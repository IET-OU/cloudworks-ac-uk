<h1>
Making Cloudworks open-source</h1>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="region1">


<p>My top priority before I go on maternity leave is to make the Cloudworks  source-code open-source and I thought it would be worth sharing the main things that in our plan for this.</p>
<p><strong>Name and branding<br /></strong></p>
<p>It is going to be confusing if the open-source version of the code is also  called Cloudworks and if new installs look identical to the Cloudworks site, so  we need to come up with a new name and branding. Names are hard because as well  as picking a good name, you need to get them trademark-checked, you don't want  to clash with anything else with the same name that might cause confusion and  you also want to be able to get a reasonably sensible domain name. We have some  ideas but suggestions are very welcome! We've already got our graphic designer  to produce a new colour scheme and site banner so we're part of the way with the branding side  of things.</p>
<p><strong>Licensing </strong></p>
<p>There are two main things to consider here. First, we have had to check with  legal at The Open University whether we can release the code as open-source and  if there are any restrictions on licences we can use, as well as check with the  funding bodies, JISC and the EU, that have funded parts of the work. We've  already done this and luckily it seems to be fairly straightforward and we can  pick pretty much any licence we would like from that perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, the code uses various other open-source code, for example the  CodeIgniter framework, JQuery, TinyMCE and Zend Lucene. These are all covered by  a variety of different licences and we need to make sure that we're not breaking  the terms of any of them when we release our code. I'm hoping that <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/">OSSWatch</a> are going to come to the  rescue here in helping me make sense of all this!</p>
<p><strong>Governance Model</strong></p>
<p>The OSSWatch website has lots of useful information about governance models.  There are some interesting decisions for us here, especially with how the  open-source work fits in with existing structures and with me going on maternity  leave in October!</p>
<p><strong>Installation and upgrade infrastructure </strong></p>
<p>We need to write and test installation instructions for the code, as  well as make sure that an 'empty' install of the code behaves reasonably  sensibly. We also need to think ahead as to how we are going to manage upgrades  and document which versions of PHP/MySQL we have tested with.</p>
<p><strong>Configurability</strong></p>
<p>We are going through the codebase trying to spot anywhere that things have  been hardcoded in which wouldn't make sense in the open-source version. One of  the main places is the support and about pages which are currently hardcoded  HTML. We also need to allow people to customise the theme and logo.</p>
<p>We have decided however on the whole to provide the code very much 'as is' in  the first instance and work on improving it later. The admin interface for example is rather primitive, but  we're working on the principle that it is better to get the code out first and  make those improvements afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Hosting, website and documentation </strong></p>
<p>We need to decide where to host the code - at the moment, it is looking like  a choice between Github and Bitbucket. We also need to put infrastructure in  place for tracking bugs (and decide whether to try and import the bugs we  currently have in our local bugtracker) as well as think about things like a developer mailing list, wiki and website as well as the type of documentation and guidance we want to have on them. We also need to decide how we manage reports of security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Get involved&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>If you're interested in being an early guinea pig for the open-source version or getting involved in development, please do contact us on cloudworks@open.ac.uk</p><p>
