                   <ul>
<li>JISC Design for Learning programme 2004-2008</li>
<li>Increasing design-led approach to learning and teaching practice</li>
<li>Over a dozen projects inc. LAMS, Moodle, ReCourse, two UK pedagogic planners</li>
<li>Some broad premises - pedagogic intention can be articulated, articulations can be usefully shared, intentions can be enacted/instatiated in real learning opportunities, might well be enabled by technical systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Lessons from Phase 1</p>
<ul>
<li>Design practice is very varied&nbsp; 'how many design approaches are there?' infinitely many, lots of cultures, personal style, have to responsive and contigent as well, very difficult to create tools to support something so diverse and emergent</li>
<li>Tools rarely as flexible or pedagogically neutral as practitioners would like</li>
<li>Design tools must enable collaborative design, contingent/responsive design and effective sharing</li>
<li>Design processes need to be well integrated with other institutional processes if to be taken seriously, won't work if have to go somewhere special to do it</li>
<li>Practitioners have two quite contradictory requirements - one is for very rich expression, but also want to be able to pick up and reuse bite-sized elements </li>
</ul>
<p>Models of learning and teaching</p>
<ul>
<li>How many approaches are there? Answer was three or three and a half! Lots of theoretical approaches lots in common - activity, constructive alignments, integration across activities </li>
<li>They differ in terms of crucial decisions that practitioners make when thinking ahead. Importance of other people - intrinsically involving learners with others or whether not. Authenticity / situatedness, how far simulates the situation in which learners will need to reproduce it, and how far for reasons of safety or cognitive development, how much scaffolding, how much flexibiligyt. Locus of control, how far teachers? how far learners? Might appear at assessment, teaching or whole design stage. Whose intention is being enacted and represented?</li>
</ul>
<p>Lessons from Phase 2</p>
<ul>
<li>Representational dilemma - pedagogic intentions need to be represented differently to/by different actors in teh learning system - educational terms vs. computational representations - Insights from audiene: This is difficult, if could articulate designs clearly in educational terms, both extremely difficult things to do</li>
<li>Modelling of educational intention remains elusive</li>
<li>Mod4L project concluded there is no obvious typology of decontextualised design or patterns, in which a finite number of educationally meaningful intentions can be described</li>
<li>It may be more productive to try modelling relationships between design elements, but...</li>
</ul>
<p>The learning teaching dilemma</p>
<ul>
<li>Good teaching (conception and enactment of a pedagogic intention) is not the same as good self-directed learning (conception and enactment of a personal learning goal)</li>
<li>If agree that different tools needed by teachers and learners, what are points of intersection between learner and teachers intentions and tools. </li>
<li>Audience comments: Underneath the tools and services issue, just talk about teaching and learning, still find that there was a dilemma. Are you thinking in terms of you are a cognitive surgeon intervening in head of the learner, or are you articulating a domain of knowledge and they need some signposts e.g. verb structure in arabic, or some joint enterprise in which learner is the expert, transform their work environment, in which case 'learner' needs to be engaged in the design process, unless clarity about different contexts. Attempt to describe limited number of approaches actually limited number of contexts? Relationship key concept, what tools might support a genuinely collaborative model, isn't also a conundrum here about thinking about transferring enquiry approaches into learning and teaching context. What tools do teachers use to conduct their own enquiries? Tools for digital scholarship should ideally be shared as much as possible. </li>
</ul>
<p>The describing/prescribing dilemma</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a tension between modelling good design practice and offering tools for educators to express their own pedagogic intentions </li>
<li>How can tools carry design messages while remaining relatively neutral an open-ended</li>
</ul>
<p>The contigency dilemma</p>
<p>The Web 2.0/'Power to the User' dilemma</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamental challenge to what we are doing in the classroom as educators, completely reconfigures the learner. Represents challenges to the idea of curriculum, learning activity design. Orchestration vs. aggregation technologies. Leave fragment of sense to future users, leaving them with the tack of making new sense in a new context. </li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<ul>
<li>Design is a contested space</li>
<li>There is a continued need for well-designed tools to support the teaching process, closely aligned with tools for learning</li>
<li>Contingency and collaboration remain key feature of the process. Must afford opportunities for both</li>
<li>Probably no one tool and tools and services can interoprate</li>
<li>Remembering that our aim as educators is to put learners progressively more in control of their own learning&nbsp;</li>
<li>New JISC publication - effective practice in a digital age, includes some elements of background of design for learning </li>
