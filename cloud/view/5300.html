                   <p>1. 35-40 minutes approx</p>
<p>2. The instruction is not difficult to follow.</p>
<p>3. Not sure about this question - this question is not clear!</p>
<p>4. Linking the reading with practice (putting knowledge into practice)</p>
<p>5. Any breach of confidentiality? This is because team work is not always widely shared before it is materialised.</p>
<p>6. Sent it</p>
<p>7. Too early to tell, did just now!</p>
<p>8. This question is not clear!</p>
<p>9. A guide is needed to use cloudworks or this training module to get effective responses.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Did not time myself, maybe an hour to read through and make some handwritten notes initially, as I couldn't access the comments because I didn't realise I had used another email address to register in Cloud last autumn!</p>
<p>When I had sorted out access today, I took about 40 minutes reading through other's comments and writing my own, and then creating my first 'Cloud'.</p>
<p>I should like to have the questions visible from here instead of having to scroll up and back all the time.</p>
<p>I have not as yet made time to check out all the links, but the info looks good and may come in useful later.</p>        </div>

                   <p>How long did you take to complete the Activity? &nbsp;this issue of time is something in my own learning and development that is currently an area on which I am focusing;&nbsp; it is my experience that I usually take about twice a long to complete tasks as my colleagues and I am in the process of examining why and so I will use this project as a way for collecting and evaluating data:&nbsp; in the first instance I spent about three hours roaming around the cloudworks environment; one hour reading/taking notes the nine pages included in the Activity 1; 15 minutes reading the comments of others; 30 minutes responding to the four questions</p>
<p>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? &nbsp;yes;&nbsp; I comment that, as has been mentioned by another respondent, I don&rsquo;t immediately see the link between the content of Activity 1 and the four questions&nbsp; If they weren't how could they be improved?</p>
<p>Was the content of the Activity informative?&nbsp; yes &nbsp;If not what would you have liked to see?</p>
<p>What did you like about the Activity? &nbsp;I was exposed to new information</p>
<p>What did you dislike about the Activity?&nbsp; I would have liked to be able get at the text contained in &nbsp;Activity 1 so that I could have a printed version as well as the onscreen version.&nbsp; I did find a way for procuring a printed version by emailing the Activity script to myself and saving it as a text file; but, within this process the formatting of the text was lost and so without some serious manual intervention this process proved to be counterproductive</p>
<p>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? &nbsp;yes&nbsp; If you did not post any comments can you say why you didn't?</p>
<p>If you did post comments to the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback? not as yet</p>
<p>How useful was the feedback? not applicable</p>
<p>Do you have any other comments you would like to make? &nbsp;yes, could you please clarify what the following acronyms stand for:&nbsp; JISC Design for learning Programme; IMS Global; RELAD</p>
<p>I found the information contained in the Activity 1 text of interest, I can appreciate how developing the ability to make the design for learning, the process in developing teaching and learning activity, more visible and explicit could impact positively on my abilities as a practitioner, the students I encounter and the wider educational community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;During the summer months I envisage pursuing some of the references include in the end-of-document reference listing and the web links included in the document.</p>        </div>

                   <p><strong>How long did you take to complete the Activity?</strong></p>
<p>I am not sure, but quite a while because while reading the activity I spent time going through Compendium, Phoebe and downloading them in my new computer.</p>
<p><strong>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? If they weren't how could they be improved?</strong></p>
<p>I found them very clear</p>
<p><strong>Was the content of the Activity informative? If not what would you have liked to see?</strong></p>
<p>I liked it and found it informative and interesting.</p>
<p><strong>What did you like about the Activity?</strong></p>
<p>It gave me the opportunity to reflect on teaching delivery methods. And as I said above, I found the links very entertaining and useful. I had come across them before, but I had not used them for a while, so this was the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What did you dislike about the Activity?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing</p>
<p><strong>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? If you did not post any comments can you say why you didn't?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I did, albeit late</p>
<p><strong>If you did post comments to the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback?</strong></p>
<p>Not yet</p>
<p><strong>How useful was the feedback?</strong></p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any other comments you would like to make?</strong></p>
<p>Not at this stage</p>        </div>

                   <p><strong>How long did you take to complete the Activity?</strong></p>
<p>Difficult to say because I didn&rsquo;t time it and I kept coming back to it on different days and having to re-read things.&nbsp; I would estimate at least an hour and a half.</p>
<p><strong>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? If they weren't how could they be improved?</strong></p>
<p>What to read and think about was clear, but I was initially confused about who the course is for, as I feel in OU modules the module team have done the designing and I&rsquo;m doing the delivering, so is this really for those who are right at the beginning of the process and not for me?&nbsp; However, there is plenty of scope for me to modify and adapt my presentation of the module so it does seem relevant to understand design, and I like innovating and trying new things.</p>
<p><strong>Was the content of the Activity informative? If not what would you have liked to see?</strong></p>
<p>I found the content very informative and stimulating.&nbsp; I would have liked clear reassurance that the course is for me.&nbsp; Also whether the focus is on blended courses or pure online courses.</p>
<p><strong>What did you like about the Activity?</strong></p>
<p>I found it really interesting, and it ties in nicely with the OU masters in online education course H800 (Technology-enhanced learning: Practices and Debates) that I am currently doing.&nbsp; I am getting to understand more about the opportunities provided by e-learning and am excited about this.</p>
<p><strong>What did you dislike about the Activity?</strong></p>
<p>Like Genie, having to fiddle around to print the material (and I realise this is not what we are &lsquo;supposed&rsquo; to do, but I wanted to annotate it by hand!).&nbsp; Having to log on to the public Cloudworks instead of having a private area.</p>
<p><strong>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? If you did not post any comments can you say why you didn't?</strong></p>
<p>I did, and I also read the comments of others.&nbsp; I would have liked to respond to some of the points, but it does not seem to invite this, as I cannot see how to make a comment on an individual message (perhaps I am missing something).&nbsp; I like discussion more than a long list of individual answers.</p>
<p><strong>If you did post comments to the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback?</strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p><strong>How useful was the feedback?</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any other comments you would like to make?</strong></p>
<p>Not at the moment!</p>

<p><strong>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? If you did not post any comments can you say why you didn't?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>If you did post comments to the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback?</strong></p>
<p>Probably too soon to tell as only just done it.</p>
<p><strong>How useful was the feedback?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any other comments you would like to make?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m late participating in this but have enjoyed reading other people&rsquo;s ideas as well as the activity information. I ddin't interact with others as late participating and time available.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How long did you take to      complete the Activity?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>About 45 minutes</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Were the instructions for      the Activity clear? If they weren't how could they be improved?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, they were clear</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Was the content of the      Activity informative? If not what would you have liked to see?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I found it very interesting and am kicking myself I did not find time to begin the process before Easter</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What did you like about the      Activity?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I liked the content &ndash; made me start to think about how we do things and how we can improve on them.</p>
<p>I also liked the way I had to log on to the cloud &ndash; I have been putting off getting involved in this for ages and so it has been good for me</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What did you dislike about      the Activity?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Downloading was a bit of a problem, but I think that is my laptop!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Did you post any comments to      the Activity Cloud? If you did not post any comments can you say why you      didn't?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes I posted &ndash; like many I find posting harder than contributing verbally.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you did post comments to      the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Posted late, so not expecting feedback</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How useful was the feedback?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>N/A</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have any other      comments you would like to make?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The other postings have been very interesting and it seems to me that most of us have a lot in common about how we operate and the kind of support we want and need</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How long did you take to complete the Activity?</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I completed in a very fragmented fashion. In any case not longer than 1 hour.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? If they weren't how could they be improved?</strong></li>
<li>Yes</li>
<li><strong>Was the content of the Activity informative? If not what would you have liked to see?</strong></li>
<li>It simply gave the terminology. I would rather answer the second question on a larger sample of activities.</li>
<li><strong>What did you like about the Activity?</strong></li>
<li>The links at the end.</li>
<li><strong>What did you dislike about the Activity?</strong></li>
<li>Found it a bit formal and forced. I did not have anything essential to contribute with my answers to the discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? If you did not post any comments can you say why you didn't?</strong></li>
<li>No, see my answer above.</li>
<li><strong>If you did post comments to the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How useful was the feedback?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do you have any other comments you would like to make?</strong></li>
<li>I felt that the reading was rather long for the content.</li>

                   <ol>
<li>How long did you take to complete the Activity?</li>
</ol>
<p>Much longer than was indicated, but I had to make notes, as I was unable to print the document out. I do find that I can take in what I read on the computer but forget it straight away! I like to highlight sections on a print off and add my own notes. In all about 3 hours along with a failed attempt to submit as even though it looked like I was signed in, it told me I wasn&rsquo;t!</p>
<ol>
<li>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? If they weren't how could they be improved?</li>
</ol>
<p>Clear and concise.</p>
<ol>
<li>Was the content of the Activity informative? If not what would you have liked to see?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes it was informative, but a little confusing with&nbsp; LD compared to ld!</p>
<ol>
<li>What did you like about the Activity?</li>
</ol>
<p>I found it interesting from a teaching point of view. Also liked the fact we had the opportunity to discuss afterwards and read others comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>What did you dislike about the Activity?</li>
</ol>
<p>I disliked not being able to print off the document to read, also not sure how to reply to others comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? Yes.</li>
<li>If you did post comments to the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback?</li>
</ol>
<p>Being moderated at the moment.</p>
