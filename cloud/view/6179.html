<p>This workshop examined the probation process for Science students and<br /> the key components by which research students can demonstrate they have<br /> achieved the probationary benchmarks for a research student. It outlined<br /> the assessment process, what the assessors are looking for and how the<br /> decision on the outcome of&nbsp; probation is reached. It offered tips and<br /> suggestions on how to prepare of each piece of assessment and looked at<br /> how the e-portfolio is used to record skills development during the<br /> course of the PhD.</p>    </div>

    
<h2 id="extra-content">Extra content</h2>
    		<div class="extra-content">

			<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">I am live blogging, excuse my typos, grammatical errors and other errors&hellip;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Welcome to the students. I am the Director of Research.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">I will be outlining the first year probation report and talking through the process and leave you with good understanding of the process.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is a formal process which was not years ago. University requires you to go through this process. I will talk through few slides and we will also do few activity exercises.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Why conduct a probation assessment?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Do not have to do a huge amount of progress, it is basically a process to identify the ability of a student, student-supervisor relationship, find the issues might face in future.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Key components of probation are to write a report about what has been done, mini viva with two faculties, oral presentation. But the form of presentation will vary across the faculty. There are the training programs, and the skill audit. Skill audit has to be ticked before probation can be passed. Supervisor will flag you through the process.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">First piece of substantial writing, you have to formulate the research questions, though the questions will evolve, but need to be well defined, the report should be 30-50 pages, no standard but details enough. Need to talk with supervisors how it should be, start writing as soon as possible, supervisor should be aware and agreed of what it is containing?  It is basically writing up a thesis but in a smaller scale.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is exercise of reflecting on what you are doing and why you are doing it?  The Distinguish between a thesis and a probation report is a probation report contains little data, sense of contribution to the research, and likely outcome.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Key part of it will allow you to form the research questions, some cases the literature review is separate from the report but they are not, they are formed together. The report has to be written in a academically correct format, cover the related area, reviewer during the mini viva will find if you have missed the area, this can take quite a bit of time to gather literature, evidence, and formulate the research questions. Start to collect references you will be using in you literature. Approach you going to use, thing about the number of approaches can be used lets say a, b or c and then compare, think about why you choosing the.  This report is a point where you might have to step back and think again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">What happen if plan &lsquo;a&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t work?  What will be the backup plan? Or change the method?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Planning varies time to time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">An example of Student with 16 steps, where she was doing well, step 15 did not work and 6 months did not work, step back and has to change or rethink.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Activity 1 (spend 10/15 min in a group)</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Thinking ahead to the first year report; what will be your research question? What will be method what sort of literature you have looked at and you have to look? </strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Any question?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Student&rsquo;s response:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">We are feeling we are not pushed enough should we be pushed?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Students should start writing as early as possible, its also students responsibility to push the process.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Can it be taking long time?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Yes it can. You should tell a story. A common mistake we often see, the report leave us with a question why you doing this? You should be clear on your report.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Too much literature review or too literature review? How many pages literature review should be?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">As a sule of thumb in a 40-50 pages report, literature review should be around 25-30 pages including introduction but it based on the project. For a particular project it can be only 10 pages or may have 40 pages because of the nature of the project. It is variable.  Previous years 1<sup>st</sup> year student&rsquo;s reports are helpful and ask for them, these will give you an indication.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Oral presentation</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Oral presentation in you department, in a research group, or you may have got a chance to give a presentation in a conference. This is a chance to do in a friendly environment for first time, can be viewed as practice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Especially this oral presentation is for getting feedback, not a means for probation pass.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Student&rsquo;s question: if I have done a presentation before do I have to again?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">A reviewer from OU or your group needs to be present. So if you have done internationally and no reviewer from OU wasn&rsquo;t present you might have to do it again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mini viva</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">A panel two of academics, but not your supervisors, familiar in your area may not be the expert, but must be able.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">About an hour, it is sometime rigorous, they ask question about the methods, why? How the technique works? Why not the other methods? It is just knowing why you doing it?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">At least you should be familiar, how and why you doing, mini viva is just to check you are in right truck.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is more of discussion then the series of &ldquo;do that&rdquo; or  &ldquo;do this&rdquo;.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Typically the questions starts like &ldquo;tell me about the aim? what is your project?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">After the viva they write a summary, how good you are and they make a recommendation, I will show you a recommendation summary in a minute.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><strong>Activity 2 </strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Think about the question that might come up in you mini viva?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Don&rsquo;t think if I write everything in the report clear enough, there would be no questions. Mini viva will ask questions about what you have written. Why have you written.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Tips:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Keep up to date with the literature.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">I would use Friday and Saturday morning, and go through the literature. If little and often then you will start building personal library.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Discuss with supervisors,  students in the group, third party monitors, PG tutors.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Always discuss and make sure your supervisors read through it. We often find supervisors claim we haven&rsquo;t seen it. Supervisor the best source of information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Once the viva and report done:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">What is the outcome? List of outcomes on the slide.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">1<sup>st</sup> one is the outcome majority of the case,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">2<sup>nd</sup> one usually rear. Usually a time table is given, for example 2 months, for remedial action, may have not meet the criteria or not the proper method, questions are loose and open.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Discuss with supervisors, if you not clear you should discuss. Unlikely you have to do the whole report again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">3<sup>rd</sup> option is even rarer. Have to be a clear reason. If it not the again ask it,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The last one it never happened in my career. There should be clear reason for it and if you are not clear ask for. You can appeal for it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">I will stress that again most of outcome belongs to option 1 or in rear cases 2.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Any qaustions? No questions have been asked.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">E portfolio</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Skill audit</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In November we had a session called skill audit, it is important.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">For a specific skill you may know your capability, but skill audit is about telling every body what you need skill development and formally reporting. University wants a skill audit and deposit in the porfolio. Showing the evidence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In the three years time of you PhD, these are the things you will be doing anyway, even we didn&rsquo;t required to record.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Then you organize it in e-portfolios. Showing the MyStaff on the screen.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">OU has the myStuff, going to be decommissioned replaced by something else.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">GoogleDocs , should be careful about accessibility, commercial records.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Question: what&rsquo;s the point of putting online, it is downloadable, accessible and producing a report.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In the first year it is not expected to create all the links, it will grow through the whole PhD process. It should not take long amount of time to create and maintain.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">To whom I share my e- portfolio?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Supervisors, Tutors.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">How the viva gets arranged?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">You supervisors, initially you should do the negotiation with the supervisors and supervisors should arrange the examiner.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">I missed the skill audit session in November? Should I do that any time?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">No you should be fine, but if you should ask for help. You should keep record and do the skill audit for your benefits.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Finishing up and thanking &hellip;.</p>
