        <p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How has the baseline reports informed your evaluation plans? </li>
<li>The baseline as the starting point &ndash; the first set of evaluation data</li>
<li>How to measure time on course creation activities?</li>
<li>Understanding what people are doing with that time?</li>
<li>How to measure the softer aspect?</li>
<li>Project as a messy, complex environment, doesn&rsquo;t occur in isolation and so how can we really attribute outcomes to this specific project</li>
<li>Can we pin down what are our core concepts, can we look at this in terms of our evaluation? </li>
<li>Time is a really interesting aspect of looking at design&hellip;. </li>
<li>Measure of time or quality of outcomes</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s all about helping teachers to improve learning and teaching</li>
<li>How do we assess quality of the designs</li>
<li>How do you assess how much L&amp;T strategy has been taken into account?</li>
<li>Quality is about meeting certain benchmark?</li>
<li>Measuring impact of intervention (on learners)</li>
<li>Evaluating design not in development</li>
<li>Strathclyde know the REAP principles work but its getting them into practice that is the tricky bit</li>
<li>Is it about measures of risk and measure of usefulness to the different stakeholders, its about measures of application</li>
<li>Effect of other variables </li>
<li>Getting principles into practice is tricky!</li>
<li>May well be conflicting different views amongst stakeholders and how do we address this?</li>
<li>How do we evaluate sharing?</li>

			<p><strong>Sharing - how do we evaluate "sharing"?<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Communities of practitioner or more?</li>
<li>Also about how educational practice unit works with across the board, the co-development is important</li>
<li>Types of stakeholders: learners, teachers, support staff, senior managers</li>
</ul>
<p>Sharing what do we mean?</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-way process where both ends are picking up and embedding with their practice, sharing as a dialogue/conversation</li>
<li>Does the sharing bring real benefit</li>
<li>Sharing of designs and the sharing in terms of dialogue</li>
<li>What assumptons do we make about what people are talking about in terms of learning and teaching and assume that will be taken into their practice, can we have a proxy, in terms of level of engagement and discussion</li>
<li>How do you describe the attributes of something on Cloudworks and why does that get them engaged</li>
<li>Can we look at the quality of designs on Cloudworks and the level of detailed discussion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attributes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attributes of communities, beginner teachers, subject communities, specialists, how cohesive the communities are,&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can we come up with levels of sharing and categorising them?</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic exchange of information</li>
<li>Using examples from their practice</li>
<li>Examples with reflection and action</li>
<li>Augmenting content/co-operation </li>
<li>Peer reflection&nbsp; </li>
<li>Feedback and suggestions</li>
<li>Contextualising in terms of theory</li>
<li>Sharing and application across different disciplines</li>
<li>Socialising/small talk</li>
</ul>
<p>Could have a profile of these for a cloudscape and see how it changes over time</p>
<p>Can we use this to evaluate other activities, not just online environments?</p>
<p>Also want to capture the follow on activities beyond the workshop, could build this into follow on evaluation data capture activities</p>
<p>Can we identify the kinds of networking tools, what works in which contexts? When should we run a workshop, use Cloudworks, use pedagogical patterns?</p>
<p>Can we identify a set of MAs across the three projects &ndash; workshops, patterns, Cloudworks etc &ndash; can we identify some measures about what to use and when and why and match those to particular stakeholders</p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop/: relevance needs to be high, potential of addressing a problem/need they have, has to be fun, size and structure are important, mix of people, facilitators</li>
<li>Design representations: From abstractions through to rich narrative case studies/pedagogical patterns, abstraction of good practice/pedagogy, ease of use, familiarity, value,&nbsp; a particular view of the design, it might provoke deeper thought, it highlights a particular aspect of a design, can you see quickly whether its worth looking at the design in more detail/see if it is useful/relevance for you, level of granualarity, context vs. abstraction, can you see it from a students&rsquo; perspective</li>
<li>Cloudworks:&nbsp; finding things of relevance to you, serendipity, finding other relevant people, find things of interest to you quickly, motivating, addictive, fun, of value/use,&nbsp; layers of participation &ndash; lurkers want different things to Cloudworks champions, timeframe to become engaged with the site</li>
<li>Informal and formal institutional mechanisms: with other colleagues, by cascading, in design teams, through institutional events &ndash; subject teams, institutional meetings</li>
<li>Professional networks &ndash; conferences, professional subject meetings, papers</li>
</ul>
<p>Also there is an issue about transferability ?</p>
<p>What criteria support sharing:</p>
<p><strong>Measures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cloudworks &ndash; number of people engaging, quant stuff, </li>
<li>If someone has logged on have they logged on within a month</li>
<li>What do people do with their sharing? </li>
<li>Being successful in emergent ways that you might not have thought of</li>

			<p><strong>Getting principles into practice</strong> (principles in this context will mean viewpoints/ theoretical models/ methodology)</p>
<p>We discussed the key principles associated with each project. This discussion will focus on how will capture impact of principles on practice</p>
<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Getting academics to 'buy-in' to principles or recognise opportunities and benefits</li>
<li>Cultural issues within institutions such as resistance to new approaches, time issues, established roles etc</li>
<li>Success will come from a shift in approach to planning, attitudes to reflective practice and also knowledge/ content</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Solutions?</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Avoid being didactic in approach to staff/ avoiding 'should' type statements</li>
<li>Train staff on volunteer only basis (can't force uptake) - champions</li>
<li>Design of tools responsive to staff need (and make this process explicit)</li>
<li>Articulate underlying principles to staff so they can make links between theories <em>that they recognise</em> and principles/ tools</li>
</ul>
<div>We have set out to evaluate positive impact on practice. Specifically:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>efficiency, flexibility and innovation (OULDI)</li>
<li>creativity and innovation (Viewpoints)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong>Evaluations method</strong></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>Informal, verbal feedback from focus groups which is used to inform design process - continuous</div>
<div>Use self-recording/ questionnaires so people can identify what changes they have experienced as a result of the intervention</div>
<div>Ask institutions if we can get feedback from people who didn't come to the workshop and interview around design practices (control groups)</div>
<div>We recognised that this discussion has opened up another huge range of issues around how we might define/ measure ie innovation.</div>

			<p><strong>Improving quality in design?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What are we approving and when?</li>
<li>How can we improve quality, peer review of designs, checklists/series of questions?</li>
<li>Pedagogy and learning isn&rsquo;t a key feature of what is presented for approval</li>
<li>Levels of acceptability/quality</li>
<li>One objective measure &ndash; number of rejections at the approval stage?</li>

<ul>
<li>Identified what we mean by principles &ndash; ulster viewpoints the theoretical models, OULDI &ndash; learning design methodology</li>
<li>What are the key issues in moving the principles into practice &ndash; getting uptake from staff, avoiding being too didactic in approach, difficulty of some of the cultural issues, resistance to new approaches, time issues and established roles. Success will come from a shift in academics approach and their attitude to critical reflection on what hey are doing and how they understand knowledge and content. Improvements in efficiency, improvement in creativity/ Short regular focus groups, self recording or questionnaires so they can identify the changes themselves, feedback from people who didn&rsquo;t attend interventions</li>
