        <p>Will live blog Morten's keynote here...</p>
<p>NKI is a non-state distance institution in Norway</p>
<p>Key focus for Morten is: How can we make online students more visible?</p>
<p><em>Background</em></p>
<ul>
<li>NKI Distance Education &ndash; one of Europe largest provides of online distance education, more than 110,000 enrolments since 1987</li>
<li>Broad range of subjects</li>
<li>About 400 courses, ca. 11,000 students in ca. 40 countries, ca. 70% women</li>
<li>Only self paced courses, start whenever they want, individual progress plans</li>
<li>Have a mixture of online and correspondence students</li>
<li>Cooperative online education allows students a lot of individual flexibility &ndash; can start and finish when they want but also access to a learning community &ndash; difficult to balance these two things &ndash; cooperative learning: learning in networks, similar to what we see in social networking</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Philosophy</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Individual freedom within a learning community in which online students serve as mutual resource without being dependent on each other.</li>
<li>Support individual freedom &ndash; can start whenever they like, they have tools to develop their individual progress plans, automatic tracking of turnaround time.</li>
<li>Also have tools to support learning communities, forum etc. Also a learning partner system so they can find a study buddy to work with and a global catalogue</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of innovations at NKI &ndash; started in 1986 &ndash; first Learning Management System through to individual learning system, continuous tracking and turnaround, learning partner system</p>
<p>Continuous turn around &ndash; average time is 2 days. Introduced in 2004, resulted in much discussion in the teachers&rsquo; online forum and a few voiced strong criticisms. But the average response rate dropped as a result of the introduction of the system. In 2008 introduced automatic e-mail reminded to tutors.</p>
<p><em>Individual planning system as voluntary option in 2004</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Makes it easier for student to reach their study goals, students can see individual progress and so can the tutors</li>
<li>In January 2009 started to email individual monthly progress reports to all students&nbsp; - contains contact information, LMS settings, progress report and planned progress. Intention is to send a personal, positive statement to every student, every month.</li>
<li>Have lists with information about next submission umber and planned submission dates make cooperation easier.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Boldic award 2006 &ndash; NKI&rsquo;s learning partner</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Innovative service for voluntary cooperation between students in a large online community.</li>
<li>Inspired by facebook, linked in etc</li>
<li>Consists of 4 steps. Make your personal presentation, decide who may access it, search for potential learning partners and invite someone to become your learning partner.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Global presentation</em></p>
<p>Their presentation has details about when they started, if they have learning partners, list of the courses they have enrolled on, etc. Encourage them to enter some more personal information about themselves, picture, interests, previous educational and work experience etc. They can choose whether or not to have a profile and the extent to which it is open or closed. 36% want a learning partner and 64% don&rsquo;t. Default is limited visibility and don&rsquo;t want a learning partner. Quite a number of the students prefer to work alone.</p>
<p>Google translation of global catalogue: http://<a href="http://www.nki.no/pp" rel="nofollow">www.nki.no/pp</a></p>
<p>Presentations show that online courses support individual needs and challenges &ndash; some key phrases from their presentations</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need flexibility to study&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of student with young children: &ldquo;When I got pregnant I found that it was easier to finish school via online courses&rdquo;</li>
<li>A range of learning challenges and illnesses: &ldquo;I have dyslexia&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits: like opportunity to share their experiences with other students, friends and family. Valuable also for the field of distance education. Distance students can tend to be quite invisible, this helps to make them more visible. Great ambassadors for NKI and information for new students, trustworthy testimonials. Presentations have resulted in more co-operations as they know each other better. Students also now know more about their students.</p>
<p><em>Transparency or privacy?<br /></em></p>
<p>What kind of information should be available? Transparency or privacy? Paulsen leans more towards transparency.</p>
<p>Risks: inappropriate content, copyright issues, criticisms from dissatisfied students, student who explore too much personal information. But on the whole have had few issues and problems. Paulsen believed transparency improves quality, error correction, preventive quality, learning quality. Also it promotes cooperation.</p>    </div>
