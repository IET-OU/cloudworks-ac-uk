        <p>The workshop "Virtual and blended design studio" at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/drs2016?src=hash" rel="nofollow">‪#<strong>drs2016</strong></a>&nbsp;asked participants to engage in a little design challenge with a remote partner. Aim was to experience the difficulties students and professionals might face when working in virtual design studios.</p>
<p>We build two teams with one remote partner and 2 local designers. The remote partner had started with a sketch addressing the task to design a fun toy for a baby (6m+). The local workshop participants had to develop the idea further in discussion with the remote partner. Then we switched remote partners. The local team presented the design to the new remote partner and received a critique of the design. After this short experiment all participants were invited to reflect on the experience.</p>
<p>The main question was: How can we best support designers in virtual design studios?</p>
<p>One immediate challenge identified was sharing and communicating sensory experiences when designing with the remote partner.</p>
<p>Verbal description of the experience of the design prototype are limiting. There is a need to facilitate developing empathy.</p>
<p>It would be desirable if both parties had a local version of the prototype. There is a need to provide the same materials for prototyping or send over files for printing.</p>
<p>The camera seemed in a wrong angle to make a true connection with local partners, (that was what the remote partner felt not the local partner)</p>
<p>The local partners felt more being in the same space with the remote partner by holding up the screen.</p>
<p>The remote partner could see more with a fish eye lenses.</p>
<p>A challenge of the workshop format was not knowing what was the goal. In 'real' design situation one would discuss more before making quick prototypes.</p>
<p>The task was not well defined, so roles of the participants could not be defined easily. This might reflect real design situations. There are also roles and hierarchies in virtual studios.</p>
<p>Framing the design problem remotely is a real challenge. Different cultures (national, discipline, company) do it differently, they might have different expectations on how well the problem is framed beforehand.</p>
<p>One has to work out spontaneously what can be done in the specific virtual setting, for example how to arrange turn taking, or how to improve the clarity of communication. When drawings are ambiguous,&nbsp;simplify them, but show the simplification process, not just the end result.</p>
<p>The remote partner found that seeing the thought process when presenting not the result improved the understanding of the idea immensely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The session was fast pace and one would have the need to go back and reflect about some decisions afterwards. A recording of the design process would be desirable. To facilitate access to reviewing the process a segmented and annotated timeline would help.&nbsp;Design critique could be held via a video blog.</p>    </div>

<p class="XHeading1"><strong>2. Conversation Description</strong></p>
<p class="XParagraph">The design studio has been the preferred environment to support creative, social and artefact-centred design education and practice (Crowther, 2013, Howarth, 2013). While corporate design studios become increasingly connected across locations, design education becomes progressively augmented with virtual learning environments (Broadfoot and Bennet, 2003, Robbie and Zeeng, 2012, Jones, 2013, Lotz et al, 2015).</p>
<p class="XParagraph">Virtual and blended studios differ from traditional physical environments in significant ways. With designers working at a distance, the people, resources, and objects of design are not physically co-located, which poses particular challenges but also offers some unique benefits. Designing at a distance leads to an increased need for communication. Managing expectations and motivations through social interactions as well as the conception, sharing and implementation of designs can be a challenge. New opportunities arise through distributed expertise and product development. New forms of user engagement and skills development may change the way designers work. This conversation is going to tackle the question: How can we best support learners in virtual design studios? Guided by examples of virtual environments and physical objects that represent aspects of design studios, participants will be engaged in artefact-centred discussions. Each catalyst will facilitate a smaller group discussion on one specific topic: industry collaboration, social interaction or assessment of learning followed by a group discussion presentation. A plenary discussion on best practice in virtual studios will bring the session to a close.</p>
<p class="XHeading1"><strong>3. Organizing research question &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="XParagraph">The main question is: How can we best support learners in virtual design studios?</p>
<p class="XParagraph">The sub-questions explored in groups are:</p>
<p class="XParagraph">How can we support social interaction in virtual design studios?</p>
<p class="XParagraph">How can we facilitate collaboration between design practitioners and learners in virtual environments?</p>
<p class="XParagraph">How can we design assessment of learning virtual design studios?</p>
<p class="XHeading1"><strong>4. Set-up of your session &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="XParagraph">After a very short pitch of each topic by the catalysts, participants will pool into three groups. Each group will have physical artefacts related to their specific topic at their disposal. The design of assessment is discussed with examples of assessment strategies, designs to be assessed, and stakeholders involved. The support of social interaction and industry collaboration is examined using examples of interactions and communications, roles and goals of stakeholders, and designs to be shared and produced.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="XParagraph">Participants have a variety of tools for thinking at their disposal. Sheets of paper and pens, Inspiration cards, Play dough and Lego pieces will help to playfully explore the sub questions. Participants are encouraged to draw or build diagrams, models or collages of processes and strategies to support above areas.</p>
<p class="XParagraph">During the conversation, examples of virtual studio environments will be accessible for the audience to experience and experiment with. Making use of virtual studios and conferencing software, two virtual catalysts will join the conversation and contribute to the group discussions. Afterwards the groups present their ideas to each other.</p>
<p class="XParagraph">In a closing plenary discussion, the catalysts note down overlapping ideas and best practice identified by the groups in &lsquo;clouds&rsquo; on the social networking site Cloudworks (http://cloudworks.ac.uk/), forming part of the dissemination strategy.</p>
<p class="XHeading1"><strong>5. Type of space and equipment required &nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Room for 30 participants,</li>
<li>3 tables fitting up to 10 chairs each</li>
<li>Fast Internet connection for remote participation,</li>
<li>2 projectors,</li>
<li>3 flip charts and markers.</li>
</ol>
<p class="XHeading1"><strong>6. Dissemination strategy &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="XParagraph">The diagrams and models together with notes from the plenary discussion on best practice will be shared with all participants on Cloudworks (http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1966) extending an already on-going conversation on best practice in design studios and design pedagogy. The DRS forum will be used to advertise the space and invite further participation from delegates who could not attend the conversation session.</p>
