                   <p><em>I think it's a good idea to introduce ourselves because we have a few guests attending this workshop.</em></p>
<p>I am Andreia Santos and I work for OLnet as a research associate. &nbsp;I have been at the OU since 2002, and have previously worked for the OpenLearn initiative for 2.5 years as a research fellow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My job as a research associate &nbsp;at OLnet involves finding out about the use and reuse of OER for both formal and informal learning. I am also very much interested in understanding how online communities on OER can be supported and fostered, with the aim to increase the sharing of content and experiences.</p>
<p>By the end of this week I expect to have had:</p>
<ul>
<li>plenty of opportunities for sharing ideas about OER in general and about the OLnet;</li>
<li>a chance to test out different technologies and formats to deliver virtual workshops;</li>
<li>the opportunity to learn more about my colleagues' research interests and views.</li>

                   <p>I am Patrick McAndrew. I have worked at The Open University for 10 years where I am Associate Director of Learning and Teaching in the Institute of Educational Technology, and also Director of OLnet.</p>
<p>I became involved in OER through working (along with Andreia) on the OU's OpenLearn initiiative that made content and an environment available for free access to learning materials.</p>
<p>I see this week as a chance to pause and look around at what other people are doing and to test out ways we can go beyond boundaries in a virtual workshop.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I am Giota (also known as Panagiota) Alevizou. I joined the Open University in July 2009 and have since been working on the Olnet project as a research associate.</p>
<p>I became involved in OERs through my research in encyclopaedias, in general and open content communities, in particular - the most popular of which is Wikipedia. I experimented with open resources and open pedagogies when teaching postgraduate courses in media and communications at the universities of Sussex and LSE.</p>
<p>Since I joined Olnet, I have been looking at a number of cases and interviewed a number of participants from the international OER community to develop&nbsp; evaluative approaches and&nbsp; a working framework on the nature of openess and collaboration in OERs, and to address the opportunities as well as challenges relating to awareness, adoption and (re)use, participatory interfaces, emerging pedagogies.</p>
<p>I too see this week as an opportunity to learn from, and through, my collegues' work and interests. I hope that this week will be the start of an dialogue on the ways in which we can research and support learning within an OER context.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I am Andy Lane and&nbsp;I have been at the Open University for&nbsp;26 years. I have&nbsp;undertaken many roles during that time but the most relevant to this week has been as Director of OpenLearn until recently. So I have to take some responsibility for what OpenLearn has turned out like although I had a large and talented team to help me!</p>
<p>Throughout my time as Director of OpenLearn I have been studying its relevance to the OU and to teaching and learning practice and I am continuing to do so as a Senior Fellow in SCORE (Support Centre for Open Resources in Education).</p>
<p>I see this week as another opportunity to test out my understandings of OER and their significance fro education in general.</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>Hi all - I'm Giselle Ferreira and I've been at the OU for 11 years, when I've done a number of things including course development and research (as a central academic), student support (as an AL in various courses) and some other bits (at the Nottingham Region and on campus). I worked with Andreia, Patrick and Andy on OpenLearn, and I'm an&nbsp; OLnet Associate currently working with Tina Wilson on a project funded by the Higher Education Academy.</p>
<p>I'm interested in all things related to OER, with a special interest in issues related to engagement with these resources. I carried out some research on this whilst working on OpenLearn, and I ended up with many questions concerning what strikes me as the blurring of boundaries between 'teacher' and 'student' and the need to re-evaluate the relationship between 'teaching' and 'learning - stuff of potentially enormous impact on education as a whole.</p>
<p>I see this week as an opportunity to 'take stock', reconnect with people I know and connect with people I'm hoping to meet!</p>        </div>
