<p class="qote" style="padding-left: 90px;"><em>asked to suggest a university mission statement, a philosophy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;professor suggested &lsquo;analysing concepts for our region&rsquo; </em></p>
<p align="right">urban myth?</p>
<p>Philosophy poses the most basic of questions - &lsquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo;, &lsquo;how do we know?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;why does it matter?&rsquo;.&nbsp; They often-enough need some kind of answer before anybody does anything about something.&nbsp; The trouble is that they rarely get quick-and-easy answers; they get what the professor calls &lsquo;concepts&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My shot at seeing how educators work on such questions is set out in an <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497" rel="nofollow">account of what educators can do</a>.&nbsp; It shows a lot going on, much of it is based on little more than opinion, and all of it is fiercely contested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Politicians also lay claim to similar what-how-why questions - they need to say what they&rsquo;re doing, how they go about it, and why it&rsquo;s a good idea. &nbsp;This blog takes a look at the opportunities they grasp, the connections they make,&nbsp;the options they find, the complexities they navigate, and the gains they make.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be a quick and easy read; nobody can deal with it in one take. &nbsp;But nobody needs to.&nbsp; So scan the pages to find what your work can act on. &nbsp;Skip what looks as though it can safely be ignored.&nbsp; Then figure what sort of political support education on your particular patch needs.&nbsp; No two are the same.</p>
<p>But mark this: one of the reason why proposals don&rsquo;t deliver is because something else needed to be done first.&nbsp; And that sometimes means recovering the at-first-ignored and making it the now-reconsidered.</p>
<p>I somehow doubt that the philosophy professor&rsquo;s suggestion galvanised those bosses into reconsidering the organisation&rsquo;s mission statement.&nbsp; But educators don&rsquo;t need a script; this is a range of starting points for thought and action. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Like earlier blogs, each step suggests action by students working with their educators, and by the stakeholder groups representing local interests in education.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on mood</strong></p>
<p class="text">Phrases like &lsquo;sea-change&rsquo;, &lsquo;its time has come&rsquo;, and &lsquo;cometh the hour&rsquo; reflect a belief in the importance of political timing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an ability to shape and catch a nation&rsquo;s mood. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s still about what, how and why to make a move - but it's also about when.</p>
<p class="text">Good timing can be no more than piggyback opportunism - today&rsquo;s headline becomes tomorrow&rsquo;s &lsquo;what teachers must do!&rsquo;. &nbsp;Politicians quickly learn not to waste a crisis. &nbsp;Managed well, good timing can transform a minority myth into a majority belief. &nbsp;This is not recommending that.</p>
<p class="text">But clever political timing sees education as a happy hunting ground for claims that politics can improve electorate's lives.&nbsp; And the claims often turn out to be ignorance of what has already been tried and discredited.&nbsp; Doesn't this mean that educators must get involved in understanding the mood they're dealing with?</p>
<p class="text">But it can't mean following any socio-political consensus. &nbsp;The search here is for durable springs for sustainable action.&nbsp; Like philosophy it's searching for underlying realities, for their reliability, and for their value.&nbsp; So how do we attract a contrary mood's&nbsp;interested attention in that? &nbsp;The way things are changing makes that an interesting question for educators and their studetns - and vital to how they learn from each other.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">local stakeholders can give voice to neglected interests because those needs are most visible in the locations where they are most experienced&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">if educators and their stakeholders find no way around neo-liberal controls then few progressive educational gains can be made&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">students working with educators need to probe their own alignments to life as consumers, as citizens and as workers</p>

<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">students working with educators can figure out what is credible political action and what is whim or popularity or partisan interest</p>
<p class="text"><a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6343931" rel="nofollow">&lsquo;...the wild west...&rsquo;</a> - directly experienced social-democrat leader argues that &lsquo;free-school&rsquo; innovation is damaging - he argues that the trend is now being shown to disappoint its former supporters - the argument is in part informed by the experience of running a strong, flexible and effective trade union</p>
<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">education stakeholders must be part of a conversation on relationships between freedom from control and progressive reform&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">education stakeholders need to face up to the complexity of overlapping claims which are sometimes irreconcilable and may be nonsensical</p>

<p class="text"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on connections</strong></p>
<p class="intro">If other peoples' timing can damage education then educators' timing can progress it.&nbsp; Timing takes hold of connections in the comings-and-goings of what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; It may link to the unfamiliar, and that may be unwanted by some.&nbsp; An exploratory brit careers-work programme was significantly entitled &lsquo;Connexions&rsquo;.&nbsp; But influential professional voices chose to canvas its imperfections. &nbsp;Might such resistance be habits-of-mind dressed up as professionalism?</p>
<p class="intro">Changed connectedness moves professionalism on, reframing conversations about what needs to be done.&nbsp; It pushes the questions beyond &lsquo;what to do?&rsquo; and &lsquo;when to do it&rsquo;.&nbsp; They are now about &lsquo;whom do we listen to?&rsquo; and &lsquo;who do we need to listen to us?&rsquo;&nbsp; These are questions of trust.</p>
<p class="intro">The slowest reader of political economy will soon come across complaints that &lsquo;nobody&rsquo;s listening!&rsquo;. &nbsp;But is it possible to listen to everybody?&nbsp; And what if the cry &lsquo;listening is what it&rsquo;s all about!&rsquo; turns out to be the right-foot left-foot politics of the hokey-cokey? &nbsp;</p>
<p class="intro">And so connectedness is complexity: customers are not always right; deals are struck both over the counter and under it; wanting is not the same as needing; claims are not invariably justified. &nbsp;All may demand a hearing. &nbsp;But not all can be heeded; or should be.</p>
<p class="intro">Shaping the connectedness of progressive education is the work of its stakeholder groups.&nbsp; Their links range from local-and-informal communities to established-and-institutionalised organisations.&nbsp; It means not just allowing things to take their course; it needs a tough-minded deliberate positioning of communities and organisations.&nbsp; It reaches outward to the experience it serves, and inward to the expertise it offers. &nbsp;At it's best it is a nicely-timed and appropriately-connected conversation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stakeholders</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="text"><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf" rel="nofollow">Learning from Experience</a> - evidence-based and illustrated account of how contacts with both informal experience and established expertise are interleaved in all learning - learners do not come to educators empty-handed - indeed, the account argues that expertise is not necessarily more authoritative than experience, each speaks of what it knows best - and experience can be a good teacher - stakeholding connects to both expertise and experience - it enables them to learn from each other, which builds a stronger base for sustainable action</p>
<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">each stakeholder group is in a unique position to work with the complementary voices of both local expertise and local experience</p>
<p class="text"><a href="http://www.management-issues.com/news/6770/strong-leadership-undermines-performance/" rel="nofollow">Strong Leadership Undermines Performance</a> - report of business-world research showing that so-called strong leadership is likely to lead to compliance, docility and quietism - a non-hierarchical organisation with an egalitarian culture is more likely to develop a stakeholder base for vigorous programme development - frequent claims that education needs strong senior management seem to be questionable &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">educators and their stakeholders may make more exciting progress by taking the &lsquo;great-man&rsquo; theory of leadership with a pinch of salt</p>
<p class="text"><a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6375261" rel="nofollow">&lsquo;Focus on the Middleman Will Really Shift Things&rsquo;</a> - education journalist&rsquo;s report of a UK programme supporting &lsquo;middle leaders&rsquo; in navigating change and developing educational responses - their &lsquo;on-the-ground&rsquo; positions are well placed to engage staff and community in mutually comprehending examination of programme-development possibilities - this relocation of stakeholding connections has proven effective enough to attract world-wide attention</p>
<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">education programme reformers need links to a role that can make&nbsp;comprehending contact&nbsp;with all levels of the people to be involved&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">few are better positioned than stakeholders to recognise educators' commitment with understanding and temperament for enabling interactive learning</p>
<p class="text"><a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6333641" rel="nofollow">&lsquo;...trade-unions for school improvement...&rsquo;</a> - education journalist&rsquo;s account of the many ways in which worker representatives are relocating the origination of useful programme ideas - it suggests a stakeholder focus moving away from centralised scripts and towards local conversations</p>
<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">stakeholder groups need to be able to voice local action struggling to deal with arbitrary control by powerful interest&nbsp;</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on complexity</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Policy should be informed by expertise.&nbsp; In education it&rsquo;s hard to avoid the claims of psychology and economics.&nbsp; But there are also the social sciences and cultural theory.&nbsp; All of this is complicated enough, but it is further complicated by doubtful claims, maneuvering&nbsp;for position and as-yet unresolved issues. &nbsp;Whatever you want to urge on politics, Google can inform a&nbsp;plausible&nbsp;but&nbsp;bogus opponent.</p>
<p class="text">The journey is as much a literary as a scientific one.&nbsp; Null hypotheses are hard to formulate; there is too much going on in learning for anybody to be able to say what is never the case.&nbsp; And, anyway, education is a search for what might be so as much as an account of what might not. &nbsp;There is no last word on education.</p>
<p class="text">For most people the need to make sense of education is urgent. &nbsp;And complexity confuses.&nbsp; This attempt to say something useful about education is not inventing complexity where there is none, it is recognising the complexity that is out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">As a species we need to make sense of things, and confusion gets in the way.&nbsp; For some it can mean caving in to what appears to be chaos.&nbsp; That surrender doesn&rsquo;t say that education can be anything we want it to be; it says that education may be nothing at all.&nbsp; Some students agree - and some of them have a point.</p>
<p class="text">But facing complexity means you're still interested, and if you&rsquo;re not confused then you&rsquo;re just not paying attention. &nbsp;Enabling people to tell the difference between which of this is plausible and which is credible is what educators do. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">And there is also this: the more anybody can take account of complexity, then the more ways that person has of figuring out what to do about it. &nbsp;It's a repertoire which can say 'if this won&rsquo;t work, what about that?'.&nbsp; Repertoires have survival value; they make complexity&nbsp;a solution,&nbsp;not a problem. &nbsp;They mean that nothing is inevitable. &nbsp;Taking some complexity on board could keep you and your work afloat. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">All of this makes complexity a starting point, not a place to jump ship.&nbsp; Actually the discomfort of saying &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know where this is going!&rsquo; energises the pursuit of meaning, and finding meaning gives purpose to action.&nbsp; But all of this comes while dealing with complexity, not while evading it.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on beliefs</strong></p>
<p class="text">Complexity and confusion are troublesome.&nbsp; Is it so hard to understand why people are more likely to spend their energy on dealing with the urgent simplicities of day-on-day survival?&nbsp; The contemplation of the complexities of long-term hope gets squeezed out. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">But education needs to be convincing about hope. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a promise, and to break it is to invite rejection.&nbsp; And that turning away can be to where people find their simplest beliefs confirmed.&nbsp; Among the simplest of beliefs are to be quick in instinct, fierce in competition, and strong in retaliation.&nbsp; They may not feel like aberrations to avoid; they&rsquo;re as likely feel like models to emulate. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s education that can feel like the aberration.</p>
<p class="text">The signs of turning away include classroom phenomena: fidgeting with devices, camouflaging comics, gazing out of windows.&nbsp; And there be media giants out there. &nbsp;Media distractions can feel more real than lessons.&nbsp; They include the adoration of the famous, which can breed dependence.&nbsp; And there is also the rage against everything else, and that can breed fear. &nbsp;The media have a strong narrative; it recounts how &lsquo;we bring you closer to what you hope for, and we defend you from what you&nbsp;hate&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">That may be the story, but there is an undeclared back-story. &nbsp;It's about people becoming believers in what politics and commerce want them to believe.&nbsp; It's the backstory which has the greater impact on their chances in life: anybody who can capture beliefs is well on the way to being in charge. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">The backstory is both complicated and inconvenient to dominant interests. &nbsp;So it gets little attention in the media. &nbsp;It can exasperate people attending to filleted versions of the news. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s not too hard to label anyone who tries to draw attention to that as the true outsiders. &nbsp;Informed educators may qualify for the label. &nbsp;Wear it with pride.</p>
<p class="text">But few educators can be surprised to find cynicism among their students.&nbsp; So, is there a way forward? &nbsp;There's no shortcut; the evidence here is that students need to be drawn into a conversation, and that it must start from what they believe. &nbsp;And that may mean working with impulse, suspicion and hate.</p>
<p class="text">So, let's ask ourselves, &lsquo;is academic learning any good at thinking about such things?' and 'do its exams measure how well people are getting on with it?&rsquo;. &nbsp; On the first, our brains discard redundant learning. &nbsp;People quickly forget what they do not get a chance to use. &nbsp;You may have noticed that. &nbsp;On the second, the disappointed are entitled to their doubts about exams.&nbsp; We have not evolved to waste energy on pointless striving. &nbsp;That too?</p>
<p class="text">All of this leaves academic educators holding an awkward student question: &lsquo;but miss, why are we doing this?&rsquo;. &nbsp;Making &lsquo;because it&rsquo;s in the exam&rsquo; the end of the matter positions educators as running the most expensive selection system ever devised.&nbsp; Worse than that, it cops out of the promise.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">The needed conversation may start cynically. &nbsp;But it's actually about finding personal fulfillment, claiming social membership, earning economic independence, and counting on planetary well-being. &nbsp;And all of that makes the interest of the &lsquo;shirkers&rsquo; and &lsquo;strivers&rsquo; as one - indivisible.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Evading the issues insulates education from all but commercial and political concerns.&nbsp; It makes learning a closed system.&nbsp; And it makes what people will wind up believing a foregone conclusion. &nbsp;Some people like that idea. &nbsp;Not progressive educators.</p>
<p class="text">Any understanding of democracy demands that everybody involved in education is clear about where it stands on working with belief. &nbsp;&lsquo;Everybody involved&rsquo; is commerce and politics, it&rsquo;s education and it&rsquo;s stakeholders, and - most of all - it's students. &nbsp;&lsquo;Being clear&rsquo; means declaring what beliefs are worth airing and whether any doubts should be suppressed.&nbsp; The more genuinely inclusive is that appeal then the stronger its narrative.&nbsp; And that narrative determines who gets into bed with whom, and who gets kicked out.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">educators' stakeholders believing in constructive programmes must deal with destructive influences</p>
<p class="text"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/27/spectrum-of-deceit-ministers-statistics" rel="nofollow">&lsquo;on the spectrum of deceit...&rsquo;</a> - a journalist explains how and why politicians abuse statistics, exaggerate claims and lie - all of this can mean ignoring informed advice on education - the account portrays politicians who are so convinced by their own beliefs that they see the end as justifying any means - and all shades of political thinking are shown to be capable of such behaviour</p>
<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">only fully and recently-informed stakeholder networks can resist the power-play of power-playing politicians</p>
<p class="text"><a href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/insight/article1277678.ece" rel="nofollow">&lsquo;Puppetmaster lobbyist&rsquo;s boast...&rsquo;</a> - fully-documented journalistic account of how unrepresentative rogue lobbyists distort the political process - they arbitrarily influence politicians whom they know can be easily won over and whose declared beliefs can readily be manipulated? - no mention of this compromising education, but can we be sure?</p>
<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">stakeholders may find that tainted-motives and the concealed defence of vested interests is as likely to be found in local as in national politics&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/18/big-ideas-bad-ideas-thinktank" rel="nofollow">&lsquo;Big ideas can be bad ideas&rsquo;</a> - professorial account of the history of the political thirst for &lsquo;big ideas&rsquo;, and how those ideas get distorted - a common reason is that, typically, they are worked up by politically-commissioned consultancies, or by think tanks seeing themselves as engaging with bold and wide-ranging ideas - the account shows how both sources too-often produce ill-conceived proposals -this can place education out-of-touch with local experience, and therefore doubted and rejected by local people</p>
<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">where politics becomes over-optimistically speculative stakeholders need to be specialists in what is actually going on&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><a href="http://www.tsrc.ac.uk/Research/QuantitativeAnalysis/WhatthepublicthinkoftheBigSociety/tabid/996/Default.aspx?dm_i=A1N,1FJ67,5JYNZ2,4UYCB,1" rel="nofollow">&lsquo;...What the public think...&rsquo;</a> - think-tank account of how the idea of &lsquo;the big society&rsquo; has been rejected - there is no widespread belief in its usefulness or its practicability - what stakeholders make of local conditions calls for helpers who can stand entirely independently of central scripting for&nbsp;purposes&nbsp;the government approves - and this independence develops a bigger and stronger idea of &lsquo;civil society&rsquo; - in education it would take account of the community&rsquo;s beliefs about what&rsquo;s going on and what needs to be done about it</p>
<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">educators are part of civil society as a form of stakeholding which brings trained expertise into conversation with local experience</p>
<p class="text"><a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/has-democracy-had-its-day/" rel="nofollow">&lsquo;Has democracy had its day?&rsquo;</a> - professorial account of how democracy itself breeds doubt and cynicism - the account shows how disappointment with politics is damaging, and how the trend has developed to the point where, for most people, the tangible benefits of democracy are far from obvious - a result is reported to be that &lsquo;middle classes&rsquo; have been able to command much of the political discourse in their interests - and their gaining of favourable positioning for education is an example of that - the argument runs that nations may be able to survive this kind of limiting of democracy - but, it argues, the increasing activity of corruption, cronyism and special interests is more dangerous - and, it asks, if that is so, what would be left of democracy for the disappointed to believe in?</p>
<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">are stakeholders at their democratic best when thinking-for-themselves as representatives or when doing-as-people-demand in plebiscite?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><a href="http://www.ephemerajournal.org/content/critiquing-corruption-turn-theory" rel="nofollow">&lsquo;Critiquing corruption...&rsquo;</a> - fully-referenced invitation to share in an enquiry into questions worth asking about corruption - it asks whether the damage done is about corrupt people with influence, or corrupt systems in place - understanding is needed of what damage is done by the politicisation of influencing educators and of designing institutions - and a question&nbsp;underlying this is&nbsp;'are the causes of damage we now face all too familiar, or are their features of the way corruption is&nbsp;now&nbsp;operating which are&nbsp;new?'</p>
<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">stakeholders, educators and students need to talk about about corruption in politics because&nbsp;doubting&nbsp;a democracy is not anti-democratic</p>
