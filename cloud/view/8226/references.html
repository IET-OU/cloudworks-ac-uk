        <p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Careers work helps people manage working-life.&nbsp; The signs in the UK are that public-sector careers work has been seriously marginalised by government policy - some would say pretty-well abandoned.&nbsp; Neither does it seem to be getting reliable support from employers.&nbsp; With a labour economy in crisis, surely a service that helps people into work should be a star turn.&nbsp; What went wrong?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more going on here than blame and complaint can help with.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m arguing that careers work needs a new start.&nbsp; I certainly don&rsquo;t see extinction as inevitable.&nbsp; But I do say that the new start needs to be distinctive.</p>
<p>Careers work has more to offer than policy, commerce and its competitors show any sign of appreciating.&nbsp; That offer can put careers workers into a new relationship with students and clients.&nbsp; And with its stakeholder and community groups.&nbsp; It also means expanding its relationship with education.&nbsp; That would be new - conventional careers work has never needed any grasp of what is entailed in setting up a progressive learning programme... until now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>what&rsquo;s the problem?</strong></p>
<p>A distinctive new start means more than re-aligning past practice for future use.&nbsp; Too much is changing, confused and disputed.&nbsp; Part of the trouble is in the way policy sees public-sector careers work.&nbsp; Some of it is in how public-sector careers work sees itself...</p>
<ul>
<li>neo-liberal policy&rsquo;s reliance on private-sector solutions has fatally damaged public-sector careers work&nbsp;</li>
<li>the fit between professional career-development expertise and day-to-day career-management experience is seriously askew</li>
</ul>
<p>These are changing political and cultural, and not just economic, realities.&nbsp; The question they pose for careers work is...</p>
<p align="center"><em>can its people re-imagine what it is to start from scratch?</em></p>
<p>Public-service careers work has competitors.&nbsp; For an entrepreneur change, confusion and dispute is a business opportunity - bad news is good news.&nbsp; The news is a multi-billion-dollar world-wide career-coaching industry.&nbsp; And, like many entrepreneurial initiatives, private-sector careers work draws on what the public-sector has already developed.&nbsp; There is more than a century of careers-work research-and-development to import - much of it still useful.</p>
<p>So the private is pre-empting the public.&nbsp; And the safest assumption for public-service careers work is that its twentieth-century status is irrecoverable.&nbsp; Actually policy support for that status was never that reliable.&nbsp; But all of that was then, my assumption for now is that a twenty-first-century recovery is within reach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I take the distinctiveness of that new-start position to be critical.&nbsp; And that means not doing again what careers work has always done, but doing what only public-service careers work can do. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s why I think there must be a new deal with communities and their educators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>what&rsquo;s the deal?</strong></p>
<p>A distinctive careers work professionalism can afford to let go of the conventional matching techniques which link personal characteristics to work-life opportunities.&nbsp; In essence this is pegs-and-holes help, and that is what most people assume careers work does. &nbsp;It&lsquo;s also a good fit with what policy and commerce seek from careers work.&nbsp; And, according to its own websites, it is what career coaching has imported.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s wholly possible that versions of its diagnostic and information processes can appear free-to-access on-line.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not much wrong with all of this.&nbsp; But it will not take people far enough into the management of today&rsquo;s working life.</p>
<p>Re-aligning careers work with that day-on-day experience needs more.&nbsp; The experience is as likely to be...</p>
<ul>
<li>concerned for my child-care as much as for their entry requirements</li>
<li>more worried about exploitation-risk than talent-matching</li>
<li>wondering how I look good for work if I've never found work</li>
<li>more attached to whose respect I must retained than to expert abstractions</li>
<li>as interested in work's impact on other lives as its rewards for my own</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s more, much more, to say about contemporary career. &nbsp;The point is that for careers work to pull back from who-we-are, and reach out to who-they-are, is to see career differently.&nbsp; And a person&rsquo;s control of that story is that person&rsquo;s command of career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it happens, recounting a story is increasingly understood as our species' default position for sorting out what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; But advance should tread carefully, narrative is also fashionable.&nbsp; And &lsquo;cool&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t so much educate as entice.&nbsp; So the deal is not to jump onto the narrative band-wagon.&nbsp; It is to draw on careers work&rsquo;s own rigorous take on narrative - both its use and its abuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is no hawking of inspirational stories.&nbsp; On the contrary, it is critical thinking.&nbsp; Any narrative, whether other peoples&rsquo; or my own, can as easily mislead as inform.&nbsp; A story needs to be interrogated to where it can become a basis for action.&nbsp; Not short-cut action, but a discovery... maybe a surprise... sometimes a turning-point.&nbsp; It is learning for action which is fulfilling, sustainable and liveable.&nbsp; And it calls for a careers work that meets people where they find things out, and takes them to where they can figure out what's worth their time and energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not learning for assessment or recruitment, it's learning for well-being.&nbsp; The questions are whether that deal can be clinched with...</p>
<p align="center"><em><br />students?<br />stakeholders?<br />partners?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>job-or-no-job careers work</strong></p>
<p>A new start means new priorities.&nbsp; This is not a defence of conventional expertise, it&rsquo;s a case for learner autonomy.&nbsp; Information, guidance and placement leads are available all over, but people need to be able usefully to learn from them for themselves.&nbsp; And that learning must reliably navigate a way through job-or-no-job change, confusion and dispute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most able and most in-touch helping agencies enable that learning - they are distinctive...</p>
<ul>
<li>seeing learning as readiness for assessment and selection</li>
<li>but distinctively as learning-for-living</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>working with individual perceptions</li>
<li>but distinctively in their social and cultural contexts</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>taking on careers work&rsquo;s expertise in economics and psychology</li>
<li>but distinctively expanding it into the disciplines of the arts, sociology and ethics</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>calling on bi-lateral partnerships</li>
<li>but distinctively forming multi-laterals across the curriculum and among community agencies</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>producing some basic how-to-do lessons</li>
<li>but distinctively integrating them into stage-by-stage learning programmes</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>working with the well connected</li>
<li>but distinctively seeking out the many not yet finding their stake in society</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are issue for the Career Development Institute (CDI).&nbsp; Its leadership has already unified a scattering of professional associations, each maintaining its own position.&nbsp; The question now is...</p>
<p align="center"><em>how does public-sector careers work move on from there?</em></p>
<p>All of this calls for a broader appreciation of psychology, a more critical examination of economics, a wider grasp of social forces, and a sharper appreciation of ethics.&nbsp; Tightly-focussed career guidance, offering immediate gains, has too little elbow for such thought.&nbsp; It never managed to shake off its reliance on auxiliary lessons clinging to the edge-of-timetable.&nbsp; A new start needs to stand back for long enough, and look deeply enough, to see things as though it had never seen them before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>living uncomfortably</strong></p>
<p>There is no significant learning to be had inside a comfort zone.&nbsp; It is a disturbing process of both holding-on and letting-go.&nbsp; This is not comforting, it is arguing - sometimes with yourself.&nbsp; But that is not being difficult, negative or disapproving.&nbsp; Though it must be creatively destructive, so that a promising future is allowed to displace a dysfunctional past.</p>
<p>Argument is good at showing why what is welcomed as fair and reasonable by some can be dismissed as dangerous and misleading by others.&nbsp; Commerce, policy and professionalism all have an interest in focusing comfortably.&nbsp; And, for careers work that focus has been more on what is up-close-and-personal, less on what is out-there-and-pervasive. &nbsp;Conventional careers work has a lot to say about what an individual can offer... might adapt for... and will fit into. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But suppose that is not all that students, partners and stakeholders need to talk about.&nbsp; What if they need acknowledgement of how things stack up differently when you look around a bit - taking account of what is going on in...</p>
<ul>
<li>the interview? - yes, but what about...</li>
<li>the learning-programme surrounding it? - yes, but what about...</li>
<li>the neighbourhood and its culture? - yes, but what about...</li>
<li>the region&rsquo;s communities and their work-life? - yes, but what about...</li>
<li>the continent positioned in a global economy?</li>
</ul>
<p>Any helping agency&rsquo;s understanding of what is going on in career depends on what its people are ready to face up to - and where they want to hide.</p>
<p class="Body1">And the future of any helping profession depends on how many uncomfortable questions it is prepared to ask.&nbsp; But, more importantly, that future depends on who it is prepared to turn to for the answers...</p>
<p class="Body1" align="center"><em>is this where you come in?</em></p>
