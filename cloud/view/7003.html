<h1 style="font-weight: normal;" dir="ltr">Marie Arndt: Blended learning support of academic writing in English for Engineering students in Oman</h1>
Tags: English. academic writing, education<br />
<h2 style="font-weight: normal;" dir="ltr">My context</h2>
<br />I am currently teaching English and Academic Skills at a government-funded Higher Education College in Sohar, Oman. The students have a first Foundation year when they study IT, Mathematics and English. After FY they study English for another two years, alongside their chosen major subject. Even though students who start at the college have studied English for 12 years at school their proficiency is generally lower than would be expected when they start college.The students often come from small villages or other small towns in Oman. They are expected to achieve as they must compete for jobs after graduation. &nbsp;<br /><br />Sohar college is the only educational institution in Oman where engineering is offered. The BA programme in Engineering is 4 years. All teaching is in English and students are expected to use English in both writing and speaking throughout the course, as well as digest subject-specific texts in English. The lecturers on the programme are mainly from other Arabic countries, India and the Philippines; some lecturers has an insufficient command of English to guide students effectively on the course. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></strong>
<h2><strong style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal;">The challenge</strong></h2>
<strong style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; font-weight: normal;"><br />My intention is to work on a project of a blended learning scenario to practice and perfect students&rsquo; English and academic skills to raise their ability to complete the project they have to complete in their final year. One major drawback is the highly unreliable internet server of the college, which means that ideally the CBL-part should be possible to work on offline. As most students have android mobile phones it would be great if the design was suitable for mlearning as well as elearning. <br /><br />

<br />
<h2 dir="ltr">How you might go about bringing that change</h2>
<br />Drawing up a support programme that students find helpful for their engineering studies. It must be simple and easy to follow, at the same time be linked to their studies. Vocabulary and comprehension of subject specific text must be blended with academic writing skills practice. The challenge is to make it interesting without being too heavy and regarded as too challenging. Liaising with future employers would also be a way to find out what employers expect of the graduates.<br />

<p>I'm interested. Can you say something more about your current practice, how you go about supporting their academic writing now and why you want to change this?</p>

                   Something like TiddlyWiki might work for the offline aspect. The OpenSim sim-on-a-stick is another possibility.        </div>

                   <p>Hi Marie,</p>
<p>I'm very interested in this project. I'm also teaching pre-engineering students, in Riyadh, and have been designing my instruction around a blended learning model for several years now. I like your idea of using reading to support writting, and a PBL focus would also be very useful for Arab students. Perhaps this could also be blended with some basic project management skills as well?</p>
<p>I've encouraged my students to join IEEE ($25 a year for students) and set up a local student chapter on campus. IEEE offers a wealth of relevant and current materials around which to organize student writing and inquiry.</p>
<p>Collaborative writing on mobile devices is challenging. If you have access to a computer lab perhaps you could schedule lab time for them to do some of this writing while doing the reading online. My students are all "bring your own device" and we do have reliable wireless on campus.</p>
<p>Let me know. I'm sure we could put together a very productive project and perhaps link some of our students up for some itnernational collaberation.</p>

                   <p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will check out TiddlyWiki and OpenSim as I'm not familiar with either. In the past I've used Edmodo.when I was teaching in an institution without an LMS. Recently I found Iversity that looked quite interesting. Both of them require online access though.</p>

                   <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>I was so excited when I read your proposal and thought it would be great if we could do something together. I hope I won't be too much of a follower, as you obviously have more experience of teaching the specific target group. I have just been asked by the Programme Director to draw up a suggested strategy to alleviate the engineering students' need to improve subject specific vocabulary and writing, especially for academic purposes. There is specific problems with their ability to complete their final-year project.&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Hi Marie,</p>
<p>This is great. Why don't you go ahead and start a Cloudscape around this and name it whatever you like - whatever you think will attract others - and we'll see if we can get a few more people interested in this.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could start with a clear needs analysis from your side and&nbsp; then go from there. What is their final year project?</p>

                   <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>Hi Mark</p>
<p>I will do my best to create a Cloudscape in the right place, Teaming up page, I assume. I haven't got their course outline at hand, but I think they have to produce an extensive report. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking to colleagues in the engineering dept today they complain that the students can't explain processes&nbsp;and that they can't write, esp. academic writing, also need to extend specialist vocabulary.</p>
<p>BTW, please link up with me on Google+</p>

                   <p>Hi Marie,</p>
<p>I found your Cloudscape. I think the Teaming up page is where it goes but don't see more than a dozen others there. I'll add you to Google+ though I haven't figured out what that's for or what it does. I looked at Google Groups as an open email venue. For a collaborative space GDocs are fine with me - maybe that linkis into Google+ ?</p>
<p>Do you know the CEFR? This week I've been reading an article about its use in IEPs by someone working in Oman. I can send you a copy if you like. Perhaps the CEFR could provide a framework for a needs analysis of first year engineering students in the Gulf region. Performances described there could be then be repackaged as a survey for instructors and / or a self-assessment instrument for students. That, and perhaps a few interviews, could provide data necessary to support curriculum design decisions.</p>
<p>We have the same problem where I work. University lecturers complain that students can't do this or that, but they are not very good at articulating deficiencies and what we get is very anecdotal.</p>

                   <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>I don't know CEFR. I would love to have a copy of the article with ref. to Oman. &nbsp;Let me read it&nbsp;and think about it, but your idea of a survey sounds good. The only problem is that we have no teaching until 16 Feb. I can probably find some staff, but the students won't be there. &nbsp;&nbsp;We could be on to something very good here, so I think we should keep going.&nbsp;In&nbsp;10 days' time I'm going to Indias for 10 days so I won't have much time then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it would be great if we could pin down more exactly&nbsp;what staff and students find wanting, and see how they match. After that we could work on a learning design. While this is missing, we could start by thinking about an outline that we can build on as we develop our design. Brainstorming.</p>

                   <p>Hi Marie, Mark,</p>
<p>Have you formed a project group and cna I join please :-) Not wuite sure what the best way to brign the group is together. Perhaps coalescing around the cloudscape Marie created or maybe you have thought of another way to do this? Forming a Google+ group? Creating a shared calendar to co-ordinate activity?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course you can join Mark and me if you are interested in what has been posted. We can form a space in Google+ and GoogleDocs if that is suitable to all. Denise (surname escapes me) is based in Abu Dhabi and may want to join us. I will be back online later today (GMT+4) as I am preparing to go to work now.</p>
