			<p>These were both created as tables, so see them as the orginal Goolge Doc. I then did a cut and paste into Cloudworks.</p>
<p>The first set of Personas does a number of things:</p>
<p>It brings fictional participants to life. I've attempted to come up with six folk who might be interested into a DIY Multimedia module from a University. I delved around in the job descriptions for vacancies at Lincoln University to get some feel for real people who do real things. I then offered some ages. Gender and background comes from their name and photo - perhaps. It doesn't take too much to imagine these people at home, or at the desk at work, or on an iPad over lunch having a go at your learning. You can start to imagine what might trip them up or that might work well. Once you are 'wearing their shoes' or 'wearing their hat' then you can start to relate to your design - typically you think 'am I over doing it?' 'Is this straight forward?' 'Is it boring?' 'Does he or she get it?' And so on.</p>
<p>The next chart is supposed to be a XY chart with responses from this group to e-learning - so a Flexible to Fixed Academic aim to the X axis and a Relaxed or Intense attitude to the module along the Y axis. Again, this just makes you realise how hard it is to accommodate everyone where the 'cohort' can be so mixed in skills, expectations, commitment, time pressures and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again, you come down on the side of excellent planning, simplicity in all things too. This isn't the place to spring them with something that has never been done before. So go with stuff that is known to work.</p>
<p>A third development would be to learn that one of them is dyselxic, another is only working part time as they are looking after sick partner ... and so on. Perhaps this makes you think of building in some flexibility to the thing.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>I use a Creative Brief at the start of any project to help me get my head around what is required. This may serve a purpose earlier on in the specification process but I put it here as I used it simply to start me off before thinking about who these personas might be.</p>
<p><strong>Personas for a DIY Mutlimedia e&ndash;learning design in Tertiary Education</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the problem?</strong><br /><br />Educators in Tertiary Education can struggle to design e&ndash;learning due to &nbsp; &nbsp;various instutional and personal factors: budget, technical and other support, cost, choice or lack of choice over tools, time pressures ...<br /><br /><strong>What is the opportunity</strong><br /><br />Like the consumer guide 'Which?' offer a clear and objective overview of what works, what it costs and where the problems lie.<br /><br /><strong>Who are we talking to ?</strong><br /><br />Educators in Higher Education : &nbsp;tutors, moderators and lecturers who work direclty with students who may be expected to design and create e&ndash;learning of some kind or another, as support for a module, to complement &nbsp;the course ... or an e&ndash;learning module in its own right. (See Personas)<br /><br /><strong>What do we want to say?</strong><br /><br />Thousands are on the same path &ndash; some are there are can advise you, some are finding their way and can offer support and advice, while yet more are starting out on this journey. Everyone starts with a different set of experiences and skills, so establish where you stand, set some goals and get stuck in. Here are, step by step, the sequences that are reqired &nbsp;in order to deliver learning that works.<br /><br /><strong>How do we want them to respond to this message?</strong><br /><br />I wouldn't have missed that for anything!<br />Like all things, it is a learning journey &ndash; I'm in good company and can see that if I hang into the end I'll have a far better idea of what is required, could design my own e&ndash;learning, commission others or play a valuable role in a learning design team.<br /><br /><strong>What else do we need to know?</strong><br />The learning journey is taking place inside a MOOC.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
