        <p>Prof. Frank Rennie talked about sideCAP, an EU funded project aiming to improve the quality and flexibility of distance eudcation provision on a sustainable basis. The project's main focus is on Open Educational Resources and the delivery of teacher training in new technologies for developing OER in their course designs.</p>    </div>

			<p>Interesting presentation capturing the essence of OER within the cotext of course design.</p>
<p>Prof. Rennie touched upon many aspects of the discussion on supporting teachers finding, using and repurposing OER materials that took place on Eluminate prior to his presentation. These involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing mindsets of teachers and institutions in sharing materials openly</li>
<li>Addressing the issue of quality</li>
<li>Improve awareness and findability, while tackling issues of confidence and adaptability </li>
<li>Learn to develop materials and teach in an open fashion</li>
<li>Foster instituional support for the development of skills and technical capabilities to customise what's available.</li>
<li>write 'wrap-around' pedagogical materials that contextualise and support the learning resources</li>

                   <p><strong>Notes from the discussion on Eluminate, during Fred's presentation</strong></p>
<p>Fred garnett: @Frank Liked the opening Pedagogy slide! The LGC group developed the Open Context Model of Learning to provide a framework for multi-context learning; REad early version here; <a href="http://learnergeneratedcontexts.pbworks.com/JIME+paper" rel="nofollow">http://learnergeneratedcontexts.pbworks.com/JIME+paper</a><br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: It's OER sequences for course then?<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: Brilliant process, Frank. Do users test this or source other materials?<br />---------------------<br />IsaacParlay: Search seems to be a key issue here - finding the *right* OERs to deploy in courses. BECTA looked at this with their 'DLR Ecosystem' but I guess that's now fallen by the wayside....? Any other DLR Repositories that people find useful in this respect?<br />---------------------<br />ian wright: we enthusiastically advocate re-use, and chastise our students for plagiarism...<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (martin w): @ian - don't get me started on that one!<br />---------------------<br />Andy Lane: But in both cases people should acknowledge their sources<br />---------------------<br />ian wright: would like to pursue<br />---------------------<br />Tim Hunt: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/jun/19/cambridge-university-don-plagiarism-row" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/jun/19/cambridge-university-don-plagiarism-row</a><br />---------------------<br />Arien: mm, interesting point<br />---------------------<br />Michelle "Eingang" Hoyle: Back to peek in on Frank Rennie's talk.<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (martin w): @Andy - that's right, acknowledgement is key<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (martin w): hi michelle<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Isaac, not a repository but Web Questa are structured discovery learning<br />---------------------<br />Andy Lane: The CC licence requires you to caknowledge wheere you use other people OER<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: WebQuests at <a href="http://webquest.org/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://webquest.org/index.php</a><br />---------------------<br />Arien: have written a post bemoaning how complex that (referencing properly) has become though!<br />---------------------<br />Will Stewart: The model requires lecturers to evolve from content deliverers to activity designers<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (Simon Buckingham Shum): In my kids' primary school last week: Teacher: "We learn by copying don't we everyone? Copying is good!" Kids: "YES!"<br />---------------------<br />Will Stewart: ...or from lecturers to teachers!<br />---------------------<br />Andy Lane: @Arien I agree that how we acknowledge and reference is not always clear to all<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: Diane Brewster just finished a Ph.D o Plagiarism. The answers arent what you read in the papers...<br />---------------------<br />Chahira: @Simon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but Kids get bored when they copy all the time, they are much more keen in CREATING new stuff&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />---------------------<br />Moderator (martin w): Simon, do they have a song 'we think copying is good, we think copying is fine'<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (Simon Buckingham Shum): I'm writing the rap...<br />---------------------<br />IsaacParlay: Thanks @ FredGarnett - I have found all other Repositories I've played with so far woefully lacking in both depth and breadth of content, as well as in terms of general architecture - will look at WebQuests<br />---------------------<br />m_hopwood: Hahaha<br />---------------------<br />m_hopwood: I think we do learn by copying but we need to move beyond it.<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Will, activity designers yay!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />---------------------<br />m_hopwood: "imitating" is a better word.<br />---------------------<br />Non: This was kinda what I was trying to get at with my question to Patrick earlier. Finding these materials in ways which match your needs or expectations is still quite challenging for learners and teachers. We need to improve the ways we manage these objects and materials so much good stuff is still not easily discoverable (thinking here expensive mass digitsation projects done at collection/instituitional level). We need to get working with the semantic web community to make this stuff more easily discovered and connect them up rather then lots of human effort directed simply at finding things.<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (Simon Buckingham Shum): "Copying" in the school is code for a set of skills they're developing, which includes mentoring through modelling. And yes, autonomy and creativity are other core focii<br />---------------------<br />Juliette: when I was teaching 5 years ago, fairly mainstream stuff, I also found the lack of appropriate content out there was the main issue, but may have changed since<br />---------------------<br />m_hopwood: Dangnabbit, I have to go to the bank&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />---------------------<br />Tim Hunt: The job of an academic is to stand on the shoulders of giants.<br />---------------------<br />m_hopwood: Hope to catch up soon.<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Isaac, yep repositories designed on an information retrieval model. We hve to get librarians out digital learning<br />---------------------<br />m_hopwood: Ciao everyone,<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (martin w): bye<br />---------------------<br />Arien: ciao!<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (JohnPettit): bye<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (Iris): Bye<br />---------------------<br />m_hopwood: ...and just when the discussion turns to librarians' role&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />---------------------<br />Michelle "Eingang" Hoyle: Juliette: I suspect it's not lack of appropriate content, but the difficulty in locating appropriate content.&nbsp; Little OER can be very creative but can be very difficult to locate.&nbsp; Big OER is easy to find, but not always appropriate or easily modified.<br />---------------------<br />Juliette: there was interesting article about learning and copying in new scientist a few weeks back too, but can't find it quickly<br />---------------------<br />IsaacParlay: @Tim Hunt - in which respect?<br />---------------------<br />m_hopwood: I will be available for librarian chat later&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />---------------------<br />Arien: too mnay different places to put it<br />---------------------<br />Juliette: Michelle: Yes, hard to tell if it doesn't exist or if you just can't find it!<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: But teachers now need to learn how to create OER designed for multi-context learning processes<br />---------------------<br />Tim Hunt: @Isaac that was in response the the comment that academics don't like to build on others' work.<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (Simon Buckingham Shum): Part of stepping out of the shadow of the printing press is to shrug off the myth of the authoritative teacher whose expertise is so opaque and hard to probe... just like a book.<br />---------------------<br />adkiyan: This is a very useful talk. dichotomies between copying and clever use of OER&nbsp;&nbsp; deserves a particular session<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (JohnPettit): Juliette: when I was teaching 5 years ago, fairly mainstream stuff, I also found the lack of appropriate content out there was the main issue, but may have changed since<br />---------------------<br />Michelle "Eingang" Hoyle: Juliette: I guess that goes back to Non saying that content creators need to tie into semantic web ideas.&nbsp; Unfortunately a lot of Little OER people are doing these projects on little resources and self-learned skills, so they don't have the expertise or even know that semantic web would be useful or how to go about it.<br />---------------------<br />Will Stewart: Yes, I agree. Using technology to maintian<br />---------------------<br />Andy Lane: Exact URL for SideCAP course on OpenLearn is <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=4449" rel="nofollow">http://labspace.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=4449</a><br />---------------------<br />Will Stewart: ..maintain status quo<br />---------------------<br />IsaacParlay: @Tim Hunt - got it. And agreed. A key issue I am driving at here is being able to locate the relevant / most appropriate work to build upon which seems to be a bit of an obstacle obstacle at the moment<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: Isnt quality a euphemism for professionalism? We are in a time of changing professional roles and the nature of quality assurance will change. Is it the product or the process?<br />---------------------<br />FranciscoAlvarez: researchers usually are not very found to openness? Perhaps linking opening<br />---------------------<br />vjkh: new scientist article is at <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627581.700-to-be-the-best-learn-from-the-rest.html?full=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627581.700-to-be-the-best-learn-from-the-rest.html?full=true</a><br />---------------------<br />Arien: interesting that tweets coming from plagarism conf right now about a plagarism tarrif<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (martin w): that phrase i pinched from Michelle!<br />---------------------<br />Walter Patterson: At the moment we have a big barrier to sharing resources in Scotland as Local Authorities want to retain IPR on the work of their teachers<br />---------------------<br />Michelle "Eingang" Hoyle: Martin: (-: (-: (-:<br />---------------------<br />Arien: sorry, *penalty tariff<br />---------------------<br />Non: Boulder colorado have done some really cool stuff in terms of connecting resources with curriculum <a href="http://www.teachingboxes.org/aboutTB.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.teachingboxes.org/aboutTB.jsp</a><br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: Agree with Frank on Etiquette, the learning game is changing so we need new rules, roles and regulations (and not DRM)<br />---------------------<br />Will Stewart: @Its both Fred. Product is the design. Process is the application of that design<br />---------------------<br />markuos: Open standards then<br />---------------------<br />markuos: via IMS<br />---------------------<br />Non: sorry got to go to a meeting- hope to catch up with you all again later!<br />---------------------<br />Juliette: thanks vjkh - that's the one I was thinking of I think<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Simon, agree but books are easy to read, they are OER too<br />---------------------<br />FranciscoAlvarez: Don&acute;t wait to semantic web and so, so&nbsp;&nbsp; We need go ahead in any case. Obviously could be better, but optimizing itsn&acute;the clever option. Smarter is obtaining possible<br />---------------------<br />juliecarle: How can we be assured the resources we post to OER sites will remain available. eg I shared a podcast on SwitchPod and now the service is no longer available. Who is responsible for backing up. Is there unlimited storgae?<br />---------------------<br />FranciscoAlvarez: Conservation of digital resources is a main and challenging topic<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Will, so product and process require a range of QA. And is it on the educational institution or on the resources or on the "learning"?<br />---------------------<br />Will Stewart: @Fred I think it's on the quality of the teaching<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @juliecarle - isnt the British Library now archiving all digital resources? Maybe we need to work with them too?<br />---------------------<br />LynnHunt: Do we want less used specialist material to 'fall off the bench'?<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (Simon Buckingham Shum): JISC reoprt on practice and potential of semantic technologies in learning and teaching: <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/projects/semantictechnologies.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/projects/semantictechnologies.aspx</a><br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Will OFSTED?<br />---------------------<br />mhawksey JISC RSC ScotN&amp;E: <a href="http://www.rsc-ne-scotland.org.uk/mashe/2008/07/searchable-opencourseware-ocw-and-open-educational-resources-oer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rsc-ne-scotland.org.uk/mashe/2008/07/searchable-opencourseware-ocw-and-open-educational-resources-oer/</a><br />---------------------<br />Michelle "Eingang" Hoyle: @Juliecarle: Even with paid or institutional services, you don't have a guarantee they're going to be around or open forever.&nbsp; However, you can publish in many places from your source material.<br />---------------------<br />IsaacParlay: @Frank - completely agree!<br />---------------------<br />Will Stewart: No - just passion<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Simon. Semantic Web, like AI, is a metaphor that lets us work on interesting ideas not a solution<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Will How do you QA a passion?<br />---------------------<br />Will Stewart: @Fred - ask the learners!<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (Simon Buckingham Shum): @Fred semantic web (or less pretentiously, open linked data) is both a metaphor and an emerging layer over the web<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Will or Escher!<br />---------------------<br />Will Stewart: @Fred - ok you're loosing me now&nbsp; <br />---------------------<br />Wendy Maples: Yes<br />---------------------<br />Michelle "Eingang" Hoyle: Small institutions might be a lot more agile, in fact, than bigger ones.<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Will glad you've loosened up! MC Escher's circular drawings<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Simon, so semantic web lets us do intersting thing, not necessarily deliver a singular solution?<br />---------------------<br />Wendy Maples: Yes<br />---------------------<br />ian wright: music to my ears<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Michelle, smaller is agile but big is where the money is<br />---------------------<br />Wendy Maples: Yes, but depends on context?<br />---------------------<br />Michelle "Eingang" Hoyle: So the OER movement should adopt Nike's motto and "Just do it!"<br />---------------------<br />Chahira: @Michelle I think it helps!<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (Simon Buckingham Shum): likely to be many semantic webs for different communities who subscribe to the world view embodied in the ontologies they use, not a single Semantic Web except for very basic, uncontroversial metadata<br />---------------------<br />markuos: Individuals and amateurization and quickly produce usable content<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (Patrick McAndrew): Specialist subjects and individual aproaches can make key contribution. No need to build systems or negogiate partnerships.<br />---------------------<br />Will Stewart: Totally agree, Frank.<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Frank great points thanks<br />---------------------<br />Michelle "Eingang" Hoyle: @FredG: I think Frank is suggesting that little institutions or individuals often block themselves from contributing because they feel it won't match the quality of Big OER, but you can actually produce quite a bit with very little money or tech.<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Michelle, agree, but the money also distorts<br />---------------------<br />Wendy Maples: Yes -- and wasn't that great<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Simon, thanks. What about the role of th British Library as a digital archie. Can we make it an open archive?<br />---------------------<br />ian wright: like going to the library in ye aulde days<br />---------------------<br />Michelle "Eingang" Hoyle: Just because it's from MIT or Stanford doesn't mean it's "good".<br />---------------------<br />Michelle "Eingang" Hoyle: Exactly.<br />---------------------<br />Michelle "Eingang" Hoyle: But&hellip; if it's from MIT or Stanford, it can easily be found.&nbsp; Big OER advantage.<br />---------------------<br />markuos: But if it works for you as the learner - it's good<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @michelle.

Whereas that might come from a good professional educator, that doesn't scale to meet the need. Social media opens up new dimensions to mentoring.<br />---------------------<br />markuos: content in multiple designs<br />---------------------<br />Bieke Schreurs OUNL: a question for the chat: anybody know about a phd on OER/Open courses?<br />---------------------<br />johnkuti: will folksonomy sort out the quality?<br />---------------------<br />Michelle "Eingang" Hoyle: @DougC: I'm being somewhat facetious, obviously.&nbsp; I make hefty use of online digital library resources at two universities, but seldom actually visit the physical building.<br />---------------------<br />markuos: Thanks Frank<br />---------------------<br />IsaacParlay: Thanks Frank - great presentation<br />---------------------<br />Richenda Power: Thanks Frank, you made me want to learn and participte more<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (JohnPettit): bye Frank<br />---------------------<br />Wendy Maples: Excellent<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (Frank Rennie): bye everyone<br />---------------------<br />Doug Clow: Notes from Frank's session here <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2975" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2975</a></p>        </div>
