        <p>21/12/12/&nbsp;<br />I have been exploring this set-up for about an hour - preparing for the main event.<br />My aim is to participate in this course for professional development. &nbsp; Using technology for learning and teaching&nbsp;is an area in which I am keenly interested. I was excited to find this course, as the offerings made available through my institution are limited.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>13/1/13<br />I have been dipping in and out of the OldsMooc - not necessarily by plan, more by 'accident'. Although I am enjoying looking at the numerous sites that my side trips are opening up to me, I must admit to getting a little dizzy trying to manoeuvre my way around the clouds, email updates, prezis and so on. I have just read a couple of other entries saying &nbsp;confusion is abounding, but I am determined to get to a light at the end of a tunnel - somewhere - &nbsp;and absorb as much as I can on the journey.</p>
<p>I came across this interesting <a title="The future of MOOCs" href="http://ryan2point0.wordpress.com/2012/11/26/the-future-of-moocs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">article</a>&nbsp;by the e-learning provocateur today. Some of the points were eye-opening to me as I have not had any previous experience with MOOCS.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>14/1/13<br />Round and round - where do I start?&nbsp;<br />Ok, so I had a look at some of the other 'moocsters' clouds, dreams, blogs.The long day's journey into night started there, but several hours later - here's the list of all the '<a title="my web searches" href="https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/?ui=2&ik=281dbd88ac&view=att&th=13c391227743f8bc&attid=0.1&disp=inline&safe=1&zw&saduie=AG9B_P-DiTGOFT2W6LvT_lpQz9Mv&sadet=1358167698230&sads=cnG95ZyYWKSMJB9s7HjksXK3_zI" rel="nofollow">side-trips</a>'<br />So in the end, I have completed my dream bazaar template and uploaded into my cloudworks cloud.</p>

			<p>15/1/13<br />Had a look at the mindmap relating to Learning Design. Not as easy to edit this on-line one as some of the others freebies that I have used.<br />Eventually added a comment in response to the edit made by Darren Gash:&nbsp;<em style="line-height: 1.5em;">Interdisciplinarity. Where does such a broad concept fit into design for learning?<br /></em>This made me think of the graduate capabilities we have been concentrrating on while developing our program, so my response was:&nbsp;<em style="line-height: 1.5em;">Learning design may become interdisciplinary when it helps learners to develop attributes that can be used across the board: critical thinking, problem solving, collaborative team working, reflective thinking, creative thinking.&nbsp;<br /></em>This is something that I console myself with when I think of the number of student we have completing the program compared to the number of job opportunities in their chosen industry:(</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>16/1/13<br />Spent time today following the 'converge' video and looking at proposals. I would like to try and keep to the guidelines set out, but it has been difficult to ascertain which proposals are closely aligned to my personal interests. I returned to the 'initiate site again and again. So, no more prevaricating. I feel as if I am wasting/losing time.&nbsp;<br />I have decided that I have to be more disciplined in this quest - I have 'applied' to collaborate with another 'dreambazaar team' and indicated interest in joining a study group.<br />I am hopeful that next week will be easier as far as navigation etc., but not sure that it will be any less demanding on time. That's why I need to start being more disciplined - return to work looms on the horizon and there will be much less time available to spend here.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Week 2: 24/1/13<br />I have been doing lots of reading this week and trying to connect with a team. There are many people interested in developing support for staff to engage in professional development around on-line learning. I have connected with the team working on&nbsp;<a title="Project team members + Study circle" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7575" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"Learning Design for Learning Design"</a>. They have written scenarios and have set up a Google+ Hangout space. Unfortunately time differences meant I was unable to attend, but Clare has very graciously written up what happened. There is also a plan of action organised "we thought it might be best to for us to try to work on the project activities (specifically short route activies 2 &amp; 4) asynchronously for the remainder of this week anyway". I will try and write up my contribution and add to the cloud before the weekend.</p>
<p>I have made a comment&nbsp;<a title="Cathy Chen - study group comment" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7267" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;about how I have organised my work this week. Essentially, to avoid being distracted and going off into the wild blue yonder too many times, I have decided to print of some of the material and concentrate on what I feel is the crucial work to be completed - Persona &amp; Scenario. I would like to try creating a force map too as I think it could be a useful exercise.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
