        <p>Getting off the computer and into an activity, ideally a collaborative one, is always productive.</p>
<p>A carefully moderated workshop can reveal the unexpected, more importantly it is an informed way to prioritise issues and to use a the combined expertise of a variety of people. From the OU Course B822 Creative Innovation and Change I learnt the value of constructing a team of people to address a problem - from different backgrounds, with different responsibilities and outlooks, even someone to rock the boat. No one person&rsquo;s voice is allowed to override the views of others. Such a group would achieve a lot with this OULDI pack. Though game-like it is a valid and valuable tool.<br /><br /><strong>Working alone there were a number of hurdles to overcome:</strong><br /><br />A black and white printer.<br />The sheets were printed off then painted. Not liking the look of the purple these cards all become yellow.<br />Ideally they would all be spray-glued to backing card to make them more robust - at least so that they don&rsquo;t curl up at the edges.<br />On the first sweep I got the 38 number of cards down to 26. This was gradually reduced in 2s and 3s until there were the requisite 16.</p>
<p><strong>The 16x16 spreadsheet is a Google Doc that I can share. This is the outcome:</strong></p>
<p><em>(I took the orange to be red, and didn't like the purple I mixed with the box of old watercolour paints I dug out to make my set of cards).</em></p>

Used a pairs table the 16 cards were ranked</strong></em><br /><br />Using a paired-sets in a table I was able to rank these 16 - clearly the exercise of discussing these with colleagues would have been extremely useful and the process of deliberation brought up issues of budget, resources and time-scale, and even refined the project as it is conceived and visualised as a certain number of activities.</p>

<p>In terms of the module DIY Mutlimedia I become very aware of the value of learning alongside an expert, of being with skilled practioners even - and very much the need to have a project brief to work to. So very much a hands on learning experience with authentic tools to create a real object or digital asset, or activity. This would also take the learners away from the computer screen, even out of the classroom into a design studio or agency. In fact the 'Online' card didn't make it into the 16. Even though this is to develop skills in use of digital multimedia tools I felt I was organising a workshop for potters, painters and tapestry weavers i.e. there is a highly practical element to it and there's nothing better than having a live guide at your shoulder ... and if there has to be a compromise then it would be live or 'as live' instruction over the Internet.</p>

                   <p>My first career was in television - I got out of a graduate position in an advertising agency and became the 'runner' and 'produciton assistant' in a micro-production company. We were six and were down to three for most of the time. I learnt by latching onto an experience BBC Producer - so directing, producing and writing. Then on the job. In time I supplemented this with trade association workshops and some formal day or afternoon workshops. After four years I took a fulltime course. This exercise has made me see how much multi-media production is a craft skill - we may use keyboard and computer screens, but so do TV editors these days too. I've even used a broadcast video camera with iPad touchscreen like controls on the viewing monitor (nightmare!) ... for someone used to buttons and knobs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been hugely encouraged to get away from screens and be with people face to face despite believing in all things e-learning. Even major practioners will talk about activities away from the screen, or phoning a friend or colleague ... even expecting a phone call or a debriefing workshop. This is because those commissioning learning want results and will break away from the shoehorn of e-learning to do so ... great for scale, great for compliance, but hardly 'human'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the 'e-' is coming detached from 'learning'.</p>
<p>Learning is the thing, whether it is online, face to face, mobile or augmented. The 'e' has to stand for 'effective' - did it work! And student analytics and feedback will quickly tell you if you are getting it right or wrong.</p>        </div>
