<p><strong>&nbsp;<strong>UK HE</strong></strong></p>
<p><em>[Avril Jamieson; Louise McCourt; BBC; Martin Weller; Wonkhe; University World News; TES; The PIE]</em></p>
<p>Cranfield has been selected as the lead provider in <a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/press/news-2018/cranfield-appointed-lead-for-new-university-in-milton-keynes" rel="nofollow">a new HEI for Milton Keynes, currently named MK:U</a>, which aims to open in 2023 with an initial cohort of 5,000 students. &nbsp;MK:U&rsquo;s offering will include accelerated 2 year degrees, intensive 3 year degrees with project placements, PT, short and CPD courses &ndash; but with a focus on STEM, digital and related subjects together with close links with employers (Grant Thornton, Microsoft and Tech Mahindra are already on board).</p>
<p>Non-continuation data (i.e. <a href="https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/08-03-2018/non-continuation-tables" rel="nofollow">drop-outs</a>) from HESA show that, for UK domiciled first-degree students,&nbsp;6.4% of &lsquo;young&rsquo; full time entrants did not continue after their 1<sup>st</sup> year, rising to 11.6% for mature (Table T3).&nbsp; The figures for young <em>part-time</em> students were higher, at 34.2% overall (mature: 32.7%) and rising to 43.0% (40.2%) for the OU specifically (Table T3e).&nbsp; However, these figures mask large differences in demographics, study patterns, etc, by institution. &nbsp;HESA also reports more than <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/27343342-22be-11e8-8138-569c3d7ab0a7" rel="nofollow">50,000 students aged 50+ at UK campus-based universities</a>, including Birkbeck where they account for 11% of its full-time student population.</p>
<p>Last year the charity Teach First found <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43643939" rel="nofollow">young people in some of the wealthiest areas of England were 18 times more likely to go to university than those in the poorest</a>, and that four fifths of students accepted at Oxbridge between 2010 and 2015 had parents in top professional and managerial jobs.&nbsp; Now POLAR data from HEPI supports this, with Cambridge, St Andrews, Bristol and Oxford scoring lowest for class equality whilst Hull, Derby, Edge Hill and Chester top the rankings.&nbsp; A Cambridge spokesman said that last year saw its highest level of state school applicants (63%) for 35 years although, curiously, he did not cite their success rates.&nbsp; Analysis from WonkHE also suggests that <a href="https://wonkhe.com/blogs/comparing-widening-participation-at-public-and-alternative-he-providers/" rel="nofollow">the WP performance of alternative providers</a> &ndash; held up by the Government as a potential driver of social mobility and inclusion in HE &ndash; is not only low but declining year-on-year.</p>
<p><a href="https://wonkhe.com/blogs/when-is-widening-participation-not-widening-participation/" rel="nofollow">Martin Weller</a> has also been looking at the WP data (its release obviously didn&rsquo;t clash with any Cardiff Devils matches) and believes the methodology is flawed because it is based on those who enter HE aged 18-19 and so disadvantages providers such as the OU and Birkbeck.&nbsp; He believes tacit support for his argument can be seen in this year&rsquo;s TEF which also included the Indices of Multiple Deprivation as a measure of WP to also take into account factors such as employment, income and health. &nbsp;Separately, a blog post by <a href="https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/blog-entry/broadening-scope-outreach-include-adult-learners-well-18-year-olds" rel="nofollow">John Butcher</a> on the HEA site calls for broadening the scope for outreach to include adult learners as well as school leavers in HE.</p>
<p>Writing in UWN&rsquo;s 500<sup>th</sup> edition, Brendan O&rsquo;Malley describes how <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180407044722981" rel="nofollow">the decision to triple tuition fees for English HE students changed history</a>: &ldquo;For a good case study in unintended consequences, it would be hard to beat the decision passed after a stormy debate by MPs in December 2010 that went on to imperil not only years of higher education reforms but, inadvertently, the country&rsquo;s future in the European Union.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just PT HE that has been suffering.&nbsp; George Ryan reports an 800,000 drop in FE learners compared to 5 years ago, so welcome news that an &pound;11.7 million <a href="https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/adult-learning-fund-announced" rel="nofollow">Flexible Learning Fund</a> will back 32 FE projects across England that aim to help more adults back into the classroom and learning new skills, according to skills minister Anne Milton.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepienews.com/news/uk-and-australia-map-out-future-research-partnerships/" rel="nofollow">UK and Australian universities are mapping out plans for a closer partnership</a> post-Brexit, with a focus on student mobility, research collaboration and mutual recognition of academic and professional qualifications.</p>

<p>Coursera had 1,632 students studying degrees as of Jan 18 with 93% one-year retention rates, and <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/moocs-become-big-business/" rel="nofollow">Dhawal Shah</a> reports that the company has taken $9.6m in degree tuition fees to date.&nbsp; He also calculates the potential revenue from the top three online degrees as being more $80m:</p>
<p>Over 90% of Brazilians who study with Coursera do so in English and yet only 5% of Brazilians speak sufficiently good English to understand university-level courses.&nbsp; In order to bridge that language gap for the remaining 95%, Coursera has partnered with local universities and business schools to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/coursera-expands-in-brazil/" rel="nofollow">launch 24 Portuguese language MOOCs</a> and one Specialization in topics ranging from project management and software design to data analytics and digital marketing.</p>
<p>Five years ago the Georgia Institute of Technology took its >MSc in computer science</a>, together with $2m of AT&amp;T investment, and offered it entirely online via Udacity at about one sixth of the cost of the on-campus programme.&nbsp; It now has 6,365 students enrolled but fears that the online version would poach applicants for the campus version were unfounded as research shows that the typical applicant to the online program was a 34-year-old midcareer American, while the typical campus applicant was a 24-year-old recent graduate from India.&nbsp; There is also evidence that the lower-cost online option attracts people who would not otherwise have pursued an MSc.&nbsp; Other institutions have taken similar approaches (the Universities of Illinois, Michigan and London&ndash; all through Coursera) but none have been able to catch GIT&rsquo;s low price which was partly due to AT&amp;T&rsquo;s need/willingness at the time to fund development costs.</p>
<p>Seattle Pacific University&rsquo;s Rolin Moe disagrees with Sebastian Thrun&rsquo;s assertion that <a href="https://wonkhe.com/blogs/the-mooc-is-not-dead-but-maybe-it-should-be/" rel="nofollow">the MOOC is dead</a>, but suggests perhaps it should be.&nbsp; MOOCs have never &lsquo;democratised education&rsquo; to any significant extent, particularly as many providers quickly branched into paid options.&nbsp; However, they have affected thinking about and access to higher/distance/lifelong education, albeit mainly for &ldquo;what sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom calls the roaming autodidact, the visage of a self-motivated and previously articulated learner who happens to be white, male and from a Western country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence, he suggests that &ldquo;Despite the earnestness of most MOOC professors, the efforts of development, implementation and assessment have not been shown to be worth their time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://thepienews.com/pie-chat/simon-nelson-ceo-futurelearn-uk/" rel="nofollow">FutureLearn&rsquo;s Simon Nelson</a> would no doubt disagree.&nbsp; The PIE features an interview in which he describes how FutureLearn came about, its relationship with the OU and other partners, and its hopes and plans for the future.</p>

<p><strong>Apprenticeships</strong></p>
<p><em>[FE Week; Jisc; TES]</em></p>
<p>The government aims to have three million people start apprenticeships by 2020.&nbsp; Sounds good, but the Skills Commission recently reported that <a href="https://feweek.co.uk/2018/03/20/why-are-apprenticeship-drop-out-rates-so-high/" rel="nofollow">more than 30% of people who start apprenticeships in Britain do not complete them</a>, and that situation is getting worse every year. &nbsp;In response, Jisc&rsquo;s Paul Feldman argues that to boost completion rates, we first need to understand why apprentices are dropping out, and greater collection and analysis of data will be key to this.&nbsp; Demographic, study activity and performance data is widely collected in HE as a matter of routine and is used to predict, track and forestall potential problems, particularly for those students from under-represented and disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
<p>Jisc&rsquo;s recently launched <a href="http://apprenticeship-toolkit.data.alpha.jisc.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">Apprenticeship Toolkit</a> may also help matters by showing how effective application of digital technologies can support the delivery of the new apprenticeship standards. &nbsp;It is aimed at colleges and training providers (including employer-providers), and organisations delivering end point assessment (EPA).</p>
<p>And the University Vocational Awards Council believes that <a href="https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-news/number-degree-apprenticeships-surge-next-three-years" rel="nofollow">Degree apprenticeships</a> will make up 10% of degrees awarded by universities in the next 3 years.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The presence of role models and mentors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exposure to real-world examples of STEM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouragement from parents and educators (which typically added more than 20 percentage points to the likelihood of them taking STEM classes in High School)</p>

<p><strong>Lifelong Learning Important but EU Struggling to Hit Targets</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>A decade ago, the European Universities&rsquo; Charter on Lifelong Learning outlined 10 commitments for universities and governments to support <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180327112443137" rel="nofollow">the development of lifelong learning</a> in order to secure a &lsquo;Europe of Knowledge&rsquo;.&nbsp; One of its goals was to have 15% of the EU population participating in lifelong learning by 2020 but, despite the emergence of new technologies and &lsquo;digital jobs&rsquo;, coupled with the growing availability of online MOOCs, OERs and other learning resources, the figure (according to Eurostat) had only reached 10.8% by 2016.&nbsp; The European University Association&rsquo;s Hanne Smidt considers the various issues and potential solutions including universities which, she believes, &ldquo;have a distinct role in (re-)educating highly-qualified people who are much needed in all sectors of our rapidly-changing labour market.&rdquo;</p>
