<p>US airline JetBlue has announced that users of its Fly-FI Hub can now <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/103477375027/learn-from-coursera-on-your-next-jetblue-flight" rel="nofollow">study any of ten Coursera courses in-flight</a> from institutions such as The Wharton School, University of Edinburgh and Berklee School of Music.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ieee.org/about/news/2014/14november_2014.html" rel="nofollow">The IEEE is collaborating with edX</a> to offer MOOCs and other continuing professional education courses, starting with that old favourite, SSCC Previews: Circuit and System Insights, which launched on 1 Dec.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bc7f0ca2-6e70-11e4-afe5-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3JzSCpQor" rel="nofollow">The Digital Business Academy</a> &ndash; a joint venture by Cambridge University, UCL, Tech City and Founder Centric &ndash; is offering a business MOOC which aims to persuade those that have shunned formal education in favour of entrepreneurship to obtain some formal business training. &nbsp;The teaching material, which ranges from how to develop an idea to marketing and financing a venture, is offered for free to registered users and each module is expected to take three to six weeks to finish.&nbsp; Completion does not result in a formal qualification, but successful students are offered rewards, such as free office space and mentoring support, provided by more than 30 industry partners, including the BBC, Twitter, O2 and Microsoft.</p>
<p>The Chartered Institute of Personnel &amp; Development (CIPD) is launching its first MOOC - <a href="http://shop.cipd.co.uk/shop/cipd-training/working-digitally-social-media-and-hr" rel="nofollow">Working Digitally: social media and HR</a>.&nbsp; Learners will be invited to complete 4 modules over 6 weeks at about 3hrs per week, and the MOOC will present three times each year.</p>

<p>A new report from the Higher Education Commission, <a href="http://www.policyconnect.org.uk/hec/sites/site_hec/files/report/391/fieldreportdownload/hecommissionreport-toogoodtofail.pdf" rel="nofollow">Too Good to Fail: The financial sustainability of higher education in England</a>, pulls no punches in its assessment of our current funding model: &ldquo;Introducing market forces to a sector that does not operate as a market puts the financial sustainability of the sector at risk; the commission recommends retreating from this notion.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to the IFS, students will graduate with an average debt of &pound;44k (which 73% will not repay in full), compared to around &pound;25k (and 25%) under the former system.&nbsp; The report examines six alternative models of funding but does not back any particular one.</p>
<p>George Osborne announced income-contingent <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20141211183611742" rel="nofollow">postgraduate loans</a> of up to &pound;10,000 from 2016-17 in his Autumn Statement.&nbsp; The number of UK-domiciled students enrolling on masters courses has plummeted in recent years, with UUK saying that 73% of the 140,000 entrants in 2012-13 were from outside the UK.</p>
<p>A report from HEFCE shows that 34% (16,500 entrants) of all <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2014112718585770" rel="nofollow">international first-degree entrants</a> in England transferred directly from UK transnational programmes delivered overseas in 2012-13.</p>
<p>Birmingham University&rsquo;s Prof Sir David Eastwood, chairman of the Russell Group, has warned that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/more-university-students-means-more-dropouts-claims-senior-vicechancellor-9849246.html" rel="nofollow">university drop-out rates will rise</a> as a result of government plans to lift the cap on student recruitment, leading to more university mergers as competition for places increases.&nbsp; He claims, &ldquo;We're getting close to a system which satisfies the needs of the qualified talent out there for a university place. I don't know how much really qualified talent is still out there.&rdquo;&nbsp; THE&rsquo;s Chris Havergal also considers the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/feature-is-bigger-better-for-universities/2017113.article" rel="nofollow">arguments for and against uncapped student numbers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20141127105433691" rel="nofollow">IOE and UCL have merged</a>, in a move they claim, &ldquo;will deliver significant advances in the fields of social science and education, whilst further advancing the work both universities undertake to develop education across London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30193095" rel="nofollow">Degree Apprenticeship</a> qualifications will launch in England next Sep, starting in the digital and software field. &nbsp;Some 150 places have already been guaranteed by the employers who include Accenture, BT, Ford, Fujitsu, GlaxoSmithKline, HP, IBM, John Lewis, Lloyds Bank and Network Rail. &nbsp;The government will pay two-thirds of the costs and fees while employers pay trainees' wages and other costs.</p>
<p>A survey by <em>Which?</em> of 1000 UK undergrads found that a third thought <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30144416" rel="nofollow">their course was not good value for money</a> and around half felt it was not demanding enough or that seminars were generally worth attending.&nbsp; A fifth found an advertised module was no longer available or the content had significantly changed.&nbsp; Only half of those dissatisfied actually complained and 58% were dissatisfied with the response.&nbsp; <em>Which?</em> believes it should be easier to remove the degree-awarding powers of universities that fail to meet academic and consumer standards.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been slightly lukewarm about desktop virtual reality in the past (dating back to Superscape in 1996), but Donald Clark has experienced <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.ca/2014/11/oculus-rift-freezers-smilers-grippers.html" rel="nofollow">Oculus Rift</a> and is smitten or, as he puts it, &ldquo;Once you flood their field of view with a screen that has a high refresh rate with rock solid tracking so that your head movements mimic what would happen in that world, along with great audio &ndash; you&rsquo;re there. &nbsp;That new world is your reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TechCrunch is onboard too, and Kyle Russell considers some of the technology advances that mean <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/24/why-virtual-reality-is-happening-now/?ncid=tcdaily" rel="nofollow">we can deliver VR now</a> in ways that simply weren&rsquo;t possible/affordable just a few years ago.</p>
<p>But perhaps we don&rsquo;t need the expense of Oculus Rift.&nbsp; Could the future lie in your smartphone velcroed into <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/10/google-cardboard/" rel="nofollow">Google Cardboard VR</a>?</p>

<p><strong>2014 Learning Insights Report</strong></p>
<p><em>[Kineo]</em></p>
<p>City &amp; Guilds Kineo have published their latest <a href="http://resources.kineo.com/learning-insights-report-2014-download" rel="nofollow">Learning Insights Report: Adding Business Value Through Learning</a>, based on interviews with 35 directors and managers responsible for</p>
<p>learning in 29 different organisations.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, money was an issue, as was supporting (in many cases) a global 24/7 workforce, but the L&amp;D focus has also shifted: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about upskilling; it&rsquo;s transforming the business through learning&rdquo;.&nbsp; Organisations are deploying more blended and technology-enhanced solutions, and social/peer learning and support are becoming more significant.</p>

<p><strong>JISC Learning Analytics Report</strong></p>
<p><em>[Niall Sclater]</em></p>
<p>Niall Sclater has researched and written a &lsquo;state of the nation&rsquo; report, <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5657/1/Learning_analytics_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">Learning analytics: The current state of play in UK higher and further education</a>, based on interviews with 13 FEIs and HEIs, including the OU.&nbsp; He notes that analytics is in its relative infancy in the UK, meaning there is an almost pioneering spirit based on some generally perceived benefits, a great deal of enthusiasm, but little yet in the way of robust, tangible outcomes and surprisingly little commonality in terms of institutional goals, approaches, tools and systems.</p>
<p>Also available from JISC is a new <a href="http://sclater.com/blog/jisc-releases-report-on-ethical-and-legal-challenges-of-learning-analytics/" rel="nofollow">Code of practice for learning analytics: A literature review of the ethical and legal issues</a>, which aims to provide, &ldquo;the groundwork for a code of practice which is intended to help institutions solve the complex issues raised by learning analytics.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Mapping Student-Led Peer Learning in the UK</strong></p>
<p><em>[HEA]</em></p>
<p>A new HEA research report, <a href="https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/about/news/10209" rel="nofollow">Mapping student-led peer learning in the UK</a>, highlights the benefits of peer-led learning.&nbsp; Students who take part in peer-led learning sessions experience reduced anxiety associated with transition into higher education. They also have a greater sense of belonging and improved academic confidence.&nbsp; For students who undertake the role of 'peer leader', benefits include the acquisition of higher level personal and professional skills. Their own subject learning is deepened too, inter-cultural awareness is enhanced and employability prospects are greater.</p>
