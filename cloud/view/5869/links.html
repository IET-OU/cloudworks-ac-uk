<p><strong>2.&nbsp; winning credibility - earning trust</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that credibility cannot be claimed, it must be earned.&nbsp; And that means being open to challenge from the very people whose trust we seek.&nbsp; It is not how we see them that matters, it is how they see us.</p>
<p><strong>culture and its enclaves:&nbsp;</strong> We are not our clients&rsquo; and students&rsquo; only sources of learning for career management - they learn in other ways.&nbsp; That means that they do not come to us empty-handed - they come with beliefs, values and expectations, which they gather from their experience of <em>culture and its enclaves.</em> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those sources of learning are massively expanding through globalisation and its technologies.&nbsp; Everyone has plenty of informal ways of finding out what is going on, and working out what they can do about it.&nbsp; And they find those sources in both friends-and-family, and on-line.&nbsp; But this is learning in enclaves - it increasingly belongs to post-coded attitudes reflected in googled urls.&nbsp; Those geographically located cultural backgrounds are becoming better markers for work-related attitudes than any twentieth-century definition of social class can any longer show us.&nbsp; Different groups, in different positions, with different experiences, learn different things about career.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>contested claims:&nbsp;</strong> And, so, there is always more than one way of thinking about working life.&nbsp; Ideas about career are constantly reorganising how we understand what people do.&nbsp; Words like &lsquo;skill&rsquo;, &lsquo;employability&rsquo;, &lsquo;confidence&rsquo;, &lsquo;experience&rsquo;, &lsquo;allegiance&rsquo; and &lsquo;motivation&rsquo; crop up differently in different accounts.&nbsp; They express <em>contested claims</em>: whatever anybody says about career, somebody else can say it differently.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve ever compiled a career-management essay or case study, you may well have wondered how to be sure that you have covered the ground. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But my reading of the evidence is that there is something like a consensus about the value of careers work.&nbsp; However much they may vary in other ways, in certain conditions students and clients agree about us.&nbsp; They approve of us when...: they know what they want to do; they are facing short-term action; and they are looking for hard information.&nbsp; We shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised by the modesty of these accolades.&nbsp; In work as complex and dynamic as ours, the best we could ever reasonably have hoped for is that we help some people, on some issues for some of the time.&nbsp; And that is pretty-well what the evidence shows.</p>
<p><strong>enl</strong><strong>arged expertise:</strong>&nbsp; The evidence shows something else: when it comes to reflecting on why to move on in one direction rather than another, that&rsquo;s when people go to other people for informal help - not to us.&nbsp; They turn to people they know, and who know them - people they feel they can trust.&nbsp; And it is on that &lsquo;why&rsquo; question that they look elsewhere.&nbsp; We increase our credibility by working with people, not just on how to do things, but on why to bother.&nbsp; It means being strong both on career and on the causes of career.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t have that understanding: we are expanding our career studies continually - drawing on psychology, economics, and sociology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;career studies&rsquo; is useful, because it speaks less of some wholly-owned careers-work discipline, more of an examination of rigorous disciplines which expand our understanding.&nbsp; The history of careers work is a history of that kind of intellectual exploration and importation.&nbsp; It brings us an <em>enlarged expertise</em>: constantly taking us into unfamiliar pathways, collecting from emerging sources, and discovering new ways of understanding what is going on.&nbsp; A recent example is how culture and neurology interact.&nbsp; It expands our scope for evoking possible selves in possible futures. &nbsp;And that offers people a deeper and wider hold on working life. &nbsp;We will know that it has earned credibility when more people, from more backgrounds, want to discuss more of their lives, with more of us, for more of the time.</p>
<p>Practical questions for winning that kind of credibility include..</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;who collates our understanding of career - and the causes of career?&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;how do we best connect that expertise to client and student experience?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;how do they know us - and become known by us - enough to trust us?&rsquo;</em></p>
