<p>I've started a collection of links to free audio and video software on this bibsonomy site&nbsp;</p>
<p>My project is to provide guidelines for creating audio and video learnng resources which are effective and inclusive. Multimedia can be a powerful online learning experience; in particular when people are speaking about their own experiences. Technology developments mean we no longer have to rely on professional studios but can adopt a DIY approach. I would like to develop a DIY handout guide for staff wanting to use audio and video in their online learning environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is now a DIY Multimedia Cloudscape - with more details - at&nbsp;http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2743&nbsp;</p>

                   Hello Sue

I'd really like to work with you on this. 
My focus in the last two years has been helping instructors to record lectures for mobile learning but I think your approach is innovative and much needed.

Btw I'm from Munich, Germany, so my English might be a bit bumpy.

                   <p>Hi Sue, if you're interested in working with others on this, I'd also like to collaborate with you. Like Esther above, I am involved in lecture recording and I also support academic staff in use of multimedia. At City University London, we recently started a Video in Education SIG to try and raise interest in this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm quite interested in striking a balance between the DIY approach and production values - one way to achieve this can be by concentrating on pedagogic values, or on the content of your material, even if you don't have access to specialist equipment. The DIY approach has advantages over more "expert" recording methods - ease of production, instant sharing etc. So it lets the creator concentrate more on what they want to do with the material, or how they want others to use it.</p>
<p>Anyway just some thoughts prompted by your idea. Hope to hear from you</p>
<p>Mo</p>        </div>

                   Hi Sue

Thanks for the input.
Mmh, I didn't get  your e-mail yet - no idea why, because I've received the   cloudworks mass mails up to now.

In my experience there's always an initial confusion in setting up this kind of group environment. Everyone has their preferred home base and then there's the official hub ... 
Google hangouts is a great option in any case.

Yes, it's a good idea if everyone were to sketch their ideas on this subject as a starting point. I will do so on my own cloud (phew, somehow this sounds like we're not in this world any more ;-)) - my learning journal.

                   I would love to contribute here as I can offer experience of producing, directing and writing training videos - everything from drama to covering lectures and events, on six figure budgets to me and £80 Sony Flip. In particular user genersted video content interests me - how comments such as these, or blog posts or picture galleries might differe if uploaded exclusively as video content. Where do craft skills come into it? The brief, the treatment, the script?         </div>

                   <p>I think that this is a great idea, reflecting the move to 'how to' guides on the web. Perhaps you could expand on why and how this would be a particularly good idea for a MOOC (which I am sure it is)? Jeff</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Jeff - I think primarily because the 'openess' of MOOCs suggest content would carry a creative commons licence and be freely available. Also, the shared expertise and experience MOOCs attract make them a useful forum for sharing practice. Would you like to join the group? :-)&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Sue</p>
<p>This interests me a lot, though I don't think I will have time to participate, but I will definitely follow it.</p>
<p>We will be conceptualising a course on Story Development (for teachers and young children) for a project we are doing, and I think what you discuss in your team may be valuable for us.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>        </div>

                   Hi Sue; have been having a nightmare with Cloudworks- can't add content as problem with IE9 (hence all my clouds look blank).  Am now managing with an ipad mini but don'tget the text editor - aarghh!
Happy to work in a study group, although my project interests are a bit different Provided I can actually contribute.  anyone else have problems? wish me luck, about to press the 'post' button...        </div>

                   <p>Hi Sheila, Julie and Fred</p>
<p>Glad I'm not the only one getting increasingly frustrated with the Cloud experience - too many clouds!</p>
<p>I've set up a Cloudscape as per Week 1 instructions here&nbsp;http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2743&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having a problem working out the communication side - it seems to go against the spirit of the cloud/google groups to suggest we use our email addresses directly&nbsp;but the thought of a single communication channel is appealing :-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you think?&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Hi Sue,</p>
<p>Thanks for your email on Saturday and sorry I didn't reply until now. Just a quick message to say I'm spending tonight on Cloudworks so I'll check out your cloud then, and hopefully make some contributions.</p>
<p>Glad to see others are also interested in this idea. I for one would be happy to use emails or a single google group to keep in touch. I guess we would have to keep coming back to the cloud periodically to update it, but for most communication a single channel would be much easier and less confusing</p>

<p>I couldn't find a Comment box on your cloud so am not sure of the best way to get to you - I hope now you've posted a comment here the cloud is in some way connected to you!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set up a DIY Multimedia for Teaching and Learning Google Group at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia" rel="nofollow">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia</a></p>
<p>And posted on Monday&rsquo;s task&nbsp;Learning design brainstorm inviting DIY Multimedia members to describe their own thoughts on learning design.</p>
<p>Please feel free to add a few thoughts on how you all approach learning design.</p>
<p>Also how are you all finding the MOOC? So far for me the Massiveness has been a bit overwhelming. I&rsquo;m hoping once we are all in the same place then collaboration and communication may get a little easier!&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Hi Sue</p>
<p>I'm very keen on exploring these technologies in the context of Continuous Professional Development.&nbsp; I work in Economic Development (labour market initiatives) and struggle to get employability workers (regardless of their employer) to engage in meaningful learning.&nbsp; I feel that our field will be left behind in an old world of occasional, meaningless courses and workshops if we don't embrace technology.</p>
<p>In my efforts to use a free rapid e-learning set up I constantly hear the same refrain "I don't have enough time" Yet the same folk can attend workshops that they moan about afterwards as being a waste of time.</p>
<p>Perhaps technology is not the solution to this but I believe it is worth exploring.</p>
<p>I'd be very happy to join this group with the intention of contributing and learning through active exploration.</p>
<p>Look forward to hearing from you</p>
<p>Brian</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Brian, good to hear from you - I agree technology is the way forward but with regard to the usability of Multimedia there is always risks of losing people; either creators or users, through poor design or over reliance on wizziness!&nbsp; Empowering staff to be creative and confident with multimedia capture and production is only one way forward but for me it's worth spending the time to look at practical ways to achieve this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set up a DIY Multimedia for Teaching and Learning Google Group at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia" rel="nofollow">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia</a>&nbsp;and started a discussion on learning design. I'm not 100% convinced replying here on Cloudworks always gets through to the right people - some have said they've haven't received messages sent this way - if you get this please could you do me a favour and let me know <a href="mailto:swatling@lincoln.ac.uk" rel="nofollow">swatling@lincoln.ac.uk</a></p>
