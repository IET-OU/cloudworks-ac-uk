        <p>Panel: Craig Mahoney (Higher Education Academy); David Mossley (Higher Education Academy); Jonathan Darby (SCORE); Megan Quentin Baster (University of Newcastle Upon Tyne)</p>
<p>CM: This is a turbulent time for education, but also a creative time with enormous opportunity. &nbsp;We need to rethink and repurpose the didactic model of higher education which is prevalent in UK universities. &nbsp;OER is going to be a part of this. &nbsp;But we need policy leadership in universities, who are often unaware of how OER can be used and promoted. &nbsp;There are examples of good practice, but they tend to be isolated and sometimes unsupported. &nbsp;We need to rethink the way we make use of resources in constructive and critical ways if we are to encourage lifelong learners. &nbsp;The Open University is the leader in the UK: &nbsp;all the others are playing catch up.</p>
<p>DM: The HEA has produced a number of resources for senior mangers and policymakers, including a toolkit (http://bit.ly/H5NEf5). &nbsp;The approach of the programme has been diverse and student-focused (including an NUS survey). &nbsp;Iniital results suggest that students respect academic who share. &nbsp;The future is about enriching the student learning experience by going beyond the point of contact.</p>
<p>JD: The OU has changed the way it communicates and educates, sharing content in new ways (including 40 million downloads on iTunesU). &nbsp;The OU has been a 'giver' rather than a sharer, historically speaking. &nbsp;Now, when new courses are created in a structured way it makes it easier for OERs to be created: &nbsp;sharing is embedded into the process. &nbsp;The OU is also thinking seriously about incorporating OER into course delivery rather than creating everything from scratch, though progress could be made in this area. &nbsp;One area where OER has made a difference in OpenLearn, which uses OER to attrach potential students at a 75% saving on recruitment cost.</p>
<p>MQB: Academics and institutions are worried about legal implications of being open. &nbsp;Attribution is particularly tough with teaching materials. &nbsp;Publishers are interested in working with HE institutions to be open, but in practice little has been delivered. &nbsp;Negotiations can also be slow, meaning that academics often just act without securing legal permissions. &nbsp;We need risk management tools and effective policies for the ways we reuse and remix content. &nbsp;Furthermore, the publishing model is changing, with power shifting to resellers like Amazon.</p>
<p>Jackie Coulter (JORUM) asked about policy leadership and lessons learned. &nbsp;CM said that there is a lack of convergence between political and institutional drivers which threatens the future sustainability of the sector as a whole. &nbsp;JC responded by saying that we need to be better about collecting evidence about the successes and importance of using OER. &nbsp;JD said that policy should be about removing barriers to being open, not about directing others. &nbsp;(Tacitly, this suggests that openness is a default behaviour which takes over once barriers are removed.)</p>
<p>Antonio Mart&iacute;nez-Arboleda&nbsp;Leeds&nbsp;University and&nbsp;SCORE) asked about the Research Excellence Framework (REF) which does not seem to make provision for OER. &nbsp;MQB said that she had raised this with REF panels, who said that they already had their work cut out and wouldn't be considering teaching materials at this time. &nbsp;But activities surrounding enhancement might use open licensing in the future. &nbsp;More importantly, authors need to start expressing a strong preference for being open in order to bring about change in research-led organizations.</p>
<p>The discussion went on to cover the possible role of top-down leadership (e.g. the Bologna process). &nbsp;There was a suggestion that we need both top-down and bottom-up processes with policies that are not overly prescriptive, but can be endorsed by leaders.</p>
<p>MQB mentioned the way that institutions like the Wellcome Trust are moving to open access models, showing how change might come from open research rather than OER. &nbsp;Judith Murray (Thompson University) wondered whether there are policy tools that could enable other types of open activities. &nbsp;Cable Green (Creative Commons) noted that OER should be understood as having&nbsp;no cost at the point of &nbsp;access and affording thelegal rights to make modifications. &nbsp;He reiterated the basic policy principle that any publicly funded resources should be openly available resources, a principle which he hopes will be endorsed at the forthcoming UNESCO meeting in Paris.</p>    </div>
