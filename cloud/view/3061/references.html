			<h2>Keynote 1: The Future of Computing Practice and Education (in an Instrumented, Interconnected, Intelligent World)</h2>
<p>Nicholas Bowen, VP Technology</p>
<p>Modern world is interconnected in ways more than simply communications networks. &nbsp;We live in a global community that is connected economically, socially and technically.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instrumentation, e.g., smart traffic systems, smart food systems - gather data from the environment to provide better information.</li>
<li>Interconnected, e.g., smart supply chains, smart energy grids - 'the internet of things'</li>
<li>Intelligent, e.g., smart retail, smart healthcare - optimisations of instrumented, interconnected systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>This take on the direction in which technology is heading is very much in line with the Open University's thinking in developing TU100 (My Digital Life).</p>
<p>Which 'age' are we heading to? - Carlota Perez shows that each of the five great surges of development in the last 240 years - industrial revolution (1771-), age of steam (1829-), age of steel and heavy industry (1875-), age of automobile (1908-), age of IT (1971-), Age of biotech, nanotech, etc. (20??-) ?</p>
<p>Within the age of computing technological innovation has evolved through the levels of - Machine -&gt; Middleware -&gt; Internet. &nbsp;Going forward there are a number of high-level trends emerging:</p>
<h3>Trend #1: How is IT delivered and managed?</h3>
<p>From "Build it" to "Buy it" - requires an integration of engineering, business models and social sciences. &nbsp;A potential qualification that meets the needs of this trend is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Science,_Management_and_Engineering" rel="nofollow">Service Science, Management and Engineering (SSME)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issue: Is the 'service' paradigm going to be relevant to the interconnected, instrumented, intelligent world we are heading to?</p>
<h3>Trend #2: Computing as a tool for other fields</h3>
<p>E.g., the use of computing in life sciences (bio-informatics) - needs skills in modelling and analytics. &nbsp;How much computer science does the domain expert in a particular field need to know?</p>
<h3>Trend #3: Expanding business value in a 'smarter' world</h3>
<p>Emerging applications in an instrumented world - implies education must be multi-disciplinary since these applications require collaboration across lots of different systems (economic, social *and* technical)</p>
<p>In order to talk about the solutions to these complex solutions, computing professionals need domain expertise in business and people processes. &nbsp;More importantly, computing professionals needs the skills to be able to engage with a very diverse group of stakeholders.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Implications for computing education from each trend is that we need to develop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foundational skills - still need to understand the basics about how systems will be built and managed</li>
<li>Domain expertise</li>
<li>"Systems Thinkers" - engineers can no longer simply 'swim in their lane' - need to interact with diverse stakeholders.</li>
<li>Strong communication and collaboration required!</li>
</ul>
<p>Developing 'T-shaped' people - the horizontal bar of the T represents a breadth of knowledge/experience over a range of areas, as well as the vertical bar representing a depth of knowledge/experience in a specific field.</p>
<h3>From Q&amp;A:</h3>
<ul>
<li>From IBMs (and industry perspective), the technical content of what students learn is less important than the skills they gain through the learning process. &nbsp;For example, the ability to self-critique ideas and then go off and independently acquire new knowledge that would allow the criticisms to be addressed.</li>
<li>From question about, how can universities fit even more (on interdisciplinary working, etc.) into an already crowded curriculum? Answer from Nicholas Bowen - universities need to have a 'near death experience' and ensure that internal processes need to ensure regular review of effectiveness <strong>and allow rapid realignment of direction</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>IBM are sponsoring a IEEE Computer online discussion on this topic @ http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computer/industry_perspective.</p>

			<h2>Keynote 2: Reinventing Software Engineering Education</h2>
<p>Prof. Raj Reddy, CMU</p>
<p>Latter part of the talk will focus on a proposal for a Learning by Example handbook of Software Engineering education.</p>
<p>Link to the previous keynote - How will every student having a laptop in the classroom will change education? &nbsp;We won't know until we give everyone a laptop a
[removed][removed]
nd instrument it and develop methods for analysing the data that comes from the instrumentation. <strong>We need instrumented, interconnected, intelligent systems for education (not just business)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Software Engineering education is more effective if it is student centred (active learning) - rather than lecture centred (passive learning). &nbsp;We need handbooks on Learning by Example and Learning by Doing for Software Engineering.</li>
<li>Need to adopt principles and practices followed in other Engineering disciplines - access to a body of knowledge / experience, access to open market for components and services, design environments and analysis tools.</li>
<li>Education and training programs must introduce and use components from the marketplace in classes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ideas from the Science of Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learning to Learn: Skills required to acquire new knowledge without the need for formal instruction. &nbsp;Give students foundational knowledge and incremental problems with some simple tools for finding additional information. &nbsp;Students use the knowledge gained from solving previous problems together with some additional information to learn something new. Teach skills of validating knowledge gained.</li>
<li>Learning by Doing: Some tasks &nbsp;(e.g., reading) can only be learnt through direct personal experience. &nbsp;However, this needs someone (thing) that can evaluate the student's attempt and provide feedback.</li>
<li>Learning by Example</li>
<li>... and others</li>
</ul>
<p>Educators need to be aware of these techniques and use them appropriately when producing course materials.</p>
<p>The three 'L's of learning - Lectures, Labs and Libraries should be enhanced to allow for active learning. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Recorded lectures can be used as the basis for tutorials where&nbsp;students are be encouraged to discuss material and arrive at answers to questions on their own.</li>
<li>Simulation software can be used to allow students to conduct experiments on their own, without the need for expensive equipment or facilities.</li>
<li>Online libraries can provide students with access to learning materials, wherever and whenever they want.</li>
</ul>
<p>Software engineering education wiki handbook should be established to provide a resource for learning from example and learning by doing. &nbsp;Such an online handbook would be a multimedia presentation of the material. Components of a handbook wiki page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some background reading material - explaining the foundations of the topic - embedded with relevant examples.</li>
<li>Provide a task or problem to solve: Includes a link to relevant background material; specific knowledge needed for the particular problem; provide a worked example of an analogous problem.</li>
<li>Ability to submit a solution: provide student with ability to review instructor's solution alongside their own. &nbsp;If the submitted solution is incorrect, ask the student to solve another problem until they get it right.</li>
<li>Enable dialog with instructor - either synchronously, or asynchronously - to resolve any remaining problems faced by the student.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A 20/20 Vision for Software Engineering Education</h3>
<p>Teach students how to carry out: Preliminary design, Analysis and prototyping, develop specification for components, build and test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online parts catalogs, online handbooks, search mechanisms to locate closest approximation to needed parts. &nbsp;Use the internet to find information - but challenge of knowing what information to trust.</p>
<p>We need a handbook of software engineering education that will allow us to learn from each others best practices. &nbsp;The handbook should be grounded in the science of learning - drawing on ideas of learning by example, learning by doing, etc.,</p>			<div class="posted-by">
