<p>What education needs from politics is much less control and a whole lot more imagination.&nbsp; I try here to say something useful about how things got this way.&nbsp;&nbsp; My conclusion is that the way things are demands more than an adjustment here, a fix there and a re-launch sometime.&nbsp; I'm arguing for mind-boggling imagination, in support of learning-for-living usefulness, based on root-and-branch innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>stakeholder voices</strong></p>
<p>The way things are is not a happy story.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s certainly not hard to find reports that politics is remote from experience.&nbsp; People's life-and-work is changed for the worse by politicos claiming to be acting for the better.&nbsp; The people I&rsquo;m thinking of are <em>students</em>, in the <em>communities</em> where they and their families live, with their <em>helpers</em> in schools and colleges and in civil society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All three groups are stakeholders - a term which includes shareholders, but reaches far beyond them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll talk a lot about stakeholder voice - how different people, in different groups, differently voice their interests in education.&nbsp; Each speaks with an indispensable authority of the sense they make of their experience.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s more leadership for education than its designated leaders necessarily know about.&nbsp; There are also more conflicts of interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, the most pressing need has to do with the way in which students now need to navigate a path through accelerating change - a journey too-often signposted for manipulation, deceit and predation.&nbsp; Educators cannot ignore this.&nbsp; But stakeholder responses vary: some see market opportunities, some wonder what markets do for social well-being or personal fulfilment, and some argue for critical thinking to enable students to deal with whatever is thrown at them.&nbsp; I try to show how and why politics shows an active interest in some of this, promises but does not deliver on some, and largely ignores some.&nbsp; Educators are bound to wonder why.</p>
<p class="text">There's plenty here for you to disagree with - and plenty of opportunity for you to say why.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>abstractions and metaphors</strong></p>
<p class="text">But there&rsquo;s no quick-and-easy way to talk about education.&nbsp; Attempts at any length resort to abstract nouns.&nbsp; Various stakeholders variously call on such concepts as...&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="text">&lsquo;achievement&rsquo; - &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; - &lsquo;fairness&rsquo; - &lsquo;fulfilment&rsquo; - &lsquo;progress&rsquo; - &lsquo;self&rsquo; - &lsquo;well-being&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">They&rsquo;re rarely defined in ways that everyone accepts.&nbsp; Some get regularly redefined.&nbsp; And when any of them are loaded into a conversation about accelerating change, a person can get lost.</p>
<p class="text">It gets worse.&nbsp; As politics turns to education for responses to its own problems, the list lengthens, to include for example...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;aspiration&rsquo; - &lsquo;career&rsquo; - &lsquo;choice&rsquo; - &lsquo;citizenship&rsquo; - &lsquo;employability&rsquo; - &lsquo;enterprise&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">They&rsquo;re pretty fuzzy concepts.&nbsp; Some are demonstrably meaningless.&nbsp; But some people&rsquo;s interests find one or more term compelling - even compulsory.</p>
<p class="text">When definitions don&rsquo;t help, metaphors sometimes can.&nbsp; They substitute abstract talk with talk of the tangible.&nbsp; Metaphors conjure images which can be visualised as part of a narrative.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s possible to talk of education...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote">as if it recounted <em>&lsquo;a journey&rsquo; - </em>or<em> - &lsquo;a race&rsquo; ........ </em>or as if featured<em> - &lsquo;a trap&rsquo; - </em>or<em> - &lsquo;a key&rsquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">Such images matter.&nbsp; And narrative seems to be the species&rsquo; default way of making sense of what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; It gives voice to experience...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>what did he say? - why&rsquo;s that so important to her? - </em><br /><em>what can she do about it? - he won&rsquo;t like that!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">Ministerial pronouncements and stakeholder response can be narrated in such terms.&nbsp; But education can&rsquo;t rely wholly on such talk - it can deceive.&nbsp; Thinking about education can use narrative, but it needs hard evidence.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>imagination and reality</strong></p>
<p>I've put in links to imagery that stakeholders might find worth engaging.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the first...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote">Imagine no possessions<br /> I wonder if you can<br /> No need for greed or hunger<br /> A brotherhood of man<br /> Imagine all the people sharing all the world</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text" align="right">John Lennon</p>
<p class="text">John Lennon bequeathed <a title="hope" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnlennon/imagine.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hope</a>, not least to young people.&nbsp; He sees young people as moving on together, as if on a shared journey.&nbsp; He avowedly does not see them as being taken in one-by-one, as in a trap.&nbsp; He wrote this when an economy, culture and technology made such western-hemisphere hopefulness seem possible.&nbsp; Contemporary experience needs a different narrative - not least for students, with their educators, and in their communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>student voice</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">So what kind of narrative might resonate with students these days?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no hope in a story of entrapment, but it might be worth wondering about the attractions of racing imagery - where people can be winners...&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose students mainly value education to help them be winners?</li>
<li>so that they seek coaching? - to get ahead of the pack? - finding an inside track? - to the finishing line?</li>
<li>might that mean that giving way to others is believed to be weakness?</li>
<li>what about if the belief were that losers have only themselves to blame?</li>
<li>would anybody then expect that excluding others from the game is how the competitive win?</li>
</ul>
<p>Are students finding such talk any more &lsquo;hard to do&rsquo; than John Lennon found in his imagining?&nbsp; Probably not: such competitiveness is not hard to understand in a stagnant economy, where one person's gain will be another's loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a lot of issues embedded here.&nbsp; There is evidence that finishing-line learning gets lost when the race is thought to be won.&nbsp; It's learning for a result, not learning for life.&nbsp; But the beliefs, values and expectations associated with such a story can, nonetheless, embed in the culture of a school, a college or a project...</p>
<ul>
<li>how far would education be valued for the advantages it gives to &lsquo;me&rsquo;, over &lsquo;others&rsquo;?</li>
<li>are relationship increasingly valued for their &lsquo;worth-knowing&rsquo; networking?</li>
<li>and about the excluded, who do they believe they can most count on when it matters? - day-on-day? - in a crisis?</li>
<li>do such outsiders have any value to the advantaged - worth talking to? - caring about? - given as much as a nod?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">This may not be what John Lennon calls &lsquo;brotherhood&rsquo;.&nbsp; And there is some evidence of loss of eye-contact in competitive cultures.</p>
<p class="text">Such issues are not intended for research schedules; they are the makings of fuller conversations.&nbsp; For the helpers these are listening conversations - helpers need to know what sense students are making of their experience of education.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">So what about John Lennon's talk of &lsquo;possessions&rsquo;? - among which socially-isolating on-line devices may be significant...</p>
<ul>
<li>are there possessions that are more valued than, say, on-line devices? - like what?</li>
<li>do we know what such feelings-for-things are about? - fun? - contacts? - status? - what else?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s fun, would that be exciting? - impulsive? - dramatic? - extreme? - dangerous? - what more could it be?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s about contacts? - does that mean with people whom &lsquo;I like&rsquo;? - or are &lsquo;like me&rsquo;? - what&rsquo;s most to like? - what people? - found where? - valued why? - something else?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s about status, would that have anything to do with expensive stuff? - up-to-date? - looking good? - feeling good? - having followers? - what else?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s plenty of room for imagination here, but it&rsquo;s not John Lennon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If educators find any trace of a &lsquo;me-now-and-fun&rsquo; culture, is it showing any traces of what some call &lsquo;immature&rsquo; - and some would call &lsquo;infantilised&rsquo;.&nbsp; There's evidence, and not only among young people. &nbsp; A second bit of imagery:&nbsp; Aldous Huxley attributes such attitudes to most of us, in his ironic <a title="huxley" href="http://classiclit.about.com/od/bravenewworld/fr/aafpr_bravenew.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">imagining</a> of a <em>Brave New World</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s no limit in such talk to why-is-this-important-to-anybody questioning.&nbsp; Neither is there any limit to what-can-anyone-do-about-it hope.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>educator voice</strong></p>
<p class="text">Inserting words like &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo;, &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; and &lsquo;choice&rsquo; into a message captures comfortable compliance.&nbsp; Other words, like &lsquo;entrap&rsquo;, &lsquo;impulse&rsquo; and &lsquo;infantilise&rsquo; feel more like uncomfortable warnings.&nbsp; But both sets of terms belong to each other, like the conflicted dialogue in a well-told story.&nbsp; Educators do not come empty handed to that conversation.&nbsp; Engaging imagery, tracking sense-making and questioning meaning - that's what educators do.&nbsp; Whatever trap-door may be slammed shut, educators can find a key.</p>
<p class="text">Maybe.&nbsp; But what if education were favourably enough disposed to government to be itself susceptible to capture?</p>
<ul>
<li>is it worth asking how favourably disposed to government educators want to be? - need to be? - are?</li>
<li>what if prevalent social attitudes are more inclined to trust governing voices?</li>
<li>and suppose governmental and commercial priorities were to become interchangeable with each other?</li>
<li>would it then be possible that terms like &lsquo;markets&rsquo;, &lsquo;brands&rsquo;, &lsquo;customers&rsquo;, and &lsquo;choice&rsquo; meld education's aims with political and business-world claims? - okay with that?</li>
<li>if these are trends, then should educators be using on-line sources to track them? - and any place for &lsquo;professional&rsquo; and &lsquo;popular&rsquo; journalism?</li>
<li>and how much of this do government&rsquo;s &lsquo;expert&rsquo; advisers illuminate? - or do its commercially-based lobbyists?</li>
<li>should any of this be a concern of educators? - and would that be only if it concerns education and assessment? - or if it affects student&rsquo;s chances in life? - or because it has broader stakeholder significance? - like what?</li>
<li>but what if such trends are already shaping stakeholders attitudes? - how, then, is any of this making learning-for-living more accessible to some people? - and less to others?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">If any part of this line of conversation seeks to maintain independence then it is more than about skills and theory, it's about ethics.&nbsp; It seems to me to be easier to make ethical claims in mission statements, than to demonstrate ethical commitments in a crisis.&nbsp; There is here the makings a conversation for educators, their mentors, trainers, associations and theorists to get into.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Because the situation is critical, an independent education service faces formidable issues...</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose educators are asked to treat what students bring out of art, work and creativity as no more than saleable commodities?</li>
<li>what if history were to become a feel-good account of a great nation&rsquo;s leaders?</li>
<li>on another tack, would it matter if an uncomprehended &lsquo;nudge&rsquo; supplants any need to understand the whys-and-wherefores for taking action? - or if back-of-the-envelope &lsquo;tips&rsquo; were thought to be enough to guide what people need to do?</li>
<li>and what if, then, any resulting self-confidence and positive thinking become the prime outcomes of education? - and if not that, something more troublesome? - like asking awkward questions - or dissent?</li>
<li>would it matter if any me-and-mine individualism tightened its hold on curriculum? - setting aside the sense people make of their experience in their neighbourhoods? - about their inheritance and upbringing? - among their connections? - and their attachments to others?</li>
<li>would psychology then be strong enough to carry the explanatory freight concerning what people learn? - and what they do with the opportunity to learn? - rather than an understanding social-and-cultural-group influences on their attitudes?</li>
<li>and would any loss of the sense of living-with-others mean that local and systemic influences on learning are down-played? - allowing the need for socially-located help to be curtailed? - and, despite policy-and-commercial claims to &lsquo;openness&rsquo;, not open to scrutiny?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">There is evidence that political pronouncements shape prevalent attitudes.&nbsp; But policy promises of &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; might not be freedom as most people think of it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s freedom for families to manoeuvre into high-rated schools, and for commerce to edge education towards privatisation.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not freedom for families get their kids into a local school which they have come to think of as theirs.&nbsp; Nor for independently-minded teachers to escape derogatory labelling.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s certainly not a freedom that John Lennon imagined &lsquo;would make the world as one&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="text">A third piece of imagery: are there any traces here of George Orwell&rsquo;s <a title="orwell" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087803" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">nightmare</a>? - take control of the language, substitute belief for reality, re-write the past.&nbsp; Evidence of social control includes reports of clever news management neutralising what policy does not want heard, smothering it with press releases which are cut-and-pasted into news items by compliant journalists.&nbsp; The media gain is to capture attention and extend the reach of advertising.&nbsp; Popular demands for satisfaction make for a headline-driven curriculum requiring educators to come up with solutions to situations where they can have no control.&nbsp; And much of each requirement is written by politicos, their advisers and lobbyists.&nbsp; Some of it is lies.</p>
<p class="text">There are different interests at stake here - different students, different educators, in different communities, differently benefit - and are differently harmed.&nbsp; But independent educators make a different use of the headline-driven curriculum: enabling a critical grasp of what the media claim, engaging students in asking on what evidence?, on behalf of whom?, and why?&nbsp; How many politicos have you noticed asking for such disturbance?</p>
<p class="text"><strong>&nbsp;<br /></strong></p>
<p class="text"><strong>community voice</strong></p>
<p class="text">The politics of promise rests on a belief in the possibility of unlimited growth.&nbsp; The evidence is that the economics of such beliefs is unreliable, especially concerning the risks and costs of collateral damage.&nbsp; And that damage ranges from the personal-and-frightening, to the planetary-and-catastrophic.&nbsp; People need a new narrative, making new sense and based on sane assumptions.</p>
<p class="text">Isn&rsquo;t that what education is for?&nbsp; It would be surprising to find that no teacher wanted to help with any part of the processes suggested here.&nbsp; A tough test is the purest of all disciplines - maths (said to be god's language).&nbsp; The most basic grasp of probability undermines the most plausible of bogus promises.&nbsp; That educator needs only to understand that this is not just about acquiring skills for an examination, it&rsquo;s about transferring learning into life.</p>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s much talk of curriculum reform; a lot of it about the needs of the economy and the usefulness to employers.&nbsp; That story needs retelling...</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose we start from an assertion that a pressing need for education is to enable the navigation of a path through change? - how far would the features of that challenge be to deal with overload? - confusion? - deception? - risk? - and what more?</li>
<li>would that mean enabling people to probe and interrogate every promise, enticement and manoeuvre?</li>
<li>and how far do they need to be able to do that as individuals? - with friends? - in groups? - on-line?</li>
<li>do current conditions need an increased ability to scrutinise, probe and interrogate persuaders? - does the phrase &lsquo;critical thinking&rsquo; convey any of this?</li>
<li>if so, is enough attention given to critical thinking in calls for reform from policy? - commerce? - the media? - religion? - if not, is it up to educators to do more about it? - and students? - and other stakeholders?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">Not all educators will say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to all of this.&nbsp; But this reform doesn&rsquo;t need all educators.&nbsp; The need is for independent educators.&nbsp; Who work with the voice of stakeholders.&nbsp; With their ethics in good order.</p>
<p class="text">The issues raised here are locally experienced, but they are globally generated.&nbsp; The planet is peppered with regimes who find it easier to nudge, entice, cajole and threaten people into compliance than to educate them into autonomy.&nbsp; They breed dependence on dominant and controlling voices.&nbsp; They feed into every conflict, fear and risk that we all face.&nbsp; It justifies violence against outsiders and breeds docility in the group.&nbsp; Educators were never more deeply and urgently implicated.&nbsp; Not least in the UK.</p>
<p>A fourth piece of imagery: John Lennon, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell each rates his mention.&nbsp; But so does Norman <a title="Jewison" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZFaPezzM4k" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jewison</a>, for his movie <em>Rollerball</em> (since disastrously re-made).&nbsp; It tells of a world where global commerce has become the government, shaping what people are to believe, value and expect.&nbsp; The instrument of control is the game - fast, extreme, where winning and losing has life-and-death significance - and, it seems, is impossible to resist.&nbsp; It seems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>why so much detail?</strong></p>
<p class="text">Is there too much to bother about here?&nbsp; Some say so.&nbsp; But the evidence is that the more ideas we take on board the greater our repertoire for action.&nbsp; Complexity is not necessarily the problem, in some form it's necessary to the solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is certainly much more going on in teaching-and-learning than is immediately obvious.&nbsp; Anyone who wants not to be bothered by complexity should stay away from curriculum.</p>
<p class="text">The task of reform is, then, demanding.&nbsp; A sane understand must explain uncomfortable causes-and- effects if we are effectively to deal with crises concerning our economy, technology and security.&nbsp; What we do about education is doubly important: for how educators help students now, and for how students go on learning - life-wide and life-long.</p>
<p class="text">The enemy of all this is not &lsquo;what-if&rsquo; thinking.&nbsp; The biggest danger is &lsquo;if-only&rsquo; thinking.&nbsp; I doubt that there has been a reform movement that has not been colonised by such single-minded claims...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>if only we could get back to... - if only they had more... - if only somebody would...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">It&rsquo;s people zeroing-in on the opportunity to get their idea, or interest, or programme on-board.&nbsp; The argument is, often enough, that...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>there&rsquo;s no need to start again, we know what we need to do</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">But we don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Education is in unprecedented crisis.&nbsp; The economic, technological and cultural trends move at an accelerating rate, and on a global scale.&nbsp; They are invading &nbsp;students, their helpers and their communities with what are, at times, unmanageable demands. &nbsp;We may not be able start again, but we are able to imagine - and to imagine what it would be like to start from scratch...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>knowing what we know about how things are - and if we were building a new education service - what would we build in?</em></p>

<p class="text">This is not colonising the action with ready-made proposals.&nbsp; But neither is it discarding all the proposals that are within reach.&nbsp; If we can agree about what&rsquo;s going on, in all its complexity, then we can trawl proposals that can be adapted to those needs.&nbsp; And the more we&rsquo;ve got to go on, the better.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">This innovative strategy does not start with provision but with need.&nbsp; The perspectives which inform the process are not from institutions but from more widely-rooted stakeholders.&nbsp; It is, then, a process of letting go and holding on.&nbsp; It discards what is no longer appropriate, useful or tenable.&nbsp; And it turns to what is.&nbsp; This is what needs mind-boggling imagination, enables learning-for-living usefulness, and calls on root-and-branch innovation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve framed the issues outside dominant interests.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s why you can reframe them.&nbsp; I want you to.&nbsp; There are some issues on which I would be pleased to be proved wrong.</p>
<p>I'll follow this up shortly, with the ideas, argument and evidence that inform what I've set out above.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m collating it now, and a link will appear here.&nbsp; It will go into detail on both...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>what does education get from politics?<br /></strong>and<br /><strong>what does education need from politics?</strong></p>
<p class="text">It will cover...</p>
<ul>
<li>what's to be done about competitiveness - commerce - fragmentation - blame - values - infantilism - exclusion - fear-and-hope</li>
<li>how educators can be ready - getting results - working with stakeholders - re-structuring activity</li>
<li>what politics can do in localities - seizing opportunities - re-connecting to localities - facing complexities - becoming authentic - being fair - acknowledging failure - re-thinking bases - offering leadership</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people have a taste for dystopian narratives, such as <em>Brave New World</em>, <em>1984</em> and <em>Rollerball</em> - and there are plenty more.&nbsp; The best of these bad-news stories are not mere frighteners, to send us behind some sociological sofa.&nbsp; Their imagery takes us to another place, where we can recognise warnings concerning our own society.&nbsp; A well-written dystopia is for grown-ups - however old or young they may be.&nbsp; Grown-ups are people who can figure out how to make good use of bad news.</p>
<p>This is a website about innovation.&nbsp; And this blog claims that UK education is facing as critical a challenge to innovation as it has ever faced.&nbsp; How do we make good use of that bad news? - contribute to the on-line discussion below, or by e-mailing <a href="mailto:bill@hihohiho.com" rel="nofollow">Bill</a>...</p>
