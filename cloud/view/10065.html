<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[Peter Horrocks; University World News; Will Woods; Wonkhe; The Telegraph; BBC]</em></p>
<p>Cameron?&nbsp; Who was he?&nbsp; Theresa May has merged DBIS with DECC to create the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, led by former Universities Minister Greg Clark.&nbsp; This new department will have responsibility for research and science whilst <a href="http://wonkhe.com/blogs/higher-education-in-the-new-government/" rel="nofollow">universities move to the Department for Education</a>, led by former International Development Secretary, Justine Greening.&nbsp; The government says that &ldquo;The Department for Education will take on responsibility for Higher and Further Education policy, apprenticeships and wider skills policy from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.&nbsp; Bringing these responsibilities together will mean that the Government can take a comprehensive, end-to-end view of skills and education, supporting people from early years through to postgraduate study and work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jo Johnson becomes joint Minister of State at the Department for Education and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, leading on universities and science.&nbsp; The Higher Education and Research Bill is due its second reading next Tuesday next week, but now under the joint ownership of those two departments rather than one.</p>
<p>Jo Johnson has announced plans to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/armed-forces-personnel-and-families-to-be-given-extra-support-to-learn-overseas" rel="nofollow">change student funding rules to benefit more armed forces personnel</a> and their families who want to take up distance learning courses while posted abroad.&nbsp; Under current rules, a prospective student must be resident in the UK on the first day of the first academic year of their course if they are to be eligible for a student loan.</p>
<p>Peter Horrocks writes on the THE blog about <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/brexit-vote-highlights-the-importance-of-flexible-learning" rel="nofollow">the importance of flexible learning</a> in a post-Brexit Britain if we are to break the consequences of poor educational outcomes &agrave; low skills &agrave; low-income on social division in our communities.</p>
<p>Anne Corbett considers <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160705101034144" rel="nofollow">the future for universities in a post-Brexit world</a>, given that EU nationals make up around 5.5% of the student body and around 15% of academic staff, and that the EU is responsible for somewhere between 14% and 19% of university income.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Hanneke Teekens presents <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160701142404205" rel="nofollow">a view from across the channel</a>.</p>
<p>The Open University has been ranked equal 47<sup>th</sup> out of 78 UK universities in last month&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities-in-the-united-kingdom" rel="nofollow">THE World University Rankings</a>.&nbsp; However, the OU fared better in last November&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/news/best-uk-universities-chosen-major-employers" rel="nofollow">Global Employability University Survey</a>, when it was ranked 13<sup>th</sup> of all UK HEIs by UK companies for producing the best 'ready-for-work' graduates.&nbsp; Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial took the top three positions in both tables although, in a different ranking based just on <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/06/23/elite-universities-tumble-down-teaching-excellence-ranking/" rel="nofollow">teaching quality</a>, institutions which normally fare well appeared further down the tables, with Oxford University in 28<sup>th</sup> place and Imperial 37<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>How this will fare after the Whitehall deckchair rearranging, we don&rsquo;t know, but BIS&rsquo;s just-released >Post-16 Skills Plan</a> accepts the recommendations of the Independent Review of Technical Education in its entirety.&nbsp; The headline recommendation of introducing a choice between academic and technical pathways at 16 is significantly more flexible than it appears at first sight and, while learners will not be able to &lsquo;mix and match&rsquo; academic and vocational qualifications at the same time, learners who have taken the technical route and wish to go to university will be able to do so by taking a &lsquo;bridging&rsquo; course such as a Higher Education Diploma or a Foundation course. &nbsp;On the flipside, it wants to create an appealing form of bridging provision for students who take A-levels but do not wish to progress to university.&nbsp; Nearly a quarter of all higher education acceptances in 2015 had studied a vocational qualification alongside or instead of A-levels</p>
<p>The QAA has told the University of Oxford to address significant concerns from undergraduates concerning <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/06/15/oxford-students-complain-about-excessive-and-uneven-workloads/" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;excessive&rdquo; and uneven workloads at the institution</a>, following fears that academic rigour is being lost.&nbsp; College tutors are expected to use their discretion when deciding how much written work should be set and how many seminars should be attended, but students report &ldquo;little parity across the colleges&rdquo;, with some students working in excess of 50 or 60 hours a week and becoming &ldquo;essay machines&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Recent research looked at how <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01587919.2016.1184400" rel="nofollow">learner engagement in MOOCs</a> might be improved by considering three pedagogical aspects: teacher presence, social learning, and peer learning.&nbsp; The study was based on participants in two FutureLearn MOOCs, each of which presented twice in 2015.&nbsp; There are some insightful student quotes (on peer assessment: &ldquo;the reviewer of my assignment was totally distracted by his own verbosity and seems to have been looking for some extra space to write another essay of his own.&nbsp; Not once was anything I wrote even referred to&rdquo;) and good evidence of behaviours and preferences.&nbsp; The researchers conclude that: &ldquo;Most visible in our study is a comparatively small core group of learners who actively and deeply participated in all these sharing practices; their behaviour enabled vicarious learning and enhanced the entire learning experience for the broader community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a position paper published by EURODL, the authors explore >possible business models for MOOCs</a>, including: the Freemium model, sponsorships, initiatives and grants, donations, merchandise, the sale of supplementary material, selective advertising, data-sharing, follow-on events, and revenue from referrals. &nbsp;There is a helpful SWOT analysis (Table 1); the authors note that paid-for certification is the predominant income generator but they stop short of recommending any specific alternatives.</p>

<p><strong>Students Shaping the Future of Technology-Enabled Learning </strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>More mature students seeking flexible learning options with varied routes to completion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More seniors are seeking opportunities to learn, but not necessarily for credit or credentials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater expectations for the use of technology for learning and for communication and collaboration with instructors and other students</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More students seeking completion of credentials/programmes started elsewhere, requiring assessment and recognition of prior learning, work-based learning agreements, and recognition of foreign credentials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More local and international students selecting a university based on its value proposition when compared to other competing providers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More students seeking programmes that offer specific knowledge and applied workplace skills, as well as generic skills in such as group work, communication, project leadership, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More students seeking shorter micro-credit programmes which are skill-based and work-ready</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yup, that all sounds very familiar.</p>

<p>Only 59% of students at American four-year colleges complete their degree within six years, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.&nbsp; However, a recent suggests that the &ldquo;completion crisis&rdquo; might be fixable through a series of small institutional tweaks.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ideas42.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Nudging-for-Success-ideas42-FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow">Nudging for Success</a> is based on 16 experiments conducted at 13 schools across the US (summarised on pp8/9 of the PDF).&nbsp; Simple interventions such as introductory videos, self-affirming questionnaires, phased reminders about funding to students <em>and</em> parents, improved form design (examples in Appendix), supportive text messages and weekly emails all had varying but positive effects on registrations, drop-outs, loan uptake and deadlines achieved.</p>
