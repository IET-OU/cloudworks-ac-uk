        <p>ARV2011 Alpine Rendezvous</p>
<p>Research Strand led by Professor Mike Sharples.</p>
<div>This is one of four workshop strands that relate to</div>
<p><strong>STELLAR Grand Challenge 2: Orchestrating Learners</strong><br /> Key research questions related to this challenge include:</p>
<ul>
<li> What is the role of the teacher/more knowledgeable other in  orchestrating learning and how does this relate to collaboration and the  knowledge of students? </li>
<li>What is the role of assessment and evaluation in learning and how can technology play a role? </li>
<li>From the point of view of the learner what is the relationship  between higher-order skills and learning of a particular knowledge  domain and what is the role of technology in this respect? </li>
<li>How can we identify the current learning trajectory or a person?  Would it be beneficial to make them aware of trajectory switches? </li>
</ul>    </div>

			<p>Challenge is to find new ways of enacting learning &ndash; ways which change how we do learning. We have new interactions, new connections and new opportunities</p>
<p>Types of learning are not necessarily new - what is new are the contexts for learning, the ways in which learning is enacted.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Some initial ideas for next-generation grand challenges for TEL</p>
<ul>
<li>Fear of maths &ndash; the role of emotions. Wearable technology that provides biofeedback on fear and stress that helps you to modulate your response. Supporting learning to learn. But stress can sometimes be an aid to learning.</li>
<li>How to create a culture of design. Mobile learning. Augmented reality. Problem of getting people to want to create something outside what is delivered to them. The culture of design and meta-design</li>
<li>How can we design environments in which people want to learn, rather than have to learn. The role of motives and purpose. Learners always have a motive &ndash; something they want to achieve. Need to understand their purpose and what they want to achieve. Social expectations. Maintaining interest and not losing it.</li>
<li>Create a socially TEL environment that helps generate and execute socially and personally meaningful learning goals&hellip; Why don&rsquo;t we harness the skills and competencies that learners have and help them to pull it into learning goals and assessment criteria, where does this leave the educator, where will the teacher be? People do things and make sense of their environment.</li>
<li>Embrace the idea of a universal protocol for design. Augmented reality &ndash; embrace that. Expanding on the notion of education for all. A protocol that would harness all that.</li>
<li>How can we support learners by providing systems that give them feedback, support and guidance on the quality of their research and learning interactions?</li>
</ul>

			<p>Proposed grand challenges for TEL:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you create platforms that are open, dynamic, malleable and live, which allow people to engage with these representations [of the learning design process] and the processes that they support?</li>
<li>Can we design technology to harness the power of emotions for learning?</li>

			<h2>New Grand Challenges:</h2>
<p>Mike Sharples group started with a proto-challenge from Gill. How can you design wearable technology that could provide bio-feedback on emotions to enable people to learn. Example &ndash; child who has a fear of learning maths.</p>
<p>What else could you do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data capture to capture events that are causing stress or fear to design a better curriculum</li>
<li>Recreating emotions in a different setting. Could you develop technology to enable people to replay emotion of having a maths lesson to be able to reflect on that lesson in a more constructive way.</li>
<li>In a group session, how could technology respond. Maybe arm band that would glow if you were experiencing emotions in a particular way so you could reflect on your own learning, and on those of others in the classroom (with armbands) in a productive way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ethical issues are of prime importance here. What are the ethics of revealing people emotions more visible or transparent. Is it ethically appropriate to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a technical grand challenge, is it an ethical grand challenge.</p>
<h3>New Grand Challenge</h3>
<p>Designing technology to harness the power of emotions for learning.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<h2>New Grand Challenges:</h2>
<p>Top-down epistomological approach.</p>
<ol>
<li>Modelling &ndash; the current situation. how people learn, pedagogical modelling, where task model comes in as a component. Identify targets, places where you want to effect change. </li>
<li>Generate multiple scenarios of how you might effect that change. Scenarios informed by the relevant theories. eg technologies informed by theories of HCI.</li>
<li>Evaluate and feedback into the model and go back to next loop of this design cycle.</li>
</ol>
<p>One idealised hypothetical model. But who is the designer?</p>
<h3>Grand Challenge</h3>
<p>How to make this model accessible to the wider audience. Coming up with a system that is open, dynamic, malleable, alive representation of design knowledge and support design processes. That allowing people to engage at different levels with the representations that these support &ndash; as users of design products, or critiques. Or engaging with these materials to support their own projects.&nbsp;</p>			<div class="posted-by">
