<p class="qote" style="padding-left: 210px;"><em>for the times they are a-changin&rsquo;</em></p>
<p class="main" align="right"><a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-times-they-are-achangin-lyrics-bob-dylan.html" rel="nofollow">Bob Dylan</a></p>
<p class="main">This is not about acoustic and electric guitars.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more important even than that.&nbsp; This is about change - from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; And the times they are a-changin&rsquo; alright, but more than Bob knew.&nbsp; More than anybody could know.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">He held out hope for a generation; but no generation gets the last word on anything.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s little consensus on what anybody can do about what's happening.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy enough to trot out vague promises - &lsquo;more choice&rsquo; is popular, &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo; might get applause, and &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; a murmur of approval.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re pretty fluffy concepts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m suggesting that they camouflage more than they illuminate.</p>
<p class="main">I&rsquo;m thinking about the way influence is exerted, how it fragments societies, whether myths can easily posture&nbsp; as reality, why there are so few whistle blowers, and the risk all of this poses for us all.&nbsp; Growing fear needs transposing into sustainable hope.&nbsp; Educators are in no position to fix that; this is about how students will figure it for themselves.&nbsp; But this is pragmatic, it signposts what can help.</p>
<p class="main">It is a companion piece to an earlier blog - &lsquo;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8466" rel="nofollow">what education gets from politics</a>&rsquo;.&nbsp; If it feels a bit scowling-grumpy, ask yourself whether we've passed the limits of what smiley-nice can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">It's addressed to education&rsquo;s stakeholders.&nbsp; These are the families, educators, voluntary groups and social enterprises concerned for what students can gain from education.&nbsp; It signposts useful ideas, arguments and evidence.&nbsp; Each source is followed by an item for a stakeholder agenda.&nbsp; Education doesn&rsquo;t need shareholders looking for a pay-off, it needs stakeholders probing who is getting what out of education, and whether its stakeholders need to do something about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff here, because there&rsquo;s a lot going on.&nbsp; It may be best to start from the signposts which point to your work now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll update the list as things change - and they will.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll also open up other areas of enquiry.&nbsp; You can track this, and other news, by dropping in on <a title="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/billaw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">my Twitter page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub">I don&rsquo;t want to be unfair to Bob Dylan - I don&rsquo;t dare.&nbsp; But the issues are too troublesome for uplifting inspiration.&nbsp; The point is this: stakeholders need students to get more from education than they&rsquo;ve so-far been in a position to realise.&nbsp; Boundaries need to be pushed.</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on influence</strong></p>
<p class="text">Should the wishes of the rich-and-powerful prevail?&nbsp; Are the people who most need help least likely to get it?&nbsp; Should we be surprised that there is little resistance?&nbsp; Is there damage that is not being openly confronted?&nbsp; And, if any of this is so, how does education resist being bounced into compliance with it?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s evidence on all of this, showing the interplay between politics and commerce - and its consequences for how we live together.&nbsp; Or don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p class="stake" style="padding-left: 30px;">stakeholder interests are integral to Sure-start, part of long-standing thinking that local links are vital to any complete education</p>

<p class="stake" style="padding-left: 30px;">what is hidden by government can be exposed by stakeholder groups, and be fed into nationwide action locality-by-locality</p>

<p class="stake" style="padding-left: 30px;">stakeholders can find local mandates for disentangling themselves from what any central influences seek harmfully to impose</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on fragmentation</strong></p>
<p class="intro">'Fragmentation' might be another take on 'a broken society'.&nbsp; It offers another way into asking where are the cracks and fissures?&nbsp; How are they formed?&nbsp; By whom?&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Some of that break-up is being phrased as between &lsquo;strivers&rsquo; and &lsquo;slackers&rsquo;.&nbsp; But perhaps it&rsquo;s more useful to talk in terms of &lsquo;predators&rsquo; and &lsquo;prey&rsquo;?</p>
<ul>

<p class="text"><a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/fractured-times-culture-and-society-in-the-20th-century-by-eric-hobsbawm/2003027.article" rel="nofollow">Fractured Times</a> - distinguished professorial historian&rsquo;s long view of the education-related origins of fragmentation - it finds them in the rejection of the credibility of a bourgeois &eacute;lite, in a science and technology providing new ways of learning and earning, and in the emergence of a consumer society in which the citizen become a customer - the trends consign all to what sociology once referred to as &lsquo;the lonely crowd&rsquo;</p>
<p class="stake" style="padding-left: 30px;">stakeholders can find that, although not patriotically favoured by neo-lib policy, all &lsquo;academic learning&rsquo; can be the stuff of &lsquo;learning-for-living&rsquo;</p>

<p class="text" style="padding-left: 30px;">stakeholders and educators need action for students who find the 'promise' of competitive education for career success as just not believable</p>

<p class="stake" style="padding-left: 30px;">students and educators can work on what people they know and trust do to make career management so fearful or more hopeful</p>

<p class="intro">Talk of parasite-people selfishly avoiding work, generation-on-generation, is an issue for education.&nbsp; Whatever beliefs, values and expectations such behaviour would amount to a counter culture.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s not hard to provoke into hostility members of a mainstream culture thinking of themselves as deserving.&nbsp; Where a government goes that way people may be pre-disposed to believe it, and even welcome the role of abused hero.&nbsp; There are always counter cultures - the super-rich cultivate one.&nbsp; But suppose there are not enough parasite people to form a culture - not even among migrant families?&nbsp; Could, then, a wound-up mainstream hostility be unwound?&nbsp; Do people unlearn what they think they know?&nbsp; Little can so seriously damage the relationship between education and the cultures it inhabits than a deceitful government.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on simplicity</strong></p>
<p class="intro">Is anything ever, as the clich&eacute; claims, &lsquo;as simple as that&rsquo;?&nbsp; Education is working with local, domestic and global influences.&nbsp; Social, cultural, economic and technological forces are at work.&nbsp; Their interaction is always layered, often volatile, and sometimes unpredictable - the world &lsquo;chaotic&rsquo; crops up.&nbsp; But people know about chaos, what they need to find is meaning in confusion and purpose in response.&nbsp; Any failure to take on this complexity risks losing touch with students.&nbsp; And that failure leaves education vulnerable to dominant interest-groups, with other agendas.&nbsp; There are branches of education close to such collapse.&nbsp; No informed educator can accept the prospect of entrapping students in any such simple-mindedness.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="stake" style="padding-left: 30px;">students and educators can work together on how simplicity persuades, but asking for how long? and with what consequences?</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on risk</strong></p>
<p class="intro">Social, economic and planetary change focus attention on risk - asking what can go wrong?, how likely is it? and how bad would that be?&nbsp; Risk is unavoidably a feature of how people incorporate education into their lives - asking &lsquo;what is education for?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what good is it?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;what can I expect from it?&rsquo;.&nbsp; The answers are different for different groups.&nbsp; For some expectations are more likely to be met.&nbsp; For some making a mistake would have more serious consequences.&nbsp; How is this to be managed by policy, by expertise, and by people who have learned to act for themselves.&nbsp; Few current proposals have much to say about the enormity of the risk that contemporary society faces, or about the urgency with which education needs to be engaged.</p>

<p class="stake" style="padding-left: 30px;">stakeholder voice expresses risk that is institutionally imposed on gender, sexual preference, disability and poverty, not all of this is about class</p>

<p class="stake" style="padding-left: 30px;">a complication for stakeholder voice is that geographically up-close groups can easily conflict, if they inhabit separated social enclaves</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on fear-and-hope</strong></p>
<p class="intro">An informal but prevalent script for learning is "tell 'em, and then they&rsquo;ll know".&nbsp; It&rsquo;s implicit in media claims about what teachers should do on issues ranging from love-life to bullying.&nbsp; A more sophisticated script is that education should pass on to each new generation &lsquo;the best that has been thought and said&rsquo;.&nbsp; And that view sees students as vessels waiting to be filled with golden wonders.&nbsp; The trouble with both theories is that students come to educators already full of learning.&nbsp; It is experience-based learning, and experience can be a convincing teacher.&nbsp; So whatever is taught must find a place, if it can, among what is already believed.&nbsp; And whatever comes out of that mix will not correspond with what the media or the &eacute;lite think desirable - never exactly, sometimes not at all.&nbsp; Learning is a back-and-forth process: educators wondering what students are taking from it, students wondering what it has to do with them.&nbsp; The only sense that matters is the sense that students make of it: &lsquo;what&rsquo;s going on and what can I do about it?&rsquo;, &lsquo;is this good for me, or bad?&rsquo;, &lsquo;do I approach, or avoid?&rsquo;, &lsquo;must I fear, or can I hope?&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 210px;">________________________________</p>
<p>There is a salutary tale here.&nbsp; It concerns an aspect of education fully enmeshed in these issues.&nbsp; Careers work is about who gets to do what in society.&nbsp; It has a century of research-and-development to draw on.&nbsp; It assiduously canvasses policy support.&nbsp; The commercial world can be counted on to take an interest.&nbsp; It has had some kind of representation in most education settings.&nbsp; Yet it is struggling to secure its own future.&nbsp; What went wrong?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible that it defended a past rather than reaching for a future?&nbsp; That would explain why it ran out of recognisably useful things to say.&nbsp; That retro-thinking was framed by a psychologically-understood individualism, linked to economically-understood opportunity.&nbsp; Such simplicity was, for a time, convenient to both commerce and politics.&nbsp; But it has little place in a privatised, digitised and globalised world.&nbsp; And it has no room for the social-and-cultural complexities of a fragmented, polarised and damaged social world.&nbsp; It has produced not so much inspiration as desperation - and the confusion seems to have taken refuge in what is called &lsquo;career-chaos theory&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But students don&rsquo;t need to be told about chaos.&nbsp; It they are to find meaning and purpose in confusion, it will need more time and space where students can learn about what&rsquo;s going on, and how they can&nbsp; make sense of it.&nbsp; Little of that can be done in hit-and-run careers interviews.&nbsp; This is not to say that face-to-face help is not necessary, but it is to say that it is not sufficient.&nbsp; Careers work has never found the need to draw on the full range of processes available to a well-constructed curriculum.&nbsp; It needs to do that now.&nbsp; The whole of what is set out here need the full scope of a curriculum designed to deliver learning for living,</p>
<p>This website is about innovation.&nbsp; And innovation means the 'creative destruction' of what can no-longer help.&nbsp; Should that be a lesson to us all?</p>
