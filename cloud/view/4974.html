<p><strong>2010 State of the (US) Industry Report</strong></p>
<p><em>[ASTD]</em></p>
<p>ASTD&rsquo;s 2010 state of the learning and development industry report has been released and, whilst the full version will cost you $500, there is a <a href="http://www.astd.org/TD/Archives/2010/Nov/Free/1110_2010+State+of+the+Industry.htm" rel="nofollow">free synopsis</a>.&nbsp; ASTD reports continued growth despite the recession, with annual spend per head rising slightly from $1,068 (2008) to $1,081 (2009).&nbsp; Average cost per learning and development hour rose from $52 to $63 because the US workforce has shrunk while investment remained fairly static.&nbsp; 36.5% of learning is delivered/facilitated electronically and about three quarters of this happens online.&nbsp; &lsquo;Reuse&rsquo; has improved with, on average, each hour of learning content being used 59.5 times (versus 44.8 in pre-recession 2007).</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>2010 (UK) Learning Technology Benchmark</strong></p>
<p><em>[Towards Maturity]</em></p>
<p>Towards Maturity has published its fourth <a href="http://www.towardsmaturity.org/article/2010/06/02/towards-maturity-2010-learning-technology-benchmar/" rel="nofollow">Learning Technology Benchmark survey</a> which, this year, features input from 400 organisations (35% public sector).&nbsp; The survey examines what successful organisations are doing to deliver business results with learning technologies and what others can learn from them.&nbsp; It finds that, amongst the top quartile, 76% of staff are using e-learning and, compared with conventional methods, e-learning is saving these organisations 21% in costs, 27% in study time and moving from idea/need to delivery 32% faster.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Pearson to Offer Degrees?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Pearson, which already owns exam board Edexcel, hopes to be given degree-awarding powers.&nbsp; Universities Minister David Willetts has made no secret of his intentions to open up the university sector to more private providers, and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11990787" rel="nofollow">Pearson plans to offer degree courses</a> in business, engineering, IT and health and social care to begin with, at &ldquo;very competitive&rdquo; prices; it is also considering offering degrees in nursing, education and hospitality and tourism.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>How Does Phoenix Measure Up?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Tony Bates unpicks <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2011/01/02/how-does-the-university-of-phoenix-measure-up/" rel="nofollow">Phoenix&rsquo;s 2010 annual report</a> and, whilst he can&rsquo;t fault their profitability ($1.04bn pre-tax in 2009) or the opportunities provided for disadvantaged minorities, he is less impressed by some pedagogic aspects.&nbsp; He contends that &ldquo;prejudices against the University of Phoenix are misplaced&rdquo; but concludes, &ldquo;Overall, I would give the University of Phoenix a C+.&nbsp; It meets a real need, and sets and achieves realistic academic goals for the students it attracts, as far as it goes.&nbsp; However, it does not succeed in giving the majority of students who enrol what they are seeking, a degree in a reasonable amount of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>PwC Open University Unveils Free Learning Material</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) has unveiled its own <a href="http://www.pwc.com/us/en/open-university/topic.jhtml" rel="nofollow">free online university</a> covering topics related to business, finance, healthcare and technology.&nbsp; The site is in its infancy and some topics contain only a single &lsquo;course&rsquo; with limited supporting material, but Stephen speculates that the UK HE funding situation may mean a PwC-branded MBA is not too far fetched.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Social Tools</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; James Davies; eLearn Magazine; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Richard Byrne has compiled a free 83-page online book of <a href="http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2010/12/super-book-of-web-tools-for-educators.html" rel="nofollow">tools for educators</a>, with descriptions of each and suggestions on how to use them.&nbsp; It has quite a schools bias but there are still plenty of useful lessons and links.</p>
<p>I mentioned the latest Pew Internet report on online activity last month, but Mashable presents a useful <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/12/16/generations-internet-infographic/" rel="nofollow">infographic showing how activity varies with age group</a>.&nbsp; Virtual worlds sit firmly in last place, with less than 9% of any age group participating, followed by blog publishing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the University of Minnesota&rsquo;s Michelle Everson thinks <a href="http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=opinion&article=156-1" rel="nofollow">all educators should consider blogging</a> - partly to record what worked and what didn&rsquo;t and also to form new professional relationships through the comments.</p>
<p>Whilst there is still no official Facebook app for the iPad, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/02/facebook-ipad-facepad" rel="nofollow">Facepad</a> app has just been released which includes some useful Twitter-like functionality.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Shy Students Using Facebook Have Better Quality Friendships</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS; OU Life]</em></p>
<p>There is speculation about the effectiveness of collaborative activities for shy students.&nbsp; To test this, Marquette University&rsquo;s <a href="http://spr.sagepub.com/content/27/7/873" rel="nofollow">Levi Baker and Debra Oswald</a> surveyed 207 undergrads about their shyness, Facebook usage and the quality of their friendships.&nbsp; They found that, among more shy students, greater use of Facebook was associated with feeling closer to and more satisfied with friends and feelings of a greater sense of social support.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our findings refute warnings that computer-mediated communication use might cause shy individuals to become even more socially withdrawn and isolated,&rdquo; the researchers said.</p>
<p>The OU ranks third in an evaluation of nearly 2,000 European universities employing social media recently published by <a href="http://www.scienceguide.nl/201012/top-10-of-social-media-in-he.aspx" rel="nofollow">ScienceGuide</a>, a Dutch news portal for research and HE.&nbsp; According to ScienceGuide, the OU has 8,700 Twitter followers and 35,000 Facebook members; more than 60% of all university Twitter followers are connected to UK institutions. They also account for 42.4 per cent of all Facebook members.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Students&rsquo; Web Use</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jakob Nielsen]</em></p>
<p>The Nielsen Norman Group conducted observational research with 43 students in 4 countries (Australia, Germany, UK and USA) to investigate <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/students.html" rel="nofollow">web site preferences and behaviour</a>.&nbsp; He found that students are multi-taskers who move through websites rapidly, often missing the item they come to find.&nbsp; They're enraptured by social media but reserve it for private conversations rather than studying or seeking corporate information.&nbsp; He also comments on two myths: firstly, students <strong>are</strong> comfortable with technology but that does <strong>not</strong> mean they are technical experts; and they <strong>do</strong> appreciate multimedia but they <strong>don't</strong> want to be blasted with motion and audio at all times.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Tablets and Digital Textbooks</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; NetworkWorld; JE]</em></p>
<p>This quite long post on the <a href="http://blog.xplana.com/2011/01/tablets-are-the-new-black-for-digital-textbooks/" rel="nofollow">Xplana blog</a> covers a lot of ground, including predictions of an explosion in tablet use by students (and a forecast graphic from Forrester Research), design issues and implications of the open source and rental e-textbook market.</p>
<p>Tablets were also hot news at last week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/011011-ces-2011-in-summary-all.html" rel="nofollow">CES</a> in Las Vegas, with around 80 announcements of new devices &ndash; featuring a range of operating systems (including the latest Android 3.0 &lsquo;Honeycomb&rsquo;), screen sizes, resolutions and features such as hi-res cameras, slide out keyboards and docking methods.&nbsp; In contrast, the world of netbooks, notebooks and desktops was notable by the thin layer of dust and occasional tumbleweed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a book is worth reading, it&rsquo;s worth discussing.&nbsp; Copia is the place to do both.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.thecopia.com/home/index.html" rel="nofollow">Copia</a> allows users to browse and buy eBooks, then discuss them online with others.&nbsp; Creating a free account gives access to 7 eBooks, plus downloadable readers for PC, Mac and iPad.</p>

<p><strong>I Think, Therefore iPod</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>John Searle is well known in philosophy circles, having been teaching the subject since 1959.&nbsp; Now, those nice folks at Berkeley have recorded three of Searle&rsquo;s courses &ndash; <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2010/12/philosophy_with_john_searle_three_free_courses.html" rel="nofollow">the philosophies of language, mind and society</a> &ndash; and made them available online.&nbsp; They join a host of other materials, including over <a href="http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses" rel="nofollow">250 free online courses</a> on the Open Culture site.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Detailed Space Shuttle Launch Video</strong></p>
<p><em>[Engadget]</em></p>
<p>NASA has released detailed slow-motion footage of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/12/nasas-space-shuttle-launch-videos-are-spectacularly-incredible/" rel="nofollow">space shuttle launches</a> with commentary from space programme experts. &nbsp;If you fancy seeing 45 mins worth of 1,000 gallons of fuel per second being burned from a gazillion different camera angles, this could be your lucky day.</p>
<p>The NASA site also contains an excellent <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/iotd.html" rel="nofollow">multimedia library</a> which includes videos, 3D models, podcasts and an image-of-the-day.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>iPhone App Translates Text in Images</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/world-lens-translates-words-inside-of-images-yes-really" rel="nofollow">Word Lens</a> is an iPhone app that can translate text in images from English to Spanish and vice versa.&nbsp; The $4.99 app uses OCR and, whilst not perfect, it performs reasonable word-for-word translation of signage, menus, etc.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Harder-to-Read Fonts Boost Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS]</em></p>
<p>Cutting across many investigations into the most readable fonts for onscreen learning comes research from Connor Diemand-Yauman and colleagues which suggests that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2010.09.012" rel="nofollow">awkward to read fonts encourage deeper processing of material</a>.&nbsp; 28 participants (aged 18 to 40) studied material in Arial, Comic and Bodoni, with the latter fonts yielding recall test scores around 15 percentage points higher than Arial.&nbsp; A second study with 220 Ohio high school pupils used fonts such as Comic, Haettenschweiler and Monotype Corsiva (plus handwritten notes that had been blurred by shaking in a photocopier) and these again yielded higher scores than plain fonts.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Learning and Forgetting</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Will Thalheimer has tried to unpick some of the myths surrounding <a href="http://willthalheimer.typepad.com/files/how-much-do-people-forget-v12-14-2010.pdf" rel="nofollow">remembering and forgetting</a>.&nbsp; He examined 14 previous studies dating back to 1917 and found the outcomes to be inconclusive in terms of defining any form of X% rule.&nbsp; However, there was strong evidence to suggest that methods of teaching and learning (structure, relevance, pace, clarity, reinforcement, etc) do have a positive effect on longer-term remembering.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>How Long Does it Take to Create eLearning?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Clive Shepherd]</em></p>
<p>Right up there with &lsquo;how quickly do people forget?&rsquo; comes &lsquo;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bchapman_utah/how-long-does-it-take-to-create-learning" rel="nofollow">how long does it take to develop e-learning?</a>&rsquo;.&nbsp; Bryan Chapman wanted answers so he asked 249 organisations with in-house development capability (6% H.E.) and gathered a surprising amount of detail.&nbsp; An average 1hr unit comprising simple content and questions typically took 79hrs to design, develop and test at an in-house cost of around $10,000.&nbsp; Greater interactivity and multimedia took this to 184hrs ($18k) whilst simulation and gaming was close to 500hrs ($50k).</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Crafting e-Curriculum That Inspires</strong></p>
<p><em>[JE]</em></p>
<p>Education Week has published the third in a series of reports on e-learning.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/collections/e-learning-2011-winter/index.html" rel="nofollow">Crafting e-Curriculum That Inspires</a> examines how US K-12 schools are working to create digital curricula and online courses, looking particularly at common-core academic standards, teaching social skills to virtual school students, blended learning and the evolving role of e-assessment.</p>

<p><strong>CETIS OERTIG</strong></p>
<p><em>[Chris Pegler; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>CETIS are establishing an <a href="http://blogs.cetis.ac.uk/lmc/2011/01/06/jisc-cetis-oer-technical-interest-group/" rel="nofollow">OER Technical Interest Group</a> to provide a forum to explore a wide range of technical issues relating to the creation, description, dissemination, aggregation, discovery, use and tracking of open educational resources.&nbsp; In addition, the group will help to surface and identify current and best practice in these areas.&nbsp; The new group is planning a number of events and initiatives, including an OER hackday, run in collaboration with UKOLN&rsquo;s DevCSI initiative on the 31 Mar/1 Apr at Manchester Conference Centre.</p>
<p>The Jan edition of University of Ontario Institute of Technology&rsquo;s online <a href="http://www.uoit.ca/teachingandlearning/contact/jan11/jan11.html" rel="nofollow">Contact</a> magazine is devoted to Open Courses.&nbsp; And eFront&rsquo;s Christopher Pappas lists his <a href="http://blog.efrontlearning.net/2011/01/top-10-open-source-e-learning-projects.html" rel="nofollow">Top 10 Open Source e-Learning Projects to Watch for 2011</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Nature Launches Open-Access Journal</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>The Nature Publishing Group is launching <a href="http://www.nature.com/srep/marketing/index.html" rel="nofollow">Scientific Reports</a>, an online open access journal covering biology, chemistry, physics and earth sciences.&nbsp; Like the Public Library of Science's PLoS ONE journal, Scientific Reports will be entirely open access and will publish every submission deemed by a rapid peer-review process to be technologically sound - including those reporting useful negative results.&nbsp; The importance of articles will be left to readers to judge via comments and metrics such as how often papers are downloaded, emailed and blogged about.&nbsp; Review, production and hosting costs are recovered via an article-processing charge (APC), currently set at &pound;890 but rising to &pound;1100 next year.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/who-owns-your-digital-downloads-hint-its-not-you/2831?tag=nl.e539" rel="nofollow">Ed Bott</a> compares ownership rights of physical CDs and books versus digital downloads from iTunes and Amazon.&nbsp; Buried within those online terms and conditions that we all accept are clauses such as this from Amazon: &ldquo;You do not acquire any ownership rights in the Software or Digital Content as a result of downloading Software or Digital Content&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The Aarhus Social and Health Care College in Denmark is piloting a project called <a href="http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&article=144-1" rel="nofollow">BODYexplorer</a>, a dynamic, interactive, branching program aimed particularly at disadvantaged learners who may be more prone to suffer from lifestyle diseases such as obesity.&nbsp; Learners engage in an exploratory journey in the human body, travelling along the animated body's natural lines of the blood, lymph system, and nervous system, solving problems and challenges &ndash; such as imbalances, symptoms and other variables &ndash; along the way.</p>
