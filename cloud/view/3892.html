        <p>Given the recent reforms - in relation to the regulation of health care professionals, an emphasis on self-care and a significant number of people now using a form of CAM - broadening the extent of research in CAM beyond the issue of efficacy, to explore the wider issues in the complex field of CAM, will support the search for an evidence base for CAM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Research which explores the challenges and expectations experienced by one group of UK Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) practitioners &ndash; Shiatsu &ndash; in relation to healthcare provision in the 21<sup>st</sup> century is therefore not only important, but also timely.</p>    </div>

    
<h2 id="extra-content">Extra content</h2>
    		<div class="extra-content">
			<a name="content-643"></a>
			<p>She is saying she got the spot before lunch &ndash; hopefully she can keep you interested without thinking about lunch.</p>
<p>Her impetus for her research came from her final year of training in Shiatsu (?). She is saying a significant number of people are using Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM).</p>
<p>CAM is referred to a diverse group of health-related therapies and disciplines which are not considered to be part of mainstream medical care (House of Lords, 2000).</p>
<p>Her research questions is situated that 20% of the population use CAM &ndash; it could be an economic force. Tends to be for long term, often stress-related or musculo-skeletal issues. Recent gov&rsquo;t reform to health professionals has implications for CAM in particular CNHC &ndash; i.e. getting some practitioners to register.</p>
<p>A problem with CAM is its scientifcity i.e. ability to show efficacy whether the treatment works or not &ndash; it is often discredited because lacking scientificity.</p>
<p>Quoting some guy called David Peters who suggests turning the research methods upside down and concentrating on individuality (and some other stuff!!)</p>
<p>There is a paucity of research in relation to CAM practitioners &ndash; and needs to go further and research specific CAM</p>
<p>Shiatsu</p>
<ul>
<li>Japanses physiotherapy &ndash; and it treats the whole person. For example won&rsquo;t treat only a stiff shoulder but the whole person.</li>
<li>Shiatsu can be practised under common law &ndash; ie. Anyone can set up and be a shiatsu provided. </li>
<li>About 0.4% of the population uses Shiatsu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Research and Experience</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficult to apply random controlled environments &ndash; i..e can&rsquo;t find a control</li>
<li>Long (2008) looked at a longitudinal study on how people viewed Shiatsu</li>
<li>The quality of the relationship i.e. between the client and the practitioner requires more investigation</li>
</ul>
<p>Her third year project involved talking to other practitioners and highlighted issues such as motivation to practice, such as building confidence, networking, the feel-good factor.</p>
<p>Methodology:</p>
<ul>
<li>She is using a qualitative ethnographic approach. She is not using a positivist approach&nbsp; - and is now going through why.</li>
<li>As a Shiatsu practitioner she would be located herself within the research process &ndash; hence she would have to be reflexive and provide richer data/</li>
<li>She&rsquo;ll be using 15 participants &ndash; the starting point will be a shiatsu practice class. She will be recruited students as well as practitioners who graduated and working towards becoming a member of the Shiatsu Society &ndash; and probably by the Shiatsu e-news.</li>
<li>She&rsquo;ll need to get permission from the HPMEC and hopes to hold face to face conversational interviews as well as diaries and maybe even wikis or blogs. Would also like to observe meetings such as classroom sessions, AGMS</li>
<li>Textual data such as bulletins, publicity data</li>
</ul>
<p>Data analysis would take a long time because of transcribing, creating codes etc. in Nvivo.</p>
<p>Initial research questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Factors influencing individual&rsquo;s decision to train in Shiatsu?</li>
<li>The trajectory of students to practitioners? (and some more)</li>
</ul>
<p>She is arguing that the research is timely in terms of the government&rsquo;s reforms.</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>You described how this is conducted on a futon or the floor. Is this a form of manipulation? What really is Shiatsu?</em></p>
<p>I can but probably by demonstration. It originates in Eastern traditions. For a sore shoulder, you use a mixture of physiotherapy and acupuncture points. People usually feel relaxed and stretched and they feel a sense of letting go.</p>
<p><em>Someone else is recommending to go and try it.</em></p>
<p><em>Someone is recommending looking at someone&rsquo;s thesis on herbalism who looked at practitioners and students in terms of methodology etc.</em></p>
<p>She is saying she has the thesis at the moment.</p>
<p><em>Did you see this in a global sense? Can this be part of the process of professionalization? It does have a status/ respectability.</em></p>
<p>One of the issues is about understanding what we mean by professionalization &ndash; and it very much of maintaining a practice, how you have been trained, the relationship between the client and practitioner. It is something I can&rsquo;t ignore and I&rsquo;ll need to regulate that.</p>
<p><em>CAM is very broad &ndash; I was wondering if you should unhinge it and just focus it on Shiatsu?</em></p>
<p>A very good point &ndash; CAM is just about context-setting.</p>
<p><em>There is a whole literature on professionalization and the person I have found most useful is Abbot (1998) &ndash; I can let you have some of his work.</em></p>			<div class="posted-by">
