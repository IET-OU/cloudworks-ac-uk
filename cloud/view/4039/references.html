        <p>Live blogging, 13:30 - OU conference Day 2</p>
<p><strong>Talk by Doug Clow</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://ispot.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">iSpot  - Your place to share nature</a></strong></p>
<p>Doug starts by saying that (iSpot. org.uk)&nbsp; helps people to identify their  observations of nature. One can take a photo and upload it to the iSpot website,  saying what they think it is (where they saw it etc). If someone thinks it's  something else, they can identify it too. Once&nbsp;the user&nbsp;gets the confirmation of  the identification, then&nbsp;they can learn more about it - in depth information of  other observations people made about the same thing . There is a web page for  every species in iSpto, aggregating all the available content&nbsp; (including  Wikipedia) about the species of the whole world.</p>
<p>At iSpot, after making an identification, the user can see who else agrees  with it. And the individual identifiers are 'ranked' in a reputation system at  the website. Once the user makes an observation and gets feedback,&nbsp;they can  build a portfolio of pictures (as more people agree with your observation) , it  increases&nbsp; their reputation in the website. Observatiosn can be of birds, plants  etc.</p>
<p>Many people who use iSpot also take a short OU course if they wish  (Neighbourhood Nature 5159). This leads to accreditation - it's a 10-point  course. iSpot has a partnership with BBC Radio 4, helping broadcasting the  project and enabling access to 'nature experts' . iSpot is Lottery funded, and  targets under-represented groups.</p>
<p>Users give lots of &nbsp;positive feedback&nbsp;about iSpot - they like the community  of people with knowledge and enthusiasm. People say "I can't go outside now  without 'seeing' things!". 130,000 visits to the site.</p>
<p>A good user story is that a 6-year old girl spotted a moth - Euonymus Leaf  Notcher ( a rare moth in Europe). It was its first observation in the UK. That  discovery was highly publicised in newspapers etc. iSpot counts on  collaborations with a number of specialist societies.</p>
<p>Participatory Learning: research driven by the work on iSpot (Clow,  Makryannis and De Liddo). Participatory Learning is a rich way of using new  online media, Doug argues, as it is in line with&nbsp;the OU mission of inclusive  education.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/fundraising/current-priorities/heat.php" rel="nofollow">HEAT:  Health Education and Training in Africa </a></p>
<p><strong>Talk by Alison Robinson (programme coordinator)</strong></p>
<p>Challenges in Africa:&nbsp; high incidence of maternal and child mortality,</p>
<p>Live blogging, 2pm - Conference Day 2</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS&nbsp;, TB and malaria increasing, critical shortage of health workers,  inadequate facilities and equipment. In Africa there's 900 maternal deaths per  1000,000 births. Africa has 11% of the world's population.</p>
<p>HEAT helps to address critical health workers shortage. The strengths of the  HEAT program are that it delivers significant impact for relatively small  investment, and it has the potential to train hundreds of thousands of health  workers. HEAT materials can be delivered in print, online or disk.</p>
<p>The pilot country of HEAT is Ethiopia. One of the reasons is that all  post-secondary education and training in Ethiopia is taught in English. Total  population is around 81 million, of which 84% live in rural communities. Every  year around 21000 Ethiopian women die due to complication of pregancy or  childbirth. It is a country of contrasts.</p>
<p>The health extension workers in Ethiopia are paid a small salary by the  Ministry of Health.&nbsp; They need to be female, speak local language and basic  English, amongst other things. Health Extension Workers' initial training need  to be upgraded to overcome the deficiencies in their initial training, and also  because the workers are keen to have a career path. The HEAT training is  provided by distance education. Restrictions on classroom capacity and  availability of teachers would take more than 10 years to upgrade 31,000 health  education workers.&nbsp; Distance learning can be completed between 18-24 months.</p>
<p>HEAT will be an online knowledge bank of training materials, both in text and  in multimedia form, delivered as OER . It will also include self-assessment  questions, resources and toolkits with case-studies etc.</p>
<p>HEAT has the support of the Ministries of Health and Education in Ethiopia,  funded by the Allan and Nesta Ferguson Trust. There will be 16 distance  e-learning modules, each one assessed by means of a tutor-marked assignment. The  first 4 out of 16 modules are being prepared and are&nbsp;due for completion be end  of July.</p>
<p>Challenges: some authors are experiencing difficulties in writing in a second  language. They are also leanring the methodology of distance learning.</p>
<p>Alison says that the work in Ethiopia has been enourmously rewarding.</p>
<p>HEAT beyond Ethiopia: all modules will be free to download. Conversations are  taking place to localise the content to Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana and Zambia.&nbsp;  Modules are adaptable also outside Africa.</p>
<p>HEAT vision: to create a consortium of countries and organisatiosn working  together aiming to tackle social inequalities in Africa.</p>

<p>Live blogging, 3:30 pm</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://aisantos.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/600px-wikipedia-logo-svg.png" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://aisantos.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/wikipedia-logo.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img title="wikipedia-logo" src="http://aisantos.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/wikipedia-logo.jpg?w=249" alt="" width="249" height="300" /></a>Openness  in Education: Talk by Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy starts by &nbsp;explaining that&nbsp;at Wikipedia it is not necessarily the case  that anyone can edit everything - there's a specific group of contributors that  edit, monitor and make the content available to the world. He also explains that  there is no relationship between Wikipedia and Wikiversity.</p>
<p>Jimmy discusses a little bit about the history and scale of Wikipedia. It was  ' the great experiment', he says, being the core idea to create a global  encyclopedia supported by volunteers. The vision statement is that every single  person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge .  Wikipedia is&nbsp;defined by Jimmy as &nbsp;"a free and high quality encyclopedia written  by thousands of volunteers in many languages". Neutrality&nbsp;and quality are  extremely important at Wikipedia. He argues that a minimum level of reliability  is necessary for the encyclopedia to be respected and popular. It is managed by  a series of community processes and control. At Wikipedia the idea of neutrality  has been the core : the firm rule is that there's a neutral point of view.  Wikipedia does not take a stand on any controversial issue - the reader is free  to make their own judgement .</p>
<p>What is free access? At Wikipedia it's first freedom of speech. The texts and  the software of Wikipedia are all free. He argues that Wikipedia is not  necessarily the most helpful format of information for the students to learn  with- but everything there can be repurposed in many different ways. Wikipedia  is an encyclopedia, which means that not everything belongs to Wikipedia. IT  offers a summary of the human knowledge with the depth of the material depending  on the subject.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a charity supported by donations, the average size for donation  is about $30 (dollars), but there is obviously big funding coming from the big  players, as Google etc, says Jimmy. The core of the donations however is made by  small donours. Over 275 million people visit Wikipedia every month. Funding at  Wikipedia happens organically, he says, not necessarily 'top-down'.</p>
<p>There's about 100,00 active contributors to Wikipedia,a ll volunteers. The  site is global. There are more than 3 million entries in English, but more than  500 million entries in other languages. There are 308,000+ articles in Chinese  alone, but it's small relative to the number of Chinese speakers that are  online. Wikipedia was banned in China for over 3 years. The Chinese government  has losen up in many ways, and now Wikipedia is generally available in China,  but certain pages are banned (e.g. some things about Tibet, the independence of  Taiwan etc). It's the 53rd most popular website in China. Jimmy says that they  would like to be more popular in China, and that it's fast growing over  there.&nbsp;Wikipedia has caused a cultural impact in China, he argues.</p>
<p>Wikipedia allows for Global content comparisons. In different parts of the  world, certain content can be more or less popular. Ex. 'Sex' is popular in  every language except French and Spanish. There are certain topics that are  equally popular, such as Star Trek and&nbsp;Star Wars...</p>
<p>Question: what's next for Wikipedia? In the short term, Jimmy explains that  the three priorities for them are: 1. quality (in the large languages, e.g.  English, instead of adding more, improving quality), 2. Growth in the developing  world (by running pilot projects ), 3. Usability (the software is not as  user-friendly as they would like it to be).</p>
<p>Question: Many educators are asking students to create Wikipedia pages, what  are your views on that? Answer: sometimes excited, sometimes not as much. It  depends on how the project is structured - quality is needed, and this usually  happens when the students are given appropriate background.</p>
<p>Question: How has been quality control over the years, and how have you dealt  with that? Answer: Several phases related to quality control, the most famous  quality problem beying vandalism.However, this is the problem we have&nbsp;lots  of&nbsp;hands on. Issues of bias for example, related to less popular and  controversial topics (e.g. Palestine, scientology etc). These articles are  closely monitored and are of high quality. More obscure topics (that people do  not care about much), are also problematic, because there are not &nbsp;many people  monitoring them. We are trying to get a system in which we can go through the  less popular topics, and that's a challenge for the future, I think - says  Jimmy.</p>
<p>Question: how is consensus generated? Answer: there's a pretty informal  mechanism to reach consensus, but it's mostly based on the issue of neutrality,  as I mention before. We developed some techniques over the years, as for  example, mentioning many different sides of the same story.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a very innovative way of sharing content, and it was an  insightful talk by Jimmy Wales.</p>    </div>
