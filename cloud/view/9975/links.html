        <p>** Submission deadline was Friday April 8th, 2016 **<br /><br />[download PDF copy of the Call for Papers here]<br /><br />CALRG invites submissions for its 37th annual conference, to be held on 6-8 June 2016 in The Open University&rsquo;s Jennie Lee Building. CALRG&rsquo;s annual conference provides a forum for CALRG members, including staff and research students at the Open University, to present and discuss their research and projects. This year, the first day of the conference, 6th June, will be a FutureLearn Academic Network (FLAN) Day, with the main conference being held on 7/8 June, consisting of academic presentations and posters. More information about the FLAN day and how to present at it will be distributed shortly. On 7/8 June, we welcome presentations on any topic related to CALRG&rsquo;s research areas.<br /><br />The current research themes include (but are not limited to):<br /><br />Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL)<br />Understanding learners&rsquo; interactions and experiences<br />Mobile learning<br />Effective designing for learning and learner experiences<br />Citizen science and public engagement<br />Learning analytics<br />eAssessment<br />Open Educational Resources<br />Contributions are invited in one of three forms:<br />(1) Paper presentations<br />(2) Lightning presentations (with or without an accompanying poster)<br />(3) Posters<br /><br />Information about each track is included below. Please note that you may only present once during the conference:<br /><br />Full presentations: Full presentations are designed for work that is mature or in the final stages of analysis, and will be allotted approx. 25-30 minutes, including 10 minutes for questions and discussion. Presenters are asked to submit an abstract of 250-300 words, which will be included in the conference programme on the CALRG website. Due to the high demand for presentation timeslots, please note that some full presentation submissions may be asked to contribute a lightning presentation instead.<br /><br />Lightning presentations: Lightning presentations are designed for works in progress, projects in their initial stages, and/or early doctoral research with limited results. Presenters in this category will be asked to submit one slide and will have only 3-5 minutes for their presentation. We ask that you submit an abstract of approximately 100 words for a lightning submission, which will be included in the conference programme on the CALRG website. Presenters of lightning talks will also have the option of extending their impact by presenting a poster at the conference.<br /><br />Posters: There will be poster sessions during lunchtimes at the conference, to enable relatively immature or new work to be presented through visual displays. Poster presenters are asked to submit an abstract of approximately 100 words and will need to stand next to their poster and present it during at least one of the days of the conference &ndash; slots will be allocated by the conference organisers. Those who are submitting a lightning presentation abstract will not need to submit a second abstract to participate in the poster session.<br /><br />N.B. OU Poster competition &ndash; we are aware of the clash between the CALRG Conference and the OU Poster Competition on 7 June. Any students affected by the clash will be asked to present their posters on the 8 June rather than 7 June, so it will be possible to attend and present at both events.<br /><br />Submitting an abstract<br />Abstracts for all submission types (full and lightning presentations, and posters) should be submitted online on the EasyChair website. No submissions will be accepted by email. The deadline for abstract submission is midnight GMT, Friday, April 8th 2016. Unfortunately, we are unable to consider late submissions.<br /><br />Doctoral students<br />It is recommended that those in the initial stages of their doctoral research (e.g. PhD, EdD) give a lightning presentation covering their doctoral topic and research questions. Those who are in the mid-to-final stages and would like to share results of pilot or final studies may wish to submit an abstract for a full presentation.<br /><br />Please address all correspondence and enquiries about the CALRG 2016 conference to calrg@open.ac.uk<br /><br />The Twitter hashtag for the conference is #CALRG2016.<br /><br />We hope to see lots of you at the conference and look forward to receiving your submissions.<br />&nbsp;<br />Liz, Rebecca, Jenna, Janesh and Tina</p>    </div>
