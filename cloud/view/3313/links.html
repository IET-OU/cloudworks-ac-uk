			<p>Melissa from OSI leading panel.<br /> <br /> Abel Caine from UNESCO. They convened the group in 2002 that used the term OER first. Susan D'Antoni led this and it remains key part of their agenda. 192 members with aim to help least developed members in particular. Building a platform for their own content classically released as books. Will focus on Journalism educators where they know the material released &nbsp;by UNESCO has been repurposed. Plan to put out spec for a Foss system soon.<br /> <br /> Catherine Ngugi OER Africa working with HE across Africa. Key to success that not seen as a sideline activity must be pat and parcel of Education system. Must address institutional policies: promotion, copyright and remuniration. Look at whether current policies support direction or need adaptation. Identify curricicukum and content gaps - see write up on OER Africa site. Vision is for vibrant and sustainable African education system. OER is a route to contribute.<br /> <br /> David Kernohan of JISC. Leading UKOER programme of 29 projects across institutional, individual and subject. Lots of things happening so did not promote single solution - very diverse HE system. Allowed to develop model, but must work towards sustainable approach of release with matched funding to assist. Brought Senior Management on board. Also focus on release of existing content which meant had to face third party issues. Did not specify metadata, format, promotion of material, business model, location (though must register in JorumOpen). Collecting findings through evaluation synthesis and production of infokit. Launch and end of first round conference on 23rd July.<br /> <br /> Ben Janssen from OUNL netherlands goverment &nbsp;launched WikiWys at end of 2008. Followed on from funding textbooks across all schools, more cost effective to invest in open textbooks. Aim to increase access, effectiveness but also raise skills of educator. WikiWys also collated other digital material to provide a national umbrella for resources. Need to build up profile and get known with initial school focus. Issue of quality addressed by peer review, adoption groups arranged by subject, and cross connect with existing plitforms and systems. Use open source technologies. Support existing communities with aim by end of year to attract 10000 users per week.<br /> <br /> Wayne Mackintosh from OER Foundation aim to foster sustainable open education, through wikieducator and training in OER for all who want it. Oernz established in New Zealand modelled on open source movement need to receive more than give. Using wikieducator platform to provide free training with monthly training sessions and teacher designed projects. Tried release funding but money is not key.<br /> <br /> Carolina Rossini Brazil OER with law background to work with Brazil government. Started with distance education but crossed over to OER. Brazil key adoptor of FOSS and Creative Commons. Green paper released to work out how to move from projects with open intent to those that are OER. Intend to also address the 70% of children with special needs who are not in school in Brazil.<br /> <br /> Question is there any economic research.<br /> Answer (Ben) looked onto existing models but not suitable. Two methodologies in use based on Open Access and transport infrastructure. Appraisal at 4-5m euro cost 10-14m benefit. This has not been challenged but is not provable. Should be able to find a collaborative answer to thus and other quality issues.<br /> David also had looked at value of open access as a model. Argued that fir each pound spent on JISC sector gets 29 pounds benefit. But did not use direct economic argument - report called good intentions considered the different models but was not used. Instead draw on public good argument of release of publicly funded content. We are paying for this anyway.<br /> <br /> Question: emphasis is on content. Is this really what is offered by OER or is it the pedagogical model? Eg BLOSSOMS has transfered approaches to teaching as well as the content!<br /> Answer yes the "how to use" is at least as important especially once some content exists. Training teachers is a part of the initiatives in Brazil. (David) need to share pedagogy but also need to be able to change the pedagogy around content.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
