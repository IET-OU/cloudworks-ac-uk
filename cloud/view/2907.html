<ul>
<li>Concept of Total Place, being more agile within and beyond the University, making the most of innovative thinking, practice.</li>

			<p>Chris Brink - introduced the team gathered around the table. Including Sir Michael Bichard is soon to be Lord.</p>
<p>Engagement should be the "Third core function" alongside Research and Teaching/Learning. In the past there was a phase of looking at engagement as for the public good, then a second phase of third strand workign with business, and then a third phase of regional engagement.</p>
<p>However it is best to think of it as alongside reserach and teaching and learning - ways to bring out civic value from these. How can the univeirtisty function as an integral part of civic society: with regional, national and international engagement. Essential what differnce does your university make?</p>
<p>It is not enough to take a "we are so clever" position but rather see ways to learn. It is important to see how to address engagement within management structure.</p>
<p>Approach: Innovation, creativity, and agility. Regional, national, international.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

                   <p>Michael Bichard - previous work on being a "total place" i.e. delivering across a range. Aim to change the way people behave through leadership - not just a plan but a change.</p>
<p>Leading a place means going beyond the measures that are inward looking (e.g. REF) and to understand what we do as an agency in the community. Organisation then need to trust each other and build coalitions and colaborative behaviours. If people do a good job in this area then they deserve also to be recognised and rewarded.</p>
<p>Too much reorganisation leads to "poorer services at more cost". Instead a culure of innovation is needed that avoids being defensive - particularly to save real money in such things as buildings, IT etc. We must do better - e.g. only 1% of those looked after go on to HE, while 33% of those in prison have been. This is a huge contrast to Denmark - 60% go on to HE. So we can and must do better.</p>
<p>There are e.g.s of this being addressed but not across the piece.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Don Olcot - do we want to have proactive leadership, or not. E.g. should we be setting up Chinese Campus when cannot collabotrate locally.</p>
<p>Building world class universities takes more than money (said by Yale President). Need to attract the right faculty and so huge diversion.</p>
<p>Global issues sparked by the Bologna process - created mobility *within* Europe but then have other within region collaborations.</p>
<p>US and UK send least of students abroad, while expecting others to come. Need to develop international perspective for our own students as global citizens.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Ed Smith - where are the barriers to engagement coming from. Is it Government? Or rather for the Universities themselves? Or the potential civic partners?</p>
<p>So need to look for purpose in engagement - nationally. Internationally there is too much opportunism - need strategy, understand partners, know people.</p>
<p>Demos edgeless "bring the world to university" rather than take the "university to the world". Use technology rather than travel.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Feedback after groups - Q&amp;A + P&amp;R (Points and Responses)</p>
<p>Q: Who pays for this?</p>
<p>A: not a marginal extra. Do not fund separately - mainstream activity.</p>
<p>P: Centre for Public Engagement in Bristol. Discover that many people are already very involved in community work. But did not want a high profile. Engagement is happening. To grow this need to match into the existing academic rationale but also complicated by personal motivations.</p>
<p>R: Audits do lead to vary long complex list. How to reward? Can demand research &amp; teaching at personal level - instead demand at collective level.</p>
<p>R: Managerialism must not take over - recognise that volunteering is part of how people operate.</p>        </div>

                   <p>P: The head of an organisation has key leadership role. But need to pay attention to students as well.</p>
<p>D (for disagreement): Too much is being placed on individuals - there is an institutional aspect that needs to be unique and valuable. What should universities do in particular?</p>
<p>R: (Chris) There are endless possibilities - but yes should be led rather than happenstance.</p>
<p>D: Universities do attract special staff. So the outreach work is different. Engagement is along logical dimenstion such as knowledge and teaching.</p>
<p>R: (Michael) That is too narrow - use the resource in the round for the benefit of the community.</p>
<p>P: Examples of economic impact through building on skills and culture. Encourage civic pride.</p>
<p>R: (Don) Not sure everybody should do this - need to reflect on mission and history, Should not make a list of what is done and then write the policy. Need to turn that around to be policy led.</p>
<p>R (Michael). Challenge is to lead not just to do.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Closing comment - beginning to understand that the game is changing - not sure how it is changing or whether we can lead or react.</p>
<p>If this is the knowledge economy what are the drivers of supply and demand. We have been supply-side. Now need to understand demand-side and be responsive. Can your university say that we have applied our minds to the challenges of society and have decided to lead on responding to ... (e.g. global warming, fundamentalism,...)</p>        </div>
