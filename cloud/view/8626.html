        <h1>Narrator</h1>
<p><em>I was the lecturer who taught the class.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>When the researcher commenced teaching the above unit the key element that the unit specification was seeking to facilitate was developing students &lsquo;ability to present their research in a suitable format that demonstrated their skills in critical analysis. As part of developing their skills in critical analysis I had engaged the students in two weeks of activities where they developed hypothesises and tested these within practical scenarios and simultaneously improve their problem solving skills. Following this students were asked to display their findings in a format that would be appropriate for dissemination among the class and other interested readers.</p>
<p>Upon completing this activity it became apparent to me that a disparity existed between the students&rsquo; ability to verbally express the reasoning behind their findings and writing these in a form that met with academic conventions i.e. demonstrating critical thought in writing. Students demonstrated, verbally, a capacity for deep learning however they presented their findings in a manner that represented only surface learning. The ability to think and write critically is not only recognised by policy but also supported by industry professionals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I began with a question i.e. how can I improve my students&rsquo; ability to think critically and present these critical thoughts in writing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability to think and write critically has been deemed as essential in order to improve cognitive thinking skills in the classroom and move away from repetitive learning techniques that contribute towards surface learning. The LLUK standards in addition to The Department for Education and learning Northern Ireland recognises the importance of critical thinking and writing skills and its impact upon Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics within the Northern Ireland education system and economy. However government policy has been less clear as to how these skills can be developed. Several studies have created links between the application of simulations and developing critical thinking and writing skills. Further the use of simulations to improve communication and analytical and problem solving skills, which are integral aspects of critical thinking and writing, have also been associated with improving employability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Defining critical thinking and writing skills has proved an elusive quarry given the plethora of subjective definitions and applications that exist. Young and Warren (2011) noted that critical thinking focuses upon the ability to transfer knowledge from one scenario to another.&nbsp; This view is mirrored by Gibb&rsquo;s Significant Event Framework (SE) where successful learners were characterised as those who could reflect upon previous experiences, regardless of the specificity of their education and training, to resolve problems at work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>In essence students who can see the practical application of an idea where more likely to succeed when transferring their critical thinking to an academic paper. However studies have revealed, even the ability to write critically following critical thought could be impaired by a student&rsquo;s understanding of academic conventions for example the structure of an essay or report; the application of grammar or referencing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having identified an inconsistency between my students&rsquo; ability to think and write critically the next stage commenced by identifying if students perceived their ability to think and write critically as a challenge and triangulating this primary research with secondary research and associated policy in the relevant field. The researcher adopted the approach of using a lesson to begin building positive &lsquo;scaffolds&rsquo; around the learners <em>anticipated</em> needs. The needs the researcher anticipated combined with the results of what the students&rsquo; identified as having learned from the lesson revealed gaps within the students knowledge where further scaffolds could be built to enhance how students write assignments and demonstrate their arguments.</p>
<p>In summary the methodology of my approach is that of using simulation as a tool to improve academic competence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the purposes of clarity it is important that readers of this should understand that the lesson that was conducted came around as the result of a culmination of building and removing scaffolds as part of a process of moving from tutor led to self managed to autonomous learning environments. The progression from tutor led to self managed learning was essential before autonomous learning could take place. <em>In this lesson the scaffolds were removed and students engaged in problem based learning associated with humanistic and autonomous education.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The basis of the simulated courtroom environment was to discuss the arguments for and against the use of supplementation within sport. As part of this process and reflective of the LLUK (2012) standards the simulation was based upon an entrepreneur who was selling sports supplements and justifying the sale of these with the benefits associated with their use in sport. The application of De Bono&rsquo;s &lsquo;Thinking hats&rsquo; was evident within the classroom however, contrary to the application of one single hat per group it was necessary that the various groups appointed wore different hats dependent on the need that arose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studies from various learning educational backgrounds have demonstrated the positive impact that simulation has upon developing critical thinking skills however the success of the simulations is dependent upon well structured and coherent learning objectives with a class involved understands completely the processes underpinning. Therefore, the defence team, who represented the entrepreneur, defended the profits the accused earned as a result of his business activities and represented the yellow (benefits) and blue (processes) of the defendants actions in addition to demonstrating creativity (green hat) associated with De Bono&rsquo;s theories through the process of their arguments. Here, the students presented one aspect of an argument using a variety of resources where they would create links between the knowledge and its practical application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The range of resources used were reflective of the learning styles present among the students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prosecution team, conversely, demonstrated that supplementation within sport was not effective; representing both the black, blue and green hats of caution, process and creativity. The role of the judge as well as jury and expert witnesses were assumed by the remainder of the students in the class wearing the hats of &lsquo;caution&rsquo; and &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; and reviewing the relevance of the facts (Black and white). It is important to note at this point that the class was managed entirely by the students in accordance with the humanistic approach to learning as they sought to address the problem they had been asked to resolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the submission of arguments the jury was asked to leave the room and come to a decision based upon the use of supplements within sport and then justify this decision to the judge. The role of the jury (White hat) was to listen to the prosecution and defence arguments and make the decision based upon, only, the information provided within the simulation as to the efficacy of supplementation within sport whilst the judge (Black Hat) ensured the equity of the processes for example time allotted to present arguments as well as adjudicating over any disputes and it was the skilled use of interpersonal skills evidenced by the judge that created an environment where assertiveness was quintessential to success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Within the courtroom simulation the opposing arguments were presented by the defence and prosecution teams. The closing argument was designed to represent a summation of one aspect of an argument presented by opposing theories, in this case the prosecution and defence team. Statements such as, &ldquo;how to make a conclusion statement without starting a new argument during it. the layout of what we were doing and how to do it &ldquo; and &ldquo;Making a concluding statement&rdquo; provided evidence that, some students&rsquo;, recognised the importance of this aspect of academic thinking and writing and also they had progressed to the upper echelons of Blooms taxonomy with their application of higher thinking skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students had entered the classroom environment with pre-prepared arguments in the form of handouts; PowerPoint presentations; expert witnesses in addition to pre-prepared questions and responses to anticipated questions. Students were able to determine that presenting opposing arguments represented the discussion aspect of their academic papers were they would use primary and secondary research to present their analysis. Some students were able to determine that the use of expert witnesses represented primary information where resources gathered from other areas e.g. text books and journal articles represented secondary information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deliberation and decision-making processes afforded to the jury represented the link between developing knowledge and transferring this to wisdom and subsequently critical thought whilst the sentence, provided by the judge, would offer a final conclusion to the process.&nbsp; Students also observed these commonalities and this was also evident from the feedback from my subject mentor i.e. &ldquo;The similarity between what they learned in the courtroom in relation to the production of evidence and what they produce as evidence of learning in assignment was very wise and very well communicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the proceedings students were able to determine that the courtroom simulation was a macrocosm of the assignment and the procedures that existed within the courtroom for example; presenting opposing debates; the summing up of arguments and deliberation represented microcosms of the academic paper i.e. analysis debate and summation, respectively. For example &ldquo;the layout of the class explained the layout of the assignment&rdquo; was offered as an answer by one student in relation to the aspects of the class that were found most useful. These findings were further reflected in students&rsquo; answers to an online survey I posted following the class and congruent with Harnett&rsquo;s views relating to creating sustainable change among students following reflective practice by a teacher. The use of open and non-leading questions in the &lsquo;rate my lecturer&rsquo; game at the end of the class activities also provided an opportunity to gain valuable feedback from students in relation to my aims and objectives and the students&rsquo; gains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Triangulating feedback from students&rsquo;, my mentor and my own observations revealed that students had progressed to the upper echelons of Blooms taxonomy where their application of higher cognitive skills was clearly evident. Further the aims of the class were achieved, students could see the link between thinking and writing critically and how the simulation represented the structure of an academic paper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition I would also advocate the following additional actions &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Students&rsquo; should use external expert witnesses as opposed to using internal witnesses from the college.&nbsp; This would add a new dynamic and level of unpredictability to the classroom that would encourage students to deal with new people and situations without the benefit of prior knowledge.&nbsp; Whilst my research has not been exhaustive there have been no cases identified, using simulations, where people from an external environment contribute to the role plays taking place.</li>
<li>The use of expert witnesses may also encourage students to develop greater in depth knowledge of their subject area in anticipation of someone who may be giving evident who knows more about the topic area than they do.</li>
</ul>
