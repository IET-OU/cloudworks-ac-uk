			<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>&nbsp;I was given a cohort of learners working towards their IT user level 2 qualification who were already part way through.&nbsp; I had no up to date learning materials or resources prepared.&nbsp; My primary function was to assess their NVQ and plug their gaps in knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>All learners were work-based and didn&rsquo;t attend college, although within the same company I was unable to see them face to face at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The outcome of the unit they were all struggling with was internet communication as all had relatively little experience of using forums and sharing information online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All learners use an assessment e-portfolio and I explored the use of forums within this but didn&rsquo;t have the necessary access rights to proceed.&nbsp; Nobody else within my team had used these before.</p>
<p>I enquired about creating college moodle pages and was told that the e-portfolio was used instead of moodle as this suited work-based learners better.</p>
<p>I was aware of the moodle cloud which would allow me as an individual to set up my own moodle teaching resources and activities (independently of the organisation).&nbsp; I decided to create some activities on this so I could experiment. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>To enable learners to gain experience of internet communication tools in order to provide evidence for outcome 4 using the internet unit &ndash; as below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning criteria (externally set)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify opportunities to create, post or publish material to websites</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Submit information online</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select and use appropriate tools and techniques to communicate information online</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User browser tools to share information sources with others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the tasks I created was to complete a feedback form about the previous activities.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were communicating information online and providing feedback on how they had found the tasks which in turn would help me amend the tasks for future use.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>Enquired re the organisations VLE &ndash; was informed to use the e-portfolio.</p>
<p>Nobody within the team was family with forums (which was essential for the task) and after some testing decided that the e-portfolio wasn&rsquo;t fit for this purpose (didn&rsquo;t have a RSS facility and I struggled with access rights)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decided to use moodlecloud as I could work on this independently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to free up half a day to allocate to this task. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hadn&rsquo;t used Moodle for several years so had to take some time to familiarise myself with this and then created five tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also had to work out how to create user accounts and enrol people to these activities.</p>
<p>Tested the tasks with a small group, fed back to the team what I had done and suggested that this may be a way forward to pool resources and develop materials/activities for our distance learners who don&rsquo;t attend workshops.&nbsp; Team not interested in developing.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The feedback indicated on the whole that learners liked learning in this way and I was able to capture the responses and I was able to assess that they were able to communicate over the internet to meet the desired outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>See attached document for screen shots of some of the tasks and the feedback from candidates.&nbsp; Most candidates found the tasks OK, just a comment re the limited instructions, which I totally agree with.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult working individually.&nbsp; I took my experiences back to the team and suggested that some development time should be allocated to moodle as all learners undertaking a IT user course should be able to learn using computer resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; This wasn&rsquo;t considered a good option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The individuals were set off with the tasks at different times and so the discussions didn&rsquo;t really take off, however, they were exposed to posting in a forum and reading messages from others so the principles were there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps additional tasks could be for them to find forums which they would find useful to subscribe to for personal or professional interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This activity should be a training task and the assessment task should ideally be related to their professional life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The activity could be made better by making fully instructions available for those who need it by means of providing &lsquo;how to&rsquo; links.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>			<div class="posted-by">
