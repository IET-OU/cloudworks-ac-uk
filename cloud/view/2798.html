                   <p>I am interested in research from organisations connected with this event (Wed Thur) including ones that are not there. Last year LSIS were at BETT but this event would be more suitable I think. Towards Maturity have a stand. They offer a model of how a mature e-learning organisation would behave. I am not aware how this links to academic research.</p>
<p>LSIS combines previous organisations working on quality and leadership/learning. I don't know how much research supports this connection or where to find it. Some from Excellence in Leadership is still available from Lancaster but I don't know how Networked Learning fits into practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This show is for commercial training departments but i think academics could relate to some of it. I hope to do some background for a future story for OhmyNews.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I have added links for EPIC and Towards Maturity page for the show. More from yesterday later. Show continues today and the research from Towards Maturity is not yet available for download.</p>
<p>On day one I found a lot of energy but not much research backup as in universities. Not sure what the cred is for Towards Maturity.&nbsp; I find it very interesting but it is based on surveys of people working on the topics concerned.&nbsp; The model is a bit vague too, no clear idea of management or direction. But then the surveys seem to show that management is not fully informed even when the projects work out well. This is just my memory from yesterday slides. There will be a full report to download later.</p>
<p>The EPIC White Papers have academic references. You need to register. I have started on mobile learning, given away on a USB stick.</p>
<p>Downstairs the new show on Skills included some stands about leadership, development etc. Still not sure what the new show is about. Several stands might have been upstairs if there was space. But busines schools could have been there I think with their take on leadership.</p>
<p>Maybe forget about previous models for a while and just take in the new information.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Antonella, thanks for links to Steve Wheeler. Good to have an idea of the main conference. I only went to one day of the show. Yes there were a lot of Content Management Systems. Not sure all of education has left this behind though. I think there are still useful comparisons with skills and training.</p>        </div>

<p>The events seem to be merging together as the online aspect gets stronger. Online it is January already or so it seems. As well as December.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Have added a link to original of article in promo mag for Learning Technology and Skills. Donald H Taylor is Chair of the conference. He says that something has already happened with technology. Now personalised, individually driven. I welcome this sort of view, rather than speculating about what might happen sometime in the future. But what is it that has already happened? The detail in the text is not that clear.</p>

                   <p>The Winterlude is starting early this year. Usually Towards Maturity release reports at the Learning Technologies show in January. But a report about online learning is released today-</p>
<p>www.cloud4training.com</p>
<p>One thing I noticed was that virtual worlds are stalled because of bandwidth issues etc. These kind of surveys depend on a self selected group of people but the base seems to be growing. How do educational organisations compare?</p>

<p>briefly, the Towards Maturity project is reaching a high enough level to interest academics, as far as I can tell. Olympia worth a visit if only through Twitter. #LT12uk</p>
<p>Adobe seem to be more PDF than Flash with added interest in video conference through mobile devices. This tech stuff has an influence on learning at some point in time.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Another blog about the Cloud. I think there are several shows at Olympia linked together. So the fairly technical one about Clouds may be explained somewhere else. Report later in the week, no Tweets tomorrow too busy...</p>
<p><a href="http://will789gb.posterous.com/cloud-for-debate-at-learning-technologies-dar" rel="nofollow">http://will789gb.posterous.com/cloud-for-debate-at-learning-technologies-dar</a></p>
<p>New book re the Cloud describes the "dark side". &nbsp;So there is a mix in which the trade show may contribute.</p>
