That could help guys like Michael Vick Matt Schaub and Kirk Cousins who would like the chance to begin new chapters elsewhere as starters. Wagner wasted a chance to win in regulation.<br /><br />Romo didn't really revive a dead Boyz team so much as getting rid of a starting QB who was a festering wound.. January.
