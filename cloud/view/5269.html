        <p>on OERS-Exploiting Digital Courseware</p>    </div>

			<p align="center">IRF Discussion Forum</p>
<p align="center">Theme 2:</p>
<p align="center">Exploiting digital courseware</p>
<p>Unisa is a founding member of the African Council on Distance Education (ACDE). It sits in a technical coordinating committee (TCC) which is tasked with developing a framework for collaboration that will cover collaboration related to materials, research, staff capacity development and cross-border education provision. One of the first activities for the TCC was to complete audits of course materials and staff capacity needs. Unisa has not yet completed these audits and in discussion at a recent ACDE TCC meeting held in Potchefstroom, it became clear there was some ambivalence about both the sharing of materials and the increasing emphasis on digital resources and the potential of e-/on-line learning. The first of these issues will be addressed in the second IRF discussion forum and the second in the third.</p>
<p>Three sub-themes are envisaged for the current discussion forum:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sharing materials</strong>. What are the advantages and disadvantages of HEIs sharing materials? What have been IRF members&rsquo; experiences in this regard? Under what conditions might an HEI choose to share materials? How can sharing materials enhance the core business of teaching and learning?</li>
<li><strong>OER</strong>. What is OER? What are the main premises of the OER movement? How should an institution like Unisa engage with OER and how does it currently engage? How can involvement in the OER movement enhance the core business of teaching and learning?</li>
<li><strong>Digital libraries</strong>. With journals, textbooks, learning guides and other resources increasingly available in digital format is there still a need to provide for physical library resources? What is a reasonable balance between provision of digital resources (on CD or flashdrive or downloadable from one or more websites) and expectation that students will source their resources at first year, graduate and post-graduate levels?</li>
</ol>
<p>It is suggested that Catherine Ngugi and/or Neil Butcher of OER Africa be invited to participate in this forum.</p>
<p>There are three parts to this briefing document providing a starting point for the discussion of each sub-theme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 provides some suggestions about sharing materials from a the recent ACDE TCC meeting </li>
<li>Part 2 provides a definition of OER and some initial ideas about a rationale for engagement and some current limitations/ reservations at Unisa</li>
<li>Part 3 provides some preliminary ideas on the notion of digital libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing materials</h1>
<p>The sharing of materials (draft or final; policies, tools, learning resources etc. whole or in part) should help to reduce unnecessary duplication, expand the base of materials available to all participating institutions and could result in higher quality due to the increased internal and external review mechanisms which usually support joint publication and sharing.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the sharing of learning and teaching resources could happen at three different levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutions might choose to share information about their learning and teaching resources but not the resources themselves, except subject to a bi- or multi-lateral agreement.</li>
<li>Institutions might choose to share both information about their learning and teaching resources as well as the resources themselves with like-minded institutions, specifying the conditions under which those other institutions might or might not use and/or adapt the resources. This would require some form of password protected access. </li>
<li>Institutions might choose to share both information about their learning and teaching resources as well as the resources themselves as open education resources (OER) &ndash; the latter obviates the need to manage the kind of agreements required above.</li>
</ul>
<h1>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploiting the potential of OER</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of Open Educational Resources (OER) was originally coined during a UNESCO Forum on Open Courseware for Higher Education in Developing Countries held in 2002. During a follow-up, online discussion, also hosted by UNESCO, the initial concept was further developed as follows:</p>
<p>Open Educational Resources are defined as &lsquo;technology-enabled, open provision of educational resources for consultation, use and adaptation by a community of users for non-commercial purposes.&rsquo; They are typically made freely available over the Web or the Internet. Their principle use is by teachers and educational institutions to support course development, but they can also be used directly by students. Open Educational Resources include learning objects such as lecture material, references and readings, simulations, experiments and demonstrations, as well as syllabuses, curricula, and teachers&rsquo; guides.<a href="#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Although the concept of OER unsurprisingly means different things to different people, it rests on the following key assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increased availability of relevant, need-targeted learning materials can contribute to more productive learners and faculty members. </li>
<li>Because OER removes restrictions around copying resources, it holds potential for reducing the cost of accessing educational materials. </li>
<li>The principle of allowing adaptation of materials contributes to enabling learners to be active participants in educational processes, whereby they learn by doing and creating, not just by passively reading and absorbing.</li>
<li>The potential of OER is best achieved through a collaborative partnership of people working in communities of practice, both within and across institutions (although sometimes also within them). Collaborative OER processes built on networks of peer members can lead to increased availability of relevant, need-targeted learning materials, achieving a better understanding of learners&rsquo; needs and motivating meaningful contributions from participating institutions.</li>
<li>OER has the potential to build capacity in African education by providing educators with access, at low or no cost, to the tools and content that they need to boost their ability to produce high quality educational materials and complete the necessary instructional design to integrate such materials into high quality programmes of learning.</li>
<li>Without collaborative partnerships within Africa, and between African education institutions and those from other parts of the world, and the ensuing active ownership by African educators of resulting OER products (whether developed from scratch or adapted from existing resources), OER is likely to have limited, if any, meaningful impact on African education systems. Simply importing content into Africa from other parts of the world will do nothing to solve capacity and resource constraints in African education systems.</li>
<li>To be successful and sustainable, development of OER cannot be a sideline activity within an institution or education system. Development of learning resources needs to be integrated into institutional or systemic processes in order to both leverage its potential and provide for its sustainability. Likewise, policies, particularly around intellectual property rights, remuneration, and promotion, need to be adapted to support and sustain licensing of educational materials as OER. </li>
<li>The potential of OER includes facilitating collaborations between educators and students at different institutions, as well as establishing a new economic model for procuring and publishing learning materials. Ultimately, a key to its success will be to demonstrate that, in the medium- to long-term, OER will help over-stretched educators to manage their work more effectively, rather than adding new work requirements to their job descriptions. (Saide 2009)</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>Unisa hasn't entered the OER arena yet in that it has not allowed any of its study material to be open source although there is an excellent open source repository in the Library.</p>
<p>Moreover, the institution is currently considering a code of practice for social networking that expressly talks about intellectual copyright and warns staff that if they converse on Facebook or Twitter they do so in their private capacity only and must be prepared to sign a disclaimer.</p>
<p>In addition, several proactive staff members are running discussion groups on Facebook for their students which Unisa fears will allow for non-paid up members of the public to have access to Unisa materials. This worries the Senate Tuition and Learner Support Committee.</p>
<p>So the question for the group is:</p>
<p>What role does intellectual copyright play in OERs and what policies and guidelines do other universities have about their study materials going opensource officially through engagement with global OER repositories and unofficially via social networking?</p>
<h1>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reflecting on libraries</h1>
<p>Unisa has one of the largest and most used libraries in the southern hemisphere. Students and staff can access library holdings on line and have books/ journals/ articles couriered to them. However, there are time and cost issues to be considered, especially in a short semester system and for students outside of SA&rsquo;s borders. For institutions in many countries it has proved impossible for library stocks to be kept up to date. In addition, programme developers need to take cognisance of what can reasonably be expected of students at different levels of study. It is suggested:</p>
<ul>
<li>At first year UG level, when students are struggling to manage the transition from secondary to tertiary education, course materials should be self-contained. Everything the student needs &ndash; including textbooks and selected journal articles, with integrated pre-, during- and post-reading activities, should be supplied as part of the study package on a CD/DVD/flashdrive.</li>
<li>At second/third year level, key resources could continue to be supplied in this way but students might reasonably be expected to access supplementary resources from designated repositories (but be aware of time and bandwidth costs for students)</li>
<li>At postgraduate level the pendulum should probably swing more towards the student locating, evaluating and synthesising his/her own resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>At whatever level, it is an anachronism to require students to access physical resources in a physical library and is not a sustainable option.</p>
