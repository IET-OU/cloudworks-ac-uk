        <h2>Striking a balance between practice and open practice, what does it  mean to operate in a digital environment?</h2>
<p>Chris Follows, University  of the arts London 2011</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction </strong></p>
<p>A significant and over arcing connection across all of my practice is  an interest in exploring the development and integration 'Open  Educational Practice' (OEP) and Open Educational Resources (OERs) in art  and design learning and teaching. The following action research  intervention took place at Wimbledon School of Foundation 25 February to  April 14 (2011). At the beginning of the final term I introduced a  'Wimbledon Foundation Video and Animation Final Projects' blog to a  specific cohort of video and animation students and staff at Wimbledon  school of Foundation: <a href="http://wimbledonfoundationvideoanimationfinalprojects.myblog.arts.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://wimbledonfoundationvideoanimationfinalprojects.myblog.arts.ac.uk/</a>.</p>
<p>Although I have had lots of experience of using web environments for  supporting students (publishing resources) this has been primarily video  and image tutorials for demonstrating technical 'intro' or 'how to'  resources. I have never had experience of applying online technologies  to directly support the development of academic practice within a  specific cohort of students.</p>
<p>The learning and teaching problem I identified'. The intervention  involved art and design foundation students, specifically those who  specialise in fine art time-based media including animation, video,  performance, sound and interactive media.</p>
<p>Students who work with video and animation tend not to work in the  formal arts studio environment and over time can become 'less visible'  to staff and their peers. Video and animation students sometimes work at  home or out on location, when at college they mostly work in dark out  of the way animation spaces and in digital media editing suites. Video  and animation students tend to lose out on studio onsite peer support.</p>
<p>The primarily point of support in the media studios are technical  staff, only on occasion would a personal tutor visit the media suite. If  and when a student manages to secure a tutorial with their tutor, the  media suite can be full and their editing workstation busy, so tutorials  are often held in painting studios, with no or little time to review  digital footage, providing constructive feedback and productive support  in this environment difficult at best.</p>
<p>I've been reflecting on ways to provide better feedback and how my  feedback to students corresponds with that of the personal tutors  feedback and visa versa. Lack of communication between technicians,  academics and the students, regarding student progress and development  can result in staff having little clear understanding or overview of the  students learning journey. An extreme example of this happened last  year during the final assessment period. A tutor had not realised how  much preparatory work one particular student had completed, as it was  not clearly visible in her portfolio due to it being TBM work. I  subsequently tried to gather together this student's work on various  computers and the tutor sat and looked through the work. The tutor was  shocked that he could have marked this student without seeing this body  of work, as he thought it made a significant difference. Also see tutors  feedback regarding this (appendix 2).</p>
<p>The below quote provides a teachers perspective and was provided as  part of my call for academic feedback (appendix 2) regarding  difficulties in communication.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"There  were the normal difficulties, students doing work away from the studio  and then turning up with a "finished piece" which has been  ill-considered, insufficiently developed, edited, story-boarded etc.  Specifically with film, in that there always seems to be a student who  thinks they can rush around with a camera, do a bit of editing and then  that's it! The main problem was making sure that students were well  prepared and had thought through their idea, the "feel" of their work  and how they were going to do this, the pace and narrative of their  work."</p>
<p>I had considered a number of different interventions to address the  learning and teaching problem, these would have involved attendance at  personal tutorials and critiques, logistically this was too difficult to  organise and would mean spending less time in the digital studio which  would make the situation worse. I tried to find a solution, which would  be suitable for all. I wanted to explore the potential of integrating  Web 2.0 technologies in learning and teaching and create a more visible,  open and collective environment for the Wimbledon time-based media  'students and staff.</p>
<p><strong>The research question I came up with: What are the challenges,  limitations and benefits of introducing blogs to better support ongoing  evaluation and timely feedback for students working in video and  animation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The intervention I made and how I evaluated it.</strong></p>
<p>The primary goal of this intervention was to evaluate the overall  challenges, limitations and benefits of implementing and encouraging  staff and student to participate in this learning and teaching  intervention. Its helpful for technicial and academic staff to have an  overall understanding of technical, contextual and conceptual approaches  the student is making. The challenge was first to integrate the blog  into the curriculum and then convince staff and students this was a  worthwhile venture. Limitations were one of participation, a 'team  effort' was required, and this was the high-risk part of the  intervention, as the notion of online academic practice was new to all.  The benefits of the intervention went well, the blog provided a perfect  means of bridging and integrating practice, the blog quickly became the  central open platform for communication, interaction, reflection and  support in which I had intended it to be. The perceived negative aspects  of time and effort spent setting up the blog were over come by the  clear benefits of helping deliver more meaningful and structured  learning and teaching experience for the students, staff and myself.</p>
<p>In total, seventeen time-based media (TBM) students openly published  digital journals displayed video, image and text showing development of  preparatory work in the run up to the final end of year exhibition. The  blog was actively used by students and myself and reflected the spirit  of intervention including active peer-to-peer open discussions there was  less visible interaction from other staff.</p>
<p>The research was evaluated primarily by using and monitoring the blog  myself daily along side the students and staff, this way I could  evaluate the project through daily observations onsite and online. The  blog became a useful visual recorded of the project, which we could  reflect on during and after the project. At the end of the intervention I  posted an online questionnaire to gather anonymous student feedback,  five students in total responded (appendix 1). I also emailed relevant  staff members with a short list of questions 5 out of 7 responded  (appendix 2).</p>
<p>As an intervention, the integration of blogs to support the learning  and teaching activities of students and staff was very effective. The  blog intervention enhanced communication, helped surface practice and  successfully introduced the new notion of open practice and encouraged  students to reflect and explore how they operate online; student  feedback (appendix 1) shows clear improvements in web 2.0 digital  literacy skills.</p>
<p>The intervention improved my practice; I managed student support and  feedback better by saving time and having clear understanding of student  progress. Tutorials were more meaningful and effective. I was more  critical of my online feedback as this was open to the world and it  could be referenced at any point, the intervention highlights this as  best practice and a possible way forward for encouraging low level  participation to support personal online digital literacy development.</p>
<p>The intervention provided sound evidence, which I can apply to best  practice in the future, advance planning, pre digital literacy  assessment to help inform design, clear guidelines, visible support, not  too embed (low risk at first), allow for flexibility of use and  non-participation. It's helpful to have nominated 'champion or steward'  in place to support, nurture and guide the project forwards.</p>
<p><strong>2. Background</strong></p>
<p>I teach students who specialise in TBM projects. As a technician in a  digital media studio you are also responsible for supporting students  in their overall digital media development. Digital media students on a  foundation course can come from four different subject areas including  3D design, visual communication, design for performance and fine art.  Students who specialise in digital media projects especially TBM tend to  work very closely with the digital media technical staff and less so  with the academics. Demand for support in this area is high, my post at  Wimbledon is shared between my colleague and myself, and therefore  communication and openness is crucial.</p>
<p>Unlike most art and design higher education courses the FE foundation  course is mainly project-based course for example students are set  termly tasks to complete based on particular learning activities and  outcomes. Students are encouraged to be independent learners and engage  collaboratively in the art school open studio environment.</p>
<p><strong>3. Literature Review</strong></p>
<p>As seen in this project and on previous projects I have worked on  there is a recurring problem of successfully integrating web 2.0  technologies into learning and teaching, I will explore why and how we  can begin to address it?</p>
<p>If we were to look at the notion of teachers as digital immigrants,  who are learning to live with technology and students as digital  natives, living with technology since birth. (Prensky, 2001) we begin to  see a huge gap that divides learners and teachers. In my experience of  teaching digital media over the past 7 years it is not true to say all  students are digital natives or all teachers are digital immigrants,  this is reflected in the feedback questionnaire (Appendix 1 &amp; 2) and  (Diagram 1) below, four out of five students positioned themselves in  the -'Very Poor' to 'Average' categories and four out of five staff  positioned themselves in the Good to Average categories, so quite the  reverse scenario to what Prensky (2007, forward to 18:10) suggests,  although he does acknowledge this, he explains there is an increasing  sway towards this being a problem in the future. As the pace of  technology development increases emphasis should be placed on  'progressive practice' and addressing the problems of digital literacy  and web 2.0 use in learning and teaching.</p>

<p><strong>Content and participation: striking the right balance.</strong></p>
<p>Wenger (1998) sees 'reification' (making it into a thing) and  'participation' as a duality of two constituent processes of the  'negotiation of meaning' fundamental to the human experience of meaning  and thus to the nature of practice. Both must exist in practice in order  to create meaning.</p>
<p>In this instance we could identify in our own practice content as  reification for example learning resources and blog posts and for  participation we could associate with commenting and interaction,  therefore as Wenger argues we need to practice both to achieve  'negotiation of meaning'. I will now explore the relevance of 'content'  and 'participation' in our practice and how the two concepts if seen as  'a duality of two constituent processes' can support OEP development.</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<p>For many of the students the introduction of the blog was a first  time experience so was uploading videos to YouTube. Its clear that  students found the process a rewarding experience. It can be very  difficult to manage digital content or digital practice, this is not  something taught on the course and there is an assumption that students  know how to operate in the digital environment. For most students  working in non-digital subjects work can be placed into an A1  presentation folder and training is provided in this but not for digital  portfolios. There is an increasing demand for students to present their  practice in digital form and I have seen universities starting to  request digital portfolio submissions over the A1 predecessor.</p>
<p>So there is a real need to surface practice and get content online  and we need to support the students in this process. There is a danger  of blogging for blogging sake as is quickly becoming the default  learning and teaching answer for addressing use of digital media in  practice. In truth many teachers who's own lack of awareness of what it  means to operate in a digital environment impacts on the implementation  and success of such learning activities, which in turn impact students  confidence and development.</p>
<p>Tutors need to be proactive in helping learners to develop learning and digital literacies. (LliDA, 2009)</p>
<p>It's easy to dismiss blog content as somehow having less relevance  than physical content in studios. 'David Gauntlett (2011) argues however  small and insignificant it may seem at first teachers need to readdress  the value of publishing content online and stop viewing web 2.0 content  as 'a sweet kind of sideshow'. (Gauntlett, 2011 pp.19)</p>
<p>"But as yet educational institutions struggle to define themselves  within this social media age, often rejecting the idea of social  networked learning because it is regarded as unstructured, undisciplined  and inferior to institutionalised learning" (Wikibooks, 2011)</p>
<p>How do we strike the right balance between open practice and  practice, for 'negotiation of meaning' to take place we need  participation, and to find the right balance of student and teacher  participation face-to-face and online. In the next section I will look  at the concept of participation and how we 'create meaning' from content  and what we may need to consider to make this work.</p>
<p><strong>Participation</strong></p>
<p>So far I have made the assumption that staff are not participating  because they are not commenting or actively visible on the blog, they  are of course busy on the ground, like myself engaged in full  participation teaching face-to-face onsite in studios, if so who is  looking at the student blogs, how do we know if there's a sign of  academic life on our blog? Staff feedback shows (appendix 2) they did  look and use the student blogs, although Lave &amp; wenger (1991) would  describe the teachers level of participation as 'Legitimate Peripheral  Participation' (LPP), sitting on the sidelines and learning how the  community works before entering the community fully or decide to back  off. Striking the right balance is difficult, students and staff are  wary of open practice as we can see in the feed back, especially staff  (appendix 2) and in this student response to question 4. To what extent  has the FMP blog improved the way you communicate with peers and staff?  Wrote:</p>
<p>"It has improved communication with peers and staff to an extent,  although I prefer communicating with staff face to face. I think the  more online teaching gets the less personal it becomes". (Appendix 1)</p>
<p>My experience of this intervention may have been different had there  have been an increased presence of tutor online activity, would this  also have changed the student's experience? If so, how do we encourage  teachers to move from the position of LPP to being a full participant? I  will use two of Brookfield's (1995 pp.4) 'critical reflection' examples  to explore this problem.</p>
<p><strong>The teacher as Fly on the Wall</strong></p>
<p>Where are the teachers? Are they observing our progress? The lack of  framework and understanding of how students and staff operate in this  space can cause confusion 'does the teacher's silence on my post mean  disappointment or satisfaction?' We can begin to manage these  expectations by addressing our level of participation. If teachers begin  to explore 'a way of understanding learning and teaching' as OEP, this  may provide an opportunity for teachers to reflect on their interactions  and decide on the level of participation in the community.</p>
<p>"She will learn when, and how much to disclose, and she will know  about the confidence-inducing effects of such disclosure. She will also  know when keeping her own counsel leads to students doing some  productive reflection, and when it paralyses them". Brookfield, S. (1995  pp.8)</p>
<p><strong>The Circle</strong></p>
<p>If our blog were a classroom, we may lay it out as a circle of  chairs, good practice you'd think, no rows of chairs for students to  fall asleep and get lost in the crowd. In the circle everyone is inward  facing, visible and in a position of dominance, part of the group. For  the confident students this is not a problem, although there is always  the problem of the dominant student taking over the group or students  feeling they should just say something for the sake of it. For the less  confident and shy students this configuration can be intimidating,  Brookfield (1995) quotes Kreisberg (1992) describe how 'painful and  humiliating experience' it is to be forced into a position of openness  and exposure in an unfamiliar environment. The students have no  opportunity to sit back and observe the tutor in practice, the student  needs space and time to check out their environment and teacher so they  are sure and secure enough to contribute to the community so they can  open up and thrive in this environment. The circle does not allow LLP  for students to find their place in the community.</p>
<p><strong>4. Method</strong></p>
<p>I found the 'research by doing' approach to action research a really  useful method of 'unpacking' the learning and teaching problem I've been  trying to understand and address for some time. The cycle of planning,  observation and reflection against a focused framework allowed me to  explore the issues I wanted to and provided the confidence to collect  'real world' focused data to help build my enquiry and argument for this  project and for future strands of research I'm sure will stem from  participating in this experience.</p>
<p>The notion of technology stewardship describe by Wenger, White and  Smith (2009 pp.24-27) as individuals who implement and support the  integration and development of communities clearly reflects my approach  to the action research intervention and the different 'streams of  activity' undertaken to achieve it.</p>
<p>I have used the following descriptive 'streams of activity' headers  'community understanding, technology awareness, election and  Installation, adoption and Transition and everyday use' from Wenger,  White and Smith (2009) Stewarding technology for communities to describe  the approach and method I took.</p>
<p>"These streams can become more or less salient at various times, but  they should not to be thought of as a sequence. They mostly run in  parallel and constantly inform each other." Wenger, White and Smith  (2009 pp.26)</p>
<p><strong>Community understanding</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the academic year students were introduced and encouraged  to use an existing site I had created for sharing and discussing  practiced based learning and teaching online <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://process.arts.ac.uk/</a>,  resources from here were embedded into the blog. The process.arts  website was introduced to the students as a place to find support  materials and resources. Students became familiar with the resource and  used it to support their development. <a name="_ftnref1" href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>"Process.arts was also helpful, because you could always reflect  back, If I didn't know how to work Photoshop I could always go back and  just look up the videos that Chris had put up and work with it, it was  very simple, very simplified was made easier for students like us" <a name="_ftnref2" href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p><strong>Technology awareness</strong></p>
<p>Although at the beginning of the year I had not know what my action  research intervention would be, I knew it would involve an exploration  of digital literacies (JISC. Developing digital literacies) and be an  extension of my research and experience ALTO and 'stewarding'  process.arts I did not use this the process.arts website for the  intervention because I felt the concept and context of the website was  too big a jump for most starting out in open practice and could distract  from the main points of the research.</p>
<p><strong>Selection and Installation</strong></p>
<p>In order to embed my action research project with direct focus on  student and staff publication and participation rather than on  publishing tools and experimental contexts ,I decided on using a more  familiar blog group environment to frame this project, <a href="http://myblog.arts.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://myblog.arts.ac.uk/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Adoption and Transition</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of the final term I introduced the blog <a href="http://wimbledonfoundationvideoanimationfinalprojects.myblog.arts.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://wimbledonfoundationvideoanimationfinalprojects.myblog.arts.ac.uk/</a> and invited all students from all areas who were using video and  animation in their final major projects to be involved. The blog was  primarily targeted at Fine Art students as these were the main user  group but other areas were invited to participate as well. Prior to the  call I had agreed with academic staff that the blog would be viewed as a  digital journal for assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Everyday use</strong></p>
<p>The blog had a clear identity 'WCA Foundation Video &amp; Animation  FMP (final major projects)' which the students could associate with.  There was an 'about' section which gave detailed information about using  'Video or animation' with guidelines on how to get technical support  and access to facilities, book equipment and how to use the blog. I  posted support calendars<a name="_ftnref3" href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/#_ftn3" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> where students could book support time with either my colleague or  myself, this worked well at managing workloads and student expectations.  There were clear links to key final major project deadlines and dates.</p>
<p>Named links of all students who contributed posts to the blog were  given a prime position on a list to the right of the site page, it was  very important to surface the community of users to encourage  participation and communication. Anyone who wanted to view a student's  blog journal could simply click on the name at any point whilst  navigating the site. The blog became daily part of my practice; I  continually monitored activity, posts and comments throughout the  project.</p>
<p><strong>5. Results</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overall participation</strong></p>
<p>Twenty six users joined the blog group including four members of  staff, the blog was fully open which meant anyone could view the posts  from anywhere so I'm unsure exactly of the overall impact the blog had.  Of the twenty four students who joined the blog seventeen students  created blog posts ranging from 1 to 17 post per student, with a overall  117 student posts being created in total and 105 comments.</p>
<p>There are three perspectives in which to view how the intervention went, through the eyes of the students, academic and myself.</p>

<p>The key success of the blog for me was the sense of being part of a  community, having everything and everyone in the one place, where in  previous years the community existed in silo's without a central domain  to share experience and practice. The key advantages of having one blog  for all meant I did not have to search around, navigate new interfaces  and software or log into multiple sites to comment or interact. If there  were problems with the site these could fix quickly for everyone, I  could also support the group as a whole with getting started and using  the blog. The blog also provide a place to embed video and animation  learning resources, I could now target these resources at specific  students if required.</p>
<p>Almost all the student's posts provided clear and informative  information, which greatly helped in my preparation for tutorials. I had  integrated a booking system for support tutorials into the blog to help  manage my workload. The booking system worked incredibly well, students  could book support in advance which meant we had time and a place to  prepare, I could suggest resources, we could continue to communicate and  share in their progress right up until the point of meeting  face-to-face which in turn became a more meaningful and productive  experience.</p>
<p>I'd had previous experience of posting resources and information but  never openly written feedback before, I found using the blog in my  practice to openly feedback made me more aware and critically reflective  about how I communicated with students.<a name="_ftnref4" href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>The important missing factor in this process was the absence of  academic input (comments and presence online) the blog failed to fully  align student, technical and academic open practice. How would academic  online participation have changed the intervention?</p>
<p>There was only one example I can provide of a three way communication  in practice, this was where I had suggested to a student to look into  some particular artists, the student was away for the rest of the week, I  saw the tutor and mentioned what I'd discussed with the student, the  tutor followed this up via the blog.<a name="_ftnref5" href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p><strong>The students perspective</strong></p>
<p>At the time of the call for participation students were just  beginning to develop their projects and needed time and space to  formulate their ideas before making the step of publishing their  thoughts openly online. Two weeks passed before the first student blog  was posted, from this point onwards 5 to 10 posts were being published  daily. The students at first seemed to be motivated by the prospect of  using the blog to enhance their grade at assessment, although this felt  less the case as students began to see the direct benefits to their  practice. Student feedback shows vast improvements in digital literacy  online skills in YouTube and blogging etc.</p>
<p>Students encouraged each other to use the blog and required little  support using it, they continued to support each other throughout.  Participating students viewed, interacted and commented on each other's  posts, the group developed their own mutual and respectful peer support  network<a name="_ftnref6" href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> see student responses to question 3 (appendix 1)</p>
<p>"It has improved my method of communicating because its made me  realise I prefer a more interactive way of communicating my ideas;  viewers being able to leave comments gives me direct feedback from which  I can work upon"</p>
<p>All feedback to this question was positive and suggests open practice  had an significant impact on learning. During tutorials students used  the blog effectively, referencing the blog before and during tutorial  time. I saw students sitting with their personal tutors in the media  suite looking and referencing content on the blogs together. Only one  student showed concern at having their work visible to the world,  although I would consider more privacy options in future. Students  included index printouts of their blogs in their final portfolios for  assesment.</p>
<p><strong>Staff perspective</strong></p>
<p>Although most staff did not fully participate in using the blogs they  did view the content during tutorials along side the students as well  as using for assessment. There are visible improvements in the digital  literacy skills of students see (Diagram 1) and staff feedback suggests  there are little problems in this area for them too (appendix 2). Staff  feedback to the question: What barriers if any prevent you from using  Web 0.2 websites and blogs in your teaching? Highlight lots of concerns  including time, exposure (open practice), loss or reduction of existing  onsite contact, quality concerns and general logistical problems (enough  PCs in studios).</p>
<p><strong>6. Discussion</strong></p>
<p>I approached this project knowing that staff participation was going  to be a problem, although I learned this assumption was not necessarily  correct. My intervention was supposed to benefit students, academics and  technical staff. Students and myself were the primary participants and  all benefited from the experience. It would have been interesting to  have seen more participation from academics and technicians and to see  how this helped overall communication and alignment. The teachers were  happy to remain on the periphery and observe and some students did the  same. I had initiated the project and the students were aware of that,  there was no reason for the students to expect academic participation,  beyond observation and assessment use.</p>
<p>If web 2.0 projects are to be implemented into learning and teaching  its good practice to target and identify your user group before hand.  Compulsory participation is not advised as Brookfield, S. (1995) points  out in the description of the circle of chairs, this situation does not  allow LPP. There is also the issue of quality, students and staff should  not be forced into a new educational spaces if they have not had the  time and space to practice in it first.</p>
<p>We should be giving students the same time and space to explore open  practice as staff. An example of this can be seen from the student  feedback question 6 (appendix 1) this students is considering their own  practice and how they operate in this arena, other users are also being  considered:</p>
<p>"Most of my posts were created at the last minute. I ran out of time  and would have love to have uploaded more reflections, clips and  research on other artists. It is easy to write loads of text but I  forget how hard it is for people to actually sit down and read something  long nowadays. So probably could have been more imaginative with the  ways i communicated to people."</p>
<p>Just asking students to use a blog in their practice is not  necessarily going to succeed by itself, although students are good  independent workers they still require guidance and support. Web 2.0  learning environments may require key staff members to be actively  involved in facilitating the community's development, Wenger (2009)  calls these members 'digital stewards' the community may struggle to  exist without them. If an open online educational community is formed  without any one individual teacher or steward to offer guidance and  support, there could be potential confusion and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The teacher who chooses to sit and observes as Brookfield, S. (1995)  quotes Kreisberg,(1992) who describes the 'fly on the wall teacher',  confusion can occur, the student sees no learning reference point in  this context, she's uncertain if or how the teacher is going to use the  blog,&nbsp; what the teacher thinks about her posts, is she doing the right  thing, are they even looking at all?</p>
<p>The flexible participation approach to open practice and blog  integration in learning and teaching seems to work, we can use this as a  good starting point in order to encourage the LLP participants into the  community and grow from their. Its may be good practice to have clear  guidelines of what to expect from the exercise, project aims and  objectives for example. Everyone should have a clear understanding of  each other's role in the project and know 'what is expected of them' in  this new domain.</p>
<p><strong>7. Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The intervention has provided a good base for me to consider how I  approach and use web 2.0 technologies in the future in practice based  learning and teaching. The blog was supplementary to other 'main' work,  therefore, low risk, it provided perfect environment for LPP and full  participation, as a first learning and teaching blogging experiment for  all students and staff I think this worked well. What became clear from  this intervention was with practice students do a great job of teaching  themselves if the right amount of peer and teacher visible support is  there.</p>
<p>It was pity the blog only ran for such a sort period of time as the  students wanted to continue, many did and continued to use the blog  after the course had finished, I had not planned for this and regret I  hadn't as I felt I had deserted the community.</p>
<p>There's an impression that using open practice, complicates teaching  and learning and is more time consuming, I hope this action research  project has helped to readdress some of these assumptions.</p>
<p>I would like to explore further the perceived power shifts explored  whilst reading Brookfield, S. (1995) between student and teacher and  relate this to the dynamics involved in open practice and how this  relates to each of Shreeve's (2008) five categories of practice. I would  also like to explore the potential of 'feed forward', use of audio and  video technologies for 'rapid generic feedback'.</p>
<p>For teachers 'approaches and conceptions of teaching' to change  regarding aligning open educational practice to match the existing  face-to-face practiced in studios, institutions would need to ensure  their teachers hold the same 'commensurate conception of teaching'  (Richardson, 2005) towards open practice as they do for current studio  practice. To achieve this the institutions at policy level would have to  adopt new 'approaches to teaching and conceptions of teaching'  themselves in the form of OEP.</p>
<p>I will conclude with a students response to question 9 (appendix 2)  Would you participate in the creation and use of online resources and  learning in future to develop your practice?</p>
<p>Yes definitely, I value this blog and process arts a lot. It is a  means to make my work more accessible within a community/group of other  artists and the world. It would be great to be able to reflect and see  my progress of becoming an artist through the years and recieve feedback  about my work via an online website.</p>
<p>We need to start looking to the future and addressing the pace and  diversity of technological developments across all aspect of our  learning and teaching now, if we don't start changing now then when?</p>

It means I can share it with my friends at school  but also  with all my friends around the world who are interested in  seeing what  I'm up to. It basically made it much easier to share with  people  whether they saw it independently in their own time and gave feed  back  or whether there was something I needed to show someone, it made  it  possible to just log on to any computer and then show then a small   clip. I also learnt how to upload video's onto youtube and use final cut   pro. Which I probably wouldn't have done if it wasn't there.</p>

<p id="ta_text.259154130-0-1387815019">Thank  you  for making this.   Sometimes I think we have too many options, for  example when we are  making a post, we can decide to post something to  the main board, our  own blog or someone else's. Maybe we should only  have the possibility to  post to our own blog?  Maybe you could tag  people in posts or videos like you can do in  facebook?  It would be  nice to have a photo album design for a post. Or to have a  link to  photo albums and videos when you go on a certain person's blog.</p>

<h3>Appendix 2</h3>
<p><strong>Staff Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Last year, We ran a pilot blog as part of my action research project - Here's a link to one of the many posts - <a href="https://owa.arts.ac.uk/owa/redir.aspx?C=2ffcbbe4b3184f3198a46426dc360bdd&URL=http://wimbledonfoundationvideoanimationfinalprojects.myblog.arts.ac.uk/2011/03/16/peeling-off-latex-cast-from-found-wood/" rel="nofollow">http://wimbledonfoundationvideoanimationfinalprojects.myblog.arts.ac.uk/2011/03/16/peeling-off-latex-cast-from-found-wood/</a> :</p>
<p>If you used the blog, could you please feedback the positive and  negative aspects of using a blog like this for students to reflect  throughout the term, for staff to communicate and view their progress  and for supporting assessment.</p>

<p>Have you ever found it difficult to communicate and keep track of  student's progress and development specifically those working in (time  based media) film, video and animation in your area?<br /> If YES how do you do this?<br /> If NO what can be done to improve this?<br /> (Shouldn't the questions be the other way round- if NO, how do you do this; if YES, what can be done to improve this?)</p>
<p>NO, I have not found it difficult- I have always encouraged students  to make showreels as this is also a good exercise for professional  practice. Now I also encourage students to put work on Vimeo as this is  easily accessible by others and a good platform for grouping an  individual's work. It can also serve as a good alternative to a website  and is more flexible and conducive for artists than You-tube. I prefer  the aesthetic.<br /> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> What barriers if any prevent you from using Web 0.2 websites and blogs in your teaching?<br /> None, other than time it would take for me to keep a blog going, and to  set up a website and maintain it although I encourage students to use  them to share information and for reflective practice. <br /> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Please indicate how you use or would like to use Web 0.2 websites, blogs or Wiki's in your teaching.<br /> See above. Blogs are good if you want to start a discussion thread or  to encourage students to reflect on their practice. Wikis can be good  for information and students can add things themselves to it so it  encourages them to be proactive around their learning and also to share  information. Web 0.2 websites as well encourage a more immediate and  communicative platform for sharing information. All these things take up  time though to set up and keep going, although once set up their  development can be left more in students' hands.<br /> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> How would you describe your online digital literacy regarding  communicating and publishing teaching materials online for blended  learning?<br /> <br /> Excellent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ()<br /> Good&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (&radic;)<br /> Average&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ()<br /> Very Poor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ()<br /> None</p>

<p>Some of my students used blogs, and they tended to be more exhaustive  than those who wrote - maybe they were more switched on students.&nbsp;  There was more integration with their visual research and their  thinking.&nbsp; However, these were few and far between.&nbsp; I think you will  only get round this problem if you made blogs mandatory, and then you  would have a problem with students who do not have their own macs/pcs,  are disorganised/dyslexic etc.&nbsp; You would have to run workshops about  how to set up blogs.&nbsp; It never failed to amaze me how many students  avoided using macs, even in vis com!&nbsp; There is always the question about  how to reach students who are not fully participating and you have to  make it work for them too, not just the switched on pro-active  students.&nbsp; You also have to ask where lecturers would have time to  scrutenise blogs.&nbsp; Some of my students who wrote blogs would send me  their links, I would have a quick look at it and think "Oh good, they're  doing this" and leave them to it.&nbsp; I would only pick up on the really  bad students who were writing diary-type, process-based blogs and not  making it sufficiently visual or self-questioning.</p>
<p>Have you ever found it difficult to communicate and keep track of  student's progress and development specifically those working in (time  based media) film, video and animation in your area?</p>
<p>If YES how do you do this?</p>
<p>There were the normal difficulties ..... students doing work away  from the studio and then turning up with a "finished piece" which has  been ill-considered, insufficiently developed, edited, story-boarded  etc.&nbsp; Specifically with film, in that there always seems to be a student  who thinks they can rush around with a camera, do a bit of editing and  then that's it! The main problem was making sure that students were well  prepared and had thought through their idea, the "feel" of their work  and how they were going to do this, the pace and narrative of their  work.&nbsp; We set up tutor groups every week where those involved in  time-based media had to bring their work, ideas, progress so far etc.&nbsp;  Student in-out was equally important in these grous.&nbsp; In the end, it  came down to the individual student, and how willing they were to listen  to advice.&nbsp; Often they realised afterwards how preparation could help  them.</p>
<p>If NO what can be done to improve this?</p>
<p>I think it comes down to the team you are working with.&nbsp; Maybe it's a  matter of discipline so that students who have not produced a  storyboard cannot borrow equipment until they've been given the go  ahead.&nbsp; Preparation is something that should be introduced from the  beginning (i.e. research, ideas, development) and there is no reason why  time based media students should be any different.&nbsp; They should go and  see the Stanley Kubrick archives at lcc and the boxes of research that  there are for one film!</p>

<p>Have you ever found it difficult to communicate and keep track of  student's progress and development specifically those working in (time  based media) film, video and animation in your area?</p>
<p>If YES how do you do this?</p>
<p>If NO what can be done to improve this?</p>
<p>On my experience, students that work with time based media tend to be  inclined to use blogging as a way of keeping a record of their  development and research.&nbsp; the blog wimbledon foundation video animation  fmp has been very effective in this respect as it has enabled not only  to maintain individual digital journal of students progress but also  facilitate communication between students and staff and enable to share  knowledge.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>What barriers if any prevent you from using Web 0.2 websites and blogs in your teaching?</p>
<p>Not always in my studio practice based teaching experience, we have  dedicated IT area easy to access for tutors during tutorials. so i  mainly had to rely on the use of college laptops which aren't always  available.&nbsp; this may at time prevent using blogs in my teaching.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Please indicate how you use or would like to use Web 0.2 websites, blogs or Wiki's in your teaching.</p>
<p>For me&nbsp; blogs and wikis as a space where students and tutors can  share knowledge and communicate in a interactive way. it is a valid and  effective tool for research, lectures and gathering development of ideas  and exchange processes of working.&nbsp; with regard to my teaching  experience with the wimbledon foundation video animation fmp it has also  being a practical tool that facilitate booking system of technical  equipment for show.</p>

<h3>Tutor 4</h3>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Have you ever found it difficult to communicate and keep track of  student's progress and development specifically those working in (time  based media) film, video and animation in your area?</p>
<p>If YES how do you do this?</p>
<p>If NO what can be done to improve this?</p>
<p>- the use of a student blog was useful to track development of  student work during self study days, but this only showed evidence of  digital/on line work. Whilst some feedback can be done via email,  one-to-one 'in the flesh' feedback is generally better for clarity - the  student can check out tutor feedback in person. The other disadvantage  is the absense of paper based sketchbooks, made objects in digital  format. Pictures may be uploaded, but these can be misleading.</p>
<p>-however for students interested in film/live performance a blog can  also compliment a paper based sketchbook. For example uploading  film/music/sound clips makes a digital sketchbook that charts the  student research journey, that works alongside the paper version.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>What barriers if any prevent you from using Web 0.2 websites and blogs in your teaching?</p>
<p>- my main barrier is the old and slow computers provided by the university.</p>
<p>-the new Foundation course is proposing the use of student blog as a  replacement to the paper based reflective journey. This may work for  some students (as mentioned above) but not others who prefer a  personalised approach rather than a standardised digital format. E.g.  the act of handwriting is important so some students. However blogs  provide an immediacy to students who often struggle with maintaining a  meaningful reflective journal.</p>
<p>- the main problem with the use of blogs will be during assessment  and tutorials where these need to be formally checked. Also during day  to day teaching a tutor will ask to see a reflective journal. With no in  studio computer provision it is difficult to check these in the context  of 'actual' teaching. Of course a tutor can check these away from the  studio, but live feedback with verbal emphasis (especially for difficult  students) still has more impact than an email.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Please indicate how you use or would like to use Web 0.2 websites, blogs or Wiki's in your teaching.</p>
<p>- I use blackboard, which is very useful to direct students towards,  placing emphasis on their responsibility to keep up to date. I think the  current policy of not printing briefs/handouts for students is a little  unfair, it also means students don't have hard copies for briefings.  The cited environmental reasoning behind this is flawed, as the paper is  still used, the only difference is the university transfers the cost of  paper and printing onto the student.</p>
<p>- Blogs for students as digital archives and places of reflection  will be useful for theatre and film students as clips of  productions/performances/films/music/moving images can form a digital  sketchbook to compliment the draw paper version. The two have to work  together as drawing is still a vital skill and means of communication of  a stage/production designer.</p>
<p>-I haven't used Wiki's as yet (unless I have without realising!)</p>
<p>- You still cannot beat live teaching, whilst on line demonstrations  have some role during self study days, for a subject area like theatre  and film, collaboration and working with others is key, and a skill I  actively teach. The 'danger' the transferring more learning on line is  the students work independently, away from college and - most basically  of all - don't learn from each other.</p>

<h3>Tutor 5</h3>
<p>Have you ever found it difficult to communicate and keep track of  student's progress and development specifically those working in (time  based media) film, video and animation in your area?</p>
<p>If YES how do you do this?</p>
<p>Students working in time based film, video and animation tend to work  more independently, and away from college. This may sometimes be due to  a lack of suitable working space in college, or, as the nature of their  practice is highly mobile, they begin to develop working patterns  involving home- working. Its crucial to break this cycle and reconnect  with a college environment as students can miss so much from peer  learning, crits, professional expertiese and feedback. Typically I would  insist on regular contact&nbsp; with my tutees in a studio envirronment so  that film/TBM/Video, can be discused/critiqued in a professional  context, and real-time reflection and development is able to take place  with advice given on documentation and contextualisation. Individual  Learning strategies are therefore crucial within this context.</p>
<p>Outside of this specific studio tutor role, there is a significant&nbsp;  and problamatic issue at assessment stage, when looking for evidence of  work, discourse and reflection&nbsp; particularly&nbsp; in time based media .The  personal/ studio tutor system is an essential&nbsp; link in deseminatiing the  range and quality of "hidden" work to the marking team. Where this  doesnt happen, the marks can be flawed, being unrepresentative of a  students abilities and progress.&nbsp; This issue was evidenced a few years  ago during assessment where the relevant studio tutor wasnt available to  make representation on behalf of their tutee as they werent in on the  day of&nbsp; team assessment. This was compounded by the student&nbsp; having had  littlr tutorial contact with others on the marking team. This particular  student had presented the bulk of their TBM work in computer file and  hadn't adequately communicated this to the marking team, appear    </div>
