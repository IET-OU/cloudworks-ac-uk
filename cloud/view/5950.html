        <p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8331/8147736741_3bd9cbaf16.jpg" alt="Learning Design: create, share, import, test, export" width="320" height="215" align="right" hspace="25" />The aim of the activity is to help you begin to think about, discuss&nbsp; and share the key features of your course or module.&nbsp; This activity is best used near the beginning of the design/ redesign process but can also be used to review an existing course or module prior to redesign.</p>
<p>There is an introductory video about the activity a bit further down this page and the card pack is available to print off <a href="https://files.pbworks.com/download/PLB2bUEfxY/jiscdesignstudio/60619333/OULDI_Pedagogic_Aspects_v8_Release.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> (pdf)</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Cut up the cards and choose a maximum of 12 which define the key features of your course/ module (either existing or planned). Just stick the ones you don't want into a pile at the side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are just having a look at the tool and are not currently designing a learning event, you may wish to use the scenario outlined below:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;<em>As part of your institution's widening participantion strand, you have been asked to design an optional 'Study skills/ preparing to learn' module. This module will be offered to all students approaching level 1 HE/ level 4 FE and 'strongly recommended' to those who feel themselves to be less confident about study at a higher level. </em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;<em>The module will be worth 10 credits (100 hours of study) and will be delivered over the summer break using a 'Blended Learning' approach. </em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;<em>Design problems include: potentially high student numbers, minimal IT support, students at risk of not completing, mixed experience of learning and technology, low learning confidence/ resilience...etc etc </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Once you have decided on 12, have a look at your cards. Are any colour of cards missing? If so, what might be the impact on student experience? Orange=Guidance and Support, Blue=Content and Experience, Green=Communication and Collaboration, Purple=Reflection and Demonstration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3. If you would like to, you can continue with your design by adding your key features to a Course Map template (<a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/OULDI/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Course-Map-Spreadsheet.xls" rel="nofollow">Excel version</a>), and begin the process of identifying the tools and resources that would best meet your design requirements.<img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/3.0/88x31.png" alt="" width="75" height="26" align="right" hspace="25" /></p>    </div>

                   <p>Hi Rebecca, nice video! really engaging!&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this video, you are using the cards for course design, I assum this will apply to curriculum/program design as well?</p>
<p>We used <a href="http://linoit.com/users/KuratiniTuwhera/canvases/5901CourseMap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Linoit&nbsp;</a>for a<a href="http://linoit.com/users/KuratiniTuwhera/canvases/5901CourseMap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> new e-learning certificate course</a> design using simillar approach, can you give us some adivse on what can be done differently?&nbsp;</p>

                   I like the consistent thought process that this imposes on course design. It's a very easy way to challenge the completeness of the design along the 4 key dimensions.        </div>

                   <p>Linoit is a nice tool we at Leicester have also usef it for this exercise. Really like the course features as I think they enable you to think about the essence of a course - what are the key principles etc.</p>        </div>

                   <p>@ Tiffany this seems like such a simple activity but in combination with the Course Map dimensions and personas it is really powerful in terms of being able to get a 'vision' of what the learning will be like. You might be interested in the OLDSMOOC design teams use of teh cards in the early design workshop we held (all in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/oldsmooc" rel="nofollow">OLDSMOOC YouTube channel</a> but scroll down for the earlier vids). The following two videos are from just one of the four workshop teams:</p>

                   <p>Really like this simple but complexly-designed approach to design. It takes into account many levels of ID decision making and is a great starting tool for designing and developing a course. I think I will use this in a current problem!</p>

                   <p>Since most of the people that I work with are in different locations, I was trying to think of the best way to do this activity with them.&nbsp; I think maybe I will send a copy of the pdf of the cards to the people I will be working with, and then set up a web meeting with them.&nbsp; I'll have my web cam overlooking my cards on my desk so that everyone can see.&nbsp; I'll just add/move/delete the cards as the group sees fit.</p>        </div>

                   <p>The video says chose "approximately 16 cards"; the text says "a maximum of 12". Not a big deal, but just thought I'd point it out.</p>
<p>Totally agree with Helen W. In terms of toner/print cartridge usage the design of the cards is SUV-style wanton waste. I hand wrote my own instead, but would be great to have a design for people who pay their own printing costs ;-)&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi all&nbsp;</p>
<p>Up to you how many cards you choose ;-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re blank ones the idea is that the cards are just suggestions, you might want to add your own words/phrases. For example in a workshop in Oz recently someone want to include elements of serendipity in her course. Also a colleague Helen Keegan has done some interesting work using Augmented Reality Games in her course and there is definitely an element of 'risk' in this course.

                   <p>Great fun. Right up my street. Posted a blog here at <a title="My mind bursts" href="http://mymindbursts.com/2013/01/26/design-learnin-activity-cards/" rel="nofollow">my mind bursts.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;(There will be several of these in due course). Also in in Linkedin group eLearning Global Network where I find myself having to try to be the educator rather than the educatee. Always a useful tactic! I think I'll go and buy a box of blank beer mats or some spray glue and card and produce a set with cards the size of place mats. Better still, stepping stones so that we can hire a gym, take our shoes off and build in a way that required physical activity and agility more akin to a game of Twister. See, it can be fun!</p>

                   <p>I'm planning to use the week 3 tools on a course next week - with real, live colleagues. Scary!</p>
<p>A few questions:</p>
<p>Is there any particular reason for selecting 12 cards initially? There is a total of 47 plus blanks. I would do two rounds of selection to get to a manageable number of cards.</p>
<p>What is meant by 'authentic' in authentic resources and authentic learning?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Niall, 12/16 is a random number - really all that intends to do it get teams thinking about what is important/ key about their design. 12 works well if you then move onto the pyramid exercise. If teams can't get it down to 12, or prefer just 5 or 8 - that's fine too.</p>
<p>We spent a long time wondering whether to put descriptors on the cards and decised against it because we found that left to their own devices teams came up with their own context specific definitions which appeared to be a good thing. As with many of these concepts, there is no clear and agreed definition of what 'authentic' means in relation to education.</p>
<p>A colleague of mine - <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/user/view/8" rel="nofollow">Simon Cross</a> - did a literature review while working on a project looking at authentic assessment (for more see his <a href="http://latestendeavour.wordpress.com/?s=authentic" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>). he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Early definitions include Wiggins who defines it as &lsquo;[the extent to which] student experience questions and tasks under constraints as they typically and &lsquo;naturally&rsquo; occur, with access to the tools that are usually available for solving such problems&rsquo;, Newmann et al. (1996), and Torrance who suggests &lsquo;[it is the] assessment tasks designed for students should be more practical, realistic and challenging than what one might call &lsquo;traditional&rsquo;&rsquo; and that it is &lsquo;a generic term&hellip; to describe a range of new approaches to assessment.&rsquo;</p>

                   <p>A few questions on the<em> Course Features</em> cards.</p>
<p>Are they at the Vision (Conceptualise) or Activities (Capture, Collaborate, Communicate, Consider) level? The activities seem to relate as follows:</p>
<div>&bull;Communication and Collaboration (Collaborate, Communicate)</div>
<div>&bull;Reflection and Demonstration (Consider)</div>
<div>&bull;Content and Experience (Capture)</div>
<p>&bull;Guidance and Support (Collaborate, Communicate)</p>        </div>

                   <p>I used the Course Features cards on a Design workshop with 11 university librarians this morning.I split the class into 3 groups and gave each a set of cards. We used the sample task on this page. I asked each group to select about 16 cards that they would use and then rank them in a diamond shape. Each group summarised its diamond on a flip chart. Interestingly, two of the groups chose very similar cards while the third was completely different. We then went on to complete a course map. This all took about 45 minutes. I could have spent longer on the course map.</p>
<p>I got a very positive response form the class. One minor negative - some participants found it difficult to distinguish the purple from the blue coloured cards.</p>

                   <p>Thank you for letting us know how you got on using these in the workshop - and thanks for the feedback on the colours. We can do something about that in the next iteration. We're there any issues with groups not understanding the terms used (eg Feed-forward, authentic etc)?</p>        </div>

                   <p>I had to explain both authentic and feed forward. There seems to be some overlap between terms eg Student choice and student autonomy are both orange cards and seem to me to mean much the same thing.</p>
<p>Blue cards (capture) cover pedagogy, delivery media and key principles perhaps these should be subdivided</p>        </div>

                   <p>I appreciate the video for a way to organize collaboration. This is particularly useful when partners value different aspects of the lessons based on what they need their students to get from the lesson to prepare for advanced learning opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach will dovetail nicely with a different project...strategic planning.</p>        </div>
