        <h2>Title &nbsp;&nbsp;Using technology to arouse interest in a research topic</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>As module leader&nbsp; for a first year undergraduate &lsquo;Research Skills&rsquo; course with a Business degree,&nbsp; I was required to assign a topic to students from which they could devise their own research questions for the semester,&nbsp; carrying out initially secondary, then some basic primary research.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>&nbsp;Sessions were programmed for a two-hour seminar, once a week for 12 weeks,&nbsp; and took place in one of the IT teaching rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Class sizes were small (approx. 10 students), &nbsp;with a highly international profile. There were 16 computer terminals arranged in rows of 4-5.&nbsp; Students&rsquo; prior experience of essay, report-writing or research would have been very much dictated by prescriptive research titles</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The challenge was to create &lsquo;buy in&rsquo; for the essentially arbitrary research topic of &lsquo;productivity&rsquo;.&nbsp; With limited time on the course, it was important that students were not only able to generate this interest,&nbsp; but that they started to work in small groups to devise their own &nbsp;research questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The task was therefore designed to stimulate early engagement in the topic,&nbsp; highlight some of the possible areas for more focussed research questions, and to create an inclusive environment for those students who would normally shy away from group discussions.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>The seminar started with eliciting definitions of &lsquo;productivity&rsquo; from students, how it might be measured and how it might be characterised differently according to job/activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was followed by a viewing of a 10 minute TED talk by Jason Fried:&nbsp; &lsquo;Why work doesn&rsquo;t happen at work?&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XD2kNopsUs" rel="nofollow">www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XD2kNopsUs</a>)&nbsp;&nbsp; Students were told their recollection of the content would be tested at the end.</p>
<p>At the end of the viewing students were invited to open an Inspiration mind-map template which I&rsquo;d previously created&nbsp; around the main points of the talk and were invited to fill in as much of the detail as possible (see figure 1)</p>
<p>Finally, students were invited to open participate in a live forum online with other members of the seminar group:</p>
<table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<div class="shape">
<p>1. &lsquo;Write a brief post (max. 100 words) on one aspect of Jason Fried's talk on productivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be something you&nbsp; agree or disagree with,&nbsp; or something you feel he has overlooked or over-simplified.&nbsp;&nbsp; State&nbsp;why you feel this way.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;When you have finished, find a post by another class&nbsp;member&nbsp;which you disagree with and respond to that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&nbsp;Results</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the elicitation stage,&nbsp; students seemed engaged and were forthcoming with their definitions of &lsquo;productivity&rsquo; so that by the time the video was shown they seemed engaged with the theme.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jason Fried&rsquo;s talk is accessible, dynamic and situates productivity in the context of the everyday office and so the task of filling in the mind-map template (post-viewing) was also carried out with some energy.</p>
<p>For the live forum discussion,&nbsp; I had left a period of 20 minutes,&nbsp; and again there was a fairly high level of activity and urgency within the room with approximately 35 posts made by 10 students, although with varying degrees of insight and frequency (see figure 2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Reflections</p>
<p><em>Student engagement</em></p>
<p>With hindsight,&nbsp; I would like to have extended the live forum activity,&nbsp; since students seemed a little reluctant to finish within the allotted time;&nbsp; this may have been some indicator of student engagement with the task.</p>
<p>All students were actively engaged with annotating the Inspiration mind-map.&nbsp; I find it hard to envisage the same level of participation among some of the same students,&nbsp; who are usually reluctant to take notes,&nbsp; around&nbsp; a paper-based activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Inclusivity</em></p>
<p>This was my first attempt at using a synchronous forum within class time;&nbsp; some of the more articulate,&nbsp; usually domineering students initially seemed frustrated at not being able to express their views orally,&nbsp; but then were amongst the most prolific posters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an exercise in inclusivity, I was interested to monitor the quality of contributions from the more retiring students;&nbsp;&nbsp; one,&nbsp; who was virtually silent in class posted the joint second highest number of responses,&nbsp; making salient points.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another posted a fairly non-critical synopsis of the talk (see figure 3)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Figure 3 - student post</strong></p>
<p>However, because I was actively involved in posting on the forum myself, it did afford the opportunity of acknowledging posts from these students.</p>
<p><em>Developments</em></p>
<p>If carrying out the task again,&nbsp; I would consider trying to structure/pre-format the threads a little more, given the limited time and to focus the discussions more thematically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any comments on further developments or perceived weaknesses gratefully received!</p>
