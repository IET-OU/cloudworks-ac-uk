        <h1>4Ts</h1>
<h2>Readability</h2>
<p>Very readable.&nbsp; Swim lane, starting at the top and moving down is a simple structure and qute easy to read.&nbsp; The bubble shapes might make adding detail a little tricky.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Expressiveness</h2>
<p>Quite expressive but everything has to fit the notation.&nbsp; Could be a difficult fit with some scenarios, particularly if there is any iteration involved or if activities can occur in different orders</p>
<h2>Utility (i.e. their usefulness in communicating important aspects of the design).</h2>
<p>Could be very useful because it is simple.&nbsp; On the other hand if the tool is to be used for sharing designs it would require all the sharers to be happy to use this rather structures approach</p>
<h2>Adequacy for my design</h2>
<p>Mu design would fit this model.&nbsp; On the other hand my design actually changes in detail each time I use it so I would need to have various versions of the design which would get clunky</p>
<h2>Benefits of using this representation for my design</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>4SPPIces Model and in LdShake</h1>
<h2>Readability</h2>
<p>As far as you can see from the diagram&nbsp; in <a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/4sppices" rel="nofollow">http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/4sppices</a>&nbsp; this is a simple, readable model of a learning process.&nbsp; Everything is there on one page, so it&rsquo;s a great summary.&nbsp; Its not so easy to see what other levels of detail exist.&nbsp; It appears that you can dive into more detail but that the detail might lose the view of the four PM, P, S H categories.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Expressiveness</h2>
<p>This seems expressive at the summary level but its hard to see how the different elements connect in the design.&nbsp; There seem to be constraints in that the designer must use the 4 categories but the relationships between them may not be obvious.&nbsp; This is in contrast to 4Ts and e-Design where relationships between swim lanes is clearer</p>
<h2>Utility (i.e. their usefulness in communicating important aspects of the design).</h2>
<p>The usefulness of this model may be more connected to the apparent ease with which learning designs may be shared between designers using the LdShake tool.&nbsp; It is hard to tell with the level of detail provided.&nbsp; You can get a better idea of what it may like to use the associated the tool from here <a href="http://ldshake.upf.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://ldshake.upf.edu/</a> .</p>
<h2>Adequacy for my design</h2>
<p>My learning design is quite flexible and can change from day to day.&nbsp; The notation would seem to accommodate this.&nbsp; On the other hand the summary does not tell you much about how the design actually works.&nbsp; So I would still prefer 4T or e-Design.</p>
<h2>Benefits of using this representation for my design</h2>
<p>This model may communicate the essence of my design well by allowing the different elements of the design to be presented.&nbsp; But the model does not easily show how my learning design would work in practice.&nbsp; I would prefer to use 4Ts as this method does not provide the detail needed to operate the method.&nbsp; There seems little room for ad hoc comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Comparison with Systems Design</h1>
<p>With systems design, there are different design notations that are closely associated with different design methodologies.&nbsp; For example object oriented systems design &nbsp;(e.g. see <a href="http://www.kilowattsoftware.com/tutorial/rooPresentation/ooFundamentals2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kilowattsoftware.com/tutorial/rooPresentation/ooFundamentals2.htm</a>) adopts a completely different notation than a more traditional approach &ndash; say SSADM (<a href="http://www2.docm.mmu.ac.uk/STAFF/M.Stanton/sad/Tutorials/DFDTutorial3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www2.docm.mmu.ac.uk/STAFF/M.Stanton/sad/Tutorials/DFDTutorial3.html</a>). &nbsp;This is because software design has changed over time and design techniques have changed to accommodate the advances in technology.&nbsp; To me the connection between learning theory and the method for communicating the design is not as developed in the examples of LD models here.&nbsp; The notation does not seem to connect explicitly with learning theory.&nbsp; 4Ts and e-Design seem convenient notations resembling process design rather than any specific learning theory.&nbsp; 4SPPIces may come closer though the theory is less familiar to me.&nbsp; Would it be better to find a theory of learning that work first and then find tools that enable the design to be created and shared second?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I have missed some obvious points&hellip;&nbsp; I wonder what others think?</p>    </div>
