        <p>Project Title &ndash; <strong><em>IncludingEverybody; A project .</em></strong></p> 

<p> A knowledge sharing series of How To guides to aid the production of accessible e-learning. </p>

<p> ‘… the future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed’ (Gibson, 2018). </p>

<p> Developments in technology are evolving rapidly and increase the means to include a diverse range of people who would not traditionally have had access to knowledge capital. Moreover, developments in mainstream consumer technologies have reduced the gap between what was specialized assistive technologies and mainstream off-the-shelf products with built-in inclusive design (James & Draffan, 2018). These technologies could benefit many, if they have digital access, are aware of them, and have the digital literacies to utilise them (McGovern, 2018). </p>

<p>The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN General Assembly, 2007) promotes, ‘the design, development, production and distribution of accessible information.’ This knowledge sharing project is prompted by a noted lack of awareness. Firstly, the World Health Organisation points out that, 
“unless professionals and people with disabilities are aware of their (assistive devices) existence, they will not benefit from them, so information sharing and awareness is vital”  (2011, p. 188) </p>
<p>
Critically engaging with the actual steps involved in  reducing exclusion is significant to addressing the reality that meeting the learning needs of some  may create barriers for others (Griful-Freixenet, et al., 2017).  
Doing this also important for people who experience exclusion from mismatched human interactions, from a temporary injury or context, or from a situation (Microsoft, 2016). Potentially us all, in fact.  </p>

<p>The IncludingEverybody project will create and disseminate video tutorials of the step-by-step process involved in creating accessible and inclusive digital artefacts in popular medias. An associated blog will provide the same information in textual and liner form, offering a different but equivalent representation of the same information. The blog will also function as a live e-curation resource with hyperlinks and multimedia resources embedded, a reference list, and a comments section to allow interaction and user generated content. Each shared artefact will carry a CC-BY-SA licence with attribution to IncludingEveryone@hotmail.com.</p>

<p>The first phase of the IncludingEveryone project and conference presentation focuses on what content creators need to know about inclusive design and accessibility in various medias. This is an important area as knowing ‘how to’ increase usability and accessibility of digital resources may have a significant impact on how effectively they convey the intended information.</p>    </div>

<h1>IncludingEveryone</h1>
<h2>An implementation of a &lsquo;How To&rsquo; knowledge sharing project on Inclusive practices</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;by</h2>
<h2>Cathy McGovern.</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h1>Why the IncludingEveryone Project?</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;&lsquo;&hellip; the future is already here &mdash; it&rsquo;s just not very evenly distributed&rsquo; (Gibson, 2018).</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h1>What is the project about?</h1>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating digital 'How To' open education resources (OER) which both illustrate and embody inclusive design elements.</h2>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; An accompanying blog which details and explores the process.</h2>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of networking and social medias to highlight and disseminate useful digital practices.</h2>
<h1>What is good now</h1>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing awareness of diversity of learners needs, context, preferences.</h2>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Built in accessibility&nbsp; E.g. Microsoft, Apple, Android.</h2>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Universal Design for Learning.</h2>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inclusive Design.</h2>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social media as voice for those previously voiceless.</h2>
<h1>But</h1>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accessibility, usability, and inclusive design considerations are complicated</h2>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users need to be involved.</h2>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standards do not address all issues.</h2>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legislative compliance problematic.</h2>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any solution for one may cause difficulties for others.</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h1>What could be</h1>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inclusive practices as habit.</h2>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accessibility and user choice the norm.</h2>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Content creators create digital artefacts that use good practices.</h2>
<h2>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Easily accessible, up to date information.</h2>
<h1>#IncludingEveryone</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Social Media to</h2>
<h2>Create and curate engagement and support just in time learning.</h2>

                   <p>Hello</p>
<p>It is really good to learn that you are working for the inclusion of the excluded ones. Your project seems to guide content creators. I also liked the idea of e-curation! This collaborative activity will help to gather a lot, hopefully!</p>
<p>Which platform are you thinking to prepare a blog? Will it be an open access blog? What approaches are you thinking to network and approach the content creators?</p>

                   <p>I like your theme Cathy, and you seem to have had a bit more success with your Sway poster :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The future is indeed here but as well as distribution we have these kind of problems.&nbsp;https://www.scottishhousingnews.com/article/scottish-areas-among-uk-s-worst-for-broadband-speeds</p>
<p>However, i always get some consolation from the fact that many of 'my' teachers who used to 'hoard' knowledge to themselves as a way of showing authority are now struggling to keep up. I had the 'pleasure' recently of doing some 'supply' teaching in my old secondary school. As a pupil there was one very 'closed' teacher in the Technical Dept. (woodwork) - he was never slow at making you feel 'stupid' if you didnt know something. This particular teacher was still at the school, close to retiral, but still there. He didnt remember me but i very much enjoyed showing him that there was more than one kind of web browser when he was in the staff room and asked generally why he couldnt access a particular programme. He was very grateful to me when i sopened showed him Google Chrome :). The point is that sharing is good and the more evenly the distribution the better in my opininion. I am looking forward to your presentation.</p>

                   <p>An ambitious and worthwhile project. Do you have a target audience in mind? I can see that this would be very useful for university lecturers. I think it is an excellent idea to havea blog and user-generated content as well, because I would imagine that new content creation tools come on the scene all the time. Or perhaps this is less of an issue if content generaters are following a set of accessibility principles?&nbsp;</p>
<p>After writing this post I have just viewed the SWAY poster which makes things very clear. I like the optional resources you have included. The Inclusive Practice Pyramid is an extremely helpful model. In my university all tutors have to upload their tutorial and lecture content in advance. Universal design principles in action, benefitting all students.</p>        </div>

                   <p> Hi Munir, </p>
<p> Thank you for your feedback. Congratulations on being able to decipher what I wrote when it was one large block of text! I’ve just learnt how to format paragraphs, thanks Bina! </p>

<p> Thank you for the very relevant questions about networking practices and a platform for the blog.</p> 
<p> My consideration of the networking for the project was informed by the Economic and Social Research Council’s Impact toolkit (the Economic and Social Research Council, 2019). Although developed for social researchers, it proved useful for me in developing the project’s communication and networking strategy. </p>

<p> Regarding Platforms, hoisting etc, I've no experience in this so it has been a huge learning curve. I should ask Simon for a chat while I have access to such a font of experience and expertise…Right now I’m stuck in the complexity of finding a platform and all associated that has good accessibility features as being fully accessibility is a guiding principle of this project.  I'm considering Wordpress with a template which meets their ‘Accessibility Ready’ criteria. I haven’t yet settled on a host. Any advice which takes those pre requests into consideration is welcome.</p>

                   <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>Thank you for your feedback. Ireland too has a huge digital divide of who can and can’t get decent internet access.  I’ll do a ‘How To’ resource on creating versions of resources which work even for those with limited data allowances or/and bandwidth. </p>
<p>I completely agree that sharing is good. I absolutely love that moment when a person such as your former teacher learn something useful and they realise that they now know a way of doing something they couldn’t before. Maybe there is hope, even for him? Never Say No, right? </p>
<p>I’m delighted that H818 is structured in a way that allows me to get better at sharing well.  I haven’t been learning to amass an amount of knowledge. I use what I learn but at the moment it only has limited local impact on students like the NEET students you have focused on.  </p>
<p>I'm hopeful that sharing through IncludingEveryone will be a lifelong project that saves my sanity and reduce the risk that I burn out or give up. I'm also aware that I have very little to lose by giving away my knowledge, others may have. </p>
<p>I too am looking forward to your presentation, I’ll comment in your cloud shortly. </p>

                   <p>Hi Bernadette, </p>
<p>Thanks so much for your enthusiasm for my project. It is very ambitious, but I do have the rest of my life to work on it.  I always aim for where I want to get to, the idea being that I may fail but at least I’ll be closer to my goal and have learnt along the way.  </p>
<p>This phase is targeting content creators in general but with a particular intention of being tested on my campus’s lecturing staff. It will be focused on their needs, and preferred resource types. I'm providing staff training in accessibility in June so I’m building up a bank of resources and need to have the infrastructure of the blog developed by then. I’ll take feedback and then disseminate iterations on Twitter and through  professional group mailing lists etc. </p>
<p>I believe that what is needed is that, as you suggest, content generators follow a set of accessibility principles. Hopefully, as time goes on, I’ll be showcasing less ‘How-To-Fix- it-To be Accessible’ and more, ‘Look How Easy it is to make it Accessible’ type resources ….</p>
<p>You’re very perceptive, yes, the almost constant development of new tools and even updates will require new resources. I want to design the IncludingEveryone blog so it can become a hub of shared experiences, resources and advice. A parallel stream is learner ‘How to’ resources. </p>

                   <p>Just wanted to add how important this subject is Cathy. How often do you come across barriers to accessiblity for your students, it seems there are a lot of considerations for different disability types. I had to scan some textbooks for a blind student and my inbuilt urge to make it look good was in effect, pointless, as the scan only needed to be suitable for screen reading software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran into accessiblity problems with my poster design also as Simon pointed out that embedded video in pdfs was going to cause problems for some screen readers so I reformatted as a video poster.</p>
<p>I think your idea of using Wordpress initially is probably a good one as it is easy to quickly set-up and get your ideas down whilst researching if there is another platform that you can migrate it to later.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Very interested in this project as I openly admit that accessibility is a weakness of mine. I also, feel it is potentially a weakness in Further Education, bar the few that do it well. It seems that it needs a driver, a passionate individual to lead. Without that I wonder if accessibility just tags along as and when.</p>
<p>I hope to gain some great tips.</p>        </div>

                   <p>This is a great topic, well done for tackling it.</p>
<p>I think that there is so much more that we all could be doing to improve accessibility. "It takes too much time" or&nbsp; "It's too difficult" seem to be common excuses that I get for not making accessible content so anything which can help to eliminate these excuses is great. I really like the idea of using social media to promote and share content.</p>        </div>

                   Great questions,
I'm going to take each one at a time.

I'm delighted that Wendy has been using Microsoft's Read aloud. This is a great example of how Microsoft's move towards built-in accessibility can be useful to many, as well as necessary for some. Read Aloud seems to be improving every update as they add features to the immersive reading toolbar such as line focus.         </div>

                   Great questions,
I'm going to take each one at a time.

I'm delighted that Wendy has been using Microsoft's Read aloud. This is a great example of how Microsoft's move towards built-in accessibility can be useful to many, as well as necessary for some. Read Aloud seems to be improving every update as they add features to the immersive reading toolbar such as line focus.         </div>
