        <p>In a <a href="http://janeknight.typepad.com/socialmedia/2009/11/social-media-for-learning-part-2.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blogpost </a>by Jane Hart, she suggests another way of categorising learning situations/contexts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rather than use the broad categories of formal and informal learning - terms which I think are&nbsp; pretty difficult to grasp, and which are being confused and abused if phrases I have read like "managing informal learning information" are anything to go by! - I have decided to categorise the use of social media in the following 5 different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>IOL - Intra-Organisational Learning</strong> - how social media     tools can be used to keep employees up to date and up     to speed on strategic and other internal initiatives</li>
<li><strong>FSL - Formal Structured Learning </strong>- how educators (teachers, trainers, learning designers) as well as students can use social media within education and training - for courses, classes, workshops etc</li>
<li><strong>GDL - Group Directed Learning</strong> - how groups of individuals     - teams, projects, study groups etc - can use social media to work     and learn together (a "group" could just be two people, so coaching     and mentoring falls into this category)</li>
<li><strong>PDL - Personal Directed Learning</strong> - how individuals can     use social media for their own (self-directed) personal or     professional learning</li>
<li><strong>ASL - Accidental &amp; Serendipitous Learning</strong> - how     individuals, by using social media, can learn without consciously     realising it (aka incidental or random learning)</li>
</ol>
<p>It may well be that these categories will need tweaking or even overhauling completely, but here is my first attempt at how social media can be used in these 5 categories, which will be a work in progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harold Jarche takes these thoughts and puts them in a diagram in a follow-up <a href="http://www.jarche.com/2009/11/social-media-and-self-directed-learning/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blogpost</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This had me thinking about how best to explain these categories to clients and folks not immersed in social media and learning. I started by looking at it as a 2&times;2 matrix, but of course there are five categories, so that wouldn&rsquo;t work. However, the axes of the amount of direction versus group size made sense to me, so I created the diagram below. What jumped out at me after the fact, and I&rsquo;ve highlighted in red, is that social media for learning requires a lot of self-directed learning, either individually or as a participant in a group/organization. Externally directed learning (FSL) is only one of five possibilities. Good food for thought on the future role of the &ldquo;training&rdquo; department, isn&rsquo;t it?"</p>
</blockquote>

			<p>I was very interested when I saw Jane's work a couple of days ago as it relates directly to a discussion I had a couple of days previously with my DPhil supervisor. See my <a href="http://lizit.me.uk/2009/11/16/buzzing-with-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog</a>. I have been reading around the formal/informal/non-formal literature for the last few months and getting less and less happy about what I have been reading. Not least because of the degree of confusion over terminology and whether it refers to a learning style, a learning context, learning content, etc, etc. What I proposed to my supervisor was a 5 part categorisation of other-directed, self-directed, incidental, serendipitous, social. On further reflection, I was unhappy with social as a category, mainly because 'social learning' is a current buzz word, but also because social seemed to be at a different level, as captured in the idea of individual, group and organisation suggested by Harold.</p>
<p>Having done a bit more reading around self-directed learning, I am not happy with that, mainly because it is a concept which appears to have changed in meaning considerably over time and lost some of the sense of the self-taught learner outside the institution which it originally had. I am veering towards self-initiated and other-initiated, with sub-categories of intentional, incidental and accidental. I will be doing more work around this and am very interested to know more about what others are thinking.</p>
<p>The recent blogs by <a href="http://www.pontydysgu.org/2009/11/user-generated-content-user-generated-contexts-and-learning/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Graham Attwell</a>, <a href="http://www.social-elearning.de/?p=63" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tillman Swinke</a> and <a href="http://steve-wheeler.blogspot.com/2009/11/hanging-in-there.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steve Wheeler</a> are also very relevant to this topic.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
