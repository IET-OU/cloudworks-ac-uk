        <p><strong>The 4T's model&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Readability&nbsp;-</strong>I think the 4T's model is easy to understand as a template and as a shared learning design for the healthy eating session. &nbsp;It is familiar as is similar to formats of lesson planning I am used to using.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Expressiveness-</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>the use of swim lanes, with colour coded flow chart style boxes, circles and key words make it really easy to visualise, understand and communicate.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Utility -</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>I think this would be highly usable, as it would be easy for others to share and contribute to, easy for others review and easy to adapt if you wanted to adapt the design for your own lesson. &nbsp;That said there may be gaps in what it covers, for example, it doesn't take account of the history/context of the design, formative or summative assessment methods or any differentiated activity required for different students. &nbsp;Neither would it be as useful for designing purly online content such as e-learning content where&nbsp;there isn't this range of activities, with a teacher and other students.</p>
<p><strong>Are they adequate for expressing your design? </strong>Yes it is similar to the lesson plan I used for designing my session.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What would be the benefits of using these representations for your design? Please explain your views. </strong>It would be easy to put together, to use and adapt for future sessions. It also includes a more reference to the output resources required. &nbsp;This may have helped me explicitly identify what outputs each team member had to create in order for the session to be deemed successful.</p>
<p><strong>e-Design template&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Readability- </strong>I think the e-design template is easy to follow and understand. It is familiar as it take a scaffold style approach, providing more scaffolding to start with and less as the session or course develops.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Expressiveness- </strong>The use of boxes arranged in step formation are easy to understand, with clear headings and summaries, arrows and a timeline below.</p>
<p><strong>Utility-</strong>I think it could be useful as an overarching design view.&nbsp; To highlight the gradual supported development of independent learning. Or to support use of online discussions or online collaborative activities where more support would be needed at the start then less moving forward. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t however provide space for any details in terms of exactly what activities a student and teacher would do within different sessions.&nbsp; It also looks as if learning is one steady flow from supported to independent, however, in reality this is likely to transition between supported and less supported throughout the students journey. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are they adequate for expressing your design? </strong>I wouldn&rsquo;t have used this to design my session with, as I didn&rsquo;t feel it provide enough detail in terms of specific activities.&nbsp; I would however use this to help describe an overarching aim for supporting the team in becoming proficient in designing their own blended learning solutions &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What would be the benefits of using these representations for your design? </strong><strong>Please explain your views. </strong>The key benefit here is the reinforcement of the idea and aim for students to become self-organised, the ease of use of the template and adaptability to different sessions. &nbsp;</p>    </div>
