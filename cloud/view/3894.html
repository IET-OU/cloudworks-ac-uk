        <p>As the above title indicates, this presentation falls within a larger theoretical debate on the &lsquo;construction of the other.&rsquo; The story I intend to narrate is complex and fuzzy, and trying to untangle the knots has proven to be challenging. However, my aim is to try and untangle these knots in order to present a coherent narrative of an oppressed group which has been muted by the way certain historical and socio-political processes have taken place. This is the story of older lesbians within one of the most important spheres of life &ndash; the domestic unit. The main strands of this story are: place, age, gender and sexuality.</p>
<p>Firstly, the literature around the domestic unit is couched in a patriarchal and heteronormative discourse, where the latter assumes that heterosexuality is the only natural way of being. It further romanticises the home as a: place of rest and love, private unit, and sanctuary. Instantly, this poses some questions on the meaning of the home for those who do not experience home in such a way: domestic violence, homosexuality, disability, older people etc. Secondly, the kitchen features much less within the rhetoric of the home. When it does, it takes on a feminised face and is seen as an oppressive site for women. Critics, from various disciplines trace this oppression in the dominant ideology of patriarchy. For lesbians, patriarchy is part of the story. Another layer needs to be added, that of the dominant ideology of heteronormativity. Lesbian homes can become visual markers within a homophobic community and may become the target of homophobic attacks and vandalism. Thirdly, ageism is another layer that needs to be taken into consideration in this discussion. Finally, the voices of older lesbians have never been included in the limited research there is on kitchens.</p>
<p>It starts to become clear that there is a need to include the kitchen within the rhetoric of the domestic sphere, from a physical, ideological and experiential perspective. However, <em>I contend that the meaning of the kitchen in the lives of older lesbians is not a mirror-image of the experience of older women.</em> The meaning of the kitchen in the lives of older lesbians may be a site for knowledge and empowerment (Abraca 2006). It can turn into a transgressive political place where the ordinary is contested.</p>    </div>

    
<h2 id="extra-content">Extra content</h2>

			<p><strong>Alison Davies and Rachel Scicluna</strong></p>
<p>They would be presenting together and it is called the multiple voices of Ideology. And the questions would a group session.</p>
<p>Rachel is going to start.</p>
<p>She is showing a picture of society as represented as tangled knots such as religion, kinship, economy, ideology and politics. There are ideologies that we take for granted &ndash; that ideologies have the power to construct the historical events.</p>
<p>They would be talking about vulnerable groups: Alison on ageing and herself on lesbians in domestic units. They would be looking at how powers function in society and how the myths from dominant ideology exist in the society (?). Holistic view on how society functions.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel begins now</strong></p>
<p>She is part of a larger project looking at older women transitioning in kitchen living. The research team is from the OU (cultural aspect) and Loughborough (ergonomics and design)</p>
<p>Aims</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s memories of past kitchen &ndash; hoping to design a kitchen for anyone at any age</p>
<p>It is an under-developed area of the story. There are histories of the kitchen not just the history kitchen. She wants to see how stereotypes stem out of heteronormativity and dominant ideology.</p>
<p>Research questions</p>
<p>What is the meaning of the kitchen in the lives of older lesbians? (past/present/future)</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>Her methodology is eclectic she is hoping to have informal conversations as well as volunteering (such as age concern which provides help to the LGBT community). As well as in-depth interviews into the architects and older lesbians. She wants her participants to dig up their photo albums to see pictures of their past kitchens, as well as drawings.</p>
<p>Approach</p>
<p>Her approach is going to be inter-disciplinary &ndash; including sexuality, gerontology, architecture, anthropology, gender (showing a venn diagram of all these parts &ndash; and saying she will be intersecting all of these).</p>
<p>In the literature there is nothing about the kitchen and homosexuality and although some anthropologists (?) came across this they didn&rsquo;t note them down because they didn&rsquo;t think it was important. She is also saying that &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; as being lesbian etc. would influence how kitchens have changed or used (?) &ndash; over the ages.</p>
<p>She shows a picture of an older woman and a younger woman. She is saying our ideology would think it is a grandmother with her daughter/ grand-daughter. But it could be her lover, lesbian etc.</p>
<p>Analytical framework</p>
<p>Maybe in older lives of lesbians that the kitchen might not be as a subversive place as seen by the heterosexual females.</p>
<p>Kitchen space as a subversive syncretic place: Subversive as transgressive and political and Syncretic as voices of different co-existing ideologies. Perhaps for the older lesbians this might be an empowering place (?) &nbsp;</p>
<p>We tend to homogenise our thoughts and action when we use the dominant ideology of heteronormativity (i.e. everyone is heterosexual):</p>
<p>This creates tunnel vision and stereotypes on different levels of society (nuclear family, home as sanctuary, kitchens as a hub).</p>
<p>Histories of the kitchen</p>
<p>Showing a picture of a nuclear family in a nice, airy kitchen. How did kitchens come about? In the Victorian era, the kitchen was a terrible place since servants slept in the kitchen or in the cupboards under the stairs (in large houses) and they were not part of the house (part of basements, separated from the building).</p>
<p>Showing now a design of the Victorian kitchen &ndash; also, noted that some of the workers were child labourers.</p>
<p>Kitchen as a hub is a very working class ritual &ndash; and the reason was because it was focal point of the house since it had a welcoming fire and where the sick were nursed.</p>
<p>During the industrial revolution, women became emancipated (?) &ndash; the continuous kitchen was designed in 1930 i.e. the sink, stove, countertop were continuous in a u-shape to be more efficient &ndash; women became free to become better housewives not so much emancipated</p>
<p>Experiences of the kitchen are not homogenous &ndash; they&rsquo;re different. The experience of home-making for older lesbian women may not be the mirror-image of heterosexual women.</p>
<p>Some of the questions she&rsquo;ll be looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li>How was the kitchen and kitchen table used in the 1970s/1980s by older lesbians? (missed the rest).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>She is recommending some literature on the anti-social family (?) &ndash; some person called Macintosh (?) &ndash; who criticises the ideology of a nuclear family (?).</em></p>
<p>In the 1970s there was a lot talking about kitchens but now it has stopped.</p>
<p><em>Another reference for you is Iris Manning Young &ndash; feminist point of view on houses (?)</em></p>
<p><em>I was wondering about the context of space for kitchens such as in rural Scotland where one room was for everything. There is something about when did the kitchen become separate. Is it not more than a kitchen? It is not a living space? It has now changed back into open-plan space. I&rsquo;m wondering how do women organise their kitchen space as opposed to those who live with men.</em></p>
<p>That is exactly what I&rsquo;m tracing. Our homes are no longer private because we&rsquo;re bringing home work etc. &ndash; these things have been looked at but not from a homosexual position.</p>
