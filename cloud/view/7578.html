        <p align="center"><strong>Carolyn&rsquo;s scenario for the development of a webinar design guide </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>(time taken: 40 minutes)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Brainstorm components of your scenario</strong></p>
<div align="center"><hr align="center" size="2" width="100%" /></div>
<p><br /><strong>Actors: </strong><em>(who is involved?) </em></p>
<p>Matteo and Emily are policy analysts. They write policies and reports for the government of Ontario and often give presentations and run training sessions about them.&nbsp; There has been a lot of community interest in a recent report about human rights, mental health and addictions.&nbsp; In fact, there has been so much interest that Matteo and Emily can&rsquo;t accommodate most of the training requests they are getting.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the training requests are coming from organizations that work in the mental health field, or who work with people with mental health issues.&nbsp; Interest has also been expressed by lawyers, not for profit organizations, healthcare workers, and employers. Matteo and Emily decide to run a webinar that people across the province can attend, to meet the need for training that they can&rsquo;t do in person.<br /><br /><strong>Goals:</strong><em> (why?) </em></p>
<p>Emily and Matteo want to train as many people as possible about the findings in the report, to meet the needs of the community and also to effect change for people with mental health and addiction issues.</p>
<p>The designer wants to ensure that the method of instruction is engaging and effective, since Emily and Matteo do not have a background in education or instructional design. <br /><br /><strong>Settings:</strong><em> (where &amp; when?) </em></p>
<p>The webinar will be run from a conference room at Emily and Matteo&rsquo;s workplace.&nbsp; All design work will also take place at the office.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Objects:</strong><em> (what things are involved?) </em></p>
<p>Adobe Connect software (already purchased), computers with microphones and speakers, internet connection, phone line, IT team (not an object!), prepared presentation, script, links, etc.<br /><br /><strong>Actions:</strong><em> &nbsp;(what do actors do?) </em></p>
<p>Emily and Matteo discuss their audience&rsquo;s needs with the designer. There will be between 75 and 100 participants.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a diverse audience, so the webinar will have to be broad-reaching yet engaging for everyone.&nbsp; Emily and Matteo provide the designer with the content they would like to discuss during the webinar. <br /><br /><strong>Events:</strong><em> (what happens to actors?) </em></p>
<p>The designer realizes that creating a custom webinar for each policy or report will be time consuming.&nbsp; A better option would be preparing a guide for policy analysts and her other colleagues on how to deliver an engaging and effective webinar.&nbsp; This step-by-step guide would need to take into account different scenarios, such as the length of the webinar, number of participants, type of audience (employers, members of the general public) etc.&nbsp; The designer figures that the best type of guide might be in a webinar format, so that Emily and Matteo get to participate in a webinar and experience it as audience members before delivering one.<br /><br /><strong>Results:</strong><em> (what is achieved?) </em><br /><br /></p>
<p>Using the designer&rsquo;s webinar guide, Matteo and Emily prepare and deliver their first webinar.&nbsp; The webinar is delivered live, but also recorded so that it can be posted on the website for those who missed it.&nbsp; They used their knowledge from the guide to illicit audience participation, and most audience members were actively engaged in the webinar.&nbsp; They were able to train the participants about the content of the report, and gain insight from participants about how it will be applied in their work.&nbsp; They get feedback from the participants, which is mainly positive.&nbsp; Constructive feedback will be used to further improve the webinar guide for the development of future training sessions.<br /><br /><strong>Your design: </strong><em>(what role does your design play?) </em></p>
<p>My colleagues are capable of developing a standard training webinar, based on their live training sessions. However, a live training session won&rsquo;t translate well into webinar format, especially for longer sessions.&nbsp; In addition, Emily and Matteo are not aware of the features available in webinar software, which can be used as alternative ways to engage learners.&nbsp; My team&rsquo;s design will help them put their training content into a webinar design a webinar that is interesting, interactive, engaging and meets their audience&rsquo;s learning needs.&nbsp; The webinar design guide can be used by anyone to design and develop a pedagogically sound webinar, using existing content.</p>    </div>

                   <p>Hi&nbsp;Carolyn,</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0mm; margin-right: 0mm; margin-bottom: 18.0pt; margin-left: 0mm; line-height: 13.5pt;">I've just been browsing scenarios to get an idea of how they work and read yours. I'm inexperienced at this but thought it would be nice to leave a comment anyway. &nbsp; Your scenario demonstrates the value of this technique in that it is involving (start to care about Emily and Matteo and want them to achieve their goals). &nbsp;Although it is from an area of activity that I am unfamiliar with it immediately starts to makes sense. &nbsp;Will you also develop a scenario or scenarios about the use of the standard training webinar? &nbsp;Like imagining it has been set up and then imagining various ways in which it can be used?</p>

                   <p>Hi Gill,</p>
<p>Thank you for your comment, it is helpful to know that my scenario makes sense!&nbsp; Creating&nbsp;one or more&nbsp;"follow-up" scenarios about the&nbsp;webinar training in use is a good idea. I think it will help me develop&nbsp;the training&nbsp;objectives and tune into the needs of my users in a more practical way.&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Hi Carolyn, thank you for posting your scenario...I've been struggling to get my head around how to do it and this has helped me a great deal. Also, it's great to be working on the same project as yourself.&nbsp;<br />Once a week I deliver webinars for the Australia e-Series using Blackboard Collaborate. After 25 years of f to f teaching I found online teaching/facilitation to be exciting, rewarding and frustrating at times. Does your training guide for Emily and Matteo include scenarios for when technical issues arise, which they inevitably do. Bandwith problems, checking audio, whiteboard hickups etc. Having a guide in webinar format is great, Emily and Matteo can see how it works for themselves. I think it would be good for them to also experience the facilitation of a webinar, give them moderator privilages, before the event. Will they have a co-moderator with them during the real time training sessions?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carolyn this is great, as I chat here I'm thinking about my scenario...look forward to working with you. Can you cross post this into our Project wiki?&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thank you Penny!&nbsp; And thanks for setting up the Wiki - I've just posted my scenario there.&nbsp; I think I will work on a second scenario tonight, which will describe the training "in-use".&nbsp; We are fortunate to have an IT team on hand if and when&nbsp;technical hiccups happen, but now that you've mentioned it I think I will incorprate that into the training anyway.&nbsp; I think it will help the confidence levels for the trainers, with the added plus of more hands on deck when issues arise.&nbsp; I am hoping that there will be two moderators for each session, but that will depend on our resources as well as the number of participants.&nbsp; The training will have to be flexible, to allow for variations depending on these and other factors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to reading your scenario next!&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>I really like the way your scenario captures a very broad range of potential participants in the proposed webinar, Carolyn and examines not only how your two &nbsp;main actors could be supported in addressing this breadth of audience but also recognises that personalising the approach for each report would be time consuming. Are you thinking about offering any asynchronous training, too - for example, recording webinars and offering a discussion forum?</p>
<p>Thanks for getting me thinking about this.</p>

                   <p>Hi Lesley,</p>
<p>Thank you for your comments, you're right on the money with regards to needing asynchronous training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just finished the OULDI facilitation card exercise, which helped me to focus a bit more on the needs of my learners (colleagues).&nbsp; I'm completely re-thinking the idea of using a webinar as a training format, mainly because I'm worried that my colleagues will have to review the webinar everytime they want to develop their own webinar trainings, which could only be a few times a year.&nbsp; Now I'm thinking that a printable guide or presentation might be more useful, as it can be referred to whenever needed.&nbsp; This would be accompanied by a one-time face-to-face session where we would practice using the Adobe webinar software, and where each learner would get a chance to facilitate a mock webinar with their colleagues as practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case, there are only 50 people in my office so a discussion form isn't necessary, but I think it would be a good idea for a larger community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Carolyn</p>
