			<p>Hi I'm Gr&aacute;inne Conole and I am a professor of e-learning at the Open University. I have a broad range of interests around exploring the use of technology for learning and teaching. This includes learning design work - ie the development of tools, methods, activities and resources to help teachers make more informed choices about using technologies and creating pedagogically effective learning activities. I have also done research looking at the student experience of using technologies. More generally I also have an interst in research methodology and ICT, evaluation and policy/strategy perspectives. See my <a href="/user/view/3" rel="nofollow">profile</a> for more information. I also have a blog <a href="http://www.e4innovation.com" rel="nofollow">www.e4innovation.com.</a> Some of my publications are available <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/cgi/search/simple?screen=Public::EPrintSearch&_action_search=Search&meta_merge=ALL&meta=&person_merge=ALL&person=conole&date=&satisfyall=ALL&order=-date/creators_name/title" rel="nofollow">here</a>.I am very much looking forward to the workshop and to meeting everyone! It provides a great opportunity to share the tools we have been developing and get feedback on the value/use.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Greetings! I'm Sylvia Currie and I work at <a href="http://bccampus.ca" rel="nofollow">BCcampus</a> to design, support, and manage the network of online communities. I've always had a strong interest in finding ways to represent teaching designs and practices in a way that is context rich and reusable by others. Content repositories leave me cold! :-)&nbsp; I want those rich activity descriptions that include reflections on what worked and what didn't. I spent some time (a long time ago) researching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-based_reasoning" rel="nofollow">case-based reasoning</a> as a way to achieve this. Now looking at the workshop description I'm excited about the possibilities of the tools we will be exploring for sharing learning and teaching designs and ideas.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

I am the coordinator for &nbsp;ETUG and our annual workshop events. This year's learning design theme is so intriguing especially when viewed from a variety of perspectives. I'm particularly interested in looking at how we can design the best learning experiences for &nbsp;f2f and online environments and blend what we know from each to maximize interest and ongoing engagement for participants who come to our workshops.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>I'm Gina Bennett &amp; I coordinate distance learning activities for College of the Rockies. We are a small &amp; very rural community college in the heart of the Rocky Mountains. To increase access to our students we offer a lot of online courses &amp; we are one of the most technologically-outfitted colleges in the system so I am kept pretty busy (there is a certain amount of 'putting-out-fires' sort of work involved). What do I hope to get out of this workshop? New ideas about learning design, new approaches for working with learners, new avenues for increasing access to education beyond the Academy.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>I&rsquo;m Meg Goodine, Learning Technologies Manager at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. My role involves supporting faculty at various levels of integrating technology into their teaching. With many new degrees and programs being developed at Kwantlen and more of an appetite for looking at flexible delivery, I am very interested in design models that will help us move beyond the tendency to dump some PowerPoints into Moodle, add a discussion forum, and call it an online or web enhanced course.&nbsp; A tool that helps faculty, especially those who are new to designing for an online environment, to better understand and visualize the design process sounds very promising. I&rsquo;m looking forward to having a chance to explore it.<br /><br />I am also currently researching e-portfolio practices and tools as part of my final research paper to complete RRU&rsquo;s&nbsp; MA in Learning and Technology program.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Hello, I'm Carolyn Levy and I work as an instructional (learning?) designer on contract here in Vancouver, BC. Most recently, I've been working with Open School BC on a number of projects but am also working with private organizations to design and develop f-2-f and e-learning training. I'm most interested in learning more about new learning design ideas and also to hear from other designers about what's working and what's not. I'm really looking forward to the opportunity to discuss learning design as a practice. My interests lie in systems theory and instructional design as well as the role of the ID in facilitating the design and development of courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond my life as an ID, I'm completely besotted with food and I'm working with an online cooking school that feeds my need to talk about food at any opportunity.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Hi there! I'm Sarah Wareing. I am the coordinator for the new Diploma in Emergency and Security Management at the Justice Institute of British Columbia. What does a coordinator do? A bit of everthing:&nbsp;advise students, hire faculty, market the program, schedule the program, develop curriculum, and teach two or three courses. We've recently decided to put the program completely online, so I get to create that too, and since none of the courses have been taught face-to-face yet, we're starting completely from scratch. I used to be fairly up to speed on what was going on with technology and education and online learning, but for the three years prior to taking on this&nbsp;new program, I was coordinating a community-based program that was all face-to-face, so I'm feeling a bit behind the wave. I'll be working with instructors to design all the courses, so I'm looking forward to learning about some new tools and hearing about how others are using technology.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Hi! I'm Cindy Underhill and I'm a Learning Resource Designer with the Office of Learning Technology at the University of British Columbia. I'm interested in the concept of personal learning environments - mainly in the process of learners constructing their own - from imagining their goals and aspirations to identifying the resources and tools that can support their learning and development. Technology is an important enabler but (for me) the heart of the matter is the decision making process and reflection about the learning environment I am creating and participating in.&nbsp; Most of the work I do is to support "informal" learning environments.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>HI!&nbsp; My name is Amanda Coolidge and I am a Technical Advisor at BCIT's Learning and Teaching Centre.&nbsp; I am relatively new to Vancouver, officially one year old!&nbsp; Prior to moving to Vancouver I was workin in Kenya with the Open University, UK, the African Virtual University and the BBC on an OER project, <a href="http://www.tessafrica.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TESSA</a>.&nbsp; I was the Senior Educational Technologist on the TESSA Project, which is an OER portal for Teacher Educators across Sub Saharan Africa. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, as a Technical Advisor at BCIT I liase with instructors across the Institute, introducing them to various educational technologies, brainstorming solutions for their classroom, and teach a variety of hands on educational technology workshops.&nbsp; I have also had the fortunate opportunity to project manage three, 3D modelling projects- which I will be discussing with Tannis Morgan at her session on Wed. morning.</p>
<p>I am really looking forward to connecting with various ETUG members, as I am a new committee member on ETUG.&nbsp; I love the networking opportunities that the workshops provide and the opportunity to get away from the office and be engaged in LEARNING with my colleagues.&nbsp; I hope to gain some further insight into learning design, the principles, processes, and outcomes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting everyone!</p>

			<p>Hello, my profile says I'm an Anthony, but call me Tony.</p>
<p>I've always been a Geek, since 1972 in fact, in the dark beginnings when computers ran on diesel engines ;-) Now in 2009, it&rsquo;s simply miraculous where computing has come. What mind-blowing advances have been made! Consequently, via the burgeoning power of the internet and shift in my interests over the years, my career has morphed into educational technology.</p>
<p>I have also become an idealist in my old age&hellip;</p>
<p>I believe that education should be freely available to all. And now, with rich online tools becoming available, and the advent of sites like the <a href="http://www.unu.edu/" rel="nofollow">United Nations University</a>, <a href="http://www.bccampus.ca/" rel="nofollow">BCcampus</a>, <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Health-Sciences-and-Technology/index.htm" rel="nofollow">MIT&rsquo;s free courses</a>, etc. we are heading towards that ideal.</p>
<p>Hence my interest in this ETUG workshop: I always want to know more about how to make a student&rsquo;s learning experience more rewarding, engaging, entertaining, motivating, and most importantly&hellip; effective.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Hi I'm John McLeod and am an instructional designer/facilitator for the faculty of Camosun College. Most of my experience has been working in secondary education both in Canada and abroad as well as&nbsp;working as an instructional designer for a small multi-media/eLearning company,&nbsp;and have only recently moved to higher education. I particularly enjoy looking at creative ways to provide learning experiences that look past the perceived division of f2f&nbsp;and online learning and instead focus on using the most appropriate tool for the&nbsp;learning objectives. I'm hoping that this workshop will start to connect me with others that are working in higher education and facing some of the associated challenges and joys.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Hello! I'm Tracy Roberts - I'm an instructional designer for Royal Roads University (Victoria) and Chair of scetug (Steering Committee for <a href="http://etug.ca" rel="nofollow">etug</a>). I live and work rurally, on the north end of Okanagan Lake, outside of Vernon, BC.</p>
<p>I am interested in developing great courses, programs, learning experiences, anything "instructional design-y (and lately, in the idea of "<a href="http://idwad.wordpress.com/2009/10/04/instructional-un-design/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">instructional un-design</a>" as I get my head into things open and networky).&nbsp; I'm interested in processes. Neat technology. Innovative uses of technology to support teaching and learning ("formal" and "informal"). And gadgets, I like gadgets. Could be electronic, but I also really like flipcharts and pens and post-its and paper.</p>
<p>What I hope to get out of the workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>a great learning experience, wherever it takes us</li>
<li>using this opportunity to design something (or maybe many things) that I need in the coming days - maybe the etug spring workshop, maybe some of the other things i've got on my plate (e.g., facilitation strategies for online synchronous sessions, an online workshop on polling/poll tools, an online workshop on RSS/start pages)</li>
<li>connecting with the great people of etug, hearing what people are up to, what they're interested in right now in Ed Tech. In part because I'm just curious, and in part because etug is always looking for information and ways to make ourselves relevant and supportive to the ed tech community in BC</li>
<li>human contact :) as i mentioned, I'm a telecommuter, I'm always online, so the chance to hang out with people is always great.</li>

<p>I'm Ron Johnson and my group&nbsp;supports program development and faculty development in the Learning &amp; Teaching Centre at BCIT.&nbsp; We are gradually moving more courses into online or blended delivery.&nbsp; One strong interest is to develop a library of interactive and engaging online learning activities, with models to show faculty how to use them effectively.&nbsp; I believe that teachers need scafolding to develop online teaching skills in the same way that we scafold students to develop their knowledge and skills.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to seeing and trying new activities and technologies and sharing ideas about learning.</p>
<p>Regards to all,</p>
<p>Ron</p>

			<p>Hi: My name is Laura Proctor. I have recently retired from working in technical support at the University of Victoria. Teaching has been a large part of my career -&nbsp; teaching computer programming and linguistics. I have used many different technologies in my teaching over the years and more recently have had a chance to explore many applications of technology in my work with faculty at UVIc. I have watched the development of the internet and am intrigued to see the many ways people have managed to use it. I'm looking forward to exploring this set of tools to see where it might lead me.</p>

			<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Rosario Passos. As a fairly new Instructional Development Consultant at BCIT I work with a skilled team of practiitoners to support faculty in designing engaging learning and teaching in an online environment. The goal is to do this according to best practices, but best practices seems to be an ever evolving and sometimes ephemeral concept :-) Before that I worked in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribeean, developing local capacity in Open and Distance Learning design and implementation for both secondary and higher education institutions. Apart from work, I am an avid, albeit fairweather sailor, and I am currently working on my masters in distance education at Athabasca University. In my thesis work, I am hoping to explore the integration of learning objects and OERs into learning design, underpinned by instructional design theory in distance learning.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to meeting you all and to exploring social media use in online teaching and learning, more specifically in learning design. Most faculty I work with are eager to integrate new tools in their teaching and learning, but need a reference framework to support e-learning design.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Rosario</p>

<p>I recently took on some additional BCcampus responsibilities around communication and stakeholder relations and find myself thinking about websites and the communication component of ICT (Information Communication Technologies) with renewed interest and a slightly different perspective.<br /><br />I'm thirsty for new ideas around the design of social learning. I'm particularly interested in design ideas that breakout beyond usual notions of learning for a geographical catchment area and instead design for globally distributed students and a learning experience that spans cultures. <br /><br />I have some understanding of design as practised in literature (setting, character, plot, ...) and the visual arts (space, colour, geometry, ...) and am looking to see equivalent parameters in learning. <br /><br />I'm also intrigued by the difference between learning design and instructional design.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Hi. I&rsquo;m Mike Minions. I&rsquo;m the educational technology coordinator at Okanagan College - which means I&rsquo;m all things edtech to faculty at 4 campuses in Kelowna, Vernon, Penticton and Salmon Arm.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lived in Kelowna since 1981 when I came to make tv commercials at CHBC-TV (a Canwest/Global station that is currently laying off all its employees). I did some time as the media production tech for the local school district, taught some courses for the faculty of education at OUC (now UBCO), and picked up a masters in Ed Tech from U of Calgary. I spend my days trying to help faculty cope with technological change and increasing student expectations all the while trying to nurture their emerging course design skills (&lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s either them building their course or me). I seem to derive a peculiar sense of satisfaction from effective and aesthetic design, especially in educational multimedia. I guess I&rsquo;m looking forward to hanging out with some people who share that affliction.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

I'm an instructional designer working on HR &amp; Finance projects at UBC.The projects are challenging, interesting, and quite different from each other with regard to audience, instructors, goals, and hence design.

<p>I look forward to learning, sharing, and hearing interesting ideas at the Workshop :).</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Hi Everyone.&nbsp; I"m Jacqueline Bradshaw, a longtime ETUG member and Educational Technology Advisor and instructor for the Library &amp; Information Technology program with Langara College.&nbsp; As Ed Tech Advisor, I work with faculty to help them incorporate approproate technologies into their teaching &amp; learning activities.&nbsp;&nbsp; As instructor in Lib &amp; Info tech, I will be teaching a brand new course in "Enhancing Library Web Pages with Media &amp; Social Software'. So this workshop should be very timely and helpful for both roles.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I'm Brian Wilson and I'm an Instructional Designer with the Office of Learning Technology at UBC. I'm looking forward to the next 2 days and getting a chance to hear about the many experiences everyone is having when using educational technology. One of the areas I'm particularly interested in is how methodology and technology interact and how technologies do, and don't, support instructors' views of what constitutes 'good teaching' &amp; 'good learning' and the kinds of challenges this brings, and therefore how instructors can be supported.</p>
<p>Looking forward to working with you,</p>
<p>Brian</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Hi all, great to be here. Like most of you,&nbsp; I have been very rushed as of late and didn't get a chance to update myself as to what today's session however, I know that BCCampus always sets us up well. What I have learned about CW so far has been quite interesting. In fact, there was a point were I was trying to figure out a way to bridge social networking sites to our LMS at VCC...still haven't come up with anything that has enough merrit to build on. CW seems to serve as an alternative to both the LMS and social networking...will be interesting to see how I feel at the end of the day. :-)</p>			<div class="posted-by">

                   <p>Hi Sylvie - thanks for the intro - sounds like you have very similar interests to me which is great! I also agree that content repositories are just not the answer. My belief is we need to in part mimic teacher practice, and stimulate/provoke/motivate/encourage.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi this is going to be a great workshop! Such a wealth of expertise and experience. Clearly one of the most important things that is coming out is the workshop providing an opportunity for you all to get togetherc, chat, catch up, share experience - so I will make sure there is lots of opportunity for that. Also reading through your posts a number of themes of common interest are emerging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding out more on the latest learning design research</li>
<li>Getting new ideas on how to use technologies and innovations in teaching and learning</li>
<li>Playing with new tools and exploring how they might be used by both faculty and studens alike</li>
<li>Keeping up with what is available and seeing how it can be applied for learners</li>
<li>"Learning what's 'out there' in terms of fresh strategies/perspectives/technology so that I can support others in creating rich and dynamic learning experiences as well as making some of my own!:</li>
<li>"I'm always looking for new frameworks of instructional and learning design, and design processes that provide me food for thought while working on such projects."</li>
