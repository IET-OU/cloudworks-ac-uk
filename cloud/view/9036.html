        <p>Hello all- found this an intersting challenge and actiivty- I am also very pleased that I wont be typing SCenEdit anymore!!</p>
<p class="Body">Review of ISiS and SCenEdit</p>
<p class="Body">I read and re read the ISiS Model and the ScenEdit tool piece and I did want to understand-because I am very interested in the way design and collaborative tools can be used to make the learning design experience more explicit.&nbsp; Design tools can be a means to challenge the tacit and implicit in the acquisitional model to make clearer the benefits of utilizing a participation model.</p>
<p class="Body">It was difficult to read, which takes away from the potential of the representation, and I was unclear which came first ISiS or ScenEdit.&nbsp; The increased complexity of having at least two different sorts of rectangles, and other images to represent the ideas did add &lsquo;imagery clutter&rsquo; for me.&nbsp; Equally only having images of the tools to depict the activities and scenario didn't make it any easer to work through, and &lsquo;for me&rsquo; at least an explanation that &lsquo;makes&rsquo; so much use of &lsquo;inverted apostrophes is uncertain of the language it is using!</p>
<p class="Body">ISiS is a goal-orientated approach that resides within an intention orientated conceptual model.&nbsp; What this conceptual model is they don't actually seem to say.&nbsp; They do describe what their model attempts to do which is focused on the</p>
<ul>
<li>Intentional</li>
<li>Strategic</li>
<li>Tactical</li>
<li>Operational</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">dimensions of a given scenario (later on in the paragraph it actually says that the &lsquo;model describes 3 dimensions' which results in a description of the scenario which added more confusion for me)</p>
<p class="Body">In short the intention is what the learning design wants to do- the Aim of the lesson.&nbsp; Strategy is the teaching method determined upon (which is itself limited to two types of methods, sequencing or distribution). The tactical is what activity the teacher will do to ensure she meets her aim using the teaching methods determined.&nbsp; These are all then put into a scenario for example a classroom or a home environment.&nbsp; The ScenEdit then goes onto capture this linear sequence in a tool for iterative use and sharing.</p>
<p class="Body">It was difficult to read with the structure of the piece organised in such a way to make it hard to see the levels in the model or the tool.&nbsp; The use then of a vertical outline which is what that tool produces and not use the language in the description in the phases described, did create a big disconnect for me in the description of the concept and the use of the model.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">&nbsp;CADMOS is a tool rather than a conceptual framework.&nbsp; It organises the tool around two models of activity.&nbsp; The conceptual model that describes the different roles and activities, and the Flow model that describes the way in which the learning design unfold, is used, is enacted.</p>
<p class="Body">It is much easer to read than the description of the ISiS, and the graphical representation for the healthy eating lesson and the flow model following illustrate clearly the use of the model.</p>
<p class="Body">&nbsp;I tried to find a link to access a demo of ScenEdit but couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The link via SourceForge was not operational nor was the demo sites accessible so I cant offer a comment on how the tool might be used.&nbsp; The CADMOS site was available and whilst it wouldn't register me the design area was accessible to review.&nbsp; This opportunity to see a design in practice and the use of the computer mouse in hover mode, which enables pop up boxes of extra info, really helped me understand the tool.</p>
<p class="Body">&nbsp;As regards my design, which was a programme of learning of 25 hours for a group of adult learners neither would be adequate for expressing my design.</p>
<p class="Body">The CADMOS tool in the iterations I reviewed on the CADMOS site seemed highly capable of describing and designing activities in a given scenario.&nbsp; It enabled complex ideas, for example web design and bullying to be designed into scenarios.&nbsp; It enabled relationships to be built between teacher, student, students and resources and as such appeared highly flexible for designing individual scenarios.&nbsp; I am not clear on how it would be used to design a learning programme from initial concept through to evaluation.</p>
<p class="Body">The ScenEdit model on the other hand did not, to me, appear as user friendly in the design of the scenarios and didn't seem to be able to build up &lsquo;layers&rsquo; of design activity like the CADMOS model.&nbsp; What the ScenEdit did potentially provide for was a framework that enabled the learning designer to run an idea from concept into a design.&nbsp; It wasn't clear on whether how this might work</p>
<p class="Body">The ScenEdit provides the possibility of engaging with the ADDIE Model- Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation and the CADMOS model seems more capable of enacting the intervention in learning and being more accessible in sharing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">&nbsp;Design needs to happen further up the stream than the scenarios one encounters whilst paddling down the stream.&nbsp; A design tool needs to consider the total environment of the learning and not just individual scenarios.&nbsp;</p>    </div>
