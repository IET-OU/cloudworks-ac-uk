        <p>Bill Law<br /> the career-learning caf&eacute;<br /> www.hihohiho.com</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s increasingly argued that we each have more than one identity.&nbsp; This is not about schizophrenia, it&rsquo;s about adaptability.&nbsp; It says we are each capable of developing a new self to meet each new situation.&nbsp; The thinking goes down well wherever self-belief, independence and individuality are applauded.&nbsp; Ideas of re-making self also accord well with contemporary calls for greater flexibility, creativity and risk-taking.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Among the most influential proposers of the idea is <a title="Amartya Sen" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias=stripbooks&field-keywords=Amartya+Sen+identity+and+Violence&x=16&y=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amartya Sen</a>.&nbsp; He tracks his life as Asian, with Bengali and British citizenship, as an economist and philosopher, and also a feminist, a secularist, and a scholar.&nbsp; He says that each of these aspects of his life enriches it with a new and different identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a much more extreme version of this line of thinking.&nbsp; It <a title="Galen Strawson" href="http://reading.academia.edu/GalenStrawson/Papers/287273/Against_narrativity_final_2008_version_" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">denies the possibility of any continuing narrative of self</a>.&nbsp; It might mean, for example, that there is no point in agonising about what you did in the past, because that was someone else.&nbsp; I think Amartya Sen has a point, but this other account of re-created selves sounds to me less like a plea than a cop-out:</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;not me governor, some other dude that I used to be - now long gone!&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>The evidence rejects the plea.&nbsp; That evidence is that much of identity is embodied - think of fingerprints and d-n-a.&nbsp; Identity can be ascertained by neurological and forensic examination.&nbsp; Our bodily tissue wears out, but not our genome.&nbsp; Identity is those not-to-be-got-rid-of realities which mean that &lsquo;I&rsquo; am forever &lsquo;me&rsquo;.&nbsp; And it represents that self in a way that no other secularist brit, conducting a neurological enquiry, can be.&nbsp; We need a term to refer to that continuing reality of selfhood - and I know no better term than &lsquo;identity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So, what about Amartya Sen?&nbsp; I find that sociology, not economics. offers the more convincing account of his point.&nbsp; Sociology has adapted the theatrical term &lsquo;role&rsquo; to refer to the realities that Amartya describes - they are social, not neurological, facts.&nbsp; They speak of the social settings a person occupies, the tasks each of those positions takes on, and the companionships that each calls up.&nbsp; At its most basic, role is that three-fold social reality - <em>me</em>...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;...being here, ...doing this, ...with you&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Roles are multiple: you might meet some other secularist, brit neurologist, but one who is also a daughter, a partner, a parent and - in any spare time she can find - base-guitar in a girl&rsquo;s band.&nbsp; But these are the roles that her identity takes on, they are not her identity.&nbsp; Finding life-roles does not multiply identity, and changing life-roles does not relinquish it.</p>
<p>Metaphors eventually break down; and one of the problems with &lsquo;role&rsquo; is that its theatrical roots imply a script.&nbsp; Scripting people is not much-welcomed in contemporary culture.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m talking sociological role, not theatrical script.&nbsp; And multiple-roles mean not just role-assignment, but also role-strain, role-conflict, role-ambiguity - and role-achievement.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t just follow scripts - we create roles.&nbsp; Thankfully my sons are not obliged to model their fatherhood on mine.&nbsp; Role-achievement is how each new generation&rsquo;s flexibility, creativity and risk-management bring about, not just personal, but social change.</p>
<p>One of the attractions of the idea of multiple identity is that it appears to be the liberating reality.&nbsp; Nothing, it seems to say, need be inevitable, the past need not predict the future.&nbsp; On-line virtual selves seem to hold out the promise.&nbsp; But virtual encounters are not with embodied realities.&nbsp; And not knowing who you are dealing with is as much a threat as a promise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Careers work cannot disregard embodied realities.&nbsp; Philosopher <a title="Daniel Dennett" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias=stripbooks&field-keywords=Amartya+Sen+identity+and+Violence&x=16&y=14#/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias=stripbooks&field-keywords=Daniel+Dennett+Freedom+Evolves&rh=n:266239,k:Daniel+Dennett+Freedom+Evolves" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Daniel Dennett</a> also arrives at the conclusion that the past does not determine the future.&nbsp; He speaks of the &lsquo;evitability&rsquo; of the human condition - nothing is inevitable.&nbsp; But he gets there by a more exploratory route - from embodied genetics to repertoires for action.&nbsp; There is no determinism in genetics.&nbsp; On that I go with Daniel.</p>
<p>But it is through our life-roles that we construct, and re-construct, each our own life.&nbsp; The multiplicity of roles that a person finds multiplies bases for action - setting up those strains, ambiguities and conflicts.&nbsp; And that kind of disturbance is where we find the coiled tension that drives creative role-achievement.&nbsp; Roles are not scripts, they are repertoires.&nbsp; There is no more determinism in sociology than there is in genetics.</p>
<p>So where does embodied identity belong in careers work?&nbsp; It is (just about) conceivable that the idea could suggest career-matching diagnostics based on observation of embodied posture, gesture and gaze.&nbsp; And (I would argue) such an invention might prove no less useful than the diagnostics we already use.&nbsp; So we are left with underlying questions for careers work....</p>
<p align="center"><em>...how far are we working towards a new client identity?<br />....and how far to an expanded client experience?</em></p>
<p>With this in mind I&rsquo;ve put an example of posture, gesture and gaze on the <a title="Billy" href="http://www.hihohiho.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">home-page of my website</a>.&nbsp; The embodied identity there is aged eight or thereabouts.&nbsp; Do you pick up any clues concerning his future?</p>
<p>I should tell you that this eight-year-old Billy, gives me a slight case of the jitters.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help wondering what - in some parallel universe - he would make of the way I&rsquo;ve used that identity to occupy his subsequent life-roles.</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;Is Billy still me? ...am I still Billy?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>All I can say for sure is that I will shortly take him off the home-page of my site, but I will never be able to discard him.</p>
<p>However, to get to the issue, I need also to tell you that Billy&rsquo;s dominant roles are son, cousin, mate, nephew and grandchild - not as impressive a list as Amartya&rsquo;s, but every bit as influential.&nbsp; You can see that Billy&rsquo;s also a pupil.&nbsp; So how will his identity engage with those roles?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In managing careers how far are people asserting new identities?&nbsp; And how far are they finding new roles -</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from early settings - to new places to go?<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from present tasks - to more things to do?<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from start-in-life companions - to other people to talk with?</p>
<p>The relationship between identity and role is critical to careers work.&nbsp; We have made less use of the concept&nbsp; than we usefully could.&nbsp; It is, after all, a bridging concept -&nbsp; linking &lsquo;self&rsquo; to &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo;.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s <a title="Coverage of Role" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/CPIpdfs/cafcpi1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">more about role on the site</a>.&nbsp; (pages 1:6-1:12). Well worth your thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is?...</p>    </div>
