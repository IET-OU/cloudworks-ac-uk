        <p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p><a title="CLT" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnoriginal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Career-learning theory</a> was first published in 1996.&nbsp; It argues that the most important features of careers work are those which enable people to think for themselves.&nbsp; This is learning-to-learn, sometimes called &lsquo;metacognition&rsquo;.&nbsp; It is applied here to careers work, but it&rsquo;s features are designed to be useful to all education professions.&nbsp; It is a questioning technique, and there is no topic on any learning programme which can escape the importance of asking not just...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<em>...&lsquo;what do you know?&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center">but also...<em><br /></em></p>
<p align="center"><em>...&lsquo;how do you know it&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>What-you-know may be soon discarded, contradicted or outdated.&nbsp; But, once learned, how-you-know can be applied to any task, and need never be lost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These ideas are applied here to careers work and to other educators who take learning to be a useful preparation for life - not just for passing exams but learning for living.</p>
<p>There are other formulations of metacognition - characterised, for example, as &lsquo;learning circles&rsquo; and &lsquo;learning styles&rsquo;.&nbsp; But few have the depth and breadth of research-based thinking invested in career-learning theory.&nbsp; It is a meta-analysis drawing on a wide range of behaviour-science - largely from sociological ethnography and psychological&nbsp; learning theory.</p>
<p>All that has happened since its publication reinforces the importance of its ideas.&nbsp; It can readily be <a title="CLTupdate" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">applied to today&rsquo;s experience</a> of economic, cultural and environmental change - both world-wide and local.&nbsp; The need for &lsquo;how-do-you-know?&rsquo; questioning has never been greater.</p>
<p>The ideas are built into Bill&rsquo;s invited presentation on career-learning theory, for the Danish VUE conference in November.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; note: the links you'll find here are to immediate sources in Bill's work, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but each contains extensive references to the sources which inform that work</em></p>
<p>The ideas signpost how educators can...&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>see where career-learning theory belongs in education thinking</li>
<li>apply it to the processes of learning-for-living</li>
<li>appreciate why enabling such thinking is now more urgent than ever</li>
<li>claim a place in the reshaping of that work</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>1. who says what?&nbsp; - a distinctive perspective</strong></p>
<p>Careers-work <a title="professionalism.pdf" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">professionalism</a> has, over a century, collected a range of ways of talking about how working life develops.&nbsp; We have theories about...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;matching&rsquo; and &lsquo;chaos&rsquo; - 'community&rsquo; and &lsquo;capital&rsquo; - </em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&nbsp;&lsquo;mindfulness&rsquo; and &lsquo;nudge&rsquo; - &lsquo;development&rsquo; and &lsquo;boundary-less&rsquo; - </em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&nbsp;&lsquo;constructs&rsquo; and &lsquo;dissonance&rsquo; - and &lsquo;attribution&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>There are issues: for example &lsquo;chaos&rsquo; does not naturally invite &lsquo;matching&rsquo;; &lsquo;community&rsquo; works differently for those who have little &lsquo;capital&rsquo;; and why take trouble with patiently enabling mindfulness when a conditioning &lsquo;nudge&rsquo; is quicker and easier?; also, can we set a framework around development if career is actually boundary-less&rsquo;?; are &lsquo;constructs&lsquo; more or less useful when they are &lsquo;dissonant&rsquo;; and, anyway, where do student and client &lsquo;attributions&rsquo; figure in any of this?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll know other theories, and they will raise other issues.</p>
<p>Stacking finding upon finding doesn&rsquo;t resolve any of the issues.&nbsp; We need another way of organising our ideas.&nbsp; And career learning has a place in one of three distinctive perspectives on learning-for-living.&nbsp; The perspectives are ...</p>
<ul>
<li>learning development, calling on our theoretical knowledge</li>
<li>programme delivery, calling on how we practically help</li>
<li>learning-for-living, calling on student and client experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Career-learning theory is in the third line - it is what students and clients do, which is different from what we think and what we say.&nbsp; People conduct their lives with or without the benefit of our theoretical expertise and practical help.&nbsp; And career-learning theory distinctively seeks to understand how people make use of whatever they find - whether they find that with us or in some other way.&nbsp; Its authority is their experience rather than our expertise.&nbsp; Career-learning thinking completes a partnership between our theory, its practice and their reality.</p>
<p>________________________<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. learning for living - part of a wider understanding</strong></p>
<p>Everybody is capable of framing and reframing what they learn.&nbsp; It is part of our species&rsquo; fingerhold on survival - finding out what is going on and figuring out what to do about it.&nbsp; It is a constant process of linking what people find to what they do - on the savannah, on the street and <a title="Colonist" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/EVColonist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on-line</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A requirement for such learning is <a title="storyboarding" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">transfer</a> (pages 19-21): it means that what is learned in one place is used in another.&nbsp; It links reminders in the learning to experience in the life.&nbsp; Without those links learning is not carried from where it is learned to where it is used, and - therefore - is not learning-for-living.</p>
<p>There is more: that internalising and embedding of experience becomes part of an <a title="storyboarding" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">embodied identity</a> (pages 21-22).&nbsp; It is manifested in the physical presence of one person with another - we call it &lsquo;body language&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And so...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;learning reminding me of life - and life reminding me of learning&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;what I find in experience&rsquo; - &lsquo;becomes as much me as a fingerprint&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>and means &lsquo;finding out&rsquo;&nbsp; - &lsquo;sorting out&rsquo; - &lsquo;checking out&rsquo; - &lsquo;figuring out&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Career learning is a third element in that triad - here set out in conversational terms.&nbsp; In that position career learning is part of a day-on-day entwined process - learning something useful..., embedding it..., transfering it to where it will make a difference.... &nbsp;</p>
<p>The technical account of that conversational process is...</p>
<ul>
<li>transferring learning to life</li>
<li>gathering and internalising a way of seeing</li>
<li>sensing and then sifting and then focusing and then understanding</li>
</ul>
<p>How distinctive is the career-learning process?:&nbsp; it is progressive - each step preparing the way for each succeeding step.&nbsp; And that progression expands the &lsquo;how-do-you-know?&rsquo; question into a bases for self interrogation...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;enough to go on?&rsquo;&nbsp; &gt; &lsquo;sorted out?&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; &lsquo;what needs probing?&rsquo;&nbsp; &gt; &lsquo;how it can work out?&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>It is also generic:&nbsp; there really is no boundary to how many &rsquo;who?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what?&rsquo;, &lsquo;where?&rsquo;, &lsquo;when?&rsquo;, &lsquo;why?&rsquo; and &lsquo;how?&rsquo; questions that search can generate.&nbsp; And everything else that happens in that triadic process depends on the effectiveness of that scrutiny - &lsquo;what is fact?&rsquo;, &lsquo;...opinion?&rsquo;, &lsquo;...useful?&rsquo;, &lsquo;...credible?&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But this is not a content-free process - there is no such thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; A person is reminded in the learning of how it can concretely be used in life.&nbsp; But the person is invited to pose the process questions - thinking less about &lsquo;what do I believe and do?&rsquo;, more about &lsquo;what makes it worth believing and doing?&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. working through confusion - out of the comfort zone</strong></p>
<p>Learning is never entirely comfortable, and significant learning can be seriously disturbing.&nbsp; One of the primary research-based sources concerning learning-for-living is <a title="CLTupdate" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jean Piaget</a> (page 10).&nbsp; He sets learning in a context of experience, he sees what happens as a process of construct building, and he sets out learning as a stage-by-stage process.&nbsp; It is not surprising to find his work constantly revisited.&nbsp; And he sees confusion and discomfort as an essential&nbsp; feature of learning - he calls it &lsquo;disequalibrium&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of that discomfort concerns other people.&nbsp; An extensive collation of <a title="CIT" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcit.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">evidence on community influences</a> shows how people take account of other people's needs, feelings and interests in managing their own careers - even where it may limit their own life chances.</p>
<p>However internalised learning may be, talk of &lsquo;decision-making skills&rsquo; takes too little account of real-life struggles.&nbsp; It is not easy to let go of attachments to others, in trying to accommodate a promising new future.&nbsp; And it is no less of a struggle to assimilate new ways of seeing things, when the need to hold on to what the past has valued still feels so right.</p>
<p>Career learning does not evade such disequalibrium, it works through it.&nbsp; And it does so to a point where, whatever is held onto and whatever is let go, something new becomes possible. &nbsp;Whether experience is chaotic or just complex and confusing, it enables people with ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; And without that kind of adaptability there is no prospect of social mobility...&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;change in my life&rsquo; - &lsquo;..neighbourhood&rsquo; - &lsquo;...country&rsquo; - &lsquo;...the planet&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;my people...&rsquo; - &lsquo;background...&rsquo; -&nbsp; &lsquo;experience...&rsquo; - &lsquo;...overlooked&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;bad feelings...&rsquo; - &lsquo;...question' - &lsquo;...hold-on if I will - &lsquo;...let go if I must&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>The career-learning part of this process is a <a title="Colonist" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/EVColonist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">critical and self critical</a> tool (pages 11-13).&nbsp; It equips people with a willingness to interrogate one&rsquo;s own life in such terms...</p>
<ul>
<li>from the personal to the planetary</li>
<li>for ready-for-anything flexibility</li>
<li>in holding on and letting go</li>
</ul>
<p>Education must not allow itself to fall into a position of helping most those whose experience best positions them to cope with change.&nbsp; It would mean helping least those who most need our help.&nbsp; The need for flexibility in dealing with unforeseen change is greatest among <a title="professionalism.pdf" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the poor and the dispossessed</a> (pages 16-20). &nbsp;</p>
<p>And for education professionals, not working with the career-learning processes of both holding on and letting go, means that twenty years of experience can be no more than one year of experience repeated twenty times.</p>
<p>________________________</p>
<p><strong>4. re-positioning careers work - claiming your future</strong></p>
<p>There is no future for this work in trying to revitalise twentieth-century answers to twenty-first century questions.&nbsp; What people face is different, the sources they go to are different, and whom they defer to is different.&nbsp; And if they are changing the way they learn then education must change the way it helps.</p>
<p>But there is here an issue for independent professionalism: what people find immediately credible is not all that careers work has to offer.&nbsp; And, as every dietician knows, what people seek is not always what they need...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;coach me for the race&rsquo; - &lsquo;invite me on a journey&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&nbsp;&lsquo;following others&rsquo; - &lsquo;wondering about celebrities&rsquo; - &lsquo;making a distinctive self&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&nbsp;&lsquo;gut dealing with conflict&rsquo; - &lsquo;heart speaking to chaos&rsquo; - &lsquo;my story finding its point&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>The word &lsquo;career&rsquo; has its own <a title="metaphor" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/mkngtwork/cafimages.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">metaphors</a> for this: one conjures images of &lsquo;careering&rsquo; around a race-track, another pictures people travelling in a &lsquo;carriage&rsquo;.&nbsp; But the people are more likely to buy the more immediate rewards of winning a race.&nbsp; Yet it is journeying which finds the richer and deeper experience of life, and it is journeying which is more inclusive.&nbsp; A journey can contain a race, but a race will not contain a journey.&nbsp; There can be dissonance between what people seek and what we offer.</p>
<p>The uses of <a title="storyboarding" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">narrative</a> may be a way in.&nbsp; Experience can only be set down as narrative.&nbsp; And it is plot or genre which gives a story its meaning, and meaning that gives a life its point.&nbsp; Indeed, there are said to be &lsquo;<a title="storyboarding" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">basic plots</a>&rsquo; (pages 10-11), and they are thought to relate ready-made meanings.&nbsp; It is what myths, legends, parables, fables and fairy-tales do.&nbsp; But, however many fairy-tales a person might indulge, the spur to purpose in life comes from how we each learn to tell our own story - and attribute our own meaning to it.&nbsp; Even recruiters understand that they do not need to listen to another fairy-tale, they need to hear something which is about this person as it is about no other.&nbsp; Like it or not, that will attract their attention and stick in their memory.</p>
<p>This is why career-learning thinking is not completed, until a draft autobiography is probed with those &rsquo;who?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what?&rsquo;, &lsquo;where?&rsquo;, &lsquo;when?&rsquo;, &lsquo;why?&rsquo; and &lsquo;how?&rsquo; questions.&nbsp; The <a title="storyboarding" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">questioning philosophy</a> of career-learning thinking invites people to construct their own story.&nbsp; They can tell of instinct and intuition, meaning and purpose and springboards for action...</p>
<ul>
<li>of mainly a journey, sometimes a race</li>
<li>in an autobiography, not a fairy tale</li>
<li>established through critical, and self-critical, questioning</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a basis for claiming one&rsquo;s stake in society.&nbsp; And, once learned, it is indefinitely re-usable, for learning in any sphere of life.</p>
<p>Returning to an educator's role, its life-long and life-wide scope makes career-learning theory applicable to any topic, for any programme, in any setting.&nbsp; And if management constraints on programme development will not allow the <a title="space&place" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">space-and-place</a> this works needs, then learning-for-living can <a title="professionalism.pdf" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">move out of conventional &lsquo;education&rsquo; settings</a> (pages 24-27), into others more realistically linked to what is going on in people&rsquo;s lives - from the personal to the planetary.</p>
<p>Re-positioned students and clients means re-positioning the helper.&nbsp; And one of the most valuable skills that a trained career adviser and educator can bring to that programme is the ability to pose and enable <a title="Colonist" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/EVColonist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">awkward questions</a> (pages 10-13)- which is at the heart of career-learning theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a long job, so there&rsquo;s no time to lose.&nbsp; But innovation in education does not mean being 'kwick-and-eazy' - it means being useful, appropriate and sustainable.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you say?</p>
