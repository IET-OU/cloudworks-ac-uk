        <p>The January eLearning Community event is also the first seminar in&nbsp;the 5th series&nbsp;of Arts and Social Sciences e-Learning Seminars so many thanks to Jane Barrett and&nbsp;Lynda Prescott for putting this programme together.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Date</strong>:&nbsp;Tuesday 27th&nbsp;January 2015</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Time</strong>: 14:00 to 16:00</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Location</strong>: Library Seminar Rooms 1 and 2.</p>
<p>If you plan to attend, have any queries or wish to suggest a future eLC event, please email <a href="mailto:iet-elc-admin@open.ac.uk" rel="nofollow">iet-elc-admin@open.ac.uk</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Arts and Social Sciences e-Learning Seminar Series 5 (2015)</h3>
<p>The theme of this year&rsquo;s Arts and Social Sciences' e-learning seminar series is<strong> &lsquo;Community and Identity&rsquo;</strong>. In online contexts, the informal spaces of social media lend themselves to the development of communities, and ideas of identity acquire multiple potentialities. But inside the more formal structures of higher education, how do we translate those concepts of community and identity into viable frameworks for learning, and what are the relationships, if any, between the frameworks we design and the fluid possibilities of social networking?</p>
<p>This seems a good moment to explore such questions, given that the OU&rsquo;s new Student Charter has amongst its principles the objective of inspiring and enabling learning &lsquo;within an academic community&rsquo;, and also because the University&rsquo;s <em>Learning and Teaching Vision and Plan 2025</em> places considerable emphasis on the idea of &lsquo;Connected Communities&rsquo;. One of the plan&rsquo;s priorities under the heading &lsquo;Student Experience Now for the Future&rsquo; is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We will create a learning environment where students feel they belong within their chosen academic community so that they can best achieve their study goals and engage in meaningful interactions and develop confidence and identity relevant to their aspirations and goals.</p>
<p>This seminar,&nbsp;the&nbsp;first in the series, examines initiatives from the Faculties of Arts and Social Sciences that may provide pointers for future developments. The session will include the usual opportunities for discussion, and in comparing the community-creation/building strategies described in the two presentations, there will be scope to consider wider questions such as what are the best anchoring-points for academic communities (modules? qualifications? the university?), and what students need from them in order to develop their own sense of academic identity.</p>
<h3>Programme</h3>
<ul>
<li>13:45 - 14:00: <strong>Refreshments available</strong></li>
<li>14:00 - 14:30: <strong>Community building </strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Robin Goodfellow (Senior&nbsp;Lecturer,&nbsp;Institue of Educational Technology)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><strong>Abstract</strong><br style="padding-left: 120px;" />Robin will review some of the work around community and online learning that followed the publication of Etienne Wenger&rsquo;s &lsquo;Communities of practice &ndash; learning, meaning and identity&rsquo; in 1999. He will discuss the way this work has influenced the development of the OU&rsquo;s learning and teaching strategy, and the background it provides for today&rsquo;s presentations.</p>
<ul>
<li>14:30 - 15:00: <strong>Student Connections and The Student Hub Live: Creating student communities using online technologies</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Karen Foley (Associate Lecturer, Faculties of Social Sciences and Science)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><strong>Abstract</strong><br style="padding-left: 120px;" />Student Connections was an online live streamed event for students in Social Sciences. In addition to the live event we have been engaging students through a variety of online platforms. "This Student Life", an audio drama, The PodMag, a news audio,&nbsp;and the Activate sessions which are run on OU Live are all important ways that the community of students are able to connect prior to the Student Connections Conference. This talk will outline these four&nbsp;formats and explain how students are able to establish identities as OU Students and also become part of an academic community.</p>
<ul>
<li>15:00 - 16:00: <strong>Building an online subject community for creative writers</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Derek Neale (Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing, Faculty of Arts)</li>
<li>Sally O&rsquo;Reilly&nbsp;(Lecturer in Creative Writing, Faculty of Arts)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><strong>Abstract</strong> <br style="padding-left: 120px;" />Since the launch of the online suite of Start Writing courses in 2003, the Arts Faculty&rsquo;s creative writing&nbsp;modules have developed a startlingly effective method of attracting, teaching and retaining students, one which is primarily participatory, involves e-Learning and multi-faceted forum use. With an MA in production, building on undergraduate success and developing new e-Learning techniques, there is now also a MOOC which attracted 50,000 learners in its first year. At all levels of learning, and from student to AL to module team member, there is&nbsp;the clear sense of a subject community, one that is focused on writing but which also generates a host of highly prized transferable skills. How has this community been&nbsp;established and developed? And can other disciplines learn from its methods?</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to attend, and refreshments are provided at the start of the session.</p>
