        <h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>Where are you coming from? What is the context in which you are working and participating in OLDS MOOC?</em></p>
<p>I am a lecturer and course leader in a UK University. I have managed e-learnign programmes in the past but would not describe myself as a Learning Technologist. I currently teach face to face but enjoy incoprporating online platforms as much as possible, both institutional (VLE) and external - such as Google Docs, blogs, wikis, Twitter and Facebook. My current goals within my teaching are to develop greater research &nbsp;and digital skills in my students.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>What did you hope to achieve? What were your goals in joining OLDS MOOC?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;I joined OLDSMOOC because I have an interest in this form of learning and because good learning design is something I feel I could learn more about and do much better! I didn't immediately make the link between the project and my own teaching but in desperation I combined the two with happy results :)</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>What did you do? What were the main events, interactions, practices and activities in which you participated?&nbsp;<em>What were the obstacles - and how did you tackle them?</em></em></p>
<p>I have participated fairly consistently in the MOOC and been very active in completing tasks up until the last week when unfortunately I received notice that I would be moving house in 3 weeks! This has meant abandoning the MOOC, project and learning partner in favour of frantic packing.</p>
<p>The first week was incredibly frustrating as I did not (and still don't ) find Cloudworks to be an intuitive platform. In particular it proved almost impossible to select a project team to join and almost at random I started stalking a woman in Ireland who looked as though she might have similar interests to mine. The fact that we shared a Nottingham connection made the introductions a little easier, added to which she had an interest in the subject area of my course (Health and Social Care).</p>
<p>The lack of a social network integrated into Cloudworks makes connection very difficult - as does the lack of a logical site map. I constantly feel lost in here and this is not aided by the multiplicity of platforms being used, with emphasis shifting from Google to CW to Twitter to Slideshare....</p>
<p>What this has done though is taught me how very confusing it is when I switch platforms with my students and consistency is a principal of learning design that I intend to adhere to more rigorously in future.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>What were the outcomes of your participation? Did you meet your goals? What went well, what didn't? What unexpected outcomes did you notice?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;My biggest disappointment is that I didn't get to complete a basic design for the module I initially envisaged. I guess in such a short time frame this was not going to be possible and had I joined this MOOC with teammates who are actually involved in the teaching of my module alongside me, this could have been more productive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that, the best unexpected outcome was making a friend in Helen Crump and in actually meeting up with her face to face one splendid afternoon. Had I joined this MOOC with a team, such serendipity would not have been possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would have liked to have undertaken the evaluation of a learning design last week. Evaluation and reflection are two things I champion. However, work priorities at the moment include the National Student Survey, Peer Observations, Module Evaluation Questionnaires and a Course Approval and Review process across our whole School , so on top of the packing, &nbsp;I probably felt a bit evaluated-out</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>What did you learn? What advice could you give others?</em></p>
<p>I do feel I have learned something about learning design and in particular I found the course features exercise in week 3 really useful. I think this is something I would take forward to use with my own team - and an opportunity is about to arise as we are planning an overhaul of how we teach research skills across all three years of our course.</p>
<p>Some activites were less useful for me, but that's OK. My advice to anyone undertaking a MOOC is not to stress about it (as my students would say). Do what you can, when you can. And have a partner to share the fun along the way. At times, the only reason I completed activities was because I didn't want to let Helen down. At other times, the only way I managed to do them at all was because she led the way. And sometimes, I got inspired and facilitated her.</p>
<p>Oh - and a final word: don't let badge envy ruin your day :)</p>    </div>

                   <p>Jane, I think you deserve a badge for honesty and effort, especially given the difficult circumstances that you face in having to move in the middle of the MOOC. After reading Helen's narrative, I knew you and she formed a rewarding collaborative relationship. How great that you found each other and I hope you&rsquo;ll be able to continue learning design and friendship long after this MOOC is over. It is wonderful how some of the relationships one develops while learning can turn into a lifetime of friendship. Earlier today, I was Skyping with my dear friend, John Hedberg, who is the Millennium Innovations Chair of ICT and Education at Macquarie University in Sydney. John and I first met each other when we both enrolled at Syracuse University in 1974. We formed a collaborative research team there (along with another student, Bernie Dodge, who is a Professor at San Diego State University) called &ldquo;Citrus Research Associates&rdquo; (Syracuse&rsquo;s school color is orange), and did many of our research assignments together. Our friendship has extended nearly 40 years &hellip;..John and I are currently collaborating on a second edition of our 2003 evaluation book, and I&rsquo;ll be going to Sydney to see him soon and he&rsquo;ll be here to visit me later in the year. We continue to learn together. It will be interesting to see what kind of long-term relationships emerge from our shared journey through the OLDS MOOC. &ndash; Tom Reeves</p>        </div>

<p>Thank you for the inspiring narrative. Like you say, this has been a big learning curve having to adjust to different forums and may be feeling a bit uneasy when we get lost. The fun of it is that we &Auml;ll Learn". Thanks Jane :)</p>

                   <p>Jane, thanks for the very useful reflections and advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>don't stress</li>
<li>do what you can when you can</li>
<li>share the 'fun'</li>
</ul>
<p>On reflection that is probably also helpful advice for MOOC facilitators ;-)</p>
<p>I also struggled with cloudworks, multiple channels, and switching between those. I'm not sure to what extent those issues are: failings in the platforms themselves; course design faults; issues with my own (and many others) digital (MOOC) literacies... Whatever, they certainly raise some interesting design challenges.</p>
<p>All the best for your move!</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>Hi Jane</p>
<p>One of the benefits of participating in the #oldsmooc is the connections I've made and hope to keep. Sharing this journey with you and other oldsmooc ers is one of the reasons I was able to continue. The serendipitous nature of online learning bought you and Helen together and the rewards are evident in your narrative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like you, I had a personal hickup which meant a dramatic change in how I was doing things for almost 2 weeks. I was so disappointed to have missed the "evaluation" week, it's work I will return to in good time.&nbsp;That in itself was a learning design experience.</p>
<p>Like Josh, I believe your advice&nbsp;"Sharing the fun"is important during online work, we don't have the physical presence that helps humans to connect, this is one of the next best options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also beginning to realise that MOOCS work best if they aren't treated as courses to begun, finish then "file away" for use when needed. They're more a learning experience from which we pull what's relevant to us and build upon into the future, through our new connections/network/community of practice/allumni (many ways to see it:)). I think MOOC Facilitators are the ultimate content curators....gathering relevant resources and value adding with their time, experitse and passion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to continuing the LD conversation througn #oldsmoocalumni.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />Penny</p>

                   <p>Hi Jane C,</p>
<p>I agree with what others have said about your project and effort in the MOOC. Josh and Grainne also have a healthy attitude to how to approach a MOOC; it made such a difference to not have to fret about deadlines for assignments etc etc. &nbsp;</p>
