<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Cathy Casserly:&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Steps on the timeline:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">1998: Open content, 99 Connexions, 2000 MIT OCW, 2001 Wikipedia, 2002 Hewlett, Creative Commons, Open Learning Initiative, UNESCO (first use of the term OER), 2005 TESSA, 2006 Khan Academy, 2007 Cape Town OE Declaration, 2008 OCWC, Flat World, 2009 Open High School Utah, 2011 Department of Labor call 4x$500m everything must be CC-BY.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">As well as this history there is evidence that OER is becoming more accepted, while there remains things to be done: Platforms for resources need integrating &ndash; including iTunesU which needs to properly support Creative Commons licensing. There are many positive actions in progress: Google and Bing adding the CC licence to search; OECD working on policy for adoption of OER; New funders coming in.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">As the new CEO of Creative Commons, Cathy taking time to assess their next steps, but Creative commons is clearly now thinking about this space &ndash; and the way that CC can power OER.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">A cycle where OER -&gt; Data -&gt; Theory then back to OER has always been part of the vision, growing participation offers the driver for this cycle.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Mike Smith:&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Use is the focus. Working on a &nbsp;report with Brooking. Need insights into how IT can be used in developing world. OER is an important catalyst and component. Lesson don&rsquo;t start with technology; start with imagination. Develop guidelines for use and enable sharing and take up.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">OER use will track IT use in the developing world. The exception is openness &ndash; but data is missing of effectiveness. But as open helps spread and use it is clear that OER can be just as effective as non-OER AND can be more easily adapted.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Mike identified 6 drivers for OER to be used:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">1: Access infrastructure</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Broadband, platforms, speed of uptake, ease of finding quality.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">2: Markey conditions</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Prices down, supply up, hardware, tools &ndash; cloud, open source, kids as experts, NGOs that can support</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">3: Choice for use of technology &ndash; how useful?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Simple, easy, reliable, OER adds free and ease of adaptation</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">4: Cultural fit</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">No disrespect of threat</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">5: Add value?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Creates new access &ndash; OER opens locked boxes.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Thoughts on effectiveness &ndash; need big effects. Meta-analysis is ok for IT use supported by OER. Teacher v computer (no significant difference is a positive effect). Not the same for teacher v teacher + technology (no difference is negative!).&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">6: Networks &ndash; the future?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Education + OER (TESSA/P2PU). Collective action.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">First rule &ndash; don&rsquo;t start with technology, start with the problem.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Eg: classrooms in Nairobi slums. New projector +USB + crank powered. USB can have OER. NGO support and get take up.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Eg: postsecondary wants to upgrade knowledge infrastructure to western level &ndash; intranet to internet. Focus on the open. Across all aspects.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Mike&rsquo;s summary offered elements of possible guidelines:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Start with problem, offer the right technical infrastructure, build in the social elements, ensure you add value.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The time is right for OCWC to offer OER to the world&ndash; create an OER Store &ndash; select what you need.&nbsp;</div>
