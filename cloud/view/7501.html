        <p>There is a lot of talk about design in educational research supported by technology, and this is a good thing. These discussions are centered on different methods to design innovations and expand theory to support teaching and learning. The intention is to bridge the gap between research and practice while investigating the impact of these technologies. Two strong approaches to pragmatically solving these educational challenges are LD and TISL that utilize different design thinking and methods involving both researchers and teachers. This position paper argues that we need to zoom out and discuss design with a capital "D" in order to strengthen and leverage stronger methods and knowledge to improve and sustain scientifically informed creative practices in professional contexts. Through better discussions, understandings, and design practices will help enable the community to strengthen research and engage the different users and stakeholders which in turn will result in better processes and products to support education.</p>
<p>Educational technology research suffers from the separation of research and practice compounded with the challenges of providing innovation to complex systems of societal organizations. Twenty years ago, Kaput(1992) argued that the limitations of computer use for education in the coming decades would likely be less a result of technological limitations than a result of limited human imagination and the constraints of old habits and social structures. Therefore, these types of challenges can be described as wicked problems. To characterize these wicked problems, Rittel &amp; Weber (1973) defined two sets of problems using the exaggerated stance that scientific and engineering problems have a clear problem definition and clear solution whether or not the problem is solved, and thereby these problems are considered tame. By contrast, wicked problems have neither of these clarifying traits since they generally fall under the category of human experience rather than natural sciences. Design can be positioned in-between science and humanities, where design bridges the natural world and human experience. This can be accomplished since designers tackle ?ill-defined? problems, their mode of problem solving is solution-focused, their mode of thinking is constructive,and they use an objective language recursively to find solutions (Cross, 2007). Nelson &amp; Stolterman (2003) argue for design wisdom, which is a much richer concept than problem solving because it shifts one?s thoughts from focusing only on avoiding undesirable states to focusing on the intentional actions that lead to states of reality that are desirable and appropriate. Design can be defined as a mix of notions as discussed by Simon (1996) and Morello (2000): design can be actions that people take to change situations into preferred ones through anticipating experiences for future uses. Most research focuses on the first part of this statement, changing situations into preferred ones. I argue that we also need to consider the second part as equally important that our research and practice must take into account how we can anticipate experiences for future uses.</p>
<p>Generally, because of research practice and everyday classroom work, we chunk down these ill-defined problems into testable problems that do not really address the larger context. By stepping back and considering what we mean when we talk about design can enable us to become better designers and provide ways to bridge the gaps between research and practice. One method to be explored is to apply a more discursive science of design approach that attempts to anticipate future uses for inventions and innovations by exploring how LD and TSIL interact.Krippendorff (2006) defines the science of design as the necessity of both a science of making and a philosophy of realizing artifacts with and for others. In order to establish and investigate the synergy between LD and TISL a strong science of design stance needs to be taken in order to anticipate the future of context, practice, and change. Therefore, I am arguing for integrating more precise design thinking and practice into LD and TIS. In order to carefully build up design skills for supporting the notion of teachers as collaborative designers and for different research activities to consider a design as success criteria. The sooner we start talking about design, the easier it will be to argue for rich design wisdom enabling states of reality that are desirable and appropriate.</p>
