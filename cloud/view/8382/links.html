        <h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>I own an online education company that works very closely with a local University. Earlier this year one of the Course Conveners at the University asked me to come and talk to a group of fourth year business science students about my experience of business strategy. </em></p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>My lecture was one of many in a &ldquo;guest lecturer series&rdquo; presented over six weeks in a fourth year business science programme called &ldquo;business strategy&rdquo;. Each lecture is one hour long, and the students attend two lectures per week.</em></p>
<p><em>As fourth year students, most are between the ages of 22 and 24, but there were a number of much older students present. The lecture was attended by about 450 students in a massive amphitheatre style lecture hall.</em></p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>The Course Convener was not looking for a specialist in business strategy to come and talk to his class, rather, he wanted a business owner to come and talk to the students about their everyday experience of business strategy &ldquo;from the trenches&rdquo;. My objective was to share as many stories as possible that would illustrate some basic principles of business strategy. I planned to keep the lecture light and engaging with examples that the students could relate to, and hoped to use the level of student interaction as a measure of success.</em></p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>I prepared for the lecture by creating a presentation in Prezi. I wanted to keep the lecture light, so I decided to created a presentation which provided visually appealing talking points which promped me to tell stories.</em></p>
<p><em>I started the lecture by introducing myself to the students, and focussed extensively on the things I knew I would have in common with them. This went very well and I felt it established some common ground between the students and me. </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;I had just gotten married a few months before this lecture, so I decided to share a story with them of the &ldquo;strategic thinking&rdquo; that my wife and I had to do with an outdoor wedding. My wife actually attended the lecture, so I was able to point her out to the students. My wife wanted to kill me afterwards, but it was great to be able to tell a story and have the two main characters in the story present at the lecture.</em></p>
<p><em>I then shared my very simple business strategy philosophy, and spent the remainder of the lecture telling stories of how this philosophy has played out in real life for me.</em></p>
<p><em>With such a large class, it was almost impossible to get the sort of student engagement I had hoped for. I realised this very quickly, and decided to leave a 15-minute gap at the end of my stories for questions and answers. This was probably the best I could do under the circumstances, but I was very disillusioned by the level of engagement that is possible with a class of this size. </em></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>I felt the students enjoyed this practical account of business strategy, and they actively engaged with me in the Q &amp; A section at the end. With such an enormous student group, extensive interaction with the group is very difficult, and I had to ask a number of students to come and chat to me afterwards for fear of spending too long on any one question when there was such a short amount of time available for discussion, and such a big student group.</em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>On reflection I felt that my slides could have been simpler, and I should have included more pictures. With regards to interacting with a group of 450+ students in a lecture theatre, I felt that I should have asked more questions to the student group, and asked them to engage with a few people around them on the discussion topics. It&rsquo;s not practical or sensible for the only interaction to be between students and lecturer with a group of that size.</p>
