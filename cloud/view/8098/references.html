        <p>I've used per reviews and expert reviews quite extensively in work that I've done. I may also do some beta testing if the learning design lends itself to it. When&nbsp;I use this approach, I often&nbsp;do so through pilot workshops. This also allows me to test learner reactions&nbsp;to different features. A series of pilots allows continued improvement while speeding time to market.&nbsp;With all this said, I haven't traditionally operated with a formal written evaluation plan. I do think through the types of information / decision that I would like feedback on but I haven't then taken that next step to formulate a rigorous evaluation plan to obtain that feedback. So I'm looking forward to working through an evaluation plan&nbsp;this week as I continue to build out the prototype.</p>    </div>

			More information on the peer review process that I used:

1. Identifying reviewers - I used my network to identify individuals with sufficient content knowledge that they could question the content but that also were business practitioners. It was important to me that they were not in an academic setting because I wanted to make sure that they've had to apply the concepts being taught. I also tried to get coverage generationally to see how differently the training was perceived. The last factor was years of supervisory experience. 

2. Establishing guidelines. Each reviewer was provided a checklist that I reviewed with them prior to their review. The checklist wasn't extensive. It focused on these main points ( in order of importance)

. Given the planned content and instructional plan, would the defined learned outcome being achieved. 

. Would a learner that completed this course walk away with at least 1-2 action items that they could start to do immediately, 1-2 that they could act upon in the short term, and 3-5 medium and long-term. In essence, could they construct a comprehensive development plan that continued to enhance their learning and improve their skills.

. Was the content interactive enough within the constraints imposed by the certification standard setting body or hosting environment (these constraints were provided) 

. What elements of the design appealed to them

. What elements of the design didn't they like

. What would they like to see more of (content wise)

. What would they like to see less of

. Are their other features that should be included or that they think really enhance learning based on their other experiences

3. Evaluating feedback - if there were easy changes, I made them. If they were going to be more extensive then I did a cost-benefit

That was about it. There was lots of opportunity for free form feedback			<div class="posted-by">
