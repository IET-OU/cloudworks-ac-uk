<p><strong>Coursera News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Wired Campus; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>Coursera has announced an additional <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/11/22/coursera-lands-20-million-in-new.html" rel="nofollow">$20 million in funding from three unnamed universities</a>.&nbsp; This means the organisation has raised $85 million since April 2012 &ndash; eclipsing MOOC competitors Udacity ($20m) and Udemy ($16m).</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/69518555384/this-holiday-season-learn-on-the-go-with-the-new" rel="nofollow">Coursera has launched an iOS app</a> that allows students to browse, search and enrol on courses, download video lectures for offline viewing, take quizzes and view their personal dashboard.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania surveyed 34,000 learners on Penn/Coursera MOOCs and found that 44% had some graduate education and <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/moocs-are-reaching-only-privileged-learners-survey-finds/48567" rel="nofollow">more than 80% had a degree</a>.&nbsp; They believe this pattern is true not just for the US but also for the BRICS nations, where, &ldquo;80 percent of MOOC students come from the wealthiest and most well educated 6 percent of the population&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, the researchers do caution that these findings may not be generalizable due to the low response rate.</p>
<p>Penn researchers also studied the behaviour of around a million (potential) learners on 16 Coursera MOOCs, finding that, on average, <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/from-a-million-mooc-users-a-few-early-research-results/48841" rel="nofollow">only half of those who register even watch the first lecture</a>.&nbsp; One interesting outcome to emerge is that courses with lighter weekly workloads and fewer assignments had somewhat higher completion rates than those that expected more of participants.</p>

<p><strong>Other MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Martin Weller; George Siemens; Wired Campus; Audrey Watters; Richard Easterbrook; Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>Sebastian Thrun&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gerald Ratner moment&rsquo; set the blogosphere alight.&nbsp; In an article in Fast Company Magazine, Thrun is quoted as saying (amongst other things), &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t educate people as others wished, or as I wished.&nbsp; <a href="http://higheredstrategy.com/udacity-has-left-the-building/" rel="nofollow">We have a lousy product</a>&rdquo;.&nbsp; Now, as part of an &lsquo;Open Education Alliance&rsquo;, Udacity will receive payment from Google, Intuit and others to help produce courses for employee training.&nbsp; Or, to quote <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2013/11/stop-me-if-you-think-youve-heard-this-one-before.html" rel="nofollow">Martin Weller</a>, &ldquo;Thrun has realised that not many people complete MOOCs, and that making them pay is a good incentiviser, so he's making Udacity an elearning corporate training company.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2013/11/15/the-failure-of-udacity/" rel="nofollow">George Siemens</a> is one of many with strong views on this: &ldquo;This is a failure of Udacity and Sebastian Thrun.&nbsp; This is not a failure of open education, learning at scale, online learning, or MOOCs.&nbsp; Thrun tied his fate too early to VC funding.&nbsp; As a result, Udacity is now driven by revenue pursuits, not innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Artist Rooms is a collaboration between Tate, the National Galleries of Scotland and the University of Edinburgh.&nbsp; In addition to a 2014 touring exhibition programme, they will also launch a MOOC looking at the life and work of <a href="http://uk.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/990349/education-for-the-nation-first-warhol-mooc-to-launch-next-year" rel="nofollow">Andy Warhol</a>.</p>
<p>LinkedIn is piloting <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2013/11/14/introducing-a-new-way-to-add-certifications-to-your-linkedin-profile/" rel="nofollow">Direct-to-Profile Certifications</a>.&nbsp; After the completion of a course with a participating provider such as Coursera, EdX, lynda.com, Pearson, Skillsoft, Udacity and Udemy, LinkedIn members will receive an email with a link that will enable them to add the certification or completed course work to their LinkedIn Profile.</p>
<p>edX is abandoning offering <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/edx-drops-plans-to-connect-mooc-students-with-employers/48987" rel="nofollow">job-placement services</a>.&nbsp; In a pilot scheme, edX identified 868 high-performing students from two Berkeley computer-science MOOCs and tried matching them to a handful of technology companies, including Google, Amazon, and SAP.&nbsp; But, of those 868 students, only three landed job interviews and none were hired.</p>
<p>Novelist <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n22/john-lanchester/short-cuts" rel="nofollow">John Lanchester</a> writes the London Review of Books about his experience of taking an EdX MOOC &ndash; Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science &ndash; which he found to be &ldquo;more rigorous, and more educational&rdquo; than he expected.&nbsp; However, I&rsquo;m not is the great and the good from Harvard will be completely aligned with his conclusion: &ldquo;I suspect a lot of the good they bring to the world won&rsquo;t be in the form of anything useful.&nbsp; Instead they offer anyone who can be bothered the chance to learn things just for the sake of learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gates-funded <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/12/06/mooc-research-conference-confirms-commonly-held-beliefs-about-medium" rel="nofollow">MOOC Research Initiative</a> has announced its preliminary results at a conference at the University of Texas but, so far, nothing ground-breaking has emerged: few active users, high drop-outs, high production costs, low returns, etc, etc.&nbsp; Sounds to me like the gravy train may be suffering from a few leaves on the line&hellip;</p>
<p>Martin Weller has also been funded by some of the money I spent buying MS Office 4.0 on 13 floppy disks in 1994.&nbsp; He blogs <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2013/12/completion-data-for-moocs.html" rel="nofollow">Katy Jordan&rsquo;s analysis of completion data</a> from 221 different MOOCs.&nbsp; You really need to see the graphs, but highlights include: negative correlations between numbers who enrol and % who complete, and between numbers of active users and % of those who complete; and a duration of 3-7 weeks looks to be more successful than anything longer.</p>

<p><strong>Planet Pearson</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; THE]</em></p>
<p>Pearson is &ldquo;<a href="http://efficacy.pearson.com/" rel="nofollow">on the path to efficacy</a>&rdquo; and has announced a series of commitments to measure and increase the company's impact on learning outcomes.&nbsp; As part of this, the company has published <a href="http://2vm8ns23vl6z2948z111iucidz.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Asking-More-The-Path-to-Efficacy-high-res1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Asking More: The Path to Efficacy</a>, comprising articles from some of the world&rsquo;s leading education practitioners and business people, and <a href="http://2vm8ns23vl6z2948z111iucidz.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The-Incomplete-Guide-to-Delivering-Learning-Outcomes-high-res1.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Incomplete Guide to Delivering Learning Outcomes</a>, which outlines Pearson&rsquo;s own efficacy programme.</p>
<p>Pearson has sold its financial news service <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-11-29-pearson-sheds-financial-news-group-to-focus-on-education" rel="nofollow">Mergermarket</a> for &pound;382m so that it can focus more on &ldquo;digital learning, educational services and emerging markets&rdquo;.&nbsp; Then, within a week, it made its largest single acquisition since buying Harcourt Education in 2007, by paying &pound;440m for <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-03/pearson-to-buy-grupo-multi-for-721-million-to-expand-in-brazil.html" rel="nofollow">Grupo Multi</a>, a Brazilian English-language training company.&nbsp; Pearson believes Brazil is the one of the largest English-language education markets, worth about &pound;2bn.</p>
<p>Pearson has made a second investment in Delhi-based <a href="http://www.pearson.com/news/2013/december/pearson-announcesfurtherinvestment.html" rel="nofollow">Avanti Learning Centres</a>.&nbsp; Avanti helps prepare students from low-income backgrounds for college entrance exams, focusing on the highly competitive career paths of engineering and medicine.</p>
<p>Oops.&nbsp; The charitable <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/nyregion/educational-publishers-charity-accused-of-seeking-profits-will-pay-millions.html?_r=0" rel="nofollow">Pearson Foundation</a> will pay $7.7 million to settle accusations that it repeatedly broke New York State law by assisting in for-profit ventures.&nbsp; An investigation found that the foundation had helped develop products for its corporate parent and also helped woo clients to Pearson&rsquo;s business side by paying their way to education conferences that were attended by its employees.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s &ldquo;uncontrolled&rdquo; expansion of student numbers at private colleges is <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/pearson-profits-from-private-expansion/2009372.article" rel="nofollow">boosting Pearson&rsquo;s income stream</a> while spelling potential cuts for universities.&nbsp; HNCs and HNDs (examined by Pearson&rsquo;s Edexcel at &pound;159 and &pound;192 per head) account for nearly a quarter of private courses attracting government support.&nbsp; The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has written to the 23 providers &ldquo;expanding most rapidly&rdquo; to tell them to recruit no more students on such courses for 2013-14 confirmed David Willetts.</p>
<p>Ex-Pearson CEO <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/05/twitter-names-marjorie-scardino-ex-ceo-of-pearson-as-the-first-female-member-of-its-board/" rel="nofollow">Marjorie Scardino</a> has been appointed to the board of Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>Why Online Learning is More Valuable than Traditional College</strong></p>
