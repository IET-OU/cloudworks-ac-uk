        <h2>Title <em>Hara Kyriakidou&rsquo;s design narrative</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>I am a primary school teacher, and the ICT coordinator at my school. I am also involved in many programs concerning internet safety.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>The idea was to celebrate safe internet day on the 9<sup>th</sup> of February 2016 with my 3<sup>rd</sup> grade students. Most of the activities took place in the classroom but our work was also presented in the school&rsquo;s assembly room. The key actors were my 8 year old 3<sup>rd</sup> grade students (16 students) and our &ldquo;audience&rdquo; was the rest of the school. They were assigned the role of internet safety &ldquo;experts&rdquo; of the schools who had to share their knowledge with others.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>Our intention was to inform our schoolmates about the importance of internet safety and the &ldquo;dangers&rdquo; they may encounter online.</em></p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li><em>We decided the areas of internet safety we would refer to (online games, cyberbullying, personal information on the web, misleading information on the web).</em></li>
<li><em>In groups, the students studied some case studies about &lsquo;good&rsquo; and &lsquo;bad&rsquo; online behaviour and discussed advice they would give to the people in the case studies.</em></li>
<li><em>In groups, the students created &ldquo;fairy tales&rdquo; about the topics mentioned above. Each group was given a classic fairy tale (Little Red Riding Hood, Pinocchio, Three Little Pigs) which they had to rewrite so that it would become related to internet safety.</em></li>
<li><em>The students were regrouped and they had to create an internet safety poster.</em></li>
<li><em>As a class we agreed on a code of conduct, which we signed.</em></li>
<li><em>We presented all our work to other classes and teachers.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The obstacles mainly had to do with technical problems on our computers, so some groups had to use pen and paper.</em></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>The expected results were that my students learned about internet safety and could create a variety of content. The unexpected results were their &ldquo;confession&rdquo; of experiencing cyberbullying, which will be one the topics we will address in the future. As a teacher, I believe that we reached our objectives to learn and teach about internet safety. Another important outcome was the building of collaborative skills and self confidence which was a result of groupwork and their experience as &ldquo;experts&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>It was a very interesting experience for me to see my students creating their own content and working efficiently in their groups. My role was limited in their learning experience, which I found helped them engage more in their own learning. Something which was also helpful and made my students become more engaged was the assignment as their role as &ldquo;experts&rdquo; and &ldquo;teachers&rdquo;. It is a practice I will use in further lessons.</em></p>    </div>
