        <p>Mobile education is a new way of learning through portable devices. It is emerging and rapidly developing field of educational studies. Technology nowadays changes ways of study and mastering of knowledge, so the role of gadgets changed a lot. We have come to rely on technology to help in everyday life. Mobile learning is growing powerful, not just for education, but for business and personal as well. As technology grows and gets better, we&rsquo;ll discover more ways in which we can use it. In addition, mobile learning is an excellent way to capitalize on the free time while traveling, waiting or doing other primary task.</p>
<p>For me learning via mobile devices is very useful, below I have highlighted my point of benefits of m-learning:</p>
<p>- Portability is a very big plus, as e-book or cellular phone is a compact and very lightweight, and enables to take notes and find information directly via internet.</p>
<p>- Huge saving in the cost of materials, mostly books are downloaded free, so it is appropriate way for cheap learning.</p>
<p>- Time management benefits, flexible hours of learning, for a busy person it is invaluable.</p>
<p>- It is customizable, because&nbsp;apps can be tailored to our unique needs.</p>
<p>- Psychological factor, as reading materials is mostly colorful, pleasant for reading; do not show the real size of a learning material.</p>
<p>- A comprehensive m-learning program ensures that every person has access to the same training materials &mdash; regardless of his location.</p>
<p>-It is very efficient.&nbsp;Mobile learning allows spending mental energy wisely. Traditional learning assumes everyone is at the same level, whereas mobile options let scroll through information we have already mastered and focus on new material.</p>
<p>-Easy access to social media, as an alternative way of finding information.</p>
<p>-Sometimes mobile learning has its difficulties, when it has shortly battery life for example. Also, it is harmful for our eyes, after reading books using mobile devices I have myopia.</p>
<p>Mobile learning is a good tool, but it can&rsquo;t replace core learning program. Mobile programs work best as a means of providing ongoing updates and keeping learning, even when we have back-to-back trips or doing other daily jobs. Just like any form of training, m-learning is just another tool that helps equip us with the information we need to perform our jobs more effectively. When used in conjunction with other training methods, it can help keep us sharp and confident, whether we&rsquo;re across town, overseas, or underwater.</p>
<p>&nbsp; As smart phones and tablets become more use-friendly and powerful, they will tend to replace desktop and notebook computers. The biggest barrier to the use of mobile learning in education is people&rsquo;s attitude towards the use of mobile technology in education. Educators see mobile technology as being too small to be useful, bringing too much distraction for learners, and associated with inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p>During the workshop, I would like to learn new techniques and methods of mobile learning, to implement it to my daily mobile learning practice. For a basic understanding of the technology and its features and how to develop effective learning strategies for mobile learning where learning is learner-centered. Mobile technology is profoundly changing the way people work, learn, conduct business, interact with each other, and access information, therefore I would like to learn how thinking critically about how to deliver instruction differently using the opportunities afforded by mobile technologies.</p>    </div>
