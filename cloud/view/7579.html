                    <br />

                   <p>Hi</p>
<p>Our team (me and <a class="author rdfa" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/user/view/5833" rel="cc:attributionURL" rel="nofollow">Alice （Xin） Huang</a>&nbsp;)wanted to use the Co-Gen T tool (<a href="http://www.pebblepad.co.uk/cogent/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pebblepad.co.uk/cogent/</a>) for creating high level outcomes for our learning design. We saw the post of <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/user/view/108" rel="nofollow">Sheila MacNeill</a>&nbsp;(http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4846)&nbsp;regarding a variant of the tool (http://www.describeability.co.uk/)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My experience of Co-Gen T was that it was not user friendly&nbsp;in its layout and the feedback to the user seems to be very complicated.</p>
<p>Our team used Discernability to create high-level outcomes instead. &nbsp;Our experience of it was that it is a very responsive and user friendly tool. It is easy to use and it gives you a wide range of options connected to keywords to assist in the creation of high level outcomes. It assists in ranking the complexity of the outcome to make it easy to determine the level of engagement of the learner with the content. It is as easy as selecting the outcome and adding it to your basket. When you are done you can click on the basket and all your outcomes are displayed on one screen (<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.describeability.co.uk/basket.asp?id=018925201318" rel="nofollow">http://www.describeability.co.uk/basket.asp?id=018925201318#</a>).

                   <p>I have been using Compendium LD and LDSE to try and plan/communicate designs with other teachers.&nbsp; I am using these in a project at the moment.&nbsp; CLD is fairly straightforward, but when I started to edit/create my own stencil stes for Blended Learning I came a bit unstuck!&nbsp; Have managed, though xml files are beyond me.</p>
<p>A clear set of drawing and annotating tools would be nice, plus some easy way of adding text boxes (or am I missing something)</p>
<p>I have outlined some of my 7Cs processes, CLD designs and resulting Moodle pages here:</p>

                   <p>I have enjoyed using these tools and have some comments on my blog http://edmusings.wordpress.com/ as well as below is the course map for a learning piece. I look forward to working with the more micro-level/detailed ID tools to complete my project (i.e. learner tasks, etc.)</p>
<p align="center"><strong>COURSE MAP for the Hospira IV Pump Training at SHC</strong></p>
<p><strong>Course/ module summary</strong>: Blended approach of hands-on sessions and e-tutorial. The e-tutorial supports the learner by providing introductory material for the IV pump (Hospira), variety of self-assessments, problem-solving case studies, and graded assessments, and operating resources. The face-to-face/hands-on session with the e-tutorial can support basic training, refresher education, and yearly accreditation.</p>

<p>Both the f2f sessions and e-tutorial could emphasize important IV pump procedures, issues and operating resources/manuals. The guided learning path would be a combination of hands-on training, and information and self-assessments on the e-tutorial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Human/peer support could be developed during the f2f class to create connections to learning buddies when in the workplace. Also, a mentor/Super User (or more than one) could be identified for learners to use for support in the workplace. The mentors phone# or email could be provided.</p>

<p>The f2f sessions and e-tutorial would focus on real world application using actual equipment and current visuals of the IV pump model.</p>

<p>Emphasis would be placed on how to operate the IV pump effectively and safely. Problems would need to be solved such as setting up, and altering the pump programs and functions to suit the needs of a patient and apply physician orders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These case scenario problems could be solved in the f2f training and in e-tutorial; the latter could be accessed in the classroom or individually by learners via a computer = blended learning.</p>

<p>The e-tutorial would provide a series of selectable self-assessments for learners to test their knowledge before (diagnostic), during (formative) or after (summative) the f2f training. The summative assessment could be used for grading learner knowledge for accreditation purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the f2f sessions, tutors would assess the knowledge and practical skills of individual learners on the use of the IV pump = verbal and demonstration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The e-tutorial assessments could be used during the f2f class as both guides for the hands-on problem solving (visual representation of instructions and problem), and/or answering questions via group input. The use of the e-tutorial assessments might motivate learners to engage with them individually and after the f2f training for continuous learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feed-forward assessment could be based on assessment results of the learner and provide a table of information to review. For instance, if learner results for a comprehensive e-quiz (15 questions) were below a certain parameter, links to useable resources could be made available to help improve their knowledge (i.e. a link to a quick reference guide or additional learning resources).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the f2f training sessions, learners work together to solve practical problems and case studies which are also represented online as self-assessment case studies.</p>

<p>The one-to-one tutorial presents fundamental information about the IV pump, resources, and self-assessments. Learners can engage as they require, providing them with personal learning and essential resources.</p>

                   <p>Great to see what you are all producing and your views on the different tools. I think there is a real need for a new online tool for design that enables you to visualise designs and oscillate between differnt design representations. This may be an outcome of a new EU project I am involved with called METIS. It is trying to integrate various Learning Design tools that have been developed such as WebCollage, CADMOS etc. Interesting comment re the Cognet learning outcomes tool, again a tool which helps one choose learning outcomes in some simple mannor would be useful.</p>        </div>

                   <p>We (me and&nbsp;<a class="author rdfa" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/user/view/5833" rel="cc:attributionURL" rel="nofollow">Alice （Xin） Huang</a>) looked at the CADMOS Tool (http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5783).</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a Flash enabled tool&nbsp;and does not need to be installed on a PC.</li>
<li>It is relatively easy to use, i was able to navigate and create content with the tool by spending less than 30 minutes exploring it.</li>
<li>There are a number of ready made templates&nbsp;to use or edited. &nbsp;The option is also there to create the content from scratch.</li>
<li>There are two views; The conceptual model view and LD Flow model. It is a neat tool&nbsp;that enables you to visually see and structure conceptual points into a flow diagram.</li>
<li>Activities can be created with Prerequisites, Type of activity and&nbsp;Actors &nbsp;specified all linked to a learning goal.</li>
<li>Complex tasks or sequences&nbsp;can easily be handled.</li>
<li>Activities can be arranged sorting them by phase.</li>
<li>Resources can be allocated to activities.</li>
<li>You are able to export your design to Moodle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weak points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It can only deal with 10 Prerequisites and Learning Goals. It becomes a limitation in complex designs.</li>
<li>It only allows you to select one learning goal per activity, Sometimes more than one learning goal is addressed by ans activity but only one may be selected.</li>
<li>It becomes congested with complex designs and the flow of tasks cannot be easily&nbsp;adjusted.</li>
<li>&nbsp; Using the Rules feature in the flow model does not provide you with a clear description of their use or application. It can also not be consistently applied to Sequences for example.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion<br /><br /></strong>The value of a tool is in its usability and we could not agree on this point. I personally&nbsp;would not use it again as I&nbsp;feel it to be too restrictive for me. Alice, who has a better understanding of Moodle than I do, was highly in favor&nbsp;of the tool and would definitely&nbsp;use it again. No tool is perfect but it is definitely&nbsp;worth taking a look at. We were able to create a conceptual model within an hour.(https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2NV0fznYyLYTXkzZXA0bzJRYkU/edit) (you need to open it with CADMOS)</p>        </div>

                   <p>I've used Course Features cards and Activity Profiles to look at a MOOC with particular reference to designing assessment for it.&nbsp; I did a Course Map as well, but I don't want to share that for various reasons!&nbsp; Comments welcome</p>

                   <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I quite like Ida Brand&atilde;o's Design. I also like the material she made available. A comment I would make is that the Content &amp; Experience should have more information about the course content. I had this problem too so I adjusted to have the main topics of the course, to say somenthing about the main focus of the course. I find that there is a connection between what we did in the EoR and the course map, we can map most itens except the Knowledge and Skills, don't you think? I believe the information should go in the Content &amp; Experience. In previous version of OULDI and even in Grainne's slides this dimension was called Content &amp; Activities, I was so sure I it means the Experience here. I missed that because it was here the space to say about how the activities would have to be developed versus the content.</p>
<p>I was puzzled about why you have Activities only in week 1 of the storyboard.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>As I am playing desperate catch-up after my absence I pursued this task on my own. Looking at previous contributions mine is pretty skimpy, I must admit. I have, however, followed my initial&nbsp;dream project and created a blended learning design for expanding English subject-related vocabulary for engineering students. I created a wall in wallwisher, where I posted task sheet, related videos and worksheets. You can find it at the following&nbsp;link. I was unable to create a hyperlink for some reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="border-top:2px solid #a7d23a;padding:8px;margin:0;font-size:12px;text-align:right"><a style="color:#41555f;text-decoration:none" href="http://padlet.com" rel="nofollow">Created with Padlet<img style="margin: 0 0 0 10px; padding: 0; border: none; width: 16px; height: 16px;" src="http://padlet.com/favicon.ico" alt="" /></a></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feedback is welcome, if you have time to take a look.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>--------------------------------</p>
<p>Now I have had a look at what people have done I have actually spent time on designing rather than mapping, which may not be what was asked. Anyway, I have enjoyed reading everybody's contributions and found many thoughtful comments&nbsp;that show a lot of insight into LD from participants. I am learning a lot, which is the main reason for me continuing being involved in this MOOC.</p>
