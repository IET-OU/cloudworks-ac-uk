        <p>Itana Gimenes: Teaching requirements engineering and software analysis guided by agile practices</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Your situation (context)</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Describe the material and social characteristics of the environment in which you operate. Where will your project take place? Who are the main actors involved? Include images, videos, sketches - anything that would help others understand the opportunities and constraints you are dealing with.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;I am a lecturer in a Computer Science department, specialized in Software Engineering (<a href="http://www.din.uem.br/~itana" rel="nofollow">www.din.uem.br/~itana</a>). In our curricula (<a href="http://www.din.uem.br/graduacao/programas-e-criterios" rel="nofollow">http://www.din.uem.br/graduacao/programas-e-criterios</a>) there is a sequence of software engineering disciplines (modules) that goes from requirement engineering to implementation distributed in 3 years following a traditional waterfall model. We basically use classical software engineering books. The main actors are software engineering lecturers, students and program coordinators.&nbsp; Problems with this sequential model include both the application of agile practices, popular in companies, and a long path to get students involved with implemention. The latter leads to complaints about software engineering being a theoretical discipline which is contradictory given the nature of the subject.</p>
<p><em>The change you would like to see (challenge)&nbsp;</em><em>What do you hope to achieve? What would be different if you succeed?</em></p>
<p>Give students important concepts of software engineering together with a vision of a more concrete subject with hands on activities and more synchronised with industrial practices. We would hope for the students to be happier and more engaged in the projects realizing the importance of software engineering techniques.</p>
<p><em>How you might go about bringing that change&nbsp;What is your pedagogical approach? Which technologies will you use to implement it, and how?</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will design activities that can give the students the opportunity to practice agile development mixed with the study of main concept of requirements engineering and software analysis. Conceptual content will be guided by &nbsp;text books and a study guide. Assessment includes projects which are reviewed and adjusted at every step and exams to check theoretical concepts.&nbsp; Templates of project artefacts to deliver are provided and support software tools are required. We use Moodle as VLE and CASE tools to support practical activities.</p>    </div>

                   <p>Itana, that fit exactly what I am doing at the moment. I am particularly interested in how to get students to experiment with agile practices of software development when they are studying software engineering. I would focus on this aspect rather than on the whole course. The main difference between us is that I am thinking of students on a distance module and you probably are not. It may be interesting to see if we can design activities than will suit both. I am happy to team up with you.</p>

                   <p>I run a module at Plymouth University where our students work with local businesses and charities to create web applications for them, and they are expected to conduct their work over the academic year in an agile manner.</p>
<p>We start them off by learning about agile practices and we expect their teams to adopt some of the elements of Scrum (but not all of the elements are suitable). &nbsp;At the beginning of the module, after they are allocated to their client, they have to develop their product roadmap, their initial sprints and their user stories. &nbsp;As the term continues I expect them to evolve and change their sprints, building on their product roadmap all the time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the first year we have run with agile in this particular module. &nbsp;The integrating project modules in our degree programmes have used agile methodologies for a number of years now.</p>        </div>
