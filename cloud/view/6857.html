                   <p>I set myself two goals for week 1, to get a better understanding for Learning Design and familiarize myself with Cloudworks. I am happy that I have achieved the former and am becoming more familiar with Cloudworks, which to my mind is not a very intituative interface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im looking forward to week 2 and getting on top of the team project.</p>        </div>

                   <p><strong>Helen Guerin&rsquo;s Reflections on Week 1.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four Grand Challenges have been identified in relation to 21 Century learning including:</p>
<ol>
<li>How can educators become more effective in their preparation and facilitation of teaching and learning activities;</li>
<li>How can educators be exposed to new teaching ideas that take them beyond their traditional teaching and learning approaches;</li>
<li>How can technology assist educators without undermining them; and</li>
<li>How can learners be better prepared for the world that awaits them.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, the focus underpinning the design of an effective 21<sup>st</sup> century learning experience should be to teach learners the skills necessary to become lifelong learner and to view learners as &lsquo;co-creators of knowledge and collaborators in networks of research and professional practice&rsquo; (Ferrell, 2011).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A review of the Larnaca Declaration on Learning Design (Dalziel et al. 2012) reveals that Learning Design is a concept that describes a field of study comprising the Learning Design Conceptual Map (LD-CM), the Learning Design Framework (LD-F) and Learning Design Practice (LD-P). The LD-CM links the wider educational environment to the LD-F. The LD-F describes different teaching and learning activities, the LD-P facilitates designing for learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Conole (forthcoming) Learning Design is &lsquo;a methodology for enabling teachers/designers to make more informed decisions on how they go about designing learning activities and interventions, which is pedagogically informed and makes effective use of appropriate resources and technologies&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Curriculum design&rsquo; is generally understood as a high-level process defining the learning to take place within a specific programme of study, leading to specific unit(s) of credit or qualification. This process involves consideration of resource allocation, marketing of the course, and learners&rsquo; final outcomes and destinations, as well as general learning and teaching approaches and requirements. It could be said to answer the questions &lsquo;What needs to be learned?&rsquo;, &lsquo;What resources will this require?&rsquo;, and 'How will this be assessed?'&nbsp;(Ferrell, 2011).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Gustafson &amp; Branch (2012) Instructional Design is a system of procedures for developing educational and training programmes in a consistent and reliable fashion. It is a complex process that is creative, active and iterative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educational design research is generally perceived as the systematic study of designing, developing and evaluating educational interventions, - such as programs, teaching-learning strategies and materials, products and systems &ndash; as solutions to such problems, which also aims at advancing our knowledge about the characteristics of these interventions and the processes to design and develop them (Plomp, 2007).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laurillard (2012) argues that teaching should be repositioned as a design science and universities should adopt a model of &lsquo;Design Inquiry&rsquo;, training educators as learning designers similar to the JISC Design Studio model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there a many commonalities across these theories they differ somewhat in their educational philosophy underpinnings, with Instructional Design being strongly rooted in the Behaviourist Approach (Skinner, 1974) and Learning Design in the more recent Social Constructivist Approach (Biggs &amp; Tang, 2007).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A paradign shift is taking place which is moving the emphasis from teacher-centered learning to student-centered learning, which requires a reconsideration of traditional teaching strategies. This, coupled with a desire to meet the needs of the knowledge economy, has led to a move to integrate generic skills with content knowledge. Therefore, it is necessary to re-design teaching and learning activities to include problem solving, teamwork, effective communication, creativity, intercultural understanding, critical thinking, etc. Examples of 21 century teaching strategies include PBL/EBL, webquests, predict-observe-explain, role play, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supporters of the &lsquo;re-usability&rsquo; concept believe that the re-use of effective teaching strategies and content can lead to more effective learning and a reduction in time spend developing strategies and content.</p>
