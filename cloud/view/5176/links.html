<p>Since this is an innovation website, it might be worth giving careers-work creativity a bit of thought. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no shortage of words.&nbsp; And &lsquo;innovation&rsquo; is one. &nbsp; But there is also &lsquo;inventiveness&rsquo;. &nbsp; And &rsquo;novelty&rsquo; - though I can&rsquo;t see why doing something not done before is necessarily creative.&nbsp; What we know for sure is that sticking with the way things are is not creative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how would it be, to sort these word into a spectrum - stretched between uncreative extremes? &nbsp;It would map the space in which creativity finds its energy. &nbsp;It might look something like this...</p>
<p align="center">novelty&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>inventiveness</strong> &nbsp; &lt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>innovation</strong> &nbsp; &lt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; status-quo</p>
<p>It gives us at least two ways of recognising careers-work creativity - as inventiveness and as innovation. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve sorted the words out like this for a reason.</p>
<p>The reason is economist David Galenson, who got started with a question about artistic market value.&nbsp; He examined how different creators work - painters, sculptors, move-directors, poets, novelists.&nbsp; It led him to make a two-fold distinction between what he calls and &lsquo;conceptual&rsquo; and &lsquo;experimental&rsquo; creativity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>conceptual</strong> creativity starts with an idea to get across - sometimes revealed to the artist in a flash.&nbsp; It is deductive - working from that idea to the creation.&nbsp; But, once it is done, the creator moves on to the next idea - coming up with many different ideas over a life-time. &nbsp;Each is different - both from other people&rsquo;s work, and from that artist&rsquo;s previous work.&nbsp; So, any particular creative form can become fashionable - but it can also prove transient.&nbsp; Nonetheless, each time, the artist knows what she or he is looking for - in this here-and-now.&nbsp; I want to call this &lsquo;inventiveness&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>experimental</strong> creativity is different.&nbsp; These artists don&rsquo;t know in advance what might come out of their work - the work is tentative and incremental.&nbsp; Artists are working from a studied past, and into a not-yet-realised future.&nbsp; This is inductive - working through a process of search and discovery.&nbsp; A creator may work on the same subject many times - struggling with a process of trial-and-error, in constant search for a better way forward.&nbsp; Such artists are cautiously working out their rules - one-step-at-a-time. &nbsp;There are no flash-points here - it is a patient out-working of search, disappointment and persistence &nbsp;&nbsp;A perfectionist creator is often plagued by frustration. &nbsp;I want to call this &lsquo;innovation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>David Gallenson&rsquo;s underlying account of creativity has proven influential.&nbsp; The author gets commissions to show how it works in business, politics and education.&nbsp; I doubt that we can afford him.</p>
<p>But I think he may have a point which is worth reworking in careers-work terms.&nbsp; I call it the &lsquo;quick-fizz&rsquo; and the &lsquo;slow-burn&rsquo; of careers-work creativity.</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>quick-fizz</strong> creativity is conceptually inventive.&nbsp; It knows what it wants to do in order to move people into looking again at what we do.&nbsp; The creative products are surprising, inviting, edgy - cool. &nbsp;They get an immediate reaction, attract attention, and find a ready take-up.&nbsp; But they do little to disturb ideas in any long-term way.&nbsp; This all feels closer to fashionable novelty than to boring status quo - but, as we&rsquo;ll see, that feeling is deceptive. &nbsp;The question is, do we have careers-work creativity like this?</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>slow-burn</strong> creativity is experimentally innovative. &nbsp;It moves slowly, working towards a new way of doing things, which has not yet been fully grasped - and so can&rsquo;t be confidently declared.&nbsp; But the creators stick with the project, working towards what may feel out-of-reach - but which demands pursuit.&nbsp; It all feels closer to boring status-quo than to fashionable novelty.&nbsp; That may be because it takes time, calls on study, and is in for the long-haul.&nbsp; The surprises of this kind of creativity are being intrigued, challenged and disturbed - and all of these are kinds of confusion.&nbsp; Do we need careers-work creativity like this?</p>
<p>I say this is a spectrum, not a dichotomy. &nbsp;And such a continuum makes subtle distinctions possible.&nbsp; There are, for example, careers-work people developing ways of presenting what we do, by inventively calling on images that are familiar and welcome to the people who most need our help.&nbsp; It may be more like fizz rather than burn, but it is certainly not mere novelty.</p>
<p>But there are dangers - for both quick-fix and slow burn. &nbsp;Some quick-fix is little more than novelty - a parasytical mash-up of other people's creativity.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the deception - because it undermines genuine innovation.&nbsp; In careers work it is especially dangerous when it decorates the status-quo with inviting bells and flattering whistles.&nbsp; Where that happens - and it does - it is not supporting innovation, it is substituting for it.&nbsp; It colludes with the way things are - and that is not reform.</p>
<p>And slow burn-dangers?&nbsp; Slow burn can closely resemble status-quo solidity.&nbsp; That is so when its pedantry moves so patiently that is mistaken for deference to our habitual ways of doing things.&nbsp; Some careers worker welcome that kind of reassurance.&nbsp; But innovation is for reform, not defence. &nbsp; Reassuring art might be fine for some living rooms. &nbsp;But reassuring innovation is not innovation at all.</p>
<p>There are questions. &nbsp;How much of the spectrum can careers work usefully occupy?&nbsp; What kind of professionals are attracted to what areas?&nbsp; &nbsp;And what does that mean for a website which gives itself the title &lsquo;innovation&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
