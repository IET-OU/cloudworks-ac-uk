        <p>This conference session is entitled &ldquo;Designing mini-MOOC&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On their website the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) invite learning and development (L&amp;D) practitioners to join them at the &ldquo;epicentre of L&amp;D.&rdquo; A bold statement given its credibility within sections of the L&amp;D community: Jacobs wrote in his blog a strong argument for not joining the CIPD back in 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years later, in September 2018 the twitter conversation from @HR_Hour, using the hashtag #HRHour, asked about benefits of membership of a professional body. There were some scathing comments about the CIPD in the replies. The gap between the CIPDs ambition and the reality of Jacobs and others experience is huge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the contact points members and potential members have is through the CIPDs offering of short-courses and qualifications. It wants learners who come on a CIPD event to feel they have had an experience that is worthy of the epicentre comment, and have a degree of control of what they learn, echoing Spencer&rsquo;s comments (2017) on empower learners.&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this the skill of the practitioner leading the intervention has to match the claim offered.</p>
<p>Many of the practitioners delivering the CIPDs content have a wealth of experience across a number of years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst there is no challenge to their content knowledge, the skills required for practitioners to facilitate events has altered as the move from a tutor-led approach to a learner lead approach (Hase and Kenyon 2000, Towards Maturity 2018) is one of the deliverables of the epicentre promise. The CIPD feel they have a duty to support the professional development of those who deliver its programmes, and have access to the latest research and thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;The MOOC will be an opportunity for practitioners to access content and be able to share their own insights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The session will answer three questions about designing the MOOC:</p>
<ul>
<li>For what purpose? This will explore further the context drivers for the MOOC</li>
<li>For whom? This will give a little more insight into the initial audience and the potential wider audience who could access the MOOC</li>
<li>What is the content? This will offer a taster of the structure and the variety of content available.</li>
</ul>

                   <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Good to hear from you again after H800 - and thanks for drawing my attention to your presentation, as it does link quite closely to my own role as you know, so I'll definitely be listening on 16th.</p>
<p>Looking at the abstract (I'l have a look at your poster/video later) ....&nbsp;is an interesting read, particlulary the idea that content knowledge needs to be supported by strategies for delivering learner-led CPD.&nbsp; I have a couple of questions ...</p>
<p>Do you think you have the right balance between the higher level background/aims of CIPD (two paragraphs), and the needs of the&nbsp;intended audience of the MOOC&nbsp;(one paragraph)?&nbsp;(I'm not saying you don't, just wondered your&nbsp;justification :-) )</p>
<p>Would it be helpful to elaborate on how your project links to/addresses one of the themes of the conference?</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Karen</p>        </div>

                   Hi David
I enjoyed your invite and will  hopefully be tuning in on 16th. Starting to think that a video clip is the way to go. I have some experience of a similar organisation making similar claims a few years ago I won't name them. But needless to say their claims were quickly undermining Ned by the speed of technological development- rendering most of their processes obsolete even if their content wasn't.        </div>

                   <p>Hi David,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very interested in your topic and happy to see another fellow learner designing a mini-MOOC as part of their project.&nbsp; I am interested to know what the driving forces were and the challenges you might envisage moving away from a tutor-led&nbsp;approach to a more participatory approach? I agree it is important for&nbsp;learners to feel empowered and certainly feel they have control in what they are learning.&nbsp; What platform are you intending to use for your MOOC design?</p>
<p>Sounds really good and will certainly be taking notes.</p>
<p>All the best.</p>

<p>How has the the MAODE fed into the work of the CIPD? Has the MAODE been useful for the learning offering of the CIPD?</p>

<p>what do you mean by a "mini-MOOC"? As opposed to a (regular) MOOC?</p>
<p>David how have members (who are not associate trainers) been involved in the design?</p>
<p>Have you thought about which platform you use will use deliver the MOOC?</p>
<p>Is it a MOOC or a SPOC? (Small Private Online Course)</p>
<p>what is the potential for SMEs or even micro-businesses/solo-preneurs to engage with this?</p>

<p>So is this MOOC as much about developing your ltrainers as well as offering a learning experiences for members</p>
<p>Experiential learning for CIPD associates?</p>
<p><strong>My Responses&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Ok, thanks for the questions and the feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the questions raised &ndash; let me remind the context of the MOOC.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an identified need to up skill the CIPDs Associates who deliver on our external courses and qualifications, so it is a very targeted audience of about 100 people not an open course as such &ndash; but using some open education resources to up skill this group in line with our customer needs..&nbsp;&nbsp;In initial stages of the design, the platform was going to be a part of our own website, however, this proved problematic &ndash; hence seeing Annette and Kelly&rsquo;s use of Trello &ndash; this made me think of using this as a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work I have done on MAODE supports our (the CIPDs) digital agenda, the conversations I have had internally over the last year have been linked very much to the project using OER to up skill our associates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other examples have been intuitive technology conversations and a range of design conversations from the H800 module (advances in technologies) and this module (for instance to papers Cathy posted on Microsofts design approach).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said in the session will have to dig out the paper again where I saw the definition of mini-mooc &ndash; earlier on in the course &ndash; but I guess it is in reality a SPOC &ndash; wish I had seen that definition earlier!! However after doing some digging around I may have got mixed up with the definitions Weller used when talking about big and little OER!</p>
<p>Weller, Martin (2010). Big and little OER. In: OpenED2010: Seventh Annual Open Education Conference, 2-4 Nov 2010, Barcelona, Spain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CIPD members give us feedback on all our training courses and as such share their expectations &ndash; this has linked into a number of reasons why this mooc/ spoc is needed and some of the content as well has been informed from discussion I have had with people on programmes I have delivered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I plan to have a space for a discussion forum and interaction and regular web sessions too.</p>        </div>
