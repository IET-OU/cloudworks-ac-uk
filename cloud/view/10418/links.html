<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; The PIE; The Guardian; FE Week; The Independent]</em></p>
<p>UK universities benefit from about &gt;&pound;1.2bn a year in EU research funding, but the Government&rsquo;s determination to sever relationships with the European Court of Justice could scupper any hope the country's universities have of remaining part of European Union research programmes post-Brexit.&nbsp; Prof Chris Husbands, Sheffield Hallam&rsquo;s VC said because Horizon 2020 and similar programmes have disputes handled within the ECJ, it was &ldquo;difficult to see&rdquo; how a solution could be found that allows continued participation unless the government turns out to be more flexible on the ECJ in relation to research.&nbsp; However, the European University Association&rsquo;s Dr Thomas Jorgensen believes, &ldquo;If you have goodwill, you can solve these issues. &nbsp;And the higher education and research issues are really among the least complicated [in Brexit]&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, at last month&rsquo;s International HE Forum, DIT&rsquo;s parliamentary under-secretary of state Mark Garnier claimed the government aims to &ldquo;<a href="https://thepienews.com/news/uk-education-exports-tumultuous-times/" rel="nofollow">harness the power of the UK&rsquo;s education sector</a>&rdquo; in future trade deals &ndash; particularly those involving China, Brazil and Malaysia as countries. &ldquo;where the GREAT campaign is pursuing thousands of export opportunities.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also noted that &ldquo;Ninety percent of global growth will take place outside of Europe and educators must be open to that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also speaking was Paul Wellings, VC at the University of Wollongong in Australia, where education is the third largest export and there is a clear government mandate to increase offshore enrolments.</p>
<p>Hefce has warned of the <a href="https://thepienews.com/news/uk-he-finances-at-substantial-risk-if-overseas-tuition-declines-hefce/" rel="nofollow">risks facing the sector if overseas student fees decline</a>, believing that universities are too optimistic about international student projections.&nbsp; Areas of potential risk include the tightening of UK immigration policy, a downturn in the global economy and increasing competition from worldwide markets for outwardly mobile students.&nbsp; Hefce believes the HE sector is particularly vulnerable to changes in the Chinese student market.</p>
<p>A poll by UUK finds that <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20170412131514332" rel="nofollow">73% of the British public would like to see the same number or more international students coming to study in the UK</a>, after discovering the contribution they make to the economy and the jobs they generate; only 26% regard them as &lsquo;immigrants&rsquo;.&nbsp; A further 75% also believe international students should be able to work in the UK for a fixed period of time after they have graduated, rather than returning immediately to their home country.</p>
<p>The Skills Funding Agency and Education Funding Agency are merging into a single body &ndash; &gt;The Education and Skills Funding Agency &ndash; which will sit within the DfE and begin operating this month.&nbsp; The EFA previously managed funding for 16&ndash;19 provision, while the SFA financed training for older learners. &nbsp;Their merger has been broadly welcomed by the FE sector as it should reduce confusion and duplication that previously existed between the two.&nbsp; The current chief executive of both agencies, Peter Lauener, has announced that he intends to retire following the merger and he will also stand aside as shadow chief executive of the Institute for Apprenticeships once a permanent replacement has been found.</p>
<p>The Guardian reports that a growing number of UK university students are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/apr/10/more-university-students-are-using-tech-to-in-exams" rel="nofollow">cheating in exams with the help of technological devices</a> such as mobile phones, smart watches and hidden earpieces.&nbsp; The number of instances has risen by 42% over the last four years but experts suspect the true figure is much higher because devices such as mini cameras and micro earbuds are difficult to detect.</p>
<p>UK universities are ranked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/mar/08/world-university-subject-rankings-2017-new-stars-emerge" rel="nofollow">top in eight subject areas</a> in international rankings published by QS, based on academic reputation, employer reputation, research citations per paper and research impact. &nbsp;Oxford claims four of those top slots, although Cambridge is no longer top in any subjects.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://business-school.open.ac.uk/news/oubs-ranked-seventh-global-online-mba-rankings" rel="nofollow">Open University Business School</a> has been ranked first amongst UK business schools and joint seventh globally for its online MBA by CEO Magazine in its annual Global MBA Rankings, profiling MBA, EMBA and Online MBA programmes.</p>
<p>Peking University is opening the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/top-chinese-university-peking-hsbc-business-school-open-new-campus-oxford-brexit-a7670451.html" rel="nofollow">HSBC Business School</a> at the former Open University Oxford regional office, Foxton Hall.&nbsp; Students, expected to be mostly from the UK and Europe, will spend a year at the Oxford campus, and another year at the PHBS Shenzen campus, in southern China.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Class Central; Inside Higher Ed; EdSurge; Audrey Watters; University World News; Open Culture]</em></p>
<p>FutureLearn content and quizzes used to be free but, under a new pricing model, that is only the case for up to 14 days after the course concludes.&nbsp; To gain unlimited access to content, quizzes/assignments and course tests, <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/futurelearn-new-pricing-model/" rel="nofollow">students must now pay the Certificate of Achievement fee</a> of &pound;24-&pound;69. &nbsp;FutureLearn&rsquo;s Chief Product Officer, Matt Walton, explains &ldquo;Research we carried out showed that a certificate on its own doesn&rsquo;t offer enough value for money and that some people don&rsquo;t want or need a certificate. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why we want to create a more useful package of features that we think provides great value to as many people as possible.&rdquo;&nbsp; Stephen Downes notes that this follows a trend set by Coursera and edX and he wonders at what point will we have to &ldquo;relinquish the name MOOC and go back to using the original product category name: commercial courseware&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/03/29/coursera-plans-expansion-online-degrees" rel="nofollow">Coursera has set a goal of offering 15 to 20 degree programmes by the end of 2019</a> and has just announced new offerings in pursuit of that target.&nbsp; HEC Paris plans to launch a master&rsquo;s degree in innovation and entrepreneurship, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which already offers two degrees on Coursera, will now launch a master&rsquo;s degree in accounting. &nbsp;UIUC also offers an iMBA programme which it says has exceeded its expectations, enrolling about 500 students across three cohorts since launching in Jan 16.</p>
<p>A price war has broken out as four Australian universities &ndash; the University of Queensland, the Australian National University, the University of Adelaide and Curtin University &ndash; compete to offer students a MOOC-based pathway to <a href="http://www.afr.com/leadership/management/business-education/digital-disruption-lowers-the-cost-of-expensive-masters-degrees-20170310-guv6pf" rel="nofollow">complete a quarter of their masters degree online at a steep discount</a>.&nbsp; These four are among 22 universities around the world, including MIT and Columbia, that are using edX MicroMasters programmes in this way.</p>
<p>Coursera estimates that nearly <a href="https://blog.coursera.org/new-mobile-features-transcripts-notes-reminders/" rel="nofollow">20% of its learners study their MOOCs on a smartphone or tablet</a>, so they&rsquo;re rolling out new features to ensure that &ldquo;95%+ of our 2000 courses can be taken from beginning to end via our apps.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also available will be transcripts, mobile notes, and personalised reminders.</p>
<p>Coursera&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/coursera-identity-verification/" rel="nofollow">Signature Track</a> was a significant early technological breakthrough when it launched in 2013: by analysing each learner&rsquo;s unique keystroke/typing pattern (&ldquo;keystroke dynamics&rdquo;), it significantly reduced the chances of cheating by remote learners using an associate to complete and submit work.&nbsp; However, it now seems to have removed the need for verification every time an assignment is submitted, although learners still have to undergo a verification step once if they want earn a course or Specialization certificate.</p>

<p><strong>The Importance of Learning Design in Educational Video</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;When organizations decide to produce an online course, many quickly jump into questions of video production and start lining up a film crew &hellip; Yet, until we get the learning design right, these questions about production values are premature&rdquo; because the video components have to fit into the overall design and pedagogic approach for the whole course, writes Amy Ahearn.&nbsp; Based on her recent experiences with an NPR broadcaster, a Wharton professor and the Head of TED, she describes <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-03-29-beyond-videos-4-ways-instructional-designers-can-craft-immersive-educational-media" rel="nofollow">four styles of video and how to produce them</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Relate&rdquo; videos get students to feel connected to the instructor, and to reflect on why they are studying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Narrate&rdquo; videos share stories or case studies that provide context, illustrate points and make learning stick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Demonstrate&rdquo; videos illustrate how to do and apply something in a step-by-step way by pulling back the curtain on invisible phenomena or procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Debate&rdquo; videos surface and address misconceptions or competing points of view, changing how students think about a topic</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pre-questions Boost Video Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS]</em></p>
<p>The &lsquo;testing effect&rsquo; is well understood by psychologists and educators &ndash; answering questions after a learning intervention leads to better understanding and retention than simply trying to assimilate content &ndash; and it is a technique widely practised in OU modules.&nbsp; Now researchers have shown <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/06/heres-a-simple-way-to-boost-your-learning-from-videos-the-prequestion/" rel="nofollow">beneficial effects of pre-questioning</a>: attempting to answer questions before a learning intervention.&nbsp; No assessment is made of pre-question responses and no feedback is given to students, but the process of attempting the questions is thought to act as an &ldquo;orienting device&rdquo; that directs students to look for certain information.&nbsp; In a post-test comprising 6 of the pre-questions and 6 unseen, students exposed to the pre-questions performed significantly better (on the pre- and the fresh questions) than those in a control group.</p>

<p><strong>Attitudes to Lifelong Learning</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/598461/Skills_and_lifelong_learning_-_attitudes_to_learning.pdf" rel="nofollow">Factors and motivations affecting attitudes towards and propensity to learn through the life course</a> was first published by the Government Office for Science last autumn, but has just been updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The authors note that &ldquo;The best single predictor of later participation in education is earlier participation (Tuijnman 1991)&rdquo; and a telling statistic is that, of adults who have done no learning since leaving school, 82.5% report no intention to do so in the future.&nbsp; The paper reports propensity to participate is strongly influenced by family experience (parental involvement has four times the impact of social class), earlier education experience, expectations at work and significant life-stage transitions, whereas access to technology has only modest impact.</p>
