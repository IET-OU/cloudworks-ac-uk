        <p><strong>Activity 2:</strong> Construct a design narrative of your own experience on the course.</p>
<p>S.T.A.R.R outline:</p>
<div><strong>Situation:</strong><br />Where are you coming from? What is the context in which you are working and participating in OLDS MOOC?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I was a complete "rookie" at the start. No prior experience or knowledge what so ever of learning design. See my OLDSMOOC intro:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>I&rsquo;m an adult literacy tutor and I live on the West Coast of Ireland (originally from Nottingham). I'm also a very recent graduate of St. Angela's College, Sligo where I completed an M.A. awarded by NUI Galway in Technology, Learning, Innovation and Change.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in digital literaciesand social learning, which ideally I'd like to teach online in a Higher Education or professional development context. For that reason I'm developing my skills and knowledge in relation to online pedagogy and instructional design; that's why I&rsquo;m glad to be here taking part in OLDS MOOC "Learning Design for a 21st Century Curriculum"</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Task: </strong>What did you hope to achieve? What were your goals in joining OLDS MOOC?</p>
<p>My goals were nothing grand, simply to find out what learning design was and to see how it might help me to design and deliver learning online. I signed up in the hope that OLDSMOOC would complement another open course that I was undertaking, <a href="http://pedagogyfirst.org/wppf12/" rel="nofollow">Pedagogy FIrst</a>, focusing on online pedagogy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div><strong>Actions</strong><br />What did you do? What were the main events, interactions, practices and activities in which you participated? What were the obstacles - and how did you tackle them?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Having posted a brief, even vague, outline of my learning project entitled <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7057" rel="nofollow">Digital Me - Understanding Digital Literacies</a>, as per my Pedagogy First initiative, I then started to look around for people to collaborate with, either to develop my idea or to work on something closely related.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There was a lot of activity and alot of confusion (chaos) in the first week as participants went through the process of negotiation. In particular, there was alot of activity around design projects pertaining in some way shape or form to digital literacies. At this point, having noted that I was originally from Nottingham, <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/user/view/5433" rel="nofollow">Jane Challinor </a>struck up a conversation with me&nbsp; relating that she was a lecturer in Nottingham Trent Uni and that her envisaged design project was similar to mine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Shortly after, Jane initiated a cloud called <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7190" rel="nofollow">Digital Identity and Social Media</a> which generated alot of discussion about different aspects of digital literacy. Now,&nbsp; negotiation for design groups was getting quite frenzied, but what I did was to&nbsp; park myself in this cloud and wait and see what transpired. At the end of the day, I was happy to work on my own, if it came down to it. By the end of week 1, it was agreed that Jane and I would form a partnership and work on her project, <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7109" rel="nofollow">Let's Get Digital</a> , a design project to incorporate digital literacies into an undergrad study skills module.I liked this idea because Jane's project was real, which would add real context and purpose to me.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Results</strong><br />What were the outcomes of your participation? Did you meet your goals? What went well, what didn't? What unexpected outcomes did you notice?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I could not have wished for a better project or a better "design partner". Through out, the project both was focused and fun. Each week we managed to achieve the OLDSMOOC goals and, what's more, to have something of real practical value to take away from it too. At first it was difficult to set up channels of communication because things were so hectic, but somehow, and this was truly amazing, with very little discussion we just seemed to do the tasks in tandem, working intutitively to compliment each other. After surviving on snatched tweets and huried DMs, we eventually caught up with each other on Skype over the weekeds. It worked really well. Also, as luck would have it, I was going to be in Nottingham one of the weekends so we were able to meet up over lunch. All very agreable, I must say.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I also enjoyed the Twitter stream for the course. It really helped to breathe some life into the course; I found Cloudworks to be very sterile, indeed stiffling almost.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In terms of the narrative and unexpected outcomes or incidents, the project was very fortunate in Week 3, when the resource <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7833" rel="nofollow">Digital Literacy Facilitation Cards </a>were rolled out and Jane was able to incorporate them into the project's learning outcomes.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Reflections</strong><br />What did you learn? What advice could you give others?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I learned lots, and not just about learning design. Primarily, I&nbsp; think I Iearned about&nbsp; context and ecologies and the design tools that enable you to factor for this. And certainly, I learned the joys of collaborating with like minded, passionate people. If I had any advice to give as a result of this experience, I would say be clear about your purpose for participating and seek out people with similar aims, be prepared to be flexible and adaptable after that because essentially you'll be heading in the right direction :)</div>
