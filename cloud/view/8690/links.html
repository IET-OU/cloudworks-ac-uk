        <p><strong>Title</strong>&nbsp;Muddling through Moodle Management</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>I design and setup elearning solutions for small healthcare agencies who want their staff to do compliance training online.&nbsp; The key to getting this setup to work is to make sure the Training Administrator (TA) who manages staff training, is confident in the use of the new system.&nbsp; If the TA understands and instructs her staff well, then I am not bothered by support calls.</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>The TA usually has had a the job of following protocols with regards training requirements &nbsp;and ensuring that training courses are organised and staff files are kept current.&nbsp;&nbsp; A new system of work can cause changes to the established way of working, and needs to be introduced with care.&nbsp; If the online training solution is seen to make everyone&rsquo;s lives easier and more manageable, then it is continued by management.&nbsp; If there is bad feedback from staff, then it is discontinued.</p>
<p>I have found that a training that follows specific protocols works well in these situations.&nbsp; I also have found that the training must take place with the candidate&rsquo;s own computer, so that they can take ownership of the training directly.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>If the client understands how to enrol students, what the common FAQ&rsquo;s are, and how to deal with common problems, then I do not get inundated with support queries.&nbsp; The measure of success is measured over the ensuing weeks, by the number of support calls I receive, and by the feedback the system receives from staff.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>The first action was ensuring that the candidate&rsquo;s computer was setup in a way that ensured a successful &nbsp;outcome.</p>
<p>The company IT department had left IE7 as the default web browser.&nbsp; This is so out of date, that it wouldn&rsquo;t work with &nbsp;the HTML5 &nbsp;coursework that we use.&nbsp; I had to ask for an upgrade, and preferably for google chrome (which is automatically updated) to be installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next stage was to set up a series of steps that the candidate could follow for each of the processes involved.</p>
<p>These included templates of instructions for enrolment, what to do when emails went missing, how to print out certificates and the basics of managing the site.</p>
<p>By having a folder with protocols set up, the training was reasonably simple and straightforward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also asked the TA to take notes that she could refer to in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The results of the training were better than expected. By focusing on the client&rsquo;s desire to follow systems, I was able, in a short space of time, to get the online system rolled out to the agency&rsquo;s staff.</p>
<p>In the first week or so there were some minor hiccoughs, but things went relatively smoothly.</p>
<p>With my time not taken up doing support, I was able to offer some further courses to the company that they could use for staff development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Both staff and management were very supportive of the system as both groups felt it gave them greater flexibility, while increasing interaction within the company.&nbsp; I felt that this was due, to a large degree, to the confidence that everyone had in using the system.&nbsp; This confidence was hinged on the clear instructions and support that they received at the start of their training by the TA.&nbsp; While the TA&rsquo;s attitude and personal competence played a major part, I would like to think that the training she received at the beginning, also helped in the success.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>Understanding that the TA wanted a series of protocols to follow, and providing these in a clear way, underpinned the success of this training.&nbsp; She was not interested in the the pedagogal and instructional theories that underpinned the training.&nbsp; The TA wanted to give clear instructions to candidates in what to do to complete the training, and wanted a simple outcome at the end of each training session.</p>
<p>Understanding&nbsp; the TA&rsquo;s objectives, and gearing the training to both her objectives, and her existing way of working, helped make the transition smooth.</p>
