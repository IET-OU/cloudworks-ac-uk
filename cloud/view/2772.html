                   <p>This question came up over cups of tea yesterday when we were "debriefing" with Grainne, James Clay and colleagues about points raised in her and Peter's presentations on Tuesday morning.&nbsp; We laughed when remembering the spontaneous trickle of applause when Peter said that "for 10 years we've been talking about flexible learning... how has our teaching practice changed?" - something to that effect. I wondered aloud what would have happened if he'd asked for a show of hands at that point, of people who felt they really were teaching in fundamentally different/new ways, grappling with "new pedagogies"? What do these "new pedagogies" look like and how we could characterise them? Images of "mobile learning" (in all 4 guises as outlined by James Clay in his keynote) come to mind - but when those learners are learning "anywhere anytime", making choices about place and time of access, or when the in/formal learning divides blur, or when learners and teachers interact in virtual worlds, (etc etc) what's new about the learning/teaching PROCESS and related strategies ? Are "new pedagogies" at the level of delivery and facilitation or deeper than that (e.g. assessment, curriculum and course design?) Or in other dimensions altogether?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Just wondering if there is a chicken and egg thing here. Which comes first, the new pedagogy or new ways of learning in the wild which are observed and then re-written as pedagogies. I don't know enough education theory to be sure, but it does seem a number of the pedagogies or learning theories that have been popular over the last 20 years have grown out of observation of what learners do and that works and then have been developed into methods that can be replicated - sometimes well and sometimes not so well.</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>At last year's Plymouth e-learning Conference Mark Russell and I facilitated a workshop that explored the concept of an e-pedagogy. The workshop aimed to explore what features of learning environments are needed to promote and support learning (see a range of responses at <a href="http://lindsayjordan.edublogs.org/what-promotes-learning/" rel="nofollow">http://lindsayjordan.edublogs.org/what-promotes-learning/</a>) and to establish whether these features have any uniqueness or specific relevance to technology-rich or technology-sparse learning environments.</p>
<p>I would suggest that - as Gilly Salmon identifies in her 5-step model - when a teacher or facilitator is introducing a tool or technology that requires new skills - new ways of thinking or working, the introduction and embedding of these tools becomes a crucial part of the teaching and learning process. Some may see this as a revision to traditional pedagogies. However, the process of learning to use these tools in a constructive way is optimised by the same factors as any other learning process; prompt feedback, reciprocity, active learning, etc., and 'learning how to learn' - active study techniques, teamworking skills - made an appearance on curricula long before the rise of Web 2.0.</p>
<p>Some may view the increasing importance of group communication and collaborative working as a shift in the nature of the learning process, and therefore representing a shift in pedagogy, but the importance of contact, reciprocity and co-operation in learning has been widely accepted for decades. The tools we use now are more efficient, accessible and mobile than the blackboards, flipcharts and typewriters of yesteryear - which is fabulous. Other than this - does 'good learning' look any different? Personally I doubt it, but I'm open to other suggestions :-)</p>

                   <p>Hi</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are "new pedagogies" at the level of delivery and facilitation or deeper than that (e.g. assessment, curriculum and course design?) Or in other dimensions altogether?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me the problem I'm experiencing-or at least at national level, ie, Spain- is that new pedagogies are indeed taking place at the delivery and facilitation level (depending on teachers/institutions awareness and drive for change) but they clash with 'old' pedagogies at the deeper level as you call them. So to me, right now, it should be extremely important to work on the new pedagogies at that&nbsp;deeper level. I've seen, read, heard&nbsp;quite often colleagues asking how to assess a whole course where students work is via blogs, wikis, etc...and students complain about the fact of new pedagogies taking place at the delivery level but then the old model of exam and reward applies, at all stages (primary, secondary, college, uni)...</p>
<p>There's still a lot to be changed (and synced bw what governments say and the bills they pass or don't pass on education, basically they should lead by example: change assessment methods at national level&nbsp;if you are recommending teachers to innovate at the delivery &amp; facilitation level!)</p>

                   <p>I had a sobering conversation with my 13 year-old son during the Ascilite09 conference... I was telling him about 2nd Life and the presentations I'd seen on it that day, how some university lecturers were building lecture theatres in 2nd life. He (bright student, avid reader, great curiosity and imagination, high academic standards - yes, and extremely proud and biased mum) shook his head slowly&nbsp; and said: "I'm not going to university".And he wasn't joking.</p>
<p>So,&nbsp; "new pedagogies" ? What exactly are we up to with elearning "innovation" and where is it headed ?</p>
<p>Thanks to all for participating in this discussion so far. Lindsay, I enjoyed reading your blog - would be very interested in anything you wrote up or reported on subsequent to the workshop?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Claire - thanks for the feedback on the blog - watch this space ;-)</p>
<p>I'd be interested to know what you think caused your son to respond in that way (about SL)... there are a lot of conversations going on at the moment about the long-standing backlash against the new ways that people work, play and learn; the constant rumblings that these new tools and methods are causing a 'dumbing down' of society; increased emphasis on the trivial, a lowering of standards and a loss of traditional, valuable skills.</p>
<p>I'm sure this backlash against technology existed long before the Ancient Egyptians discovered the use of rollers and pulleys to build the Pyramids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peter Marris (Loss &amp; Change; 1974) explains beautifully how individuals and society respond to change, and how important these conservative impulses are to the change process. These ever-present rumblings may seem like ignorant, damaging nonsense to innovators and evangelists, but should not be ignored; they fuel the rigorous examination of the nature of and reasons for change.</p>
<p>If your son is questioning what value new technologies like Second Life might have for his own learning, then you have an interesting and productive conversation on your hands. He may equally be accepting unquestioningly something he has read or heard that took a more conservative view about virtual worlds in education... but he is only 13 so there is no need to panic - independent critical analysis is probably a couple of years away yet ;-)</p>

                   <p>I understood my son's response to be questioning the ability of tertiary educators to harness new technologies to support teaching and learning - but I could be wrong. He and his peers take virtual worlds for granted in their "gaming lives", and so to replicate a formal educational setting in a fantasty world where "anything could happen" is, I think, hugely disappointing to him. I will pursue this conversation with him and hope to elicit some fresh and exciting ideas about how these immersive environments could support learning, as they do playing, in his view.</p>
<p>thank you for mentioning Peter Marris' book. One of the <a href="/cloud/view/2756" rel="nofollow">invited speakers</a> at this conference, Mark Nichols, was talking precisely about the value of "the rumblings of&nbsp; damaging nonsense" and their crucial role in rigorous examination of our (elearning in this case) practice.</p>

                   <p>Interesting thanks for the link JOhn. Also talking briefly to Gordon Joyce from Notthingham University on the way back to the UK - bumped into him in the holding pen at LA! I wonder if we should be exploring the ideas around threshold concepts more with this respect? Gordon and colleagues won the best paper award at Ascilite this year, so worth a read, will add a link to the<a href="http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/auckland09/procs/" rel="nofollow"> proceedings...</a></p>        </div>

                   <p>yes, thank you very much, John. I will follow up on those links with interest asap. Pre-empting and diagnosing students' conceptions has a lengthy and strong research-basis in science education (e.g. Posner and Strike, Osborne and Gilbert, Ros Driver, Seymour Papert, to name a few) as does applications of AI (thinking of the Knowledge Based Systems in undergrad physics and comp sci in the 80's). I look forward to watching progress with the new technologies and your PhD. New technologies? yes. new pedagogies? I'm still wondering.... perhaps this needs (re?)definition...</p>        </div>

                   <p>I am with Elena (Spain) about using web 2.0 not just for delivering content and enhancing learning through interaction and communication but also to use them for formative and summative assessment. Currently, where I work - we have started to use wikis for to assess group work - process and product and someone is writing a new curriculum where blogs will be used to assess critical thinking (discussion, evaluation etc).</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know if anyone has experience of assessing blogs at any level and would like to share</p>        </div>
