                   <p>I'm Sally Trevor from Brunel International and have chosen this link for our training day as these MIT lectures can be very useful in teaching and testing listening skills.&nbsp; I chose the Brain and Cognitive Sciences lecture series because it is extremely interesting and the lecturer provides excellent PDF accompanying activities and he is highly entertaining.&nbsp; These lectures would be aimed at advanced level international students.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks Rebecca, no I haven't used these ones before.&nbsp; But they seem to be very good.&nbsp; However, I've decided to look for something a bit easier for our training session as&nbsp;we are&nbsp;new to the software.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I know what you mean :) The aim is for teams to get to just a <em>broad</em> visual overview of the new or reworked module by the end of the session, with ideas and examples of resources and technologies (aligned to pedagogic intent). Given that it is just a one day workshop, and there are some new tools to use too, I guess it is about getting the balance right between something that is not too complicated and yet still interesting enough to launch on students! We hope that Cloudworks will be used after the event too for discussing and developing designs further post f2f workshop.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi, I'm part of the Brunel International group. We're thinking about developing materials to support our students in their listening and note-taking skills. It can be difficult to find a good range of subjects / topics to keep students motivated so they keep returning to a particualr website / activity, but I think the Guardian has an excellent range of academic related topics eg Business, Technology, Media, and longer listening actifivites which replicate the demands of more extensive lecture listening.</p>
<p>This website doesn't give full transcripts, but by cross-referencing with the articles written on the topic, students can review vocabulary and context. Because it's such a current and authentic source of&nbsp;listening, I think it will be a highly motivating resource to exploit in and out of the classroom. What do others think?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am Anu Sharma, a Senior e-Learning Technologist from the Academic Practice Development Unit at Brunel. Our team is considering developing a 'PebblePad' e-portfolio&nbsp;workshop for staff. The aim of the workshop would be to introduce staff to tools and features of the system, whilst considering how these could be used to complement the student learning process.</p>
<p>I have included a link to the PeblePad site which provides examples of previously constructed portfolios.</p>
<p>This is a great resource because it encourages scaffolded or independent learning to some extent. By providing examples of previously constructed portfolios, it gives staff the opportunity to consider how they could use the tools at their disposal in the content of their teaching.</p>
<p>Rather than giving staff a&nbsp;prescribed template, they are encouraged to independently &nbsp;consider how they would structure/ promote use of this facility for use with their students.</p>        </div>

                   <p>My name is Sweta Rajan-Rankin and I am a new lecturer in social policy with the social work division of the School of Health Scienes and Social Work, Brunel University. The link I have added was to my most recent lecture on 'theories and ideologies of welfare' which I taught to BA level 1 students in social work. This is an important foundational course for social work students, however theories can often be quite daunting to students who may come from Access course routes and are unfamiliar with academic learning at a graduate level. By using this example I hope that our group can look at ways in which we can make theory more fun and interesting for students and get them engaged in discussing ideological positions towards welfare and link them to current political debates. This is just one idea- does the group have any suggestions?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Sweta,</p>
<p>I am Giota, Rebecca's colleugue and will be the 'OER advisor' for the workshop. I see your point and sometimes finding relevant resources for a particular level can be daunting. I had a look at the <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/" rel="nofollow">OER Commons</a> website and a research on 'welfare' took me to a unit from Open University's <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/courses/remaking-the-relations-of-work-and-welfare" rel="nofollow">Open Learn</a>&nbsp; that you may find useful. Have a look at the content and relevant visualisation and deliberation tools, and feel free to post ratings, or try to use it in class. You can also post ratings and a comment on relevance or the context you reused it (if so) on OER Commons <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/courses/remaking-the-relations-of-work-and-welfare" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<p>On the idea of making argumentation and links to theory more fun. There are several open tools for deliberation and argumentation. Here's a page from <a href="http://globalsensemaking.wik.is/index.php?title=About_GSm/Existing_Sm_Tools/The_Deliberatorium&redirect=no" rel="nofollow">MIT's Deliberatorium&nbsp; </a>It also contains links to other sense making and argumentation tools.</p>

<p>There are some things about me are ;</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Nicholls</strong><strong> </strong>has worked in clinical and academic posts in South Africa and London, UK. Her MA was at the Tavistock-Portman Clinic in psychoanalytic work with organisations.&nbsp; Her PhD research involves a psychoanalytically informed ethnographic study of the social defence mechanisms used by occupational therapists in their professional work. She has published articles and chapters on psychoanalytic thinking in occupational therapy and her current interests are in dreaming as a research method and the symbolic understanding of occupations in clinical work and social life.</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone, my name is Gr&aacute;inne (pronounced gronya) Conole and I work with Rebecca and the others from the OU as part of the OU Learning Design Initiative (http://ouldi.open.ac.uk). I'm sorry that I wasn't able to be at the workshop today but I hope to be able to contribute remotely. In addition to the openlearn repository of OER that Giota mentioned, it's worth flagging up a new initiative we have funded for from the Hewlett foundation, Olnet (http://olnet.org). This is from the website:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The aim of OLnet is to tackle gathering evidence and methods about how we can research and understand ways to learn in a more open world, particularly linked to Open Educational Resources (<abbr rel="nofollow">OER</abbr>) but also looking at other influences. We want to gather evidence together but also spot the ideas that people see emerging from the opportunities.</p>
