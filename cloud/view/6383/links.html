<p>4. A series of manuals were produced in 2011 which form a &nbsp;collection for the matching of competences in higher education and the labour market. Each is a dissemination measure of the European funded Tempus project.</p>
<p>These manuals contain some useful information and guides. No's 1 and 3 are included here as I think they contain the best resources. Manual 2: Matching Competences between Higher Education and the Labour Market&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;and Manual 4: Strategy and Curricula Development, can be obtained by searching&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. Principles of &nbsp;Curriculum Design for Literacy Training : UNESCO publication</p>
<p>This was written some time ago and i thought twice before including it in the eWatch. However Having read through much of the content I thought lots of this tuff is highly relevant and is well presented. You may think differently ,but i think there is a lot of useful material in the document.Some may be familiar but hopefully some you will find useful</p>

<p>8. Clayton Wright's June - December 2012 Educational Technology and Education Conferences listing.</p>
<p>This is probably the best listing you will ever come across thanks to the continuing hard work by Clayton Wright. You could spend forever on the road. Come to think of it I think I know some academics who do!</p>
<p>Don't forget to link to the other sites recommended by Clayton on developing and renewing online course and open education resources.</p>
<p>Linking to Seb's site is deliberate as well. Apart from Clayton's list. Seb has some excellent resources and comment worth exploring.</p>

<p>9. iPods,iPhones and iPads in Education</p>
<p>A useful Website with a New Zealand flavour and some ideas and resources relating to the use of iPods,iPhones and iPads. Classroom management made a lot of sense.</p>
<p><a href="http://ipodsiphonesineducation.wikispaces.com/iPods+in+the+Classroom" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ipodsiphonesineducation.wikispaces.com/iPods+in+the+Classroom</a></p>
<p>10. Ways to Evaluate Educational Apps</p>
<p>A useful article about evaluating educational Apps. The rate at which Apps are being used in teaching and learning is accelerating rapidly. Knowing what to choose and use can be a challenge. Using a purpose design rubric App will be of some help in the decision making process. Apparently there are over 43,000 educational Apps available. Ouch!</p>
