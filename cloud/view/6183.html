<p><strong>MITx</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Tony Bates; THE]</em></p>
<p>MITx&rsquo;s first open class, <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/mitx-opens-enrollment-for-first-interactive-online-course-pilot-certificates-will-be-free/35396" rel="nofollow">Circuits and Electronics</a>, began on 5 Mar.&nbsp; Based on an introductory class offered to between 100 and 250 campus undergraduates, the course will help students make the transition from physics to electrical engineering and computer science.&nbsp; Open students will get grades based on homework assignments, activities in a gaming-style virtual lab, and tests.&nbsp; No MIT human intervention is planned - all interactions, responses and evaluation of submissions will be automated.</p>
<p>Tony Bates reflects on whether/how it will work, and whether it represents a welcome leap forward or just an online reinvention of the <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2012/02/15/will-mitx-work/" rel="nofollow">CAL and programmed learning of the 1970/80s</a>?</p>
<p>Martin bean writes in THE about <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=419264" rel="nofollow">the developing world&rsquo;s need for higher education</a> and his assertion that this can be met by the digital delivery of open educational resources.</p>
<p>The Times Higher also discusses MITx as part of a wide ranging article which considers: &ldquo;With novel credentials being developed and employers seeing the value of <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=419088" rel="nofollow">low-cost study based on open courseware</a>, Jon Marcus asks if the bricks-and-mortar elite will end up on the wrong side of history.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>New iPad Launch</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17292424" rel="nofollow">next generation iPad</a> was launched last week and goes on sale in the UK this Fri (16 Mar).&nbsp; The new device features more pixels than you&rsquo;ll know what to do with, faster graphics, a 5MP autofocus camera, voice recognition and 4G connectivity.&nbsp; Prices range from &pound;399 (16GB, wi-fi) to &pound;659 (64GB, wi-fi and 4G).&nbsp; The previous model will stay on sale at a reduced price, starting at &pound;329 in a bid to, &ldquo;make it more affordable for schools.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Worldwide Student Numbers Forecast to Double by 2025</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; The Telegraph]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120216105739999" rel="nofollow">global number of students enrolled in higher education</a> is forecast to more than double to 262 million by 2025, and more than half of these will be in China and India alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Average annual growth in demand for international higher education between 2005 and 2025 is expected to exceed 3% in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Central America and South America,&rdquo; writes higher education consultant Bob Goddard.&nbsp; As a result of this demand, the number of students seeking study abroad could rise to eight million &ndash; nearly three times more than today.</p>
<p>The number of full-time undergraduate courses on offer at UK universities has fallen by more than a quarter (27%) since 2006, according to a UCU report, <a href="http://www.ucu.org.uk/media/pdf/c/h/Choice_cuts_report_Feb12.pdf" rel="nofollow">Choice Cuts: How choice has declined in higher education</a>, which finds that the number of undergraduate courses available has decreased from 70,052 in 2006 to 51,116 in 2012, despite an increase in student numbers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9128663/Cheapest-universities-and-colleges-to-take-more-students.html" rel="nofollow">&lsquo;Former Polys&rsquo;</a> are 20 years old this month and their popularity and student numbers continue to grow.&nbsp; They were helped by a recent announcement by David Willetts that 20,000 places have been removed from the HE system and redistributed: 9,643 places will be distributed to 35 former polys charging annual fees of less than &pound;7,500 and 10,354 places will go to 155 FE colleges.</p>

<p><strong>Pearson Sees Digital Publishing Income Beating Print in 2012</strong><br /><em>[Zite]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-pearson-sees-digital-publishing-income-beating-print-in-2012/" rel="nofollow">Pearson&rsquo;s digital revenue grew by 18%</a> to &pound;2bn through 2011 and the publisher forecasts, &ldquo;Revenues from digital and services businesses [are] expected to exceed revenues from traditional publishing businesses in 2012.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pearson-owned Penguin has sold 50 million apps and e-book since 2008 and the group reached 43 million students through digital learning services.&nbsp; e-Books now make up 12% of its global (&pound;125m) sales. &ldquo;We expect this percentage to increase significantly again in 2012,&rdquo; the publisher said.</p>
<p>Amazon has pulled more than 4,000 books from its e-shelves after <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_amazon_getting_impatient_with_book_publishe.php" rel="nofollow">publishers wouldn't budge for lower prices</a>.&nbsp; Google is cutting off partners in its e-book affiliates program because sales referrals are too low to be worthwhile.&nbsp; Although e-book sales are rising, print still brings in more revenue for publishers because consumers expect e-books to be cheaper and so publishers can't charge as much for them as they might like.</p>

<p><strong>How Important are Open eBook Standards to Universities?</strong><br /><em>[JISC; Pete Mitton; Wired Campus; ALT]</em></p>
<p>The ePub/eBook/iBooks debate continues.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/blog/how-important-are-open-ebook-standards-to-universities/" rel="nofollow">Ben Showers</a> writes on the JISC site about the effect of different (and open standards) on the university sector.&nbsp; He also refers to a recent and very useful JISC paper, <a href="http://jiscpub.blogs.edina.ac.uk/final-report/" rel="nofollow">Digital Monograph Technical Landscape: Exemplars and Recommendations</a>, which unpicks some of the technical and commercial landscape.</p>
<p>Inkling Habitat (mentioned last month) is attracting reasonable interest as a serious e-book authoring tool.&nbsp; A video from the recent O'Reilly TOC Conference of Matt McGinnis&rsquo;s presentation, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bborgjHF4&list=PL16E261CDB64A51AF&index=5&feature=plpp_video" rel="nofollow">The Death of the Page, the Dawn of Digital</a>, is worth a view, but you might want to skip forward to about 7:00 to miss some of the introductory stuff.&nbsp; Jenn Webb also reports from the conference about <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/02/the-ebook-evolution-toc.html" rel="nofollow">the e-Book revolution</a>, what&rsquo;s happened so far and where publishers expect/hope things will go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A free, open-source authoring contender is <a href="http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/booktype" rel="nofollow">Booktype</a> which, once installed on a Web server, allows teams of authors to work together to write and edit sections of books and chat with each other in real time about revisions.&nbsp; The finished product can then be easily published on e-readers and tablets, or exported for print-on-demand&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scott Hennessy writes of his experiences using <a href="http://newsletter.alt.ac.uk/2012/02/mobile-publishing-with-jutoh/" rel="nofollow">Jutoh</a> for mobile publishing.&nbsp; Jutoh costs &pound;24 per licence, runs on Windows, Linux and Mac and can also be carried on a USB stick.</p>

<p><strong>Free Introductory Textbooks</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates; Zite; Cult of Mac]</em></p>
<p>Rice University is offering <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/books" rel="nofollow">online introductory textbooks for free</a>, through the Hewlett/Gates-funded OpenStax College.&nbsp; The books are peer reviewed and could save US students up to $90m a year, if adopted by university and college instructors.&nbsp; In the next five years, OpenStax hopes to have free books for 20 of the most common college courses across a range of subjects.&nbsp; Five are currently available, covering physics, biology, anatomy, physiology and sociology.</p>
<p>MIT OpenCourseWare and textbook publisher Flat World Knowledge have teamed up to provide free, high-quality textbooks to learners accessing three <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/ocw-flat-world-knowledge.html" rel="nofollow">OCW Scholar courses</a>: Principles of Microeconomics, Introduction to Psychology and Solid State Chemistry.&nbsp; OCW Scholar courses include openly published course content (syllabi, lecture notes, assignments and exams) but are created specifically for independent learners, who typically have few additional resources available to them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/73673/apple-publishes-six-free-electronic-books-for-developers/" rel="nofollow">Apple is offering six free electronic books for developers</a>.&nbsp; Titles include iOS Application Programming, The Objective-C Programming Language and iOS Human Interface Guidelines.&nbsp; Downloads are available via the iBookstore.</p>

<p><strong>Samsung Learning Hub</strong></p>
<p><em>[JE]</em></p>
<p>Samsung has announced its own education service called <a href="http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2012/02/22/education-is-the-sincerest-form-of-flattery-samsung-readies-learning-hub-for-galaxy-tab/" rel="nofollow">Learning Hub</a>, which it says will provide 6,000 textbooks and videos from 30 education providers across the world.&nbsp; Content and features &ndash; including automatic scoring, note-taking abilities and learning management options &ndash; are initially aimed at the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and 8.9 tablets, with smartphone support to follow.&nbsp; Do we hear the sound of Apple running for the hills?&nbsp; Probably not.</p>

<p><strong>Visual Impairment Support</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Jonathan Fine; Slashdot; JE]</em></p>
<p>Florida State University has agreed to pay two blind students $75,000 each after they successfully argued that a <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/150000-settlement-reached-in-blind-florida-state-students-e-learning-suit/35659" rel="nofollow">maths course relied on e-learning systems that were inaccessible to people with disabilities</a>.&nbsp; The students could not access software that was used for homework and tests and the course also relied on inaccessible remote-control &ldquo;clickers&rdquo; that allow students to answer multiple-choice questions during lectures.</p>
<p>The BBC reports on the increasing provision of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16984742" rel="nofollow">Braille</a> in many walks of life, notably on packaging, signage and device interfaces.&nbsp; There has also been a shift in emphasis in terms of what is provided; the RNIB&rsquo;s Pete Osborne observes, &ldquo;Manufacturers don't now say 'it'd be really nice if we could do Braille', they say we know we should, we need to know how.&rdquo;&nbsp; The article provides some useful examples of how Braille works and how blind people use it, including comments from David Blunkett and others.</p>
<p>Researchers at Georgia Tech University have built a free open-source app, <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/12/02/20/0136243/georgia-tech-iphone-app-could-help-blind-users-text" rel="nofollow">BrailleTouch</a>, that uses six large touch-screen buttons and speech synthesis to allow users to generate Braille text without needing to look at a the device's screen.&nbsp; Early studies with visually impaired participants proficient in Braille demonstrated that users can input up to 32 words per minute with 92% accuracy.</p>
<p>The Connexions OER site has just made available two topics with content specifically optimised for blind students: <a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11294/latest/" rel="nofollow">Physics Concepts</a> and <a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11349/latest/" rel="nofollow">Objected-Oriented Programming Concepts</a>.</p>

<p>Researchers at Cambridge University have been investigating <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/06/in-mobile-apps-free-aint-free-but-cambridge-university-has-a-plan-to-fix-it" rel="nofollow">information privacy provided by apps</a>.&nbsp; They developed an API to analyze 250,000 apps in the Android store, finding that 73% were free, 80% of those relied on targeted advertising as their main business model, and 70% of those were collecting data that is not relevant to the apps themselves.&nbsp; They found examples of free apps that collected the user&rsquo;s location, phone number, contacts, e-mails/sms, calendar, phone number and IMEI.</p>

<p><strong>Cognition is Changing and so too Must Education </strong><br /><em>[The Atlantic; Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Elon University and Pew Internet have released a report, <a href="http://www.elon.edu/e-net/Note.aspx?id=958393&board_ids=5,58&max=50" rel="nofollow">Imagining the Internet</a>, based on surveys with more than 1,000 thought leaders who were asked to consider how the Internet and its environment are changing kids' cognitive capabilities.&nbsp; By 2020, it is expected that Generation AO (Always-On) &ndash; brought up from childhood with a continuous connection to each other and to information &ndash; will have characteristics that differ greatly from their elders: multitasking will be the new norm; hyperconnectivity may be leading to a lack of patience and concentration; and that an always-on ethos may be encouraging a culture of expectation and instant gratification.</p>
<p>Tony Bates presents a useful <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2012/02/29/a-student-guide-to-studying-online/" rel="nofollow">student guide to studying online</a>, with advice, tips and links to providers.&nbsp; The OU gets a mention as the founder of, &ldquo;modern distance learning.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also writes a separate piece bemoaning <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2012/03/10/pedagogical-roles-for-video-in-online-learning/" rel="nofollow">the underuse of video in post-secondary education</a>, discussing the potential pedagogic benefits and roles of video and inviting readers to submit their own exemplars of good practice.</p>
