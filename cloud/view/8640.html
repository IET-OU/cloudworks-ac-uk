        <h2>Title <em>The Truth about Teaching work shop.</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>Working as a career coach, for a company that specialises in helping individuals going through outplacement (redundancy). &nbsp;I noticed a lot of clients were interested in moving from the private sector into education.&nbsp; Most of these clients were professionals and were interested in teaching.&nbsp; Many were referred to me for 1:1 sessions, often unsure if this was the path they wanted to pursue.&nbsp; I therefore suggested that the business run a workshop to highlight the truth about teaching.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>The workshop was run in a conference room set up with a large table, at the top of which was a portal for a laptop, a screen and a projector (which made the room hot and was quite noisy).</em></p>
<p><em>The delegates (of which there were a maximum of 12), came from a range of businesses and were all going through various stages of outplacement (some had just found out their job would be finishing, others had been looking for work for a number of months).&nbsp; They also had different professional qualifications, backgrounds and ages.</em></p>
<p><em>The workshop was very much aimed at those who were interested in teaching as a potential future career.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>The workshop aimed to give a realistic overview of teaching in Primary, Secondary, &nbsp;&nbsp;and Tertiary Education.&nbsp; The measure of success would be the client feedback, some would decide that teaching was not for them, others would arrange 1:1 meetings to investigate entry into teaching.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>The workshop used a power point presentation to run through specific areas:</em></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Relationships/notice periods/the staffroom </em></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The teaching day (partly to dispel the belief of many candidates that being a school teacher would fit with their role as a parent once their children were at primary school).</em></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Pay scales.</em></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Rewards</em></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Which age range would you like to teach? (looked at varying classroom demands, relationships with students, parents and fellow teachers)</em></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>How to investigate your preferences further &ndash; an overview of the qualifications required.</em></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Finding a teaching route that suits you.</em></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>What happens once you&rsquo;re qualified?</em></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>What to do between now and the course start</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Whilst the power point slides were being talked through, examples of lesson plans for Primary and Secondary schools were shown, candidates were invited to ask questions.&nbsp; There were also leaflets that had been produced by the Teacher Development Agency which candidates could take away.&nbsp; Where relevant pages of these were highlighted for example pay scales.</em></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>The feedback from the workshop (each candidate is asked to give feedback on the course structure, which 3 things they will take away from the workshop, what they found most and least useful).&nbsp; Were overall very positive.&nbsp; One candidate was disappointed as they wanted to be a Teaching Assistant.&nbsp; Several candidates went on book 1:1 appointments with me for further help with the best route into teaching for them,&nbsp; 4 candidates decided teaching was not for them.</em></p>
<p><em>The first time this was run, the workshop was oversubscribed.&nbsp; I felt that I got the information needed across, however some of those attending were interested in becoming Teaching Assistants (which the course did not cover).&nbsp; Some candidates walked away having decided teaching wasn&rsquo;t for them (which I had anticipated) others wanted to know if there were ways of circumventing the qualifications needed to teach (which I hadn&rsquo;t quite considered).</em></p>
<p><em>Many found that there was a lot of information covered (this was on the feedback sheet).</em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>I found the number of candidates was too many.&nbsp; When this workshop was repeated although I used the same structure, because there were fewer candidates (often fewer than 6) I was able to use a different style.&nbsp; I would initially highlight the areas I was planning to cover and then sit down at the same table and explain the material but with more opportunity to ask for client experiences.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The workshop literature was also adjusted to highlight that the course was not aimed at those interested in becoming teaching assistants.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The workshop made less use of the power point presentation, partly as with smaller numbers it was possible to tailor the presentation to them and have more of a discussion type format.&nbsp; Also because the powerpoint conveyed information professionally it also made the room hot when the room was full.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>For the first session there were 14 candidates.&nbsp; Some of the feedback was that the room had been cramped and stuffy.&nbsp; For this reason the number of candidates was also reduced.&nbsp; </em></p>
