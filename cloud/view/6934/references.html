<p>I've dream about e-learning on Musical education, but i've been discussing 21st century learning designs, and about students in the blogosphere, and the way that we are teaching, and the new forms of teaching, and personas, and mindmaps.</p>    </div>

			<p>This week i've benn much more in trhe course i've learn much more from the course, with some comments on google group 21st century.I hasked what does learning design mean for you? Sue said "Learning Design or Online Learning Design? Can we distinguish between them because there are distinct differences. With OLD the materials have to work much harder to sustain interest, motivation and retention. Transferring traditional content to an online environment can be flat and miss the potential for providing variety and interaction. I wonder if the Online in Learning Design is an additional layer? Theory in this layer would include Laurillard&rsquo;s &lsquo;conversational framework&rsquo; model which offers a useful example of how OLD can stimulate dialogue and networks of learning. Garrison and Anderson suggest a Community of Inquiry made up of three presences; social, cognitive and teaching. In the past I&rsquo;ve found enabling communities of shared practice (e.g. Wenger) can create powerful learning experiences. Online discussion can take time to set up and encourage (Salmon&rsquo;s five step model is worth following) but the directions it can go off into can be exciting. On the practical side of OLD, chunking content up with formative assessment opportunities and using alternative formats such as audio which can be listened to 'anytime anywhere' are worth building into the course or activity design. Pragmatically, taking part in an online course &ndash; maybe a MOOC &ndash; is probably one of the best ways to discover what works well and less well in OLD."</p>

<p><strong>Paul said</strong> "There is so much great debate and links to promising resources in this thread that I can add little, except my own personal account as someone who does learning design with teachers but doesn't teach. A strange position, granted, but there you go. For me, learning design is multi-faceted and malleable. Learning design is not an individual endeavour, it's a team effort involving teachers, students, admin staff and sometimes learning technologists. No two courses, teachers or students are the same and so it's important to have a range of options, to have a fluid mix of elements. To do this it's important to keep learning, keep trying new things and try to keep an open mind. For me learning design is about taking in the context of a learning situation as fully as possible: the politics, personalities, subject domains, skills, attitudes and dispositions of stakeholders to begin with. Then the educational context: how is it assessed, is assessment fixed or can we change it, how many students are there, what if we end up with a much larger cohort than anticipated, or much smaller? Do we know what tends to work well for these types of students in this subject domain - what are people in other settings doing? What kind of tasks and interactions might promote learning? What kind of learning do we value most? How will we know if learning is happening? How do we promote peer support? How can we introduce 'authentic' activity into the learning and assessment. Can we trial new ideas with colleagues or small groups beforehand? It begins and ends with people. Sometimes what seems important turns out to be impossible, sometimes beautiful things happen spontaneously."</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>I created this mindmap:</p>
<p>http://www.mindmeister.com/247315793</p>
<p><strong>Sacha said</strong> "I've been looking at the mindmap, tho I can't work anything (I am using a work laptop which does not allow any downloads - a perfect example of the instituional systems not being very helpful or forward thinking!!). Anyway, I felt that blogging should be on there as well as VLEs. And I'd like to add contexts in too - for example, if I set up a FB group, would my students use it or go and make their own? I'd like to add in (somehow) the fracturing of information across "instituional" social media and "real world" social media. Perhaps that should go under "ownership". Mindmap aside, I guess that is the very key of 21st century e-learning = how to make a blend of ours and theirs to make good practice"</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p><strong>George Hobson</strong>&nbsp;Yesterday&nbsp; 13:06 - Community - OLDS MOOC - schools (All discussions) How is our understanding of Learning Design principles fitting into our context, schools? Whereas we consider context to be tacitly understood in a school setting, using personas and other approaches can open up our eyes to a real variety of learners - not just in the learning preferences dimensions, but in motivation, constraints, relationship between actors, etc.</p>
<p><strong> I Said:</strong> Dear George, Motivation is on the center of learning. Schools are a liitle outdated and if they don't open probably they will died.But we are here so I think that with person like us that have an open mind the school with real actors probably have to adapt their way of see the new school.</p>
<p><strong> Manuel Lousa Said</strong>: Ontem &agrave;(s) 14:58 Hi George! As I'm a Maths teacher, the context of Learning Design and how to motivate my students to learn Maths is something that really interests me. I&acute;d like to know more about the way approaches that can open up the eyes of students in the classroom, etc...</p>
<p><strong>George Hobson Said</strong>: 11:35 Thanks, Ricardo and Manuel - motivation is key. There are other factors too. It would be interesting to make a schools contexts checklist. There is common ground with university level work in this too, of course, but I suspect there are maturation and social relationship factors to consider carefully. For example - how to provide for students to contribute without fear of embarrassment or ridicule? We as teachers are aware of this, but this aspect is often a complete block for student participation - we may not know the social pressures in the class of students facing us. And I think that there are technological measures (as well as f2f measures) that we can take to ensure inhibition free participation. What other filters to learning can there be in our contexts?</p>			<div class="posted-by">
