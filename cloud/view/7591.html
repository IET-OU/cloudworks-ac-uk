        <p>This is my second MOOC experience.&nbsp; The first one was a 8-week Udacity (<a href="http://www.udacity.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.udacity.com/</a>) course last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;Although I had worked through the video lectures and exercises, I had to give up after a few weeks. &nbsp;The main reason was that I had little interactions with other students and the tutors on the course. &nbsp;That might be caused by different time zones. <br /><br />I signed up the oldsmooc because that the course tutors were in the UK and I met some of them.&nbsp; The main objective was to see how the course tutors can motivate students on the course.&nbsp; After one week, I feel that this is more like a MOOC course. &nbsp;Although there is no way to see a list of all participants ( It&rsquo;d be good if it were possible), I still can feel that a great number of course mates out there by looking at the messages, clouds, and tweets.</p>
<h3>Confusing, exciting and demanding</h3>
<p>Looking back week 1, initially I was excited and confused - <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7038" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7038.</a><br /><br />Like many participants on the course, the topic was a relatively new one as I had not systematically studied &lsquo;learning design&rsquo;. &nbsp;This is an area that I have heard of and been keen to explore. &nbsp;I was enthusiastic about the course. &nbsp;&nbsp;After a quick scan of the course outline and introduction, I also realised that it was a pretty demanding courses (3-10 hours per week) which I had to find on top of my full time job. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Due to my experience of giving up the <a href="http://www.udacity.com/" rel="nofollow">Udacity </a>course, from the beginning I was determined to keep up with the course and not to be left behind in order to have conversations with people on the course. &nbsp;&nbsp;A few critical tasks in the first two days were to set up my profile and project in Cloudworks, and then introduced my project to people on the course via a Google open discussion forum. &nbsp;&nbsp;The reason that they were critical was that these would decide whether I could attract people to team up with and study collaboratively for the next 4 weeks. &nbsp;&nbsp;With little time on my hands &nbsp;and being new to Cloudworks, it was quite stressful that I had to familiarise myself with Cloudworks and scan a great number of uncategorised messages. &nbsp;In addition, &nbsp;I discovered that conversations did not only happen via Google discussion, but also in Cloudworks, Twitter, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;This made me feel rather confused after the initial excitement of joining the course.<br /><br />With the third day of week 1 approaching, I had not formed a team with anyone. &nbsp;The posts and messages that I created did not seem drawing anyone&rsquo;s attention either. &nbsp;My enthusiasm seemed diminishing. That was my lowest point of the week. &nbsp;At that point, I even thought about giving up this course. &nbsp;&nbsp;I was asking myself: &uml;Why do I have to do this course? No credit and &nbsp;qualification will be given, and nobody has asked me to do it&uml;.</p>
<h3>The turning point</h3>
<p>After one good night&rsquo;s sleep, I decided to carry on. &nbsp;I realised that this was a course I wanted to study. &nbsp;Therefore, I did not need any external motivations such as qualification or credit. &nbsp;I wanted to see how my intrinsic motivation could affect my learning experience. I wrote a short blog post explaining <a href="http://blogs.oucs.ox.ac.uk/fawei/2013/01/14/how-to-maximise-the-benift-when-studying-a-mooc/" rel="nofollow">how to maximize the benefit when studying a MOOC</a>.</p>
<p>Once I felt positive about the course, I dived into the messages and projects again. &nbsp;The more I read, the more I realised that I was not alone. For instance, people commented in Couldworks about their difficulty in learning a new system. &nbsp;People also commented on their frustration with finding team mates. &nbsp;Note: I think that Couldworks is a really good system. I guess that the stress was caused by people having to digest new information about &lsquo;learning design&rsquo; and to learn the system at the same time. <br /><br />While brwosing through the Google forum, a topic &uml;<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!topic/olds-mooc-open/bOWPPE8y8nY" rel="nofollow">Bowing out with olds&uml;</a>drew my attention. &nbsp;After reading the message, I could not help replying to Phil&rsquo;s message to share my experience and encourage him to carry on. &nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned in my message that although it was difficult to read/participate everything in this massive course, the nature of a MOOC did offer great opportunities to learn from and collaborate with people that you might not find in a traditional online course. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Encouraging, inspiring and hardworking &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Luckily the situation started becoming positive. &nbsp;People began commenting on my project page with a strong interest (<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7321" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7321</a>). I teamed up with a few people who were also interested in staff development, peer support and collaborative learning (the team cloud: <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2782" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2782</a>). &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Interacting with Penny Wheeler, one of the team members, inspired me to develop my project further. &nbsp;I originally thought to create an online space to collect successful stories of using learning technologies from Oxford&rsquo;s staff and support them to help each other. &nbsp;When Penny asked if her project could be added to my list, I thought it might be a good idea to create a platform to gather stories internationally. &nbsp;This made me more excited about the project and course. <br /><br />The positive experience and interactions made me proactively set up a Google circle and Google group for the team. &nbsp;What&rsquo;s more, my message replying to &nbsp;&lsquo;Bowing out with olds&rsquo; drew attention from one of the course tutors -Joshua Underwood. &nbsp;Josh commented on my message and shared his view on the designing aspect of this MOOC course.<br /><br />To sum up, it has been a dynamic week for me. &nbsp;Now I feel encouraged and inspired thanks to all people who have interacted with me on the course. &nbsp;I know that hard work is still ahead as so far I have not been able to spend time on reading about &lsquo;learning design&rsquo;. &nbsp;However, the experience and interactions are a vital part of the understanding of &lsquo;learning design&rsquo;. &nbsp;<br /><br />Finally I would like to say: &uml;Let&rsquo;s keep the conversations going, happy sharing and happy MOOC&uml;.</p>    </div>
