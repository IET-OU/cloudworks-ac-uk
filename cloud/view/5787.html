        <p>The Open Ceremony for ICDE started with a Goddess on a Swan and Birds of Paradise dance to represent the concepts of education and expanding horizons/</p>
<p>The introduction from the chair based at Universitas Terbuka describes how ODL is becoming the mainstream system as it spreads across the world. Internet, spread and OER are all pushing towards greater use of ODL. More than 600participants and 200talks expected. Streaming is via&nbsp;<a title="ICDE Conference site" href="http://www.ut.ac.id/icde2011/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ut.ac.id/icde2011/</a>.</p>
<p>Frits Pannecoek as Chair of ICDE explained how ICDE has a fed into UNESCO and has a long history moving from concerns about correspondent teaching throught to internet learning. Planing for expansion from 150m to 240m post secondary learners in the next 10 years - an expansion that needs ODL approaches. Time of OER, Creative Commons and new educational structures for economics. Challenges of quality, ranking of organisations (where does ODL fit?), cultural appropriateness (OER built in the north consumed in the south!), new economic situation (what should be free what should be paid for). This conference is a chance for reflection and deliberations.</p>
<p>Minister of National Education of the Republic of Indonesia, Mohammed Nuh, opened the conference in a simultaneously translated speech in Indonesian. His talk recognised the "world is flat" impact of technology and breaking down of borders as information moves so fast. Information moves faster than goods. The world of education is part of this new phenonemon moved by knowledge. Noise, data, informatin, knowledge and the wisdom formas a hierachy. But can education move as fast as the financial and commercial sector? Higher knowledge is more than money or goods - knowledge can flow from less to more, increasing both the "less" and rather than reducing the "more" increasing it as well. Why ODL does not grow as fast as the financial sector - needs us to identify the factors that are an obstacle to make knowledge freer and more flower. ODL can be the answer to equalising chances in education, especially higher education. Indonesia now has reached 26% in HE, ODL offers further potential benefits. Infrastructure alone will not overcome the social obstacles. Infrastructure can help for &nbsp;those who are motivated. Problem is both content and methodology to provide the motivation for learning from available content - presentation and creativity, intellectual innovation is needed to overcome the social obstacles. Designing the right approach to transacting at a distance can overcome the barriers. The networking effect of Web 2.0 allows greater impact - as more users enter the system the reach increases following a square law. For a thousand users connections are 1000squared - 1000. [I think this is based on Metcalfe's law of&nbsp;<a title="Connection square law" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law" target="_self" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law</a>.] Careful design is needed to achieve this - establishing an academy based on free and open education may flip over the way of learning from school in a class to learning at home. The teacher will no longer "teach" but rather "tutor" the problems being tackled by the learners. Services then become more personal - Socratic approach ... according to their ability was seen as too expensive, but now may be achieved. In Indonesia a participative and collaborative "virtual house for learning" for shareable teaching material. In a few weeks a ministerial decree will be signed to launch this in Indonesia. The impact will be felt in indonesia and world wide. This will provide a gateway for eduation in Indonesia.</p>
<p>"Thank you to everyone who loves the world of education and ODL."</p>
