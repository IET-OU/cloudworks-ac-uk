                   <p>I &nbsp;have enjoyed completing the activity.</p>
<p>1. 40-45 minutes (approx)</p>
<p>2. Clear enough to complete the activity</p>
<p>3. This question is not clear!</p>
<p>4. Experience-based answer</p>
<p>5. Difficult to relate to the document, especially with complex design terminology</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Contributed to the activity cloud&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;My posting is the first one, so have to wait!</p>
<p>8. N/A</p>
<p>9. Some specific examples and cases &nbsp;to illustrate the application of design representations can be useful. &nbsp;Also, information on advantages and disadvantages of using &nbsp;visual and textual representations at different levels of learning will be useful.</p>        </div>

                   <p>This isn't the official evaluation but I have to say that the materials in slideshare are very restrictive. they won't enlarge and i have tried mutliple times to download or view in slideshare and it doesn't work.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Isabella, I note that you are able to enlarge the embedded text by clicking on the full screen icon on the right-hand side at the bottom of the screen containing the script.&nbsp; With regards to getting at a version of the text that you could print, you can achieve this by clicking on the &ldquo;share&rdquo; icon on the far left-hand side, at the bottom of the screen with the text and then send the script to your email address.&nbsp; Once the script has been directed to your email &ldquo;In&rdquo; box you can &ldquo;View&rdquo; the text and then choose &ldquo;Save as&rdquo; and direct the text to a Rich text formatted document.&nbsp; The disadvantage of this method is that in the transfer the formatting of the original text is lost and all diagrams become simply a series of words.&nbsp; For this particular bit of information you can retrieve a PDF file from the internet: <a href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fss/organisations/netlc/past/nlc2010/abstracts/PDFs/Conole_2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fss/organisations/netlc/past/nlc2010/abstracts/PDFs/Conole_2.pdf</a> .&nbsp; I hope that this helps.&nbsp; Genie</p>        </div>

<li>How long did you take to complete the Activity? &nbsp;roughly two and a half&nbsp;hours</li>
<li>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? yes</li>
<li>Was the content of the Activity informative? yes; some of the thoughts, which I have come away with include:&nbsp; the effective use of the learning design process can enable teachers and designers to make more informed decisions and, hopefully, as a result impact positively on the learning and development of the students with whom they come in contact; learning design can make the development and structure of the learning processes more explicit and shareable; there are a complex matrix of resources and tools that can be drawn on</li>
<li>What did you like about the Activity? the comprehensiveness of the information provided in a structured overview; the availability of further information represented by web links to additional, supplemental information</li>
<li>What did you dislike about the Activity? I was acutely aware that in order to explore the concepts presented properly, I would need to invest significantly &nbsp;more time</li>
<li>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? yes</li>
<li>If you did post comments to the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback? &nbsp;not yet</li>
<li>How useful was the feedback? &nbsp;not applicable </li>
<li>Do you have any other comments you would like to make? no</li>

<li>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? If they weren't how could they be improved?&nbsp; Instructions were clear</li>
<li>Was the content of the Activity informative? If not what would you have liked to see?&nbsp; The Activity was very informative.&nbsp; I thought the various examples of visualising the design processes was excellent. </li>
<li>What did you like about the Activity? See above</li>
<li>What did you dislike about the Activity?&nbsp; The only thing I did not like, and this is not directly linked to the activity itself, was that when I selected any of the links in the article I then lost my place and had to start from scratch even to the point of having the article in full screen! :( But apart from this minor hiccup everything else was fine.</li>
<li>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? If you did not post any comments can you say why you didn't? commetns were posted</li>

                   <ol>
<li>How long did you take to complete the Activity? Probably about an hour - longest time out of all the activities</li>
<li>Were the instructions for the Activity clear?&nbsp; - yes </li>
<li>Was the content of the Activity informative?&nbsp; - yes</li>
<li>What did you like about the Activity? - different example of representations with links to other material, etc</li>
<li>What did you dislike about the Activity? - my heart sank when I saw the document was 9 pages so I wanted to print it off (I work better reading on hard copy, and as noted earlier, pay more attention). Slideshare wasn't working correctly the first time I tried but came back to it, after checking with Paul and what to do, and was able to get it to work. However, as Genie noted, the text document isn't very user-friendly at all and it was hard going making sense of it. Plus after I had to go back to the online version to look at the images. This is the kind of thing that puts me off learning online! </li>
<li>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? Yes</li>
<li>If you did post comments to the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback? Too early to say</li>
<li>How useful was the feedback? n/a</li>
<li>Do you have any other comments you would like to make? My sense through this course is that it has more practical benefit to those designing long-term activities or whole courses.</li>

                   <p>I am not sure that I am in complete agreement that this brief Learning Design training is more appropriate for module design (number 9).&nbsp; I certainly have taken away ideas that in my judgement will be useful in the way I consider the development of my face to face tutorials in the future.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Genie, I also found this took me around two hours, maybe more, but I found reading Conole's non-proofread article a pain, so needed to take a break for some fresh air and sunshine and water the greenhouse in between about page 3 and 5...</p>
<p>having done that, I found I liked the 'swimlane' analogy best, but this could be partly because of its resonance with one of my favourite activities...</p>
<p>the complex diagrams, such as the 'principles/pedagogy matrix' were a bit off-putting, daunting, and would need more fleshing out with real examples to make them accessible for me. I guess some may be in the linked materials, but time was running out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I felt tempted to rewrite the article in a more easy-to-read form...</p>
<p>but, having said all this, I am looking forward to meeting some of you &nbsp;on 10/06 and learning more about the 'tools' on offer for learning design, for various outputs, not just tutorials.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I found out how to download...<br />When you go to slideshare, go to top of screen and press &gt; download. Should then be able to save, change to font you like, and print off of course. You may have to log in first, I used my facebook login so didn't have to sign up to slide share.<br />Hope this helps.<br />Sandy Barthorpe</p>        </div>

<p>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? If they weren't how could they be improved? &nbsp;yes</p>
<p>Was the content of the Activity informative? If not what would you have liked to see? &ndash; yes it was informative and good links for further reading</p>
<p>What did you like about the Activity? Found it thought provoking in reflecting on how have previously &nbsp;designed learning activities</p>
<p>What did you dislike about the Activity? Like other people I found the paper was a little hard going in places.</p>
<p>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? If you did not post any comments can you say why you didn't? Yes</p>
