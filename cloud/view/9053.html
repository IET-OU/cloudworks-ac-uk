<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Gill Smith; Grainne Conole; Campus Technology; edX; Stephen Downes; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>The US Dept of Justice has announced a <a href="http://www.educationdive.com/news/edx-reaches-deal-with-justice-dept/383257/" rel="nofollow">settlement with edX over the accessibility of its services</a>.&nbsp; The MOOC provider will modify its website, platform, and mobile applications to allow students who are blind, deaf, or otherwise disabled to participate, bringing it in line with the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>Research by Toven-Lindsey et al explores <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz8cVS8LoO7ON3dBOEM5bzM0eEU/view" rel="nofollow">the range of pedagogical tools used in 24 MOOCs</a>, finding that the range of pedagogical practices currently used tends toward an objectivist-individual approach, with some efforts to incorporate more constructivist and group-oriented approaches. &nbsp;The paper challenges educators to strive for more creative and empowering forms of open online learning.</p>
<p>MIT and Harvard University have just published a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2587984_code2293023.pdf?abstractid=2586847&mirid=1" rel="nofollow">37-page draft report</a> that summarises findings from two years of hosting 68 MOOCs for 1.7 million participants who logged 10 million "participant hours" of activity.&nbsp; Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Participation in a second presentation was around 43% lower than the first but there was no significant decrease in a third presentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>57% of registrants intended to earn a certificate (and a further 8% of the remainder ultimately did)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computer Science courses had average participation numbers almost four times higher than other subjects (68,000 vs 19,000) but lower certification rates</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A recent <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/enrollment-mitx-moocs-are-we-educating-educators" rel="nofollow">Educase paper</a> identified that a large proportion of edX learners were themselves teachers.&nbsp; Now a blog post by the same authors discusses whether <a href="https://www.edx.org/blog/are-we-missing-opportunities-engage#.VSPpe9J0xEY" rel="nofollow">opportunities are being missed to engage teachers with MOOCs</a>.&nbsp; Some 28% of edX survey respondents identified themselves as past or present teachers, 54% were interested in accreditation opportunities and more than 70% desired greater access to MITx materials for use in their own courses.&nbsp; Now the authors suggest this presents some opportunities for MOOC providers, such as offering professional development for teachers, providing tools that allow teachers to tailor MOOC content into &ldquo;personal online courses&rdquo;, and providing profiling facilities so experienced teachers could identify themselves and be paired with novices to promote greater dialogue and learning.</p>
<p>A recent paper by Joksimovic et al, <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/273755322_What_do_cMOOC_participants_talk_about_in_Social_Media_A_Topic_Analysis_of_Discourse_in_a_cMOOC" rel="nofollow">What do cMOOC participants talk about in Social Media? A Topic Analysis of Discourse in a cMOOC</a>, examines how social media platforms (blogs, Twitter, and Facebook) affect the learning processes shape learners' interests and the topics to which they devote a significant attention. &nbsp;The findings indicate that learners tend to focus on several prominent topics that emerge very quickly in the course and they tend to maintain that focus, regardless of readings suggested by the instructor, and the affordances of different social media mean that different tools are used to discuss different topics.</p>
<p>And a paper in this month&rsquo;s BJET, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjet.12277/abstract" rel="nofollow">What public media reveals about MOOCs: A systematic analysis of news reports</a>, finds that coverage of MOOCs in public media is rapidly decreasing.&nbsp; By mid- 2014, it had decreased by almost 50% from the highest activity during 2013 and, while the majority of discussions during 2012-13 were focused on MOOC providers, partnerships and investments, the more recent focus has shifted towards the position of MOOCs in the global educational landscape and the use of data and analytics.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; Gill Marshall; BBC; University World News]</em></p>
<p>A new HEFCE report, <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/HEFCE,2014/Content/Pubs/2015/201507/HEFCE2015_07.pdf" rel="nofollow">Financial health of the higher education sector</a>, shows there to be &ldquo;significant variations in the financial performance of individual institutions across the sector&rdquo;, with two institutions seeing their income fall by more than 10% in in 2013-14, while four saw growth of more than 15% (Fig 1).&nbsp; Staff costs rose by an average of 3.4%, but with variations from -11% to +14% (Fig 4).&nbsp; In a bid to attract students, institutions are borrowing to invest, with a sector total of &pound;6.7bn (26% of total income), but with one institution peaking at 93% (Fig 11).&nbsp; The report warns that, &ldquo;Without increased surpluses and continued government support, there is a risk that the sector will be unable to deliver the scale of investment required to meet student demands, build capacity and &hellip; remain internationally competitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Jeremy Clayton, director of knowledge and innovation strategy at the Dept for Business, Innovation and Skills, warns that universities are viewed by &ldquo;politicians from across the political spectrum&rdquo; as <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/universities-worse-than-bankers/2019426.article" rel="nofollow">overstaffed and largely untouched by public spending reductions</a>, despite having achieved efficiency savings worth &pound;1 billion over the past three years.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/uclan-sets-aside-28m-to-cover-losses-at-overseas-campuses/2019181.article" rel="nofollow">University of Central Lancashire</a> has put aside &pound;2.8 million to guard against further losses on its overseas campuses as its Cyprus branch lost more money and drew criticism from the UN Secretary-General.&nbsp; The campus recorded a loss of &pound;1.4 million in 2013-14, blamed on &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; recruitment which UCLan says has now improved.&nbsp; Plans for a Sri Lanka campus have been shelved and a deal for another planned campus in Thailand had previously collapsed before building started.</p>
<p>The Association of Colleges says that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-32017137" rel="nofollow">190,000 adult education places will go next year</a> and adult education in England &ldquo;will not exist by 2020&rdquo; if government cuts continue.&nbsp; Funding is being cut by 24% and courses for health, public services and care, and ICT could be hardest hit as the government prioritises apprenticeships and subjects such as English and maths.</p>
<p>Concerns about plagiarism in a 2013 <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-32034849" rel="nofollow">University of Buckingham law module</a> should have triggered a formal process says the QAA.&nbsp; Instead, academics reduced students' marks for &ldquo;poor academic performance&rdquo; because they interpreted the problem as poor referencing rather than plagiarism.&nbsp; The university subsequently referred to some sections in essays as having been &ldquo;lifted&rdquo; but decided the first year students had not yet been subject to rigorous training on avoiding plagiarism and so had not committed any deliberate action to deceive.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s first <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=201503271940068" rel="nofollow">Research Centre for Global Higher Education</a> is being established by the UCL Institute of Education in partnership with Lancaster University and the University of Sheffield. Co-funded by HEFCE, the centre will open in October 2015.</p>

<p>Apollo Education Group (<a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/university-of-phoenix-enrollment-numbers-are-down-2015-3?r=US" rel="nofollow">University of Phoenix</a>) announced its Q2 earnings last month and news that total enrolments were down 15% and revenues were down 14% caused the company's share price to fall by 16%.&nbsp; Student numbers have fallen by more than 50% compared to five years ago, from 460,000 down to 213,000.</p>
<p>LinkedIn is buying online training provider <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/linkedin-to-acquire-online-training-site-lynda-com/" rel="nofollow">Lynda.com</a> for around $1.5bn in what will be the professional network's largest acquisition to date. &nbsp;Lynda.com offers a large library of online courses in such areas as Web design and development, computer programming, animation, video production and editing, education and business. &nbsp;A basic subscription currently costs $25 a month ($250/year) with a premium subscription at $37.50 a month ($375/year).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2015/04/02/jones-international-university-to-close.html" rel="nofollow">Jones International University</a>, an online, for-profit institution based in Colorado, has announced plans to shut down following a 55% drop in enrolment between 2011 and the end of 2014, leaving JIU with about 2,000 students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be warned, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sv_ls2_4?ie=UTF8&node=10943282011" rel="nofollow">Amazon is moving into online tutoring</a>.&nbsp; As part of Amazon's new Home Services, US customers can purchase tuition in subjects ranging from maths and languages to music and fitness &ndash; 121 at home or in small groups in local centres.&nbsp; The service is offered in partnership with San Diego-based TakeLessons, a marketplace for local and online lessons.</p>

<p><strong>Technology For Employability</strong></p>
<p><em>[Rebecca Galley]</em></p>
<p>The Jisc cross-sector <a href="http://employabilityproject.jiscinvolve.org/wp/" rel="nofollow">Technology for employability</a> study is currently about half-way to completion and three key themes are emerging:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Institutions are on various points of the continuum towards student employability &ldquo;maturity&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology is under exploited</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is insufficient engagement and partnership working with employers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors welcome feedback on these themes, either as blog comments or replying directly to <a href="mailto:peter.chatterton@daedalus-e-world.com" rel="nofollow">peter.chatterton@daedalus-e-world.com</a> or <a href="mailto:grebbeck@me.com" rel="nofollow">grebbeck@me.com</a>.</p>

<p>Tony Bates seems to have done more work and made more online postings since he retired than ever before.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been releasing chunks of his new online book,<a href="http://opentextbc.ca/teachinginadigitalage/" rel="nofollow">Teaching in a Digital Age</a>, for comment as they&rsquo;ve been drafted over the past year or so.&nbsp; Now the whole thing (502pp) is complete and available for free.&nbsp; Tony&rsquo;s foreword says that &ldquo;The book examines the underlying principles that guide effective teaching in an age when everyone, and in particular the students we are teaching, are using technology.&rdquo; &nbsp;The twelve chapters cover issues such as the nature of knowledge, F2F and online methods of teaching, technology and different media, and quality.&nbsp; Stephen Downes&rsquo; assessment: &ldquo;This is a monumental accomplishment and I have no doubt that Bates will receive wide praise for his efforts over the last year.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>College Lets Students Switch Between Online and In-Person</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>An increasing number of institutions allow students to <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/online-or-in-person-one-college-lets-students-switch-back-and-forth/56265" rel="nofollow">study courses on campus or online</a>, but Philadelphia&rsquo;s Peirce College will shortly allow access to both formats in the same course.&nbsp; The college, which caters specifically to adult learners, plans to allow its students to switch back and forth between attending class in person or online, based on which is more convenient for them on a given week.&nbsp; As part of the college&rsquo;s 2015-2018 strategic plan, some programmes will allow switching from autumn of this year, with the entire curriculum following by September 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>State of the Commons</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>CC reports on <a href="https://stateof.creativecommons.org/report/" rel="nofollow">the state of Creative Commons</a>, noting that there are currently around 880 million CC-licensed works (although Stephen Downes points out that 111 million of these are separate Wikipedia articles) and that total is expected to pass 1 billion in 2015.&nbsp; Other highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The majority of CC work is published in the US (37%) and Europe (34%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>14 countries (including the UK and Scotland) (?) have made national commitments to open education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Hewlett Foundation leads the way in open policy for philanthropy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The US Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training initiative (TAACCCT) is the largest CC project, with a $2bn budget to help community colleges equip their students with the skills they need to find employment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But according to <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/free-not-future-digital-content-education/" rel="nofollow">Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</a>&rsquo;s Chief Content Officer, writing in Wired, &ldquo;If we do not get educational content right, students are less likely to gain the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in college and careers.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, a clear message &ndash; it&rsquo;s very important that we pay money to educational publishers in order to learn well from &lsquo;quality&rsquo; content.&nbsp; But, as Stephen Downes observes, &ldquo;&hellip;in fact, almost any content will do if learners are motivated, and no content will do if learners are not motivated.&nbsp; And the reason why free can work and is working is that it's created by and for people who are motivated.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Learning for Life</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>According to a new report, <a href="http://tytonpartners.com/tyton-wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Learning-for-Life_The-Oppty-for-Tech-to-Transform-Adult-Education_March-20151.pdf" rel="nofollow">Learning for Life: The Opportunity for Technology to Transform Adult Education</a>, there are 36 million US adults who lack basic skills (1 in 6 maintains low literacy skills and nearly 1 in 3 has low numeracy skills) and yet the adult education system serves only about 11% of them. &nbsp;There is enthusiasm for using technology and participants have good access to modern devices and the internet, so the report (Part 1 of 2) calls for greater exploitation of ICT.</p>

<p><strong>Thug Notes</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-03-20-lessons-from-thug-notes-does-swearing-belong-in-the-classroom?utm_campaign=22e47780a7-Innovate+215-HIREEDU&utm_medium=email&utm_source=EdsurgeLive&utm_term=0_0f1ec25b60-22e47780a7-292151429" rel="nofollow">Thug Notes</a> is web site aimed at US students which includes video explanations of Shakespeare and other notable works of literature.&nbsp; However, the approach taken by Sparky Sweets PhD is a little unconventional&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After making a b**** outta their enemies, the king&rsquo;s fresh generals Macbeth and Banquo hit up three witches who start laying down some cold prophecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, it&rsquo;s a hit with many students and also some teachers, and the YouTube channel currently has over 400,000 subscribers.&nbsp; According to the site&rsquo;s cofounder, Jacob Salamon, &ldquo;Thug Notes originally started off as an idea and a joke&hellip; &nbsp;We never really expected to enter this whole world of education; that wasn&rsquo;t the initial intention. &nbsp;But we began to see that this is working in classrooms. &nbsp;Teachers are using it; students are using it. &nbsp;Millennials are falling in love with reading again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if you tend towards the more academic end of the literary spectrum, a feature on The Week site provides descriptions and video exemplars of what <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/545166/what-english-shakespeare-beowulf-king-arthur-actually-sounded-like" rel="nofollow">the English of Shakespeare, Beowulf, and King Arthur</a> actually sounded like.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Watch Interface Design</strong></p>
<p><em>[User Focus]</em></p>
<p>Good user interface design is a challenge in itself, but trying to squeeze lots onto a 38mm (1.5&rdquo;) screen makes it even more so.&nbsp; Therefore, the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/WatchHumanInterfaceGuidelines/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014992-CH3-SW1" rel="nofollow">Human Interface Guidelines for the Apple Watch</a> make interesting reading because they explain not just <em>what</em> developers should aim for, but also <em>why</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Happy Birthday iPad</strong></p>
<p><em>[Techno Buffalo]</em></p>
<p>OK, so <a href="http://www.technobuffalo.com/2015/04/03/the-first-ipad-launched-5-years-ago-today-see-how-much-it-has-changed/" rel="nofollow">when was the first iPad launched?</a>&nbsp; My two late-teen daughters guessed at 1999 and 2002, making them about a decade out &ndash; because iPad 1 appeared on 3 April 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why predicting the future and impact of technology on society is so fraught with uncertainties.</p>
