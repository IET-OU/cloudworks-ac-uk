        <p>There has already been some discussion about what models and tools we might use to help us review and articulate the design problem space in advance starting of any MOOC design work proper. So far the models on the table are:</p>
<p>Simon Cross's <a href="http://latestendeavour.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/the-lattice-model-for-designing-learning-defining-the-design-problem-space-and-guiding-the-design-solutions/" rel="nofollow">Lattice Model</a> and Yishay Mor's <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BneOQmlmG6ZQFUIjVWehA487g7-_-Gpi36-d41rzlwY/edit" rel="nofollow">Scenario/ Force map</a> tool</p>
<p>To summarise our discussions so far, I think that we feel that Simon's lattice model is too complicated to use in an activity, so we think we will probably use Yishay's activity and then review activity outputs using the Lattice Model (correct me if I'm wrong anyone!) so that we can begin to locate priorities and concerns.</p>
<p>Do you know of any other learning design tools we might use to define the problem space at this early stage? Please join in :-)</p>    </div>

			<p>Thank you to those that gave me feedback for this activity - in particular for additionally pointing me to the <a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/methods-and-methodologies/eor" rel="nofollow">Ecology of Resources framework</a> (EoR). We have decided upon a 2 hour activity comprised of 3x 0.5hr tasks using firstly the EoR framework (facilitated by Katerina Avramides), secondly Yishay's Force Maps and finally Simon's Lattice Model. This combination of tools will allow us to create a really rich picture of the design space - very exciting.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p><strong>Live blog from the design workshop:</strong> Feedback from groups is that the lattice model is too complex to use in the workshop, and that it covers a lot that has already been covered in the two previous activities.</p>
<p>Yishay suggests that it could be used as a checklist that the design space has been sufficiently reviewed.</p>
<p>Steve Warburton suggested that the model has some implicit assumptions about who the audience/ 'student' is that doesn't work so well for the MOOC which is less tightly structured and less predictable. He emphasised strongly that 'loosely structured' does not mean 'not well designed' but that the lattice catagories might push the designer to be too ridgid in the design created.</p>
<p>Grainne has suggested another &nbsp;representation of the problem space that does something similar that is less complex that she will add below.</p>
<p>Diana said she liked the model as a checklist because it is so wide ranging but would like a more clearly articulated process of how to use it. She thinks it could work as a MOOC tool but needs a clear activity designed to support it.</p>
<p>Some really interesting debate,particularly between Steve W, Dave White and Diana about how far a MOOC is a 'journey' - with a start and an end - and how far it is a hobbist 'club or society' (<strong><em>see video below - 'Why is a MOOC?'</em></strong>). So, some questions emerging for this debate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should the % of participants who complete all weeks be a success factor? If not, what are the criteria for success?</li>
<li>How far do we (as designers) have a responsibility for designing a journey/ narrative through?</li>
<li>How far should participants have an expectation that if they complete the whole MOOC they will achieve a pre-defined set of outcomes?</li>
<li>How responsive can we be in negotiating the curriculum?</li>
</ul>
<p>The model certainly worked well to mediate design discussion around what makes a MOOC different to most courses and what that means for the curriculum design.</p>
<p>And now lunch...:-)</p>			<div class="posted-by">

<p>I've embedded the scenario template, but its very narrow. I wonder if there's a way to control its layout?</p>

                   <p>I have participated in two of George Siemen's MOOCs. The first time I didn't even realise it - he just asked me to do a webinar and the next day there were lots of google alerts from people's blogs referring to my talk and the associated papers George had pointed them to! The second time was in Feb again I did a presentation but as it was week 27 of the MOOC participation was low. I did respond to the few comments people posted on cloudworks and via their blogs.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Task 1 (EoR part 1)</p>
<p>I was supposed to failitate a week in the MobiMOOC. In the end, unexpected circumstances meant that I couldn't dedicate the time for that. Luckilly, the organisers had allocated two facilitators per week, so the programme didn't fall apart.</p>
<p>The MOOC used two main channels: a google mailing list and a wiki (on wikispaces). Although I wasn't able to participate actively, I could follow the discussions on the mailing list and gain a sense of the activity.</p>        </div>

                   <p>A narrative ffrom the participants' point of view</p>
<p>Why I should be interested in this course? &ndash; what I might get out of it, how it relates to me and my work</p>
<p>Then I start using it, listening, watching, reading and trying to  make sense of what it is aiming to do and how well this fits my own  situation, asking myself what I might contribute</p>
<p>Beginning to see how some part of the course does relate to my issues  &ndash; how can I be sure they are addressed &ndash; is there an opportunity for me  to negotiate a way of working on the issues of most importance to me?</p>
<p>As I start taking part I realise there are some others on this  community who share my views, ideas and concerns, so I'd like to work in  a smaller group with them - how do I do that?</p>
<p>We find a way to do that, but seem to be going off track a bit - are  we applying the course ideas appropriately? How do we check this out  with the rest of the community and with the tutors? I'm still not quite  getting what I need to solve my most immediate problems.</p>        </div>

                   Never took part in a Mooc but have read quite a bit about them. The common theme seems to be anarchy, or perhaps excessive freedom, lack of structure, leading to very high drop-out rates, reduced engagement, etc. a lot has to do with managing expectations.        </div>

                   <p>Scenario: Structure the MOOC around topics which are each presented in a bound timeline - say one topic per week. Introduce each topic and clarify what resources and tools are associated with it. Perhaps start with a synchronous presentation or an asynchronous one. Point participants to relevant resources - for example papers or chapters. Give some clear activities for example participation in a discussion forum or asking them to reflect on their personal blog. Have a central place to aggregate all the outputs associated with it - perhaps in the Cloudworks Cloudscape for the MOOC. Either set up some facilitation from the team or divide participants into peer groups for peer support.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Scenario: Stumbling across or being drawn-in to a MOOC which is of interest (DS106).</p>
<p>Attracted by the crowd/activity - peer support/inspiration. Other people (community?) are the main 'resource' - Peers direct each other to relevant resources.</p>
<p>"Drive-by" assignments - dipping in and out. Lack of overall structure seen as positive - no need to do eveything.</p>
<p>Creating 'beyond-text' resources as part of assignments encourgaed collaboration. A range of skills and therefore people needed to complete tasks.</p>
<p>"Outcomes" not too important.</p>
<p>Club or society model? - Interest driven... More like a hobby.</p>
<p>Direct = learning outcomes - Indirect = being part of a 'club'/community</p>

                   <p>Environment - my current work insofar as it relates to learning design, career prospects, pressures on teaching, opportunities for new ways of teaching, resources limitations, new types of students,</p>
<p>Tools and People - opportunities for new ways of teaching, rather old technologies, some colleagues who are dismissive of technology, conventional technologies are dominant and well provided for, some good innovative colleagues who are technicallly able but overworked</p>
<p>Knowledge and skills- resources and intentions of the course; the representation of knowledge in the field; the opportunities provided by the course to practice new skills</p>
<p>Learner characteristics - lots of experience of teaching, but no training in how to teach; lots of subject knowledge in a fast changing area that I keep up with online; trying to keep up with new technology skills, but aware of falling behind</p>        </div>

                   Relevance, sense-making and managing a potentially huge amount of information seem central to reducing attrition in a Mooc like this. Is this "knowledge and skills", "environment" or "filters"? Or all 3? 
Too much emphasis on "MO" in MOOC, (too massive and too open) could perhaps lead to the wrong outcomes - poor retention, dissatisfaction, etc. Perhaps the "filters" need to apply to the design of the MOOC, from today.        </div>

                   <p>Relevance, fun interface and a structure that allows mentoring and peer interaction both synchronously and in ones own time are key to attrition... Knowledge and skills are also paramount; it appears that people that have substantial digital and networked literacies emerge as leaders and can act as mentors in MOOCs. So I guess the 'environment' and 'community' are key to learning design.</p>
<p>I wonder if someone has done a systematic study on what MOOCs are successful and why (errr aside from the huge propositions of legacy instituions like Coursera/Udacity)...A fun, alternative course (e.g. the intimately known ds106) with clear, yet fluidly adaptable syllabus (to allow student agency), fostering the development of strong digital personas? A short-hands on coursse that promises some dimension (managable) of professional development, and some sort of accredidation (see <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-webcraft/" rel="nofollow">https://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-webcraft/</a>)? &nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>I've participated in several moocs that each had very different approaches. &nbsp;I was fairly active in <a href="http://change.mooc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Change11</a>. &nbsp;I enjoyed the model of a new presenter and topic each week. &nbsp;The part that was most effective for me was the weekly+ synchronus sessions. &nbsp;I find there is something very powerful about meeting in real time with others online around a shared interest. &nbsp;It adds a nice social aspect which is also fun. &nbsp;I found the lack of a dedicated space for asynchronus participation a challenge. &nbsp;It seems nice to be completely decentralized but this creates an undue barrier to participation in my opinion. &nbsp;Ideally for me, people should be encouraged to use their own blogs or whatever for participation but there should also be a central space for interaction that ties it all together.</p>
<p>I participated somewhat in David Wiley's <a href="http://openeducation.us/welcome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Intro to Open Education.</a>&nbsp;I liked the material and the structure and particularly am intrigued by the gamification element and the use of badges to reward achievement but found the lack of any sychnchronus sessions unfortunate for the reasons stated above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I participated fully in&nbsp;<a href="http://openbrookes.net/firststeps12/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">First Steps in Learning &amp; Teaching</a>&nbsp;(FSLT) even having a personal tutor assigned to me and completing assessed work to earn a certificate. &nbsp;Although not very massive, I think FSLT would be the closest mooc I've experienced to what you are planning for this OLDSMOOC. &nbsp;It was very well planned out, and did a nice job combinging synchronus and asychronus activies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I also participated for a time in the big MIT AI mooc and also in Kurt Bonks mooc that he in conjunction with Blackboard as well as snooped around several others. &nbsp;Here are a couple of things I'd suggest might contribute to making the OLDSMOOC a success:</p>
<p>-in the beginning acknowledge and give permission and blessing to lurkers and partial participation</p>
<p>-It sounds like you'll be getting fairly large numbers (even though there might be low levels participation and high levels of "drop outs") so consider how you might build in personal support networks. &nbsp;Perhaps think about recruiting volunteers and supporting the development of relatively small groups for some tasks</p>
<p>-think early about what kind of resources/aretefacts could be created during the course by and through the participants. &nbsp;This includes the recorded sessions, discussions, bibliograhies, wikis, etc.. but also the social structures that emerge. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>-maybe build in ways for people to connect on existing projects and develop new projects</p>        </div>
