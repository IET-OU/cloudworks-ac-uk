<p><strong>Google Apps at the OU</strong></p>
<p>The OU began rollout of Google Apps for Education to small groups of opt-in students on 19 Aug, with much wider rollout planned for next Feb; in parallel with this, First Class email is being phased out.&nbsp; More detailed information is available on the <a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/1391503" rel="nofollow">LIO project pages</a> and in the recently revised <a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=469483" rel="nofollow">OU Computing Guide</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab</strong></p>
<p>Star of the recent IFA technology fair in Berlin was <a href="http://galaxytab.samsungmobile.com/" rel="nofollow">Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Tab</a>.&nbsp; Originally billed (by the press) as a direct iPad competitor, it is now clear that it will have its own market slot.&nbsp; Sure, the 7&rdquo; screen isn&rsquo;t as big as an iPad, but it&rsquo;s big enough to display some serious content (including Flash), it has a 3.2 MP back camera (including flash), another on the front for video calling and &ndash; big differentiator &ndash; it&rsquo;s a phone.&nbsp; This means, according to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/03/the-samsung-galaxy-tab-can-set-its-own-price-no-need-to-directly-compete-with-the-ipads-500-price" rel="nofollow">TechCrunch</a>, that Samsung can set a premium price, possibly up to $800, although <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31021_3-20016152-260.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20" rel="nofollow">CNET</a> is predicting a much lower $200-$300.</p>
<p>[CNET]</p>

<p><strong>Scotland&rsquo;s First &ldquo;iSchool&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>All 105 students at the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/01/scottish_ischool/" rel="nofollow">Cedars School of Excellence</a> in Greenock will now take all their lessons on iPads.&nbsp; Each of the children will have their own iPad which is hooked into the school's wireless network, allowing them to access "pre-approved websites for lessons in English, maths, languages and history."&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; I thought iPad was a tool, not a cult.&nbsp; I have a fantastic new power drill at home, but sometimes nails or glue are more suitable&hellip;</p>
<p>[The Register]</p>
<p>Not so fast.&nbsp; Professors at <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/blogPost-content/26782/" rel="nofollow">St John&rsquo;s College, Annapolis</a> worry that e-readers will draw students' attention away from classroom discussions, and have voted &ldquo;to discourage students from loading up Homer or Aristotle on their Kindles or iPads and bringing them to seminar&rdquo;.</p>
<p>[The Chronicle]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Broadband Use</strong></p>
<p>Visualisation of the month award goes to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11012356" rel="nofollow">OFCOM</a> for an excellent graph depicting what we do all day. &nbsp;The latest OFCOM survey reveals that, of the 15h45m we are typically awake each day, we spend 7h5m "engaging in media and communications activities" (phone, computer, radio or TV). &nbsp;16-24 year-olds spend less time on this (6h35m) but achieve more (9h32m) through multitasking. &nbsp;Mobile data volumes grew by 240% from 2007 to 2009 and 45% of all mobile web use in the UK is on Facebook, way ahead of second-placed Google (8%). &nbsp;UK internet take-up is now at 73%, the majority of which is fixed broadband.</p>
<p>[BBC]</p>
<p>A survey by Pew Internet has found that 66% of Americans use a high-speed internet connection at home (rising to 80% for 18-29 year-olds), but that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/11/pew-fifth-adults-internet/" rel="nofollow">21% don&rsquo;t use the internet at all</a>.&nbsp; 48% of these do not think online content is relevant to their lives and 90% declare themselves simply as &lsquo;not interested&rsquo;.</p>
<p>[TechCrunch]</p>
<p>Slightly more esoteric, but if you&rsquo;re interested in what&rsquo;s happening with the <a href="http://www.bcg.com/documents/file58645.pdf" rel="nofollow">internet in Brazil, Russia, India, China and Indonesia</a>, the Boston Consulting Group&rsquo;s latest report could be just what you need.&nbsp; Notably, PC penetration is low in these countries (Brazil and Russia at around 32%; China, 20%; Indonesia and India, 5%, compared with the US and Japan at 90%) so m-learning has a potentially bright future, either via phone or pad/tablet.</p>
<p>[Tony Bates]</p>
<p>Finally, Chris Anderson and Michael Wolff&rsquo;s article in &lsquo;Wired&rsquo;, <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/08/ff_webrip/all/1" rel="nofollow">the web is dead: long live the internet</a>, has attracted a lot of interest.&nbsp; Chris and Michael put alternative perspectives on where we&rsquo;ve come from, where we&rsquo;re heading, who&rsquo;s in the driving seat, and why.</p>

<p><strong>Education at a Glance 2010: OECD Indicators</strong></p>
<p>The latest update to <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/52/0,3343,en_2649_39263238_45897844_1_1_1_1,00.html" rel="nofollow">Education at a Glance</a> is packed full of data about the state of education across the OECD countries.&nbsp; With international data, there&rsquo;s always the danger of comparing apples with oranges but, subject to that health warning, we discover that 40% of the OECD adult population participates in some form of education in a given year; S Korea has the greatest proportion of 25-34 year olds in tertiary education (60%) and the US has the greatest non-completion rate (50%) but tops the league on spending (3% of GDP).</p>
<p>[Tony Bates]</p>
<p>Tony also brings news of an initiative from the Lumina Foundation for Education, aiming for a <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/09/13/lumina" rel="nofollow">degree qualifications profile</a> that defines what graduates should be able to know and do when they receive associate, bachelor's and master's degrees, no matter where they earn them.</p>
<p>[Tony Bates]</p>

<p><strong>Survey of UK eLearning Companies</strong></p>
<p>The BCS reports on IT Training magazine&rsquo;s second <a href="http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=conWebDoc.36721" rel="nofollow">annual survey of UK e-learning companies</a>.&nbsp; Line dominates the bespoke developers, with a revenue of &pound;7m (about one third that of LTS) followed by Kineo and Epic.&nbsp; The LMS (VLE) rankings are also based on company revenue, putting Saba at the top, but it would be interesting to see how Moodle fared on a ranking determined by user base.</p>
<p>[BCS]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>3D Worlds in Higher Education</strong></p>
<p>Stephen recommends Eero Palom&auml;ki&rsquo;s recent MSc thesis on <a href="http://www.vmwork.net/material/Palomaki_-_2009_-_Applying_3D_virtual_worlds_to_higher_education.pdf" rel="nofollow">3D virtual worlds in higher education</a>. &nbsp;He not only looks at the options (including the inevitable SecondLife) but also considers didactic approaches and proposes a process model for producing a course utilising 3D virtual worlds.</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Critical Past</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.criticalpast.com/" rel="nofollow">Critical Past</a> claims to offer nearly 60,000 historic videos and 7m photos, stretching back as far as 1894 and mostly from US government sources.&nbsp; Viewing is free, but download and use incurs a fee.</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>JISC is now offering a single gateway into the various <a href="http://www.jisc-content.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">content collections</a> it has been assembling or sponsoring since 2003.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[ALT]</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasacommons" rel="nofollow">NASA</a> has placed 50+ years of copyright-free archive images onto Flickr.</p>

<p><strong>How Phoenix Preps Tutors</strong></p>
<p>Interesting short interview in eLearn Magazine with Jessy Keiser, a former MBA instructor at the <a href="http://elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&article=133-1" rel="nofollow">University of Phoenix</a>, which gives some insight into how Phoenix prepares and supports its associate lecturers.</p>
<p>[eLearn Magazine]</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the South African Institute of Distance Education (SAIDE) has just developed a new online guide for its tutors.&nbsp; <a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/oer/oers/south-african-institute-for-distance-education/supporting-distance-learners" rel="nofollow">Supporting Distance Learners</a> is described as, &ldquo;a set of course materials intended for tutors in blended learning or fully online programmes.&nbsp; It takes readers reflectively through what it means to support learners in e-learning environments of a variety of kinds &ndash; both at a distance, and in conventional contact tuition environments that are web supported.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Parents' &pound;3,500 Bill for Student 'Essentials'</strong></p>
<p>First year students need around &pound;3,500 of &lsquo;essential&rsquo; kit before embarking on their university career, according to new research.&nbsp; The study, by eXpansys, refers to this generation of students as <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/Parents39-3500-bill-for-student.6507949.jp" rel="nofollow">igrads</a> because of the need for gadgets and reveals the top two pieces of equipment needed are a laptop computer and a smartphone, such as a BlackBerry, which together cost &pound;900.&nbsp; On top of that, internet access, a mobile phone contract and accessories such as cables and printers are also necessary.</p>
<p>[University World News]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>W3C Widgets</strong></p>
<p>The Worldwide Web Consortium, perhaps best known for its W3C accessibility standards, has introduced a <a href="http://newsletter.alt.ac.uk/w5a1dao0xsc11h1gubfgme?email=true" rel="nofollow">widget standard</a> that is intended to support a non-proprietary approach to client side web apps.&nbsp; This is based on web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) rather than programming languages, giving much greater cross-platform potential, albeit at the expense of some rich functionality.</p>
<p>[ALT]</p>

<p><strong>World Social Science Report</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Never before have there been so many social scientists in the world&rdquo;.&nbsp; Gosh.&nbsp; So many career-jeopardising comments come to mind, I don&rsquo;t know where to start.&nbsp; Perhaps I should just link you to UNESCO&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/resources/reports/world-social-science-report" rel="nofollow">World Social Science Report 2010</a>.</p>

<p><strong>eBook Update</strong></p>
<p>China's largest e-publisher, Shanda Literature Group, has launched the <a href="http://publishingperspectives.com/?p=19036" rel="nofollow">Bambook</a>, a dedicated e-reader, as well as an e-bookstore featuring more than three million titles.&nbsp; But at $150 for an e-ink device, I wouldn&rsquo;t bet the farm on it.</p>
<p>[Giles Clark]</p>
<p>A Wall Street Journal article, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703846604575448093175758872.html" rel="nofollow">The ABCs of e-Reading</a>, cites a Sony-funded survey of 1,200 e-reader owners, covering iPad, Kindle and the Sony Reader, revealing that:</p>
<ul>
<li>40% of e-book owners claimed they read more than they did with print books </li>
<li>People with e-readers read them in places they don&rsquo;t normally read books </li>
<li>Nearly half of all Americans read no books for pleasure </li>
<li>Approx 11 million Americans will have an e-reader by the end of September </li>
<li>E-books are read more slowly than printed books (iPads: 6.2% slower; Kindle: 10.7% slower) </li>
</ul>
<p>[Tony Bates]</p>
<p>The American Council of Learned Societies has just released a whitepaper, <a href="http://www.humanitiesebook.org/heb-whitepaper-3.html" rel="nofollow">Handheld E-Book Readers and Scholarship</a>, based on a survey of 142 users using various platforms including 3 variants of Kindle, 3 Sonys and iPhone-Touch-Pad.&nbsp; Over 60% used these devices frequently or occasionally so, not surprisingly, there was general satisfaction; however, some problems were reported with searching, referencing and minor errors in texts.</p>

<p>If all this has whetted your appetite, Hongkiat lists its <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/20-best-websites-to-download-free-e-books/" rel="nofollow">20 best websites to download free eBooks</a>.</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>

<p><strong>Structure of Blogs</strong></p>
<p>Jakob Nielsen&rsquo;s Alertbox provides useful guidance on usability, although I add the caution that his advice is aimed mainly at commercial sites, where the drivers to attract and keep users on the site are (hopefully) slightly different to education.&nbsp; A recent posting looked at the <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/blog-front-pages.html" rel="nofollow">structure of blogs</a>, with eye-tracking plots showing how users respond to different layouts.&nbsp; He concludes that summaries are (initially) better than full articles and the use of images helps maintain attention.</p>
<p>[Jakob Nielsen]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Free/Social Learning</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://nixty.com/" rel="nofollow">NIXTY</a> is a new provider of online educational content &ndash; some free, some subscription.&nbsp; Now this is a laudable aim and it&rsquo;s a nicely designed site, but what does it really offer?&nbsp; I linked to a lesson on Circuits and Electronics and ended up at <a href="http://nixty.com/lessons/lessonStudentLessonItem?course_id=1118&lesson_id=2317" rel="nofollow">a page containing a 51 min MIT lecture on logic gates</a> presented as an embedded YouTube clip.&nbsp; There is a general discussion area, but nobody seems to be discussing anything.&nbsp; A quote on the home page proclaims: &ldquo;NIXTY is like a college in my living room.&nbsp; I can access it anytime and learn anything I want.&rdquo;&nbsp; No.&nbsp; You can watch/hear/read stuff and try to remember it, but that&rsquo;s not college education, it&rsquo;s watching/hearing/reading stuff.</p>
<p>[Giles Clark]</p>
<p><a href="http://openstudy.com/" rel="nofollow">OpenStudy</a> comes at the problem from the opposite direction, with the emphasis very much on peer support for learning.&nbsp; CEO Phil Hill describes it as &ldquo;the Match.com of study&rdquo;, with users building their own personal study networks by following other students and joining groups.&nbsp; When they have a question, the site pushes it out to their extended network and matches them with people available to work with them.&nbsp; The site opened at the start of Sep and has 3,000 users so far, including a pilot project with MIT.</p>
<p>[The Chronicle]</p>
<p>As part of a joint UNESCO/Commonwealth of Learning initiative - <a href="http://oerworkshop.weebly.com/--online-discussion-forums.html" rel="nofollow">Taking OER beyond the OER Community: Policy and Capacity</a> &ndash; three online discussion forums will each run for a week in Sep, Oct and Nov, addressing issues such as policy, technology, quality, licensing and funding.</p>
<p>[Tony Bates]</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2010/09/08/new-community-founded-to-help-schools-exploit-open-source.aspx" rel="nofollow">JASIG</a>, a consortium that sponsors open source projects for HE, has initiated a &ldquo;2-3-98&rdquo; community of practice to help institutions understand how to exploit open source software; it will provide self-support for administrators, managers, and practitioners that want to use open initiatives in order to reduce costs and increase choice.&nbsp; Participants will be part of a mailing list, access a wiki, contribute to white papers, and share best practices through events.</p>

<p>Researchers from Middlesex University told last week&rsquo;s ALT Conference that students prefer to use Google and YouTube for information searches rather than expensive <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100911065234821" rel="nofollow">electronic resource library systems</a>, which they find too complex, time-consuming and cumbersome.&nbsp; According to the Middlesex report, &ldquo;People expect library resources to work in the same way as those available on the internet, that is, simple and user friendly&rdquo;.&nbsp; UK universities spend more than &pound;112m on electronic resources including e-books, full text databases and back copies of e-journals; nearly &pound;80m was spent on licences for e-journals alone.</p>

<p><strong>And Finally&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>In honour of the UK papal visit, we bring you &hellip; the Bible online.&nbsp; No, not a luxuriant eBook; this is the multi-player online role-playing game we&rsquo;ve all been waiting for.&nbsp; In chapter 1, now available in beta, &ldquo;Players can meet and play the real heroes of Genesis, Abraham and his descendants.&nbsp; The game is designed for users to actually <a href="http://thebible-onlinegame.com/" rel="nofollow">experience the Book of Genesis</a> by fulfilling quests of Abraham, which is based on the true stories of the Genesis [&hellip;] players are to lead their tribe, build buildings, maintain resources and engage in warfare with other tribes [&hellip;] There are also quests for users to experience Genesis according to the history of the Bible.&nbsp; For example, as it is written in Genesis 14:13~14, there is a quest for Abraham to lead 318 men to rescue his nephew Lot.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
