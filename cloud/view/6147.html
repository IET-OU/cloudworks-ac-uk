        <p>Bill Law<br /><em><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Career-learning Caf&eacute;</a></em></p>
<p>In his account of human motivation Abraham Maslow (1970) sees the drive for&nbsp; &lsquo;belongingness and love&rsquo; as seeking connections with family at home, mates at school or work, neighbours close-by, and welcoming groups. &nbsp;He sees its opposite as rejecting and rootless.&nbsp; And it is work-related: getting along with colleagues is a reason for seeking some kinds of work; and being ready to offer help to others is a motive for taking some kinds on.</p>
<p>Nowadays we are more acutely aware of rejection and rootlessness - speaking less of connections, more of disconnection.&nbsp; Zygmunt Bauman (2000) documents a society experienced as unconnected, uncivil, unpredictable and unsafe.&nbsp; He remarks that, in such a world...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;...the idea of career is nebulous - and utterly out of place&rsquo;.</em></p>
<p>Mary Douglas (1966, 1970) foresaw much of this.&nbsp; She sets out a spectrum of ways of coping - at the extremes it can mean clinging to a group, but it extends to opting out of all commitment.&nbsp; She develops four visualisations of how such drives socially position different people differently. &nbsp;All four are useful as descriptions of students and clients engaged in career-management issues. &nbsp;One of the four is attracting a lot of contemporary attention...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>isolates:</strong> are detached from society - excluded from opportunity - not belonging - unable to afford group membership - voiceless - risk averse</li>
<li><strong>positioners: </strong>are believers in tradition, order and social class - respectful of &eacute;lites as guides to success - seeing failure as the result of non-compliance</li>
<li><strong>individualist: </strong>are entrepreneurial, innovative and adaptive-to-change - and, so, competitive and confident - but rootless, so that everything is up for grabs</li>
<li><strong>enclaved: </strong>are locating themselves with the like-minded - where beliefs and values&nbsp; are important - and, so, rejecting outsiders - and defending &lsquo;us&rsquo; against &lsquo;them&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Allessandra Buonfino usefully <a title="Buonfino" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/cafBuonfino.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">summarises Mary Douglas&rsquo;s work</a>.&nbsp; She uses it to propose a new frame of reference for understanding all forms of social membership - which would include work-life.&nbsp; She seeks something less top-down and more about the search for recognition.&nbsp; She argues for...</p>
<p align="center"><em>making that social world familiar to people</em></p>
<p>It would mean people can create and access new forms of belonging.&nbsp; She sees the formation of enclaves as a particularly attractive way of finding acknowledgement.&nbsp; We might say that finding a like-minded enclave is a way of gaining recognition, finding affirmation and claiming a stake in society.&nbsp; And that means that what people do about enclaves has parallels with what they do about career - what happens in one will influence what happens in the other.</p>
<p>Mary Douglas takes account of such dynamics of change.&nbsp; She sees enclaves as becoming important in fractured societies - where both congenial families and demanding hierarchies are weakened.&nbsp; People then look for others they can trust about what is worth believing, worth having and worth doing. &nbsp;She sees all of such allegiances as capable of being both protective and aggressive. &nbsp;We can now see such sharing forming religious, sporting, cultural and consumer allegiances.&nbsp; However, what few foresaw, but what it is now possible to report, is how the internet has re-shaped things.&nbsp; On-line life has assembled itself around enclaves, while commercial interests have accessed the niche markets they create, and risks are being recognised for people who rely on their restricted connectedness. &nbsp;Some of those risks are <a title="LawICT" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/EVColonist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">shown to be</a> for working life.&nbsp; Mary Douglas&rsquo;s other groups may well find a place to belong in enclaves - whether on-the-street, on-line or on-the-make.&nbsp; But, in all three enclaved locations, there are both inhabitants and predators.</p>
<p>Geographer Danny Dorling (2011) documents much of this in terms of maps and locations.&nbsp; It post-codes opportunities.&nbsp; In examining what goes on in a locality, he remarks that...</p>
<p align="center"><em>in each location there is both remembering and forgetting</em></p>
<p>And that process becomes part of each location&rsquo;s separateness. &nbsp;In each, members must - then - either start from scratch or call on what the group shares.&nbsp; Danny Dorling points out that sharing in groups is through narratives. &nbsp;The career-related analysis of such enclaves might look like the list set out below.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each has a distinctive collection of &lsquo;who?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what?&rsquo;, &lsquo;how?&rsquo;, &lsquo;when?&rsquo;, &lsquo;where?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;why?&rsquo; - all story-tellers&rsquo; questions, and each prefixing narrative verbs. &nbsp;To work-up such narratives is to discover how each location can tell more-than-one story.&nbsp; But it is also to see how the possibilities for each enclave are distinctive of each.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>social circle: </strong>approaching - belonging - contacting - containing - positioning</li>
<li><strong>group:</strong> belonging - capitalising - evicting - rejecting - separating</li>
<li><strong>url: </strong>connecting - enclosing - following - navigating - protecting</li>
<li><strong>neighbourhood:</strong> cleaning - constituting - polluting - protecting - sequestering</li>
<li><strong>community:</strong> affording - attaching - diversifying - situating - valuing</li>
<li><strong>territory:</strong> allying - defending - evacuating - invading - occupying</li>
</ul>
<p>And so the career prospects that come out of each of these stories are various - and variously-fulfilling and -sustainable.&nbsp; The significant factors are that some narratives enlarge the space that the group occupies, and some reduce it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all connectedness: but, in the contemporary world, Abraham Maslow&rsquo;s advocacy brings both expansion and contraction - and evokes both hope and fear.&nbsp; It depends.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of research showing how career management depends on situation, language and culture.&nbsp; Much depends on situation because a mix of - for example - no-go areas, derelict spaces, congenial neighbourhoods, feel-good street-markets, gated communities and cosmopolitan contacts both feeds and poisons any sense of who people take themselves to be.&nbsp; It depends on culture because the habitual - in shared symbols, ceremonies and rituals - forms social attachments and allegiances, and all of this offers a mirror in which belief, value and expectation are reflected.&nbsp; It depends on language because talk is more than just communication: it frames what it is possible to say about &lsquo;what&rsquo;s happening?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what does it mean?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;what shall we do about it?&rsquo; - and people need to know what to say to whom, and how.</p>
<p>Managing such tasks in terms of looking again at one&rsquo;s enclaves is useful.&nbsp; It offers a handle on life which is more recognisable than the crude generalisation touted by identity politics: categories like gender, race and social-class obscure too much within-group variation.&nbsp; Talk of enclaves recognises that ghetto and gentrification sit cheek-by-jowl, and faces up to what can be undeclared hostility in village life.&nbsp; It reframes, on a human scale, the ground for exchange and movement between strangers and competitors, and - where they are entrenched - enemies.&nbsp; All sides of all such encounters need to know each other - usually more than they realise.&nbsp; Talks of enclaves justifies Allessandra Buonfino&rsquo;s hope for the creation of new forms of belonging.&nbsp; Such agency might even rediscover&nbsp; love in more of its many senses.&nbsp; Can we guess that Abraham Maslow would nod agreement?</p>
<p>The importance of being able to manage this process is now supported by our understanding of genetics (Pagel, 2012).&nbsp; That research shows that human survival depends on our ability to learn how to belong to a group.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easier for gorillas, who can move from one group to another instinctively equipped to behave appropriately.&nbsp; But for you and me it&rsquo;s different.&nbsp; Moving from one enclave to another takes adjustment time - to appreciate what's-what, and to see how they are best managed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true that we share our evolutionary relative&rsquo;s capacity to &lsquo;just do it!&rsquo; - and there are times when instinctive impulse works well for us.&nbsp; But our split-level brain also gives us the capacity to slow down and take account of things - before we do anything.&nbsp; And that proves usually to be the more reliable guardian of our chances in life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea of enclaves has not featured much in conventional careers-work thinking.&nbsp; Most of the considerations that we put in front of students and clients are focused more on individual attributes than shared memberships.&nbsp; There is an argument here for broadening that thinking along lines extended by Zygmunt Bauman, Mary Douglas and Danny Dorling.&nbsp; I wonder if innovation in...</p>
<p align="center"><em>making that social world familiar to people</em></p>
<p>...might usefully find our most congenial colleagues among geographers who understand location, literates who understand language, and dramatists who understand narrative.</p>
