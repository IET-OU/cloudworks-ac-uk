<p><strong>Focus on &hellip; e-Reading</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; The Chronicle; Campus Technology; Publishers Weekly]</em></p>
<p>Defining an accurate student position on learning from print vs screen is fraught with danger.&nbsp; For start, &lsquo;on-screen&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean now what it used to (i.e. probably a vertical 17&rdquo; monitor placed a couple of feet away on a desk), and many of the headline facts and figures for e-books refer more to sequential reading of fiction than studying from textbooks.&nbsp; OU surveys tell us that around 95% of our students, &ldquo;enjoy learning through reading printed text&rdquo; but only around 50% &ldquo;enjoy learning through reading text online&rdquo;.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t ask the question but presumably those figures relate to &lsquo;dense&rsquo; text rather than reading shorter activities, quiz questions, forum posts, etc.&nbsp; We might also presume that those who love print also benefit occasionally being able to search or copy/paste from electronic text (but may not necessarily regard this as &ldquo;enjoyable&rdquo;).&nbsp; So, what other relevant evidence is there to help us assess the situation?</p>
<p>Stavanger University&rsquo;s Anne Mangen conducted a study comparing reading an &lsquo;upsetting&rsquo; short story on paper and on iPad, in which she found that paper readers reported higher measures of empathy and immersion than iPad readers. &nbsp;In a more recent study, 25 participants read a 28-page story on a Kindle, and 25 read the same story in print.&nbsp; They were then tested on aspects of the story including objects, characters and settings, revealing that performance was largely similar, except when it came to the timing of events in the story.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Kindle readers performed significantly worse on the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/19/readers-absorb-less-kindles-paper-study-plot-ereader-digitisation" rel="nofollow">plot reconstruction</a> measure, ie, when they were asked to place 14 events in the correct order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prof Naomi Baron bemoans <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/How-E-Reading-Threatens/147661/" rel="nofollow">a growing reluctance on the part of students to read long-form text in any format</a>, suggesting that e-readers and tablets have made matters worse &ndash; they may be fine for novels, but not for text we intend to &ldquo;muse over or reread&rdquo;.&nbsp; She surveyed university students in the US, Germany and Japan, finding that, if cost was not a factor, &ldquo;If a text is long, 92 percent would choose hard copy. For shorter texts, it&rsquo;s a toss-up.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is also the attendant distraction factor, with 85% of US students indicating they were likely to multitask when reading on-screen, compared to just 26% while reading in print (and there is evidence that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254?np=y" rel="nofollow">multitasking</a> &ldquo;poses a significant distraction&rdquo; to academic performance).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xconomy reports that educational publishers are moving much more into <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2014/08/04/as-book-prices-drop-big-publishers-push-into-software-and-edtech/" rel="nofollow">interactive e-books</a> as potential sources of profit and Pew Internet research tells us that 37% of US adults aged 18-29 <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/09/10/younger-americans-and-public-libraries/" rel="nofollow">have read an e-book in the past year</a>.&nbsp; In a recent survey of 500 US students sponsored by e-book supplier <a href="http://www.vitalsource.com/pressreleases/Pages/Fourth-Annual-Wakefield-Survey-Cites-Cost-of-College-Technology-Innovation-as-Top-Trends-in-Higher-Education.aspx" rel="nofollow">Vital Source</a>, 62% stated that they have used interactive textbooks with features such as video, audio and quizzes, and 67% say their professors frequently recommend they purchase the e-text versions of textbooks and other course materials.&nbsp; The top benefit (31% of students) is that these make lessons easier to understand; 23% say they help them complete assignments more quickly and 21% believe they help them stay more organized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Textbook price comparison site CampusBooks found that nearly half of the 1,072 US undergraduates they surveyed had been assigned an e-textbook for a course. &nbsp;However, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/08/25/facebook-still-lures-students-and-etextbooks-dont-make-them-uniformly-happy.aspx" rel="nofollow">only 44% were very or somewhat happy</a> using an e-book, with 39% very or somewhat unhappy. The researchers noted that reported dissatisfaction with e-books appears to rise as students progress through school but, despite this, adoption also increases &ndash; probably for financial reasons.&nbsp; The survey also asked how students take notes in class. Around 90% use paper and 35% use a laptop, but only 9% append the textbook itself, possibly mindful of the potential textbook resale market in the US.&nbsp; But Mueller &amp; Oppenheimer caution against taking notes on laptops because it <a href="http://adifference.blogspot.ca/2014/09/are-laptops-really-bad-for-learning.html" rel="nofollow">results in shallower processing</a> due to a tendency to transcribe verbatim, whereas those students who took notes longhand tend to process information and reframe it in their own words &ndash; leading to better performance in conceptual question tests.</p>
<p>And, in a <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/63225-college-students-prefer-a-mix-of-print-and-digital-textbooks.html#path/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/63225-college-students-prefer-a-mix-of-print-and-digital-textbooks.html" rel="nofollow">Hewlett Packard</a> online survey of 527 college students, 57% said they preferred print materials to e-books when studying.&nbsp; When citing reasons for their preference, 54% cited &ldquo;ease of use&rdquo; and 35% &ldquo;note-taking ability&rdquo; as a reason for preferring print.&nbsp; Only 6% favoured e-books for their note-taking ability and 5% for their interactivity (which, we&rsquo;re often led to believe, is the holy grail of e-book design).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, regardless of preferences and opinions, what about actual learning effectiveness?&nbsp; In a recent study, <a href="http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/eds/detail/detail?vid=5&sid=480ac1d9-99bb-4cda-b195-b72645f87007@sessionmgr110&hid=106&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#db=psyh&AN=2013-27035-011" rel="nofollow">Margolin et al (2013)</a> invited ninety participants read five factual and five fiction 500-word passages of text.&nbsp; Thirty read from A4 paper, 30 used a Kindle and 30 read PDFs on a PC.&nbsp; All scored around 75% in MCQ comprehension tests, regardless of medium/device.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; The Chronicle; Audrey Watters; The Boston Globe; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Stanford&rsquo;s Prof John Mitchell welcomes the impact that MOOCs have had on the world of education over the past couple of years but he fears <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/moocs-are-free-but-for-how-much-longer/2015204.article" rel="nofollow">they may not remain free for too much longer</a>.&nbsp; This is for obvious economic reasons relating to the costs of development and support, but also for practical ones such as abating high drop-out rates.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the issues we have with MOOCs is that it can be very difficult to set up successful group projects when people keep leaving the course,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe if there&rsquo;s payment or an application process or courses targeted at a particular community we will have less attrition and more cohesion in the group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how confident can we be that students will pay even modest fees?&nbsp; Australia&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.afr.com/p/national/education/une_shuts_down_its_loss_making_moocs_ZQoeYL6tucYL6h5TJTAXBI" rel="nofollow">University of New England</a> (UNE) has shut down its pioneering pay-for MOOC because it could not make it pay.&nbsp; Whilst the basic online courses were free, students were required to pay A$495 to do an exam, A$35 an hour for a group tutorial and A$150 an hour for private tutoring.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a very good experiment for us but it was an experiment,&rdquo; said vice-chancellor, Prof Annabelle Duncan.&nbsp; &ldquo;While MOOCs will continue to be offered I am sure by some of the very big providers around the world it&rsquo;s not something that a university like UNE would go at alone,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Sebastian Thrun solved Udacity&rsquo;s economic conundrum by &lsquo;selling out&rsquo;, whereas Coursera remains largely free apart from the $50 Signature Track fee students can pay to take verified exams and earn a certificate of completion.&nbsp; However, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2014/08/20/courseras-new-goal-teaching-at-firms-such-as-mastercard/" rel="nofollow">Coursera is now also embarking on paid partnerships</a> with organisations such as MasterCard, AT&amp;T and Shell, as they seek content for employee training and development.&nbsp; At MasterCard, for example, a course on web applications has been offered to 2,500 employees, whilst a behavioural economics class taught by Duke professor Dan Ariely has been offered to 300 marketing staff.</p>
<p>An interesting new take on dropout rates comes from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/10/coursera-president-daphne-koller-2014-is-the-year-moocs-will-come-of-age/" rel="nofollow">Coursera&rsquo;s Daphne Koller</a>, who claims that, of the people who actually aim to finish the course, 70% do so.&nbsp; In an interview at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference earlier this month, she also flagged a move towards more self-directed learning, and classes that have less rigid (and distant) start dates &ndash; Coursera has found that if a course starts within a week of a student enrolling, engagement doubles. &nbsp;And how do employers regard MOOCs?&nbsp; Koller noted that around 70% of students with a Coursera credential list it on their LinkedIn profile, and she believes that around 60-70% of employers would look at the credential of an applicant favourably.</p>
<p>edX is expanding its reach beyond HE and has begun offering <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/09/online-education-company-edx-expanding-offer-free-courses-aimed-high-school-students/wWdR6XQakRKIxAhaH580ZP/story.html" rel="nofollow">26 courses geared toward high school students</a>.&nbsp; The courses were created by 14 institutions &ndash; including MIT, Georgetown and Rice universities, the University of California and Boston University &ndash; and will cover subjects including computer science, calculus, geometry, algebra, English, physics, biology, chemistry, Spanish, French, history, statistics, and psychology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/09/04/online-education-platform-edcast-puts-universities-charge-their-content" rel="nofollow">EdCast</a> is the latest new kid on the block, with aspirations to be simultaneously massive and intimate, private and public.&nbsp; It is essentially a service provider built on top of Open edX code, and a first example of what an EdCast product may look like comes from the UN-backed Sustainable Development Solutions Network &ndash; which has more than 200 university and organizational members and now has its own online education portal, SDSN.edu.&nbsp; EdCast EdCast claims to be finalising deals with &ldquo;dozens&rdquo; of groups of institutions, the number of which &ldquo;may total in the hundreds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A FutureLearn MOOC offering <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29157037" rel="nofollow">English language lessons</a> from the British Council has attracted over 100,000 registrations from students in 178 countries.&nbsp; Spain accounts for the biggest group of students but there are also large groups from the UK, Burma, Russia, Colombia, China, Vietnam and India &ndash; and around a third of these are studying via mobile phones.</p>
<p>The Indian Institute of Technology and the Commonwealth of Learning have teamed up to offer a novel MOOC that is focused on the design of the course itself. &nbsp;The four-week <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140903154113518" rel="nofollow">MOOC on MOOCs: What you need to know about massive open online courses</a> is aimed at addressing the nuts and bolts of designing and running a MOOC.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/08/29/profit-anthem-education-abruptly-closes-campuses-after-filing-bankruptcy" rel="nofollow">Anthem Education</a>, a for-profit chain of US colleges and career institutes has filed for bankruptcy.&nbsp; The company had 41 campuses, 14 of which it has already sold to International Education Corporation.&nbsp; It hopes to keep 28 campuses up and running (presumably including the ones IEC is acquiring) although the bankruptcy filing immediately closes off the federal student aid which accounts for nearly 90% of Anthem&rsquo;s income.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.skillsoft.com/about/press_room/Skillsoft_Annoucement_Presentation_final.pdf" rel="nofollow">Skillsoft</a> has announced its intent to purchase SumTotal Systems, declaring themselves &ldquo;highly complementary&rdquo;.&nbsp; Skillsoft has 6,000 customers and 19m users of its 60,000 learning assets (which include 6,000 interactive courses and over 40,000 e-books and videos) whilst SumTotal&rsquo;s learning management and talent management systems are used by 3,500 customers with 45m registered users.</p>

<p><strong>Majority of Scottish Academics Set to Vote &lsquo;No&rsquo;</strong></p>

<p>However, according to 1,048 young people (16-17) who attended the BBC's Big Debate in Glasgow, 97% of them thought <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29158556" rel="nofollow">tuition fees was the most important issue</a> to them, followed by the economy (94%), currency (88%), welfare (88%) and pensions (84%).</p>

<p><strong>Labour Proposes Technical Universities</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; Stephen Downes; edsurge; Audrey Watters]</em></p>

<p>The need for such an approach is supported by evidence from the Manpower Group, whose <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/08/employers-arent-just-whining-the-skills-gap-is-real/" rel="nofollow">Talent Shortage Survey</a> surveyed 38,000 employers worldwide, finding that 35% reported difficulty in filling jobs due to lack of suitable and available talent.&nbsp; McKinsey estimates that the number of skillsets needed in the workforce increased from 178 in Sep 09 to 924 in Jun 12 and the US National Center for Education Statistics projects that by 2020, <a href="http://www.christenseninstitute.org/publications/hire/" rel="nofollow">42% of all college students will be 25 years of age or older</a> as more working adults seek to develop new skills for the rapidly emerging new technologies and jobs.</p>
