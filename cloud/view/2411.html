        <p>From the website:</p>
<p>BoB is an off-air recording and media archive service. BoB is available to staff and students of member institutions of the British Universities Film &amp; Video Council that hold an ERA+ license. This TV scheduling service allows you to record TV and radio programmes that are scheduled to be broadcast over the next seven days as well as retrieving programmes from the last seven days from a selected list of recorded channels.</p>
<p>After a programme is recorded users will receive a Flash video file they can watch in a web page - in a similar way to BBC's iPlayer. BoB stores recorded TV and Radio programmes in an archive indefinitely* for all users to enjoy. The archive currently offers thousands of TV and radio programmes covering all genres and that number is set to rise as more further and higher education institutions join BoB.</p>    </div>

                   <p>I've used this a few times &amp; have found it pretty useful.</p>
<p>There are a few problems (or there were, don't know if they've been sorted, I know I've mentioned them).</p>
<p>1: When I tried to create a playlist of 5 episodes of the same thing, I couldn't see a way of setting them in the order I wanted them. I added them in the right order, and then they shifted. I couldn't work out what logic was used; and even when I tried again &amp; very carefully added them, it still re-arranged them in the mystery order.</p>
<p>2: I'd made a few clips from the same programme, &amp; they were labelled with the programme title - so I had to remember which was which - I couldn't rename / label them in a useful (to me!) way.</p>
<p>Those two issues aside, I've found it very useful - like iPlayer on steriods.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I've just had another play; the two playlists I created just now set themselves in the order I added the programmes - which is what I'd expect.</p>
<p>I tried, again to do the one that's not sorting itself as expected (and I'm only trying to get it in broadcast order, it's not that I want it in some odd order) -and it's still sorting itself in the wrong order (same wrong order each time). Perhaps it's only that one particular set of programmes that's a bit odd.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Grainne</p>
<p>One thing that has just happened is that I'd had a few things that have suddenly disappeared from my list of recordings. It's the Virtual Revolution series; which, as far as we can tell, is an OU creation - and this seems to be the problem.</p>
<p>One of the librarians did some research for me, she found the following on the Surrey website:</p>
<p><em>ERA+/BoB FAQs<br />Why can&rsquo;t I record certain broadcasts?<br /><br />The ERA+ licence is applicable to all licensed broadcast services (television and radio) in the UK that aren&rsquo;t covered by any other certified Section 35 licence. The only other certified Section 35 licence in the UK is held by the Open University and therefore OU productions or partnership productions cannot be recorded under the ERA licence. This includes many popular prime-time programmes such as Coast and The Money Programme. The University of Surrey does not currently hold an OU licence and therefore BoB is configured to not record OU broadcasts (the EPG is cross-referenced with www.open2.net)."</em></p>
<p><br />She's contacting<em> </em>people via the Virtual Rev. website to see if she can get further information. (It was a very useful programme, so would be a shame if we can't use it; I'd find it potentially much more useful than, say, EastEnders in my teaching!</p>
