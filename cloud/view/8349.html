        <p><strong>"Healthy Eating" in an e-Design Template</strong></p>
<p>The e-Design Template had less detail than some of the other models but I found it quite straightforward to understand. The e-Design Template describes four phases of scaffolding, which build upon an increasing diversity of interaction and assessment. These phases are: Active Induction, Guided Exploration, Facilitated Investigation and Self-organised Learner.</p>
<p>The Healthy Eating lesson is laid out in a table and broken down into 11 activities that also list the interaction between participants and the duration of each activity. Laying it out in a table helps make it clear to read, but the table was not fully employed as the lesson only uses two of the phase scaffolds. There were also no assessments for this lesson.</p>
<p>The learning outcomes of the activity were not expressed in the template, therefore it was difficult to judge if the lesson fulfilled its objectives. As this lesson is part of a series this model would help demonstrate how the student moves from teacher-managed, closed activities to student-managed open activities over time.</p>
<p>I did not find this template useful in representing the Healthy Eating lesson as I thought it lacked important details such as the technologies used and information about the participants. Although it does state that there is interaction between teacher and student, etc., it doesn&rsquo;t state what this interaction is. There is no contingency built into this template if the lesson does not follow the plan for technical or other reasons.</p>
<p><strong>"Healthy Eating" as a 4SPPIces Model</strong></p>
<p>The 4SPPIces model integrated into LdShake includes a series of tabs that relate to the pedagogical methods, participants, space and history of the learning design. I did not find the Healthy Eating lesson as clear in this model as some of the others as it did not have a table format and therefore the plan was less obvious. However it did include more detail than other models, such as the e-Design Template, and the figure of the summary did provide a useful overview.</p>
<p>The model does support collaboration so would be useful for team planning. The model includes the virtual space and technologies used so would be useful for TEL.</p>
<p><em><strong>Are these representations adequate for expressing my design?</strong></em></p>
<p>I do not think that either model is very useful for expressing my learning design. My workshop was an informal session that developed in response to the learner&rsquo;s specific queries. Although I did prepare and have a plan in mind I needed to be able to respond to their specific concerns therefore I would need a model that was more flexible.</p>
<p><em><strong>What would be the benefits of using these representations for your design?</strong></em></p>
<p>I could see that the 4SPPIces Model would be useful if my team decided to incorporate my design into a series of workshops that could be reused. I cannot see any benefit to using the e-Design template for my design as there is no assessment.</p>    </div>

                   <p>I agree with your reservations about these templates for informal/spontaneous learning activities. Perhaps they work better in a controlled, structured situation where there's a set curriculum to deliver?&nbsp;</p>        </div>
