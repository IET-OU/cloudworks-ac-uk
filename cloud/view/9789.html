<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Audrey Watters; Class Central; Steve Parkinson; Donald Clark]</em></p>
<p>US researchers looking at MOOC enrolments, engagement, persistence and completion report counterintuitive findings that may help us better understand <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/journal_of_higher_education/v087/87.2.evans.html" rel="nofollow">the drop-out problem</a>. &nbsp;Having analysed 2.1m students&rsquo; participation in 2,900 lectures from 44 (mostly STEM) Coursera MOOCs, their key findings were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students who signed up 1-3 weeks before the course started demonstrated highest levels of persistence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strongest predictor of course completion was the student&rsquo;s willingness to take a pre-survey (12 percentage points more likely to complete)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students with Gmail or .edu email addresses showed worse persistence than students with other email addresses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Videos posted earlier in the week were more likely to be watched than those posted later in the week (although length of video seemed to have no impact on viewing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emails from instructors to students about new course material were ineffective in getting students to watch more</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some students were also asked which of three tracks they intended to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quantitative track (with weekly quizzes and maths based problems)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qualitative track (weekly quizzes and a final project)</p>
</li>
<li>
