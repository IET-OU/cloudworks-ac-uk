        <p>Bill Law<br /><em><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Career-learning Caf&eacute;</a></em></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much talk among careers workers of the value of reliable assessment and impartial information.&nbsp; It belongs to ideas about matching the qualities of an individual to the requirements of an opportunity.&nbsp; It draws on knowledge of labour economy and of differential psychology.</p>
<p>Such thinking position careers workers as front-loading into the labour economy.&nbsp; Its leaders see the work as supporting economic productivity.&nbsp; If they are right, the effectiveness of careers work is tested by how fully the outputs of an education become the inputs of the economy.</p>
<p>But it all makes a lot of assumptions; and they are largely mythical...</p>
<ul>
<li>careers work is in no position to accrue a significant net gain for national economic performance</li>
<li>assumptions about such decision-making rationality have little support, even among economists</li>
<li>life chances are as likely to rest on some combination of accidental encounter, well-positioned background and instinctive impulsive</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this pictures a towering individual, freely making independent decisions, based on a balancing of factors. &nbsp;And the idea that what comes out of that process benefits rather than damages the rest of us is pure mythology.&nbsp; Somebody should make an on-line wargame fantasy about it &ndash; somebody probably will.&nbsp; But <a title="professionalismblog" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5873" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the evidence</a> tells a different story.</p>
<p>The towering dragons and their sorcerers&rsquo; apprentices probably know they are dishing up myths.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re bright enough to know that these are convenient myths &ndash; rampant individualism is convenient to...</p>
<ul>
<li>leaders who rake in rewards by persuading others that all progress depends on trail-blazing individuals</li>
<li>commerce which flatters consumers, romances candidates, and isolates employees by steering away from the collective and towards the individual &nbsp;</li>
<li>governments which claim that social damage can be fixed by firmly dealing with feckless and undeserving individuals</li>
</ul>
<p>And we need better to understand the to-and-fro between what are internal claims on &lsquo;respect&rsquo;, &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; and &rsquo;confidence&rsquo; and what are external experiences of stress, manipulation and anxiety.</p>
<p>In a sane society the people best placed to work on probing any resulting crock of delusion would be educators. &nbsp;That curriculum deals with the power of contemporary mythology, and the interests it serves. &nbsp;Would that be careers education? &nbsp;&nbsp;Probably not, no time or space for that kind of exploration.&nbsp; And, anyway, it would get minority support &ndash; schools and universities are widely assumed to be for supporting the advertising and propaganda which steers individual employables towards national competitiveness. &nbsp;Is that why teachers become teachers?</p>
<p>A relevant &nbsp;conference has been organised.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<a title="place-spaceconference" href="http://www.esri.mmu.ac.uk/space/index.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">&lsquo;Space, Place and Social Justice in Education&rsquo;</a></p>
<p>Why &lsquo;space and place&rsquo;?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s because the evidence shows how geography relates to chances in life.&nbsp; The ways people experience &lsquo;respect&rsquo;, &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; and &lsquo;confidence&rsquo; are situated.&nbsp; That feeling of knowing you are probably going to be alright is place-related.&nbsp; How you feel belongs to where you are. &nbsp;Geographer <a title="Dorling" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Injustice-Why-Social-InequalityPersists/dp/1847427200/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1340100645&sr=8-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Danny Dorling</a> is among the few who have thoroughly documented and mapped these realities.&nbsp; He will be at the conference.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="enclaves and systems" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">My own paper</a> examines the varying terms in which people voice their claims on respect, freedom, confidence.&nbsp; It is, I argue, a marker for their claim to a stake in society.&nbsp; It kicks off from a fundamental question for social justice...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 210px;">who gets to do what in society?</p>
<p>I find it hard to think of a more important issue for social policy. &nbsp;And posing it brings careers work to the heart of that issue. &nbsp;What we do about it will feed into our hopes for social mobility.&nbsp; And, among those who prefer to live with convenient myths, it will feed into the pretensions they use to disguise the reality.</p>
<p>The article shows how the 'who-gets-to-do-what' question must be answered differently in different locations.&nbsp; It examines six manifestations of place.&nbsp; Each of them is differently populated - they are social enclaves.&nbsp; We are social animals and work-life is part of our social membership. &nbsp;In each enclave people are bound together by what shared experience has taught them.&nbsp; And in each there are different beliefs about how things are, different values about what is worth getting, and different expectations about getting them. &nbsp;The voicing of recognition, affirmation and membership is situated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here are some of the ideas that need arguing...</p>
<p><strong>...about experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>what seems real and useful in one place seems alien and irrelevant in another</li>
<li>from early in life, too many people have ambition progressively squeezed out of them, if these are not the ambitions that are locally favoured</li>
<li>that trap can be sprung in a sequestered suburb as much as in a run-down neighbourhood or a remote village</li>
<li>helping action which serves the interests of some can damage the interests of others</li>
<li>programmes that go well in some locations are rejected in others</li>
<li>progress depends less on what leaders claim &ndash; more on who believes them</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>... about what we can and can&rsquo;t know</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>measures of effectiveness assume that we can say in advance what programme outcomes should be</li>
<li>we can&rsquo;t, ready-for-anything flexibility has different starting-points and pursues different aspirations</li>
<li>observations of how people use learning are more useful than measures of what they learn</li>
<li>we don&rsquo;t know in advance how local people will use a programme</li>
<li>discovered usefulness should dispose of ready-made tests</li>
<li>ready-for-anything flexibility is needed by people and community, it also serves commerce and society</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>... about professionalism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ready-made measures originate in commerce and policy</li>
<li>satisfying them is portrayed as a kind of patriotism</li>
<li>an evidence base can only make useful sense one location at a time</li>
<li>It must take account of embedded learning from local experience</li>
<li>parading research findings are secondary to discovering that experience</li>
<li>findings must inform professional and organisational reform as well as programme development</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>... about voice</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center"><em>heeding local voices means excluding ready-made thinking&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise targeted expertise may silence exploratory experience&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp; voice means enabling people to construct their own narratives&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp; narrative and exploration are mutually dependent&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp; narrative starts in a place but does not necessarily stay there&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp; space makes room for realising claims on respect, freedom, confidence, and a fair stake in society &ndash; which is justice</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you would rather make your case face-to-face, you could register for the <a title="place-spaceconference" href="http://www.esri.mmu.ac.uk/space/index.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">conference</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More important, a successful conference can remind you of why you came into your work in the first place</p>    </div>
