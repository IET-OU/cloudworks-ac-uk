        <p>My mini-viva is pretty soon and I need to write a short talk!&nbsp; I know that a mini-viva is something like a 'grant pitch' for the next two years.&nbsp; Thus it seems sensible to talk about Contributions in terms of Why This Matters, the associated Deliverables, and a Risk Analysis.</p>
<p>The three main contributions I highlighted in my probation report are:</p>
<p>1. <strong>It tests the PLE idea on a complex classical subject.</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>It shows how to make a large-scale learning system sustainable.</strong></p>
<p>3.<strong> It improves our understanding of how people learn.</strong></p>
<p>In a bit more detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>(a) We talked at the Mash-Up Personal Learning Environments workshop about "grand challenges" for PLEs -- the one I wanted to highlight was deep coverage in some subject, though another equally popular grand challenge had to do with broad coverage and applicability across subjects -- Ideally we would have both and we can work from "two sides of the mountain" by dividing the problem up in this way; (b) using the idea from my initial job description, a PLE requires both good "social networking" facilities and strong "semantic adaptivity" -- there are various improvements I want to make to the PlanetMath platform that will deliver both, e.g. improvements to the forum system, learner profiles, a recommendation system for exercises, and some light text analysis features for suggesting similar articles and so forth; (c) this is already a pretty heavy load and there are two more items in my outline to get to! -- thus, the main risk is that I'll have too much to do -- and the main hope is that I will be able to "crowdsource" a fairly significant portion of these deliverables -- which doesn't mean I'll have zero work to do, for sure, but rather, I'll have to find my own part of the above, and make them all as accessible to others as possible -- if not everything gets done, I'll have to document why the choices I made lead in the direction of the greatest overall contribution.</li>
<li>(a) Many academic projects are successful precisely as academic projects, which explicitly means that they do not have to be game-changers or have a major "real world" impact -- and that is perfectly fine, but I'm interested in studying how innovations can be game-changes and looking at where real world impact comes from -- in fact, sustainability is really the baseline for "success" in this sort of investigation -- more broadly construed, things like "sustainable growth" and "sustainable development" (even if potentially in conflict with one another!) are both important in an ecological sense -- if we can understand even one small part of how that works, it could be very important!; (b) I've already developed the related notion of "paragogy" as a theory of peer-produced learning, and this will continue to be developed in a series of studies with real learners, and more on the large scale, throughout the productive aspects of the work I have planned; (c) there is a lot going on in this space (see the Wikimedia Foundation's mission statement) and I am concerned that despite the years I've spent working on this sort of issue myself, it is still a huge uphill battle -- accordingly I think the major risk is that of not getting 'in the loop' with the right people, or, vice versa, not getting them into my loop -- and another higher-order risk is that I could run around trying to do social networking all the time and not put enough energy into the semantic adaptivity! -- the solution to this problem is to do what I can to make my own engagement sustainable (at least for the duration of this project).</li>
<li>(a) People always learn in a social context but all too often this isn't explicitly acknowledged in the development and analysis of the learning materials -- here the participants are responsible for everything involved with the system, including learning and learning about learning -- system developers will have to improve our understanding of learning in order to support it better (or at all), and, in particular, we will have to do everything very explicitly (an "interactive textbook" is very different from a "textbook); (b) the main set of deliverables here are recommendation systems that work with interactive problem sets, as well as tools for authoring problem sets and stitching together curricula -- I also plan to set up tools to support interaction with tutors; (c) the worst case scenario is that no one uses the system so we don't get any data -- but a worst case scenario isn't a particularly realistic "risk" -- what's more likely is that the results won't be comparable to results from mainstream education (which is only natural given that the project will develop in only 2 years with very limited resources) -- this means that we need to find appropriate measures of "success" and show a trajectory for future growth/development.</li>
</ol>
<p>That seems good enough for a rough outline.&nbsp; Thanks Cloudworks!&nbsp; Oh, and I hope I can look forward to comments :)</p>    </div>
