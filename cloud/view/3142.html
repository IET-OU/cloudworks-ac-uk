        <p>One of the striking things to come out of the MOTILL Project was the apparent lack of any coherent ethical guidance with respect to the use of mobile devices for teaching and learning.&nbsp; The practicioners I interviewed all brought this up as an area where guidance is crucially needed.</p>
<p>Much of the existing work that has been done in this area concerns research ethics and the ways in which one might research mobile learning in an ethical way.&nbsp; This is certainly something that I'm interested in, but it seems more innovative to me to expand the boundaries of the investigation beyond teaching and learning to look at the impact of communications technologies on social interaction more generally construed, on (inter-)subjectivity, and on processes of norm-formation and social mores.</p>
<p>I apreciate that this might take the project somewhat outside of the IET purview.&nbsp; The challenge of understanding the wider ethical ramifications of modern technologies is undoubtedly one which educational technologists should address.</p>
<p>I have two lines of inquiry in mind at the moment.&nbsp; Firstly, and drawing on my PhD research, would be a more general account of the relationship between technology and autonomy arising from the Frankfurt School tradition in critical theory.&nbsp; This will provide an initial framework for showing where some of the ethical considerations specific to mobile technologes might arise, and also has the virtue of allowing me to draw parallels and other links with pedagogies which emphasize the autonomy of the learner.&nbsp; I am also interested in drawing on Heidegger's later philosophy of technology to flesh out the kind of philosophical worries associated with the advance of technologies.</p>
<p>Obvioulsy, this might seem a little philosophy heavy for TEL, and I am keen to be quite explicit about the link to teaching and learning.</p>
<p>One realistic output might be a 'tool-kit' for practitioners with a bit of ethical guidance and ten principles to think about.&nbsp; It might even be worth looking up the relevant legislation and sticking that in there too!</p>
<p>I welcome any thoughts or reflections you may have to offer.</p>    </div>

			<p>Here's a way of construing ethics for mobile learning which may be a bit more accessible:</p>
<p>Here are three kinds of ethical question which (very) broadly illustrate the different kinds of questions an ethicist might ask, and how these relate to m-learning.&nbsp; They are based on the three main types of moral philosophy (though there are others).</p>
<p>A DEONTOLOGICAL (literally, the 'science of duty') approach to morality would emphasise the role of moral duties and obligations.&nbsp; Questions of this kind might focus on the behaviour expected of teachers and learners in mobile learning environments.</p>
<p>A CONSEQUENTIALIST meta-ethics assess the 'rightness' or 'wrongness' of actions in terms of their consequences (or intended consequences).&nbsp; Utilitarianism is the most common form of consequentialism.&nbsp; Consequentialism can be useful when comparing the likely results of different courses of action.&nbsp; In the case of mobile learning, a consequentialist analysis might try to elaborate the full implications that could result from the appropriate or inappropriate uses of mobile technology in teaching and learning contexts.</p>
<p>A VIRTUE ETHICS approach focuses upon the desirability of traits and consequences:&nbsp; virtue ethicists believe that ethics is about cultivating the kind of traits and habits that contribute to a good or flourshing life.&nbsp; In a mobile learning context, we might speak about the kinds of good habits teachers and learners should aspire to develop, and the qualities of a 'good' mobile learner.</p>
<p>It should be noted that each position has relative strengths and weaknesses, and most philosophers think that some sort of combination and refinement of these basic meta-ethical positions:&nbsp; to try and preserve as many of the advantages of each, as it were.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I think I want to suggest is that these frameworks for reconstructing and understanding ethics can bring clarity and focus to the ethical problems and dilemmas faced by educators using mobile learning.</p>
<p>I'd also like to focus on some real-life examples, both to stop the piece being too abstract and to show how an understanding of basic ethical positions can inform and guide practioners.&nbsp; If anyone knows of some good examples of problems that have come up in the past, I'd love to hear them.</p>
<p>I'm going to add some links that explain the terminology.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

                   <p>Smith Nash's podcast (linked right) mentions Utilitarianism.&nbsp; The kind of Utilitarianism she describes would be properly described as a form of 'negative' Utilitarianism since it takes minimising suffering or discomfort to be the end of ethics.</p>
<p>One reason to think that this is inadequate as an ethical principle is that it is incapable of conceiving of increasing pleasure (utility) as a good in and of itself.</p>
<p>I think Smith Nash really has something more like a precautionary principle in mind.&nbsp; But if that's so, there could be severe implications in terms of stifling innovative or creative research.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks Rob, this is very useful. For me it creates a connection to the study of mobiles and mobilities (slight difference in focus and granularity) that explores the social impact of personal mobiles devices (social including global, economic, anthopological, cultural, seldom educational and seldom ethical), of personal mobile connected and of mobility in various other sense.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi John - I'm glad that you get a sense of how the issues surrounding mobile learning tie up with much broader issues about the nature of social life and personal behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My feelings about the best way of framing the issues have developed quite a bit since I first wrote this outline. I don't think that radical new ways of approaching ethics are needed, but I do think that we need an improved inventory or taxonomy of the learning scenarios where the use of mobile technologies and their ethical use needs to be thought about.</p>

                   <p>Think I'd agree in principle .... my concern is to get communities (lay communities, technical communities, professional communities,&nbsp;whatever) discussing this stuff in the terms in which they understand it, starting from&nbsp;where they are (and I am!)</p>        </div>

                   <p>Yes, of course - we have to work within the frameworks and expectations that people already know.&nbsp; But what if those frameworks don't allow for adequately phrasing or capturing the crucial issues?&nbsp; If the change that's coming is sufficiently radical, those frameworks and expectations themselves may need to evolve...</p>
<p>When I was asking practicioners (elsewhere) for examples of what they saw as ethical issues pertaining to mobile learning, most of them seemed to think that there were no such issues!&nbsp; Or, at least, that there were issues of research ethic but that's all there is to be said.&nbsp; So it definitely seems to me that a new kind of paradigm for understanding the ethical issues relating to mobile learning is needed.</p>        </div>

                   <p>The idea that ethics needs to start from where the person or people are standing seems useful to me. For it is not only the impact of a (mobile) device, or the research ethics, but I feel that with the global human appearing, ethics (like the term human rights) can have different definitions, and thus different types of meaning.</p>
<p>I remember telling a friend that I was not sure whether introducing a smartphone for learning was a good solution to address students in developing countries (although I was involved in a project that did such thing at the time). Then he told me that if I was choosing for 'them', I was making an unethical choice in that moment, for I was not asking them. Not being in favor of consumer oriented societies, I still was not sure. But then he asked me: why do the have's decide what the have not's should or should not be exposed to?</p>
<p>So, now I feel that ethics is not always clearly defined, or has not the same meaning to the complete group that will discuss that term.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks Inge</p>
<p>When i talked in terms of starting from where people are, I was thinking as a teacher, of giving people, in this case researchers and practitioners, a meaningful context and their own examples in which to discuss ethical issues.</p>
<p>Your example is drawn from 'development' - many many ethical dilemmas come from working in the 'developing' regions of the world, due i think partly because of the enormous differentials in perceived power and authority between 'us' &amp; 'them'.</p>
<p>I was involved in a very good workshop in Uppsala in October with Andy Dearden, Niall Winters and Susan Dray (amongst others) exploring some of this in the m4d context.</p>
<p>Material may still be online.</p>
<p>One of my concerns at the moment is to find ways to take people's accounts of ethical issues into the public domain in an ethical and methodologically sound way</p>

                   <p>Ignatia -</p>
<p>The fact that ethical concepts can be quite slippery and difficult to pin down really emphasises the importance of having a clear and systematic way of approaching and resolving ethical issues.</p>
<p>In the case of making decisions for others:&nbsp; it doesn't follow that if I act against somebody else's wishes I am acting immorally.&nbsp; I may even be acting in their own best interests.&nbsp; But I think your point is that they should be the ones to decide for themselves how their interests would best be served:&nbsp; that their autonomy is valuable of itself. I would agree with this view, though only if certain other conditions pertain.&nbsp; For example, we need to know (i) that said parties are capable of acting autonomously and (2) that they use this autonomy responsibly or for the best.&nbsp; We don't think of ourselves as acting immorally if, for example, we tell a child that they cannot play with knives.&nbsp; The issue is whether we should take a similarly condescending attitude towards individuals or institutions in the developing world... it depends on the situation, I suppose.&nbsp; But I wouldn't say that failure to recognise autonomy is always and necessarily wrong.</p>        </div>
