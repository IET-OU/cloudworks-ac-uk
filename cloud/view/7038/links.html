        <h2>Week 1</h2>
<h3>13 January 2013</h3>
<p>This is my first day of taking part in the course.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have managed to spare a bit time to <strong>create my profile in Couldworks</strong>.&nbsp; The next step is to catch up with more conversations on Google discussion page and clouds created by the course mates.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarise the first day: &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>confusing, exciting and demanding</strong></p>
<p>Initially it was a bit confusing with how and where to start &ndash; the course page, Google discussion or cloudworks; then I got excited to see the active participation; now I realise that the course seems pretty demanding by looking at the amount of reading and user generated content.</p>
<p>:-) Happy MOOC :-)</p>    </div>

			<h3><strong>12 January 2013 - Day 2 </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Presentation: <a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course/week-1/intro2ld" rel="nofollow">Introduction to learning design</a></strong></p>
<h3>What did I learn from the presentation?</h3>
<p>Although I have been working with academics to design 'learning environment' for many years, I have not had the chance to learn about 'learning design'.&nbsp; My understanding of 'learning design' as a concept is still rather vague. Your presentation provided a comprehensive overview of learning design.&nbsp; With different ideas/understandings/perspectives buzzing in my head, I would say that these are still new information.&nbsp; Hope that reading others' posts and joining the debate will help to turn the information to knowledge of my own. <br /><br /></p>
<h3>What do I agree with or disagree with?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>As I am still digesting the the points in your presentation,&nbsp; here are just a few initial thoughts and questions. Your presentation makes me ask questions and reflect on my previous knowledge. I guess this may be the power of 'learning design'.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"...with its big lecture halls, planned as venue where information would be imparted into students in the sense of filling a empty vessel will become obsolete. The </em><strong><em>new</em></strong><em> task of the university and its faculty will be to teach how to collect, select, organize and criticize information thus turning it into knowledge. "&nbsp;</em> - Elkan Y. and Klopper H</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">I am not sure how it can be said as 'new' task. <em>"Collect, select, organize and criticize information": </em>hasn't this always been one of the tasks of the university even before computer was invented?&nbsp; Teachers provide reading list. Students seek and select information from the books. Then information is organised and criticized in an essay.</p>
<ul>
<li>I totally agree that the big picture faced by the university makes it even more critical to clarify the purpose of education and the role of the university.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>"everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations to desired ones"&nbsp; </em>- Simon <br />It is important to evaluate the existing situations before necessary changes are introduced.&nbsp; This becomes even more important when resources are limited.&nbsp; 'Desired ones': it is necessary to get the end users to be involved as they are the real judges.&nbsp;</li>
<li>"a mutual learning process between users and designers": this is a nice one as it&nbsp; stresses the importance of 'people'. I believe that 'people' ought to be the central point of 'learning design'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p><em>"how to represent teaching practice from a technical perspective in the development and delivery of online learning environment; how to represent teaching practice in appropriate form to enable teachers to share ideas about innovative online pedagogy and think about the process of design."&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>I agree with this as it covers both technical and pedagogical aspects.</p>
</li>
<li>Question: how do you understand 'learning development'? How is it related to learning design?</li>
<li>Question: several definitions of &lsquo;Learning design&rsquo; seem indicating that 'learning design' is introduced to improve teaching and learning in the new environment where computer is used.&nbsp; I guess that &lsquo;learning design&rsquo; can be used in any learning and teaching environment, right?</li>
</ul>
<h3>How is it relevant to your project?</h3>
<p>I have not decided a particular project yet.&nbsp; <br /><br />My job is to support academics in using appropriate technologies to support their teaching by helping them to explore, select, evaluate and use technologies.&nbsp; <br /><br />Therefore everything in this course will help me do a better job.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<h2>Week 2</h2>
<p>20<sup>th</sup> Jan&nbsp; - a rather late start of week 2 as I have caught cold on Friday and been feeling pretty bad L.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of work needs to be done to catch up.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>contextualise&nbsp;my learning design project by developing a rough scenario</li>
<li>share my scenario via Cloudworks and Google+ with other team members and gain feedback</li>
<li>Based on the feedback from others,&nbsp; improve the scenario</li>
<li>Reflect on the importance of context for learning design</li>
<li>Try to understand different contextual approaches to learning design</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assessment &amp; Evaluation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Compare my initial scenario with the final design plan for my project at the end of week to see what changes that I have made and what I have learnt during the week</li>
<li>Summarise and reflect on if and how what I learnt during the week help me better design my project</li>
</ul>
