<p align="center"><em>'matching has been made more subtle with personal-construct thinking calling on significant memories of past experience - but it's still psychological matching'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'a culture is about the beliefs values &amp; expectations that get embedded in memory'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>'national governments increasingly treat the business world as the favoured providers of careers information &amp; education-based career events &amp; "inspiring" visits to work places'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'some careers workers &amp; educators accept the claims of commerce - some see them as a negation of independence &amp; of their reason for joining their profession'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>a backstory is necessary to independent thinking - it explains longer-term causes of shorter-term events - for example why the 11+ was rejected - or what it is about being Welsh that explains it's people's feeling for education'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'skilful news management using digital techniques can re-write and even erase backstories'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'much of what is important to any backstory is first realised and acted-on locally - that is a starting point for help - but not a finishing point'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'enclaves locate people where they live &amp; learn - they may be ready to disclose to insiders - but they may also resist invasion by outsiders - among their "outsiders" may be careers workers'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'while national governments are responsive to private-sector capture cities &amp; their hinterlands are proving more able to propose developments that citizens can recognise as about their lives - they engage with the proposals &amp; can bring meaningful &amp; relevant suggestions'</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>'some people's experience &amp; memories have convinced them that their best hope lies with people they can trust on ventures that will pay-off - whether legal or not'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'these processes are not like decision making - they are more like working out what from their past to hold onto - out of respect &amp; love for their upbringing - &amp; what from their past they will let go - out of being ready for their future'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>'the sources of careers thinking are probabilistic mathematics &amp; history &amp; geography &amp; culture studies &amp; life sciences - which are the disciplines of mainstream curriculum'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'it doesn't matter what subjects mainstream educators work on - their usefulness is their ability to enable students to ask key questions and recognise useful answers'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
