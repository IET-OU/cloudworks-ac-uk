    <div class="user-entry">

        <p><strong>Readability</strong></p>
<p>The language in these representations was quite laboured, and at times, felt as though something had been lost in translation. &nbsp;It really needs editing to cut out basic language errors and avoid confusion or misunderstanding. On first reading, neither of my choices made much sense to me then I carried out research on Youtube and the &lsquo;models&rsquo; dedicated l and d sites which provided a great deal more clarity.</p>
<p><strong>ISiS and Scenedit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Expressiveness</strong></p>
<p>The ISiS model was presented clearly in terms of its three operational dimensions in the design process: Intention, Strategy and interactional Situation (Tactical). The explanation expanded the dimensions further, identifying the components that relate to Strategy and Situation. This was then made more accessible through screenshots from Scenedit.</p>
<p>The&nbsp; Scenedit tool has been created to implement ISiS&rsquo; three dimensions and when utilised it is able to provide visual descriptions of the design process&hellip;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- all of which I thought I understood until I consulted the example diagram where&hellip;</p>
<p>the <em>legend</em> attributed to figure 1 identified &lsquo;a rectangle for a strategy&rsquo; and a rounded rectangle as &lsquo;an Intention&rsquo;.</p>
<p>but the pictorial diagram seemed to define the rectangles the opposite way round the other way round. (I tried to post an illustration of this but 'cloudworks' would not allow it!)</p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Utility</strong></p>
<p>What was particularly useful was the visual depiction of the &lsquo;interactional Situation&rsquo;, highlighting the components and the speed with which one could gain an overview of a scenario without needing to consult a written document. Assuming that the &lsquo;legend&rsquo; was more comprehensive, Scenedit would be even more useful.</p>
<p><strong>Are they adequate for expressing your design? </strong></p>
<p>My design is relatively straightforward, requiring few additional tools and resources. The visual breakdown of the components would certainly provide a useful high level picture of how the programme would roll out. The scenedit tool would probably save time as I became familiar with it and could utilise all its potential.</p>
<p><strong>What would be the benefits of using these representations for your design? Explain.</strong></p>
<p>It probably forces me to go back to basics and question some of the assumptions that I now make when designing programmes or courses. When designing collaboratively there is a lot to be gained from this type of tool which would enable the designer to move beyond their own limited experience and cognitive framework.</p>
<p><strong>Web collage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Expressiveness</strong></p>
<p>This representation was very challenging, particularly the coherency of the language.&nbsp; By far one of the more complex models, it highlights how it can be used superficially through the <em>healthy eating</em> examples, but does emphasise that the scenario only takes &lsquo;advantage of some of the features of Web Collage.&rsquo; This suggests that there are plenty more features which have been omitted because of the limitations of this example.</p>
<p>In its attempt to highlight the components of Web Collage, it focuses on specifics from the scenario. Thus we jump from Lesson 1 and 2 to Lesson 5.</p>
<p>The screenshots of Web Collage in action, go some way to making the model more accessible. It is clear that there is an overview chart which highlights the flow of the programme. Each phase focuses in greater detail, the learner composition (including identities), the learning objectives and supporting learner activities. This can be made explicit through the &lsquo;Pyramid&rsquo; tool. The diagram explanation seemed to omit crucial information which was evident pictorially in the diagram.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Utility</strong></p>
<p>I felt that the benefits of this model reside in its capacity to link in with LMS and Moodle. It still has limited functionality, such as identifying the use of resources or timings of activities. The flow chart linking in with the phases does help to acquire a high level view of the scenario, whilst appreciating how the groups and individual work are conducted within each phase. There are, however, too many shortcomings to the model.</p>
<p><strong>Are they adequate for expressing your design? </strong></p>
<p>As above, too much limitation and unknowns at the moment to make a qualified decision.</p>
<p><strong>What would be the benefits of using these representations for your design?</strong> <strong>Explain.</strong></p>
<p>The collaborative capacity and the LMS connection, I am impressed with the&nbsp; overview chart and the pyramid tool. Again, I would need to spend more time experiencing the tool before really identifying the use I could make from it.</p>    </div>
