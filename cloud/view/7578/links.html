        <p align="center"><strong>Carolyn&rsquo;s scenario for the development of a webinar design guide </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>(time taken: 40 minutes)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Brainstorm components of your scenario</strong></p>
<div align="center"><hr align="center" size="2" width="100%" /></div>
<p><br /><strong>Actors: </strong><em>(who is involved?) </em></p>
<p>Matteo and Emily are policy analysts. They write policies and reports for the government of Ontario and often give presentations and run training sessions about them.&nbsp; There has been a lot of community interest in a recent report about human rights, mental health and addictions.&nbsp; In fact, there has been so much interest that Matteo and Emily can&rsquo;t accommodate most of the training requests they are getting.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the training requests are coming from organizations that work in the mental health field, or who work with people with mental health issues.&nbsp; Interest has also been expressed by lawyers, not for profit organizations, healthcare workers, and employers. Matteo and Emily decide to run a webinar that people across the province can attend, to meet the need for training that they can&rsquo;t do in person.<br /><br /><strong>Goals:</strong><em> (why?) </em></p>
<p>Emily and Matteo want to train as many people as possible about the findings in the report, to meet the needs of the community and also to effect change for people with mental health and addiction issues.</p>
<p>The designer wants to ensure that the method of instruction is engaging and effective, since Emily and Matteo do not have a background in education or instructional design. <br /><br /><strong>Settings:</strong><em> (where &amp; when?) </em></p>
<p>The webinar will be run from a conference room at Emily and Matteo&rsquo;s workplace.&nbsp; All design work will also take place at the office.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Objects:</strong><em> (what things are involved?) </em></p>
<p>Adobe Connect software (already purchased), computers with microphones and speakers, internet connection, phone line, IT team (not an object!), prepared presentation, script, links, etc.<br /><br /><strong>Actions:</strong><em> &nbsp;(what do actors do?) </em></p>
<p>Emily and Matteo discuss their audience&rsquo;s needs with the designer. There will be between 75 and 100 participants.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a diverse audience, so the webinar will have to be broad-reaching yet engaging for everyone.&nbsp; Emily and Matteo provide the designer with the content they would like to discuss during the webinar. <br /><br /><strong>Events:</strong><em> (what happens to actors?) </em></p>
<p>The designer realizes that creating a custom webinar for each policy or report will be time consuming.&nbsp; A better option would be preparing a guide for policy analysts and her other colleagues on how to deliver an engaging and effective webinar.&nbsp; This step-by-step guide would need to take into account different scenarios, such as the length of the webinar, number of participants, type of audience (employers, members of the general public) etc.&nbsp; The designer figures that the best type of guide might be in a webinar format, so that Emily and Matteo get to participate in a webinar and experience it as audience members before delivering one.<br /><br /><strong>Results:</strong><em> (what is achieved?) </em><br /><br /></p>
<p>Using the designer&rsquo;s webinar guide, Matteo and Emily prepare and deliver their first webinar.&nbsp; The webinar is delivered live, but also recorded so that it can be posted on the website for those who missed it.&nbsp; They used their knowledge from the guide to illicit audience participation, and most audience members were actively engaged in the webinar.&nbsp; They were able to train the participants about the content of the report, and gain insight from participants about how it will be applied in their work.&nbsp; They get feedback from the participants, which is mainly positive.&nbsp; Constructive feedback will be used to further improve the webinar guide for the development of future training sessions.<br /><br /><strong>Your design: </strong><em>(what role does your design play?) </em></p>
<p>My colleagues are capable of developing a standard training webinar, based on their live training sessions. However, a live training session won&rsquo;t translate well into webinar format, especially for longer sessions.&nbsp; In addition, Emily and Matteo are not aware of the features available in webinar software, which can be used as alternative ways to engage learners.&nbsp; My team&rsquo;s design will help them put their training content into a webinar design a webinar that is interesting, interactive, engaging and meets their audience&rsquo;s learning needs.&nbsp; The webinar design guide can be used by anyone to design and develop a pedagogically sound webinar, using existing content.</p>    </div>
