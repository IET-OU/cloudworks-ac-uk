<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; Stephen Downes; EdSurge; eCampus News; World Bank; Forbes]</em></p>
<p>Google announced at last month&rsquo;s I/O conference that it will be designing curriculum for Nanodegree courses offered by Udacity, the first being a program in Android development.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-05-31-google-teams-with-udacity-to-offer-nanodegrees?utm_campaign=4d006060ef-Innovate+225-HIREEDU&utm_medium=email&utm_source=EdsurgeLive&utm_term=0_0f1ec25b60-4d006060ef-292151429" rel="nofollow">Android Nanodegree</a> will comprise six courses and is expected to take nine to 12 months to complete.&nbsp; It costs $200 per month, and top 50 students will be invited for a three-day career summit at Google's headquarters.</p>
<p>Matt Crosslin considers whether <a href="http://www.edugeekjournal.com/2015/05/25/what-if-the-problem-isnt-with-moocs-but-something-else/" rel="nofollow">MOOC retention problems relate to student motivation</a>.&nbsp; He notes that much of education relies on motivation that is predominantly extrinsic in nature (grades, credits, fees, gold stars, etc) whereas MOOCs tend to rely much more on intrinsic motivation.&nbsp; In other words, &ldquo;What if MOOCs are just a mirror that shows us the sociocultural problems we don&rsquo;t want to deal with in our system?&nbsp; What if the problem is not with the learners, but the way they have been programmed through the years?&nbsp; You can say MOOCs are failing because they lack sufficient &lsquo;student motivation&rsquo;, but what if it was actually the case that society has been failing for decades and MOOCs are just exposing this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Canadian researchers are digging beyond the headlines and analytics to discover much more about <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher-ed-beta/invisible-learners-taking-moocs" rel="nofollow">MOOC learners and learning experiences</a>.&nbsp; Through a series of interviews (70 so far), three initial findings have emerged that contradict the initial hope that MOOCs can help anyone, anywhere, anytime learners.&nbsp; Firstly, MOOC learners possess sophisticated study skills (e.g. note taking, investigating new or unfamiliar subject matter).&nbsp; A significant proportion also either live flexible lives that enable them to participate, or appear to be exceptional in their abilities to create time to study.&nbsp; Finally, many say that learning experiences are deeply emotional, with the potential to offer not just pleasure and appreciation but occasional anxiety and embarrassment as well.&nbsp; They believe these findings call into question, &ldquo;whether open courses, in their current form, are the democratizing forces they are sometimes depicted to be &ndash; and even whether &lsquo;educating a billion&rsquo; with MOOCs is a laudable goal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>EdCast has announced a new social media platform that allows people to post mini-MOOCs, or video snippets of educational content plus short text comments. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.ecampusnews.com/technologies/edcasting-edcast-mooc-989/" rel="nofollow">EdCasting</a> is a less formal version of online courses, and is akin to tweeting, &ldquo;with the difference being that each post is based on a video or link that can be described without being limited to 140 characters&rdquo;; however, there is no &lsquo;re-tweeting&rsquo;, meaning that content will not get diluted.&nbsp; The launch platform includes 10 channels ranging from entrepreneurship, architecture, robotics, technology, and health, filled with insights from over 100 &ldquo;globally renowned experts and influencers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With a population of 1.4bn, it&rsquo;s not surprising that the <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/education/moocs-china-are-growing" rel="nofollow">Chinese online education market</a> increased by 700% between 2013 and 2014 (compared to 9% in the US).&nbsp; Part of this growth includes MOOCs, and one of the Chinese government&rsquo;s goals is to train 13 million K-12 teachers on education technology skills in the next five years through MOOCs.</p>
<p>A new survey, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2015/06/10/moocs-emerge-as-disruptors-to-corporate-learning/" rel="nofollow">Leveraging MOOCs and Open Learning Assets in The Workplace</a>, sought the opinions of 222 heads of HR, Corporate Learning and Talent Management on the benefits and barriers, and the long term impact of MOOCs on corporate learning.&nbsp; Key findings are that MOOCs are seen as innovative and attractive (to staff and externals) but many companies want to go further and curate a wider range of open learning assets.&nbsp; Barriers to developing MOOCs include budget, technical and security issues, a lack of MOOC design skills among corporate learning professionals, and resistance amongst in-house L&amp;D professionals.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of Udemy&rsquo;s seven million students come from outside the US but the company has just raised $65 million in new funding to further expand its global presence.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-06-02-udemy-raises-65m-in-quest-to-grow-online-learning-marketplace-across-the-world" rel="nofollow">Udemy</a> currently offers 30,000 courses and those taught by its top 10 instructors generated $17 million in revenues, with between 25-97% of course fees distributed back to instructors.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coursetalk.com/" rel="nofollow">CourseTalk</a> site lets users find, rate and comment on MOOCs, and more than 74,000 user ratings for over 7,500 courses from 46 providers have now been analysed in <a href="https://d3q6qq2zt8nhwv.cloudfront.net/s/coursetalk/pdf/newco/What Reviews Divulge About Online Education.891195873352.pdf" rel="nofollow">What Reviews Divulge About Online Education</a>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not big on detail but the findings on pp3-9 give a succinct overview of what users are saying.&nbsp; To summarise: low rated courses (1-3 stars) are confusing, boring, outdated (or wrong) and predominantly free; whereas those scoring 4-5 stars are easy to navigate and digest, fun and interactive, flexible and charge a moderate cost.&nbsp; On average, paid courses were rated 1.4 stars higher than free courses.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/daphne-koller-on-the-future-of-online-education-1433532321" rel="nofollow">Daphne Koller</a>, &ldquo;If you put an instructor to sleep 300 years ago and woke him up in a classroom today, he&rsquo;ll say, Oh, I know exactly where I am&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; The Guardian; University World News]</em></p>
<p>A Channel 4 Dispatches investigation<strong> tonight at 8:00</strong> describes how <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/15/cheating-rife-in-uk-education-system-dispatches-investigation-shows" rel="nofollow">shady practices and in some cases outright fraud are woven into the fabric of UK education</a>.&nbsp; This includes, over the past four years, more than 58,000 undergraduates have been investigated by their universities for plagiarism, of whom 40,000 were disciplined, 12,000 had marks deducted and 400 were expelled or excluded from HE.</p>
<p>Some 46% of UK academics said they have been pressurised to mark students&rsquo; work generously, according to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/may/18/academics-under-pressure-to-bump-up-student-grades-guardian-survey-shows" rel="nofollow">a Guardian survey of university staff</a>, while 43% said they did not feel supported in their job and 37% did not believe teaching was valued by their institution.&nbsp; Nearly a third (31%) of women said they were worried that taking maternity leave would jeopardise their career progression and, among Russell Group staff members, 32% lacked faith in their vice-chancellor.</p>
<p>New Universities and Science Minister, Jo Johnson, is behind a crackdown on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33062052" rel="nofollow">190 bogus universities that are known to be offering fake degree certificates</a> in order to, &ldquo;protect the reputation of the UK as a provider of high-quality education&rdquo;. &nbsp;After a BBC investigation last year found fake University of Kent degree certificates on sale online for &pound;500, Radio Kent discovered a website in China selling degree certificates from dozens of UK universities and, in the first quarter of 2015 alone, Higher Education Degree Datacheck (HEDD) added 42 bogus institutions to their database.</p>
<p>The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills faces cuts of &pound;450m, with the Treasury saying that this will include <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33014472" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;savings in higher education and further education budgets&rdquo;</a>, but the Department for Education has indicated that this will include savings based on underspends in existing budgets, rather than cuts.&nbsp; The savings in education spending were announced by the Treasury as part of a &pound;4.5bn package to reduce public debt.</p>
<p>A new report from PwC, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20150521093111718" rel="nofollow">London Calling: International students&rsquo; contribution to Britain&rsquo;s economic growth</a>, estimates that international students in London are contributing &pound;1.32bn on fees to the UK economy, &pound;1.36bn on living costs and a further &pound;121m from visiting friends and families.&nbsp; London has &ldquo;more world-class universities than any other city in the world&rdquo; and as the &ldquo;most popular city in the world for international students&rdquo;, hosts 40,000 from continental Europe and 67,000 from the rest of the world.&nbsp; More than one in five of the 310,000 international students in the UK studies at a London university and 18% of students in London are international, representing 39% of the total fee income of London&rsquo;s universities and supporting an estimated 70,000 jobs in the capital.</p>

<p><strong>Students 'Cannot Multi-Task With Mobiles And Study'</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; The Guardian; The Telegraph]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33047927" rel="nofollow">Mobile Phones in the Classroom: Examining the Effects of Texting, Twitter, and Message Content on Student Learning</a> reports on a series of tests conducted with 145 undergraduates to investigate how well they coped with multiple tasks such as watching a lecture on a video and then taking notes and answering questions, while facing a series of interruptions on their internet-connected mobile phones.&nbsp; Perhaps not surprisingly, the researchers found that those sending and receiving messages while studying scored lower test results and were less effective at tasks such as note taking.&nbsp; They described an effect where students are, &ldquo;physically present, yet mentally preoccupied by non-course-related material on their mobile devices.&rdquo;&nbsp; Last month, an LSE study found that schools in four English cities which <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/may/16/schools-mobile-phones-academic-results" rel="nofollow">banned phones saw test scores increased</a> by more than 6%.</p>
<p>But research from Miami University suggests <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11660908/Tweeting-could-help-children-focus-in-class-study-says.html" rel="nofollow">using phones in class could actually be beneficial</a>, provided students stay on topic.&nbsp; Students used mobile devices to respond to messages that were relevant to classroom material, revealing a direct relationship between note taking and engaging in social media discussions: &ldquo;Even if students are responding to messages from others, if that activity is related to class content, those students will take better-quality notes than students responding to unrelated content.&rdquo;&nbsp; Researchers believe this is because, &ldquo;the related content allows students to engage in behaviours similar to note-taking: focusing on the material at hand, processing that material to determine key parts, and recording the important information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ofcom reports that <a href="http://media.ofcom.org.uk/news/2015/five-years-of-tablets/" rel="nofollow">54% of UK households now have a tablet</a>, up from just 2% in 2011. &nbsp;This proportion rises to 64% among people aged 35-54 and a further 21% of households currently without a tablet said they were likely to get one within the next 12 months.&nbsp; Many households own multiple tablets, with 34% of kids aged 5-15 having their own device and 11% of 3-4 year olds now have their own tablet to keep them entertained.</p>

<p><strong>Copyright Changes Afoot?</strong></p>

<p>Current <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jun/09/call-to-unlock-a-treasure-chest-of-hidden-research-data" rel="nofollow">copyright legislation limits the amount of data that researchers can &ldquo;mine&rdquo;</a> &ndash; using a computer to scan for facts and data within thousands of relevant articles to discover connections &shy;&shy;&ndash; because the process requires the mining program to download and copy content first before scanning it.&nbsp; Not surprisingly publishers are resisting any changes to laws in case content is used under the pretence of text mining but then re-published and charged for elsewhere.&nbsp; However, the EU is consulting this summer with a view to updating its 2001 copyright laws to better suit the digital age, thus giving researchers greater access to published work.</p>
<p>But every day, millions of Europeans may be unwittingly breaking copyright law. &nbsp;Due to an obscure rule known as <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org.uk/2015/06/uk-at-risk-of-losing-freedom-of-panorama/" rel="nofollow">Freedom of Panorama</a>, those innocent snapshots of modern buildings you&rsquo;ve taken in countries such as France and Belgium are breaches of copyright. &nbsp;While the UK does have this freedom, we may be at risk of losing it in the ongoing copyright reform negotiations taking place in the European Parliament.</p>
