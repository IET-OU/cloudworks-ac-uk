        <p>Seven participants from within the 'core group' contributed to this online discussion, namely, Prof Bill Law, Prof. Rachel Mulvey, Linda Taylor, Kay Gregory, Jo Hutchinson, Dr Deirdre Hughes and Prof. Jenny Bimrose. Apologies were received from Dr Hazel Reid, Dr Robin Mellors, Clare Nix, Tim Warren, Valerie Metcalfe&nbsp;and Kay Gregory.</p>
<p>The agenda covered the following items:</p>
<p><strong>Review and assessment of online communications:</strong> Generally speaking this was thought to be working well. The conferencing arrangement&nbsp;is fairly new to most people therefore the group is learning as they go along.&nbsp; Two specific issues were discussed in relation to techincal improvement (i) Cloudworks does currently show how recently 'hits' occurred and (ii) whilst the RSS feed facility is available the Group has yet to fully connect this. Bill agreed to link dorect with OU colleagues to address these issues and will provide an update in due course. The content of the dedicated Careers Innovation Group website is rapidly expanding.</p>
<p><strong>Update on ESRC Seminar Series 'Reframing service delivery: professional practices and professional identities in UK careers work' -</strong> The first highly successful ESRC seminar was held on 1/12/11 at the University East Of London <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/ier/research/semcomprfs" rel="nofollow">http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/ier/research/semcomprfs</a>&nbsp; Policy makers and other attendees showed a keen interest in the work of the Careers Innovation Group. Jenny indicated that it will be essential to attract interest and responses to the key issues raised via the CIG website as officials had agreed to visit the site on a regular basis.&nbsp; It was noted that&nbsp;highly relevant&nbsp;innovation ideas emerged from this seminar.</p>
<p>The second ESRC seminar will take place in March 2011 at the University of Glamorgan, Wales. Date to be confirmed - watch this space! The chosen &nbsp;topic for discussion&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;'Professional associations: exploring the &lsquo;Balkanisation&rsquo; of careers guidance, the role of associations and their inter-relationships.</em>' Jenny Bimrose&nbsp;requested potential speakers for the seminar. It was agreed that names and &nbsp;contacts should be forwarded to her&nbsp;via email: <a href="mailto:jenny.bimrose@warwick.ac.uk" rel="nofollow">jenny.bimrose@warwick.ac.uk</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The official lauch of the Careers Innovation Group</strong> took place at the Europa Hotel in Belfast on 3-5th November 2010, as part of the ICG Annual Careers Summit and Conference. Ministers were present when the Careers Innovation Group was launched at the conference and they seemed impressed with the work undertaken to date. Most importantly, practitioners and managers in attendance also commented on the necessity for this work to further develop and expand. It was agreed that further promotion and profiling of Careers Innovation group was required. Linda agreed to promote this via the ACEG Newsletter. Rachel agreed to do the same via a pan-European ERASMUS project, which is currently reviewing professional qualifiactions. She mentioned the possibility of creating an innovation strand that could link to UK developments.</p>
<p><strong>Update on the Careers Profession Alliance developments:&nbsp; </strong>Deirdre gave a brief overview of significant developments such as (i) Ruth Spellman was offically appointed Chair of the Careers Profession Alliance w/c 23/11/10. A Press Release statement is currently being prepared to widely publicise this; (ii) Ongoing discussions have taken place with DBIS and DfE officials to discuss the plan for implementing key recommendations from the Careers Profession Taskforce. On 23/11/10 the Alliance was invited to submit a costed proposal by 10/12/10 with an expected result by earlyJanuary 2011 at the very latest; (iii) a Programme Manager job description and person specification has been prepared and advertised through the Alliance networks; (iv) the Chair of the CPA host the first formal meeting in her new role on 18/1/11 (the Programme Manager should hopefully be appointed by then to oversee and co-ordinate the delivery of the Work Programme including common professional standards, a common careers profession framework, initial training for careers professionals, CPD and a national kitemark for CEIAG); (v) a common code of ethical principles has been development and is currently in draft format. The ICG joint ethics and standards and professional development committees have this item table for discussion on 13/1/11. There may be some scope for the CPA to link directly into the work of this group through website activities.</p>
<p><strong>Serious concerns about the demise of Conexions and inevitable impact on innovation:</strong> It was agreed that &nbsp;Deirdre will upload any useful papers on trade union responses to this critical issue. In particular, she will contact UNISON and the TUC to help make them aware of the Careers Innovation Group's work. A key question for the group is whether it is now&nbsp;time to prepare a customised template that can be used to communicate with interested parties on the key factors impacting on careers innovation in the UK? Responses to this suggestion welcomed.</p>
<p><strong>The next online meeting is scheduled on 22/3/11 as outlined above</strong>. At this meeting, plans will be made for a more detailed&nbsp;programme of online and face to face activity for 2011-2012.</p>
<p>Jenny Bimrose thanked everyone who participated online for their willingness to test out the technology and their invaluable contribution of ideasa nd content rich materials.</p>
<p>All members are strongly encouraged to upload, review and comment on materials to help ensure the success of online communications.</p>    </div>
