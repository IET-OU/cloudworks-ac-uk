<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Independent; The Guardian; The Telegraph; Wonkhe]</em></p>
<p>Ucas said it is &ldquo;extremely concerned&rdquo; by figures which show that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/uk-black-students-university-applications-investigation-more-likely-ucas-figures-nus-labour-a8314496.html" rel="nofollow">black students seeking a place at university</a> are 21 times more likely to have their applications investigated for suspected false or missing information than their white counterparts.&nbsp; Ucas&rsquo;s own figures show that one in every 102 applications from black applicants was investigated compared to just one in every 2,146 from white British applicants, triggering accusations from Labour of &ldquo;institutional racism&rdquo; in the HE system and demands for urgent action to stamp out &ldquo;racial profiling&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A report last year by HEPI estimated that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/24/vice-chancellors-urge-action-eu-students-international-fees" rel="nofollow">European student numbers would drop</a> by as much as 60% post-Brexit and many universities are now drawing up lists of courses that could face closure and lobbying the government to save them by changing its policy on student fees.&nbsp; Although the number of European students studying in the UK has remained buoyant since the referendum (135,000 last year), it is expected to crash when Britain leaves the EU next year and fees for Europeans rise from UK to &lsquo;international&rsquo; levels of up to &pound;20,000 on some courses, with no access to a loan.</p>
<p>Fears of an <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/05/09/fears-brexodus-academics-britains-universities-myth-figures/" rel="nofollow">academic "Brexodus"</a> have been exposed as a myth after figures revealed that 25% more academics arrived in the UK than went home in 2017.&nbsp; In all 6,801, academics arrived from other EU countries to work in British universities in 2017 compared with 5,416 EU staff who left.&nbsp; Of the 116 universities who responded to an information request by The Spectator, 75 institutions were &lsquo;net gainers&rsquo;, 34 saw a net loss and seven had no overall change.</p>
<p>As OfS gets up and running, HEPI, together with the mentoring charity Brightside, has brought together 35 leading thinkers in the field of social mobility and education to jointly produce <a href="https://wonkhe.com/blogs/thinking-big-35-ideas-for-widening-access-to-higher-education" rel="nofollow">Reaching the parts of society universities have missed: A manifesto for the new Director of Fair Access and Participation</a>.&nbsp; The views therein are as diverse as the contributors &ndash; ranging from financial (maintenance grants; fee waivers) through to custom and practice (cease unconditional offers; end unpaid student and graduate internships).</p>

<p>In a blog post earlier this month entitled <a href="https://blog.edx.org/furthering-the-edx-mission" rel="nofollow">Furthering the edX Mission, Forging a Future Path</a>, the company states, &ldquo;We believe that we need to move toward a financial model that allows edX and our partners to achieve sustainability and we acknowledge that means moving away from our current model of offering virtually everything for free.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well it was fun while it lasted.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Leo, EdSurge; Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>According to research by Gartner, by 2022, nearly 80% of organisational skills will have to be reprioritised or revisited because of digital business transformation.&nbsp; This may help explain the acquisition by the UK&rsquo;s Learning Technologies Group &shy;&shy;- parent company of Leo Learning, gomo and others - of <a href="https://leolearning.com/news/leo-learning-welcomes-peoplefluent/" rel="nofollow">PeopleFluent</a>, a provider of cloud-based integrated talent solutions.&nbsp; The acquisition will provide LEO with access to PeopleFluent&rsquo;s talent management platform, workplace collaboration software, on-demand video technology, as well as the ability to manage and measure leadership development and coaching and mentoring.</p>
<p>Having overseen savage cuts and headline-grabbing divestments of what were previously regarded as core components of its business, Pearson boss John Fallon has moved the company from a $3.3bn loss in 2016 to a profit last year.&nbsp; EdSurge features an interview with Fallon in which he explains the shake up and its effects and speaks about the likely future for <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-04-17-what-s-next-for-pearson-not-buying-your-education-startup" rel="nofollow">a much more digital Pearson</a> that is more responsive to customer wants and needs: &ldquo;This is the Spotify generation. &nbsp;Students will pay for use. &nbsp;They don&rsquo;t want to buy to own, and they only want to pay to use things that are directly relevant to their course and their outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it seems Pearson are not alone in that thinking.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vitalsource-joins-with-mcgraw-hill-education-to-make-digital-course-materials-more-affordable-for-college-students-300626663.html" rel="nofollow">VitalSource is collaborating with McGraw-Hill Education</a> to ensure the latter&rsquo;s adaptive courseware is seamlessly available to students at more than 500 US institutions through VitalSource's "Inclusive Access" delivery method.</p>
<p>And another.&nbsp; Five years after filing for bankruptcy, Cengage is back, it&rsquo;s more digital and it&rsquo;s about to launch a new on-demand service called <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-04-24-in-move-to-unlimited-pricing-model-cengage-hopes-for-a-comeback" rel="nofollow">Cengage Unlimited</a> that gives students access to the complete collection of the company&rsquo;s online textbooks for about $120 a semester (or $180 a year).</p>
<p>There are also signs that publishers are responding to long-held claims that <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2018/05/01/publishers-race-reduce-costs-digital-textbooks" rel="nofollow">eTextbook purchase costs are too high</a>.&nbsp; Since 2016, the average price of eTextbooks on VitalSource has fallen from $56.36 to $38.65 (-31%); more specifically, the average maths eTextbook has decreased by almost 50%.&nbsp; Another US distributor, RedShelf, confirmed a similar price drop, averaging -26% since 2016.&nbsp; And is this because publishers are nice people?&nbsp; No, according to Redshelf&rsquo;s COO Tom Scotty, it&rsquo;s because they are desperate to capture market share.</p>

<p><strong>How Open University Works: An Insider&rsquo;s Perspective</strong></p>
<p><em>[Ian Blackham]</em></p>
<p>Class Central carries a piece by recent OU computer science graduate Manoel Cortes Mendez <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/open-university-insiders-perspective/" rel="nofollow">describing his OU study experience</a>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a long and detailed description, aimed at prospective (particularly US) students which paints a positive picture of the OU, its staff and its methods, &ldquo;from enrolment to graduation&rdquo;.&nbsp; It seems to be an accurate portrayal from his computing perspective, although the experiences of those in other subject areas may differ.&nbsp; For example, &ldquo;The OU remains a firm believer in traditional course material, which they&rsquo;ve been producing in-house since 1971 and is included in the course fee. &nbsp;So a few weeks before classes start, you&rsquo;ll receive a UK-stamped package containing textbooks, DVDs, USB drives, and sometimes, special equipment&rdquo;.&nbsp; Mendez was undoubtedly pleased with his OU experience and is now part-way through Georgia Tech&rsquo;s Online MSc in Computer Science.</p>

<p><strong>The Effects of Motivation on Online Students' Reading Behavioural Patterns</strong></p>
<p><em>[IRRODL]</em></p>
<p>The latest issue of <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/issue/view/92" rel="nofollow">IRRODL</a> contains its usual good and relevant mix of papers relating to open, online and distance learning, including one by Sun et al on <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2853/4630" rel="nofollow">the effects of motivation on online students' reading behavioural patterns</a>.&nbsp; In some respects it confirms the obvious &ndash; students with high reading duration (HD) tended to be more seriously engaged in learning activities and were less likely to fail to complete the unit test.&nbsp; However, the behaviours of students with low reading duration and low motivation (LDLM) and low reading duration but high motivation (LDHM) appeared quite similar, including a tendency, after passing the first test, to bypass the next content and quickly move onto the next test.&nbsp; However, further analysis revealed key differences in the effects of online multitasking reading, with LDHM students (who might equate to time poor OU students?) more easily able to switch back from multi-tasking to the learning materials and refocus their learning than those in the HD and LDLM groups.</p>

<p><strong>The State of Higher Education</strong></p>

<p><strong>Adult Students Prefer Online Programmes</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Gasp.&nbsp; Online learning programme provider Pearson offers a free report that shows that <a href="http://images.results.chronicle.com/Web/TheChronicleofHigherEducation/{fee1e24d-a375-47ed-8a80-50cd53b13520}_WorkingWithPartnersCreateProgramsAdultStudents_Explaliner_v6.pdf" rel="nofollow">adult students prefer online programmes</a>.&nbsp; Not only that but it seems that adult learning is a tricky area, beset by &ldquo;a dearth of data about their priorities and needs&rdquo; and so &ldquo;partnerships can be appealing, specifically with companies that serve as online program managers (OPMs)&rdquo;.&nbsp; Such as <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/products-services-institutions/online-program-management.html" rel="nofollow">Pearson</a>?</p>
<p>But is there any truth in the <a href="https://encoura.org/prove-opms-really-boost-enrollment/" rel="nofollow">claimed benefits of working with OPMs</a>?&nbsp; Research by Eduventures for the (US) National Research Center for College &amp; University Admissions (NRCCUA) suggests there is, and that institutions who partner with OPMs have seen online enrolment between 2012-16 increase significantly above that of peers: 43% vs 15% (UG) and 34% vs 23% (PG).&nbsp; BTW, don&rsquo;t let the graph title confuse you &ndash; it means &lsquo;autumn&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;decline&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Online Courses Don&rsquo;t Necessarily Cost Less</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>An online course is more than just a website, so although larger institutions may be able to deliver online courses for less than traditional ones, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-04-12-do-online-courses-really-save-money-a-new-study-explores-roi-for-colleges-and-students" rel="nofollow">not all providers have the infrastructure</a> or student base to allow real savings while maintaining high quality.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/02/17/study-challenges-cost-and-price-myths-online-educationhttps:/www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/02/17/study-challenges-cost-and-price-myths-online-education" rel="nofollow">For some, it actually costs more</a>.&nbsp; A recent study by Arizona State University, &ldquo;<a href="https://edplus.asu.edu/what-we-do/making-digital-learning-work" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Making Digital Learning Work</a>&rdquo;, compared the efforts and cost savings made by six US institutions.&nbsp; However, all six have made strategic efforts and invested in central units to support their endeavours, contributing to a reduced cost per credit hour.&nbsp; The question this raises is how different the findings would have been if the study had included small-players who deliver high-quality face-to-face programs but lack the ability to invest in an extensive online infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Too Much of the Wrong Support Can Impair Course Performance</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>A study from Pearson casts doubts over the benefits claimed by some educators of allowing students to master a topic by taking a test again and again until they do well.&nbsp; Externally audited, efficacy research about one of the company&rsquo;s apps (MyLab Math) shows a <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-05-02-pearson-efficacy-study-highlights-the-challenge-of-letting-students-retest" rel="nofollow">significant correlation between increased retesting and lower overall course performance</a>.&nbsp; Students on three different campuses of Arizona State University used MyLab Math to help build maths skills. &nbsp;They then use the QuizMe app and, if they don't demonstrate mastery, they are taken back to a &ldquo;study plan&rdquo; &ndash; but the data showed those taking the tests multiple times to get higher scores actually earned lower course grades in the end.&nbsp; Pearson&rsquo;s Emily Lai believes, &ldquo;one possible explanation could be that the lower-skilled learners were simply repeating those QuizMe activities over and over again until they were able to achieve a relatively high score even without fully mastering the concepts."</p>
<p>You might also think that giving students access to a platform containing <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/05/11/info-rich-course-planning-apps-may-lower-grades" rel="nofollow">information about the distribution of prior students&rsquo; grades</a>, the amount of study effort they reported, the percentage who dropped out and other information could all serve to improve performance &ndash; researchers from Stanford found this was not the case.&nbsp; Students, particularly new ones, who accessed the information saw a decline in their performance, with prior grade information having the greatest detrimental effect: seeing previous high scores &ldquo;may make students overconfident about the investment of work they need to do well&rdquo;.&nbsp; The researchers cautioned that universities will have to think hard about how the &ldquo;amount and form in which that information is provided enhances academic endeavour - or undermines it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Mixed Observations of an Online Education Report</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>Supporters and opponents of online education get their say on the findings of a glowing report on the online offerings by six institutions in the US. &nbsp;In the &gt;Inside Higher Ed article, the variation of opinions reflect the subjective nature of the topic, so it seems we are a long way from a consensus.</p>

<p><strong>Collaborative activities can work for online students</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>The physical distance between online students can be a barrier to group work, but with careful planning, facilitation and the right tools, students can overcome the challenge and form effective groups. &nbsp;Tactics to drive success vary, but <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2018/04/25/group-projects-online-classes-create-connections-and-challenge" rel="nofollow">building activities that reward participation through assessment</a> is one method of increasing engagement that has worked at the Chicago School of Professional Psychology.</p>

<p><strong>Linking learning to work and life gives students sense of value</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>A recent survey found that <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2018/04/04/when-learning-matches-work-and-life-students-appreciate-their-education-more.aspx" rel="nofollow">students who study courses directly related to their work are more likely to feel they received high-quality education</a>. &nbsp;They are also more likely to feel they received value for money. &nbsp;Relevance and the development of skills that are useful on a day-to-day basis are likely to play a part, but the results go further, linking these feelings with a sense of &lsquo;thriving&rsquo; and well-being.</p>

<p><strong>Can You Really Revise While Chatting Online?</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exam time and, just as every student knows it&rsquo;s absolutely okay to revise in parallel with music, TV and social media, so every parent knows it&rsquo;s absolutely not.&nbsp; So what does the research tell us?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tom Bennett, a teacher, parent and the government's adviser on behaviour in school, says <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43784091" rel="nofollow">it's a complete "myth" that teenagers can study while multi-tasking</a> between social media and online entertainment.&nbsp; Revision needs focus and concentration, he says, but this is going to be scuppered by the relentless, attention-seeking demands of social media as users feel the need to constantly check for updates and responses.&nbsp; An MIT study of pupils in the Boston area found "a link between greater media multi-tasking and worse academic outcomes in adolescents".&nbsp; And academics also found similar results when they looked at achievement in schools in England that had banned mobile phones and so created at least part of the day away from messaging and social media, concluding that "not only does pupil achievement improve as a result of a ban, but also that low achieving and low income pupils gain the most".</p>
<p>However, Dr Sandra Leaton Gray, senior lecturer in education at the UCL Institute of Education, says it's a mistake for parents to barge in and demand that devices are switched off.&nbsp; "The clever way round it is to say, 'How are things going online?' Ask them if they're being distracted".&nbsp; Good luck with that.</p>

<p>An Arizona State University <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2018/04/12/research-online-courses-associated-with-improved-retention-access.aspx" rel="nofollow">study has linked online courses with higher rates of retention and graduation</a>. &nbsp;In the study of six US institutions where students have the choice of online, blended or face-to-face teaching, results have also shown earlier finishes. &nbsp;However, other factors may contribute to these findings&mdash;on average, <a href="https://mibiz.com/item/25804-tech-savvy-students-drive-higher-ed-to-teach-in-new-ways" rel="nofollow">online students tend to be older</a> than their campus-based counterparts.</p>

<p><strong>Testing the Learning-by-Teaching Effect</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS]</em></p>
<p>Researchers have investigated the theory that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3410" rel="nofollow">teaching improves the teacher&rsquo;s learning</a> because it compels the teacher to retrieve what they&rsquo;ve previously studied.&nbsp; Volunteer students (N= 124) studied material about soundwaves, after which they were divided into four groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Being filmed alone while they delivered a lesson on the study material without notes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching verbatim from a set script</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing down all they could remember from the material</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completing multiplication arithmetic (control group)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The participants were subjected to a surprise test one week later in which Groups 1 and 3 were found to exhibit comparable levels of comprehension, as per the researchers&rsquo; expectations, outperforming those in groups 2 and 4.&nbsp; The researchers said their results suggest that &ldquo;the benefits of the learning-by-teaching strategy are attributable to retrieval practice; that is, the robust learning-by-teaching strategy works but only when the teaching involves retrieving the taught materials.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lack of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/us/oxford-comma-maine.html" rel="nofollow">an Oxford comma</a> cost a US dairy company $4m in a legal dispute with its drivers about overtime pay.&nbsp; State law requires time-and-a-half pay for each hour worked after 40 hours, but with exemptions for:</p>
<p><em>The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of:</em></p>
<p><em><em>(1) Agricultural produce;</em></em></p>
<p><em>(2) Meat and fish products; and</em></p>
<p><em>(3) Perishable foods.</em></p>
<p>The drivers argued that &ldquo;packing for shipment or distribution&rdquo; meant packing, and that they were entitled to 4 years&rsquo; worth of overtime pay for the distribution (whereas a comma after &ldquo;shipment&rdquo; would have made it clear they were not).&nbsp; Judges found in their favour, although the state legislature has now revised the clause as: &ldquo;The canning; processing; preserving; freezing; drying; marketing; storing; packing for shipment; or distributing of&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
