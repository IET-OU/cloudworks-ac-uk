        <p>Narrator</p>
<p>I was the teacher/mentor/lesson planner/curriculum planner</p>
<p>Situation</p>
<p>The one hour&nbsp;lesson took place as part of a series of lessons to develop literacy skills in a small group of 14 year old Chinese students. The students&nbsp;were in the same form for their main subjects.&nbsp;I met the students once a week. The lesson took place in a small room, with the students sitting around a circular table. They had work books in which to record their ideas but no course book.&nbsp;I had access to a whiteboard.</p>
<p>Task</p>
<p>The task was to develop narrative skills by engaging students in the development of a story of their choice. This came as a request from the English subject teacher who was concerned about the students' ability to analyse the ideas and literary devices used in a text.&nbsp;By encouraging the exploration of their own ideas, I hoped to increase awareness of how other writers expressed their ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actions</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Engage students in a brain storm to elicit types of story they have read/ liked/ disliked.&nbsp;I&nbsp; elicited genres not suggested. results shown in mind map on whiteboard and copied into workbooks.(mind map to be referred to in later lessons)</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Students discuss and decide which type of story they would like to develop.I had to monitor here to make sure no student dominated and all ideas were considered.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Students are given a worksheet which identified the organisation of a narrative and put questions to encourage and extend ideas.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp; Students discuss, answer prompts and suggest their own ideas. I&nbsp;asked questions to clarify/ extend ideas and help with vocabulary and spelling.</p>
<p>5)&nbsp; I&nbsp;develop new mind map on board to show ideas, seeking student participation on how to add new suggestions. At this stage there is no judgement of any idea. Students record mind map as it develops.</p>
<p>6)&nbsp; Once this stage is over, students discuss and prioritise the ideas adding&nbsp;clarification as required.I&nbsp;monitor and support discussion.</p>
<p>7)&nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp;elicit the tenses, literary devices eg use of adjectives, adverbs, metaphor etc. used in narratives.</p>
<p>8)&nbsp; Students write story for homework and read out stories in following lesson.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>All the students produced stories which were different although they had all used the worksheet to help organise their story.</p>
<p>Reflections</p>
<p>This was the first time the students had done this kind of activity. Coming from China they were used to teacher centred, teacher as expert pedagogy. I wanted to demonstrate that in creative writing there was no correct/ acceptable answer, rather that the use of&nbsp;literary devices is important.&nbsp;The students seemed to like the freedom to explore their ideas and began to be aware of where there were gaps in the story. Subsequent lessons&nbsp; have been&nbsp;less teacher centred as students became familiar with developing a mind map. They have&nbsp;built their own portfolios of mind maps.</p>
