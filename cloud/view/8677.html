<tr>
<td><strong>Design Principles Database</strong></td>
<td>The DSB is not so much a way by which to represent a learning design, but a peer-reviewed database of specific 'principles' organized hierachically accompnied by comments and ratonales provided by their designers. As such it can be used guide new designers, help experienced designers to clarify their own rationales, and provide examples of design priniciples and taxonomies for researchers.</td>
<td>&nbsp;As a design collection built up between 2001 and 2008 by a large community of designers, the DSB, by definition, expresses a great number possible learning design elements and should be able to describe most new designs. Though with the rapid development of technology, I wonder how it might represent uses of social networking technology or portable devices that have become so ubiquitous.</td>
<td>&nbsp;I think the DSB has great potential in assisting designers to communicate the rationale of their designs by providing many and varied examples from previous designs. I could use it any lesson to inspire new designs or refine existing ones.</td>
<td>A brief look through the database leads me to believe that I could use it to express and refine the rationale for my lesson using photographic typoglogies to stimulate a series of communicative tasks in an EFL classroom. My lesson relied on social networking, but only as a way of sharing student work, models for which exist in the database.</td>
<td>As it stands, my lesson needs refinement. It is not the product of careful reflection, but reflects an early and intuitive attempt at learning design. With the DSB I could refine the design to better serve my students' needs. As with the 'Healthy Eating' example, I could have mapped the lesson stage where students were asked to share their captioned photos to the prinicple of "reusing student artifacts as a resource for learning" to support those students who did not grasp the fucntion of photographic typologies in our project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Web Collage</strong></td>
<td>Provided the designer makes use of Web Collage's Collaborative Learning Flow Patterns (CLFPs), the tool is capable of represnting minute detail of a lesson in a way that is very easy to read thanks to a very sophisticated graphical engine. One can even follow how individual students move from phase to phase of a lesson at a glance.</td>
<td>The example provided by The Learning Design grid shows a level detailed not matched by any other tool except maybe ISiS, enabling the designer to express a great deal of their intention. It does, however, seem to be oriented around CLFPs which seems to exclude the ability to express phases of individual student work or T-SS interactions, forcing the use of generic phases in the flow which may not express exactly what the designer intended. But considering the rudimentary ability of the other tools to represent any interaction paterns graphically, this is not a hindrance.</td>
<td>&nbsp;Web collage should be robust enough to communicate the most important aspects of most learning designs. What's more, it can be tightly integrated with existing LMSs, allowing designers to quickly retrieve lists of course participants, assign users to groups, and create activities on the LMS accordingly. It does not lack in utility!</td>
<td>&nbsp;Considering how Web Collage handled "Healthy Eating", I believe it could also be used to represent my design. My lesson was heavily reliant on group work and peer interaction, and the CPFPs could represent these interactions with great fidelity.</td>
<td>The benefit that becomes immediately obvious is the explicit modelling of assessment. My design was not explicit in its assessment, and using Web Collage could have 'forced my hand' in integrating assessment into the design.&nbsp;</td>
