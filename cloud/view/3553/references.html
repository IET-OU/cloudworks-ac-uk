<p><strong>Session Overview</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>"The ideal IP system creates incentives for innovation, without unduly limiting access for consumers and follow on innovators. It must strike the right balance in a rapidly changing world so that innovators can see further by standing on the shoulders of giants. "</em></p>
<p>[Gowers Review of IP, 2006. <a href="http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/0118404830/0118404830" rel="nofollow">http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/0118404830/0118404830</a>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;Intellectual Property Rights and their management across HEIs and FEIs are profoundly affected by environmental changes such as developments in technology, legislation, policy and licensing, including open data, open content and open source. The JISC is keen to develop a future strategy which reflects this change agenda. As part of this we need to understand how current IP frameworks support or limit the opportunities of this change.</p>
<p>This session will explore these broader environmental issues and how they impact upon research, learning and a thriving 'Digital Britain'.</p>
<p>It will also present JISC&rsquo;s IPR Policy, including JISC&rsquo;s position on using Creative Commons Licences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session will provide an opportunity for JISC projects to review and comment upon a draft paper produced by the JISC IPR Consultants outlining the emerging issues in terms of IP frameworks and the challenges and questions that need to be addressed in order to respond effectively to the changing environment and to support innovation and excellence in research, learning and knowledge transfer activities.</p>
<p><strong>Session Chair</strong></p>
<p>Professor Charles Oppenheim -&nbsp; JISC IPR Consultant&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Speakers</strong></p>
<p>John X Kelly, Principle Legal Information Specialist, JISC Legal</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>How      far should traditional models of IP "protection" be used to      reward innovation in a web-based environment? </li>
<li>How      can HEIs and FEIs balance their traditional knowledge transfer business      models with open innovation and open source paradigms? </li>
<li>How      can a suitable balance be achieved between rewarding and remunerating      creators and facilitating digital access and use in teaching, learning and      research? </li>
<li>Is      risk management an appropriate substitute for IPR compliance? </li>
<li>Can      open licensing and the current IPR regime co-exist? </li>
<li>Is      there a place for IPR today, and if so, what form should it take, to what      and how? </li>
<li>How      far can technology move forward in this area, without pushing the      boundaries of IPR to breaking point or is IPR broken already? </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who should attend?</strong></p>
<p>Delegates who have an interest in/concerns about how external factors (such as legislative changes and issues emerging from ongoing work e.g. challenges and new research models) may impact upon institutional IPR and who are interested in what might constitute a fit for purpose IP regime for education and research in the networked environment and who wish to find out about JISC IPR and Creative Commons Licensing Policies.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Naomi Korn and Professor Charles Oppenheim, JISC IPR Consultants</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>July 2010</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Version 1.0</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Universities make money</em></strong></p>
<p><em>UK Universities generated &pound;59 billion for the UK economy in 2009, putting the higher education sector ahead of the agricultural, advertising, pharmaceutical and postal industries</em><a href="#_ftn1" rel="nofollow"><em><strong>[1]</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Delicate balance</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The ideal IP system creates incentives for innovation, without unduly limiting access for consumers and follow on innovators. It must strike the right balance in a rapidly changing world so that innovators can see further by standing on the shoulders of giants</em><a href="#_ftn2" rel="nofollow"><em><strong>[2]</strong></em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Web isn&rsquo;t a side-issue anymore</em></strong></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;&hellip;Getting online can help people save money, find a job, access services in a way that works for them, and make connections with each other and with their community. It will also help us all to drive down the cost of delivering public services.&rdquo;</em><a href="#_ftn3" rel="nofollow"><em><strong>[3]</strong></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Within a rapidly changing technological landscape the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)<a href="#_ftn4" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> mission is to inspire &ldquo;&hellip;UK colleges and universities in the innovative use of digital technologies, helping to maintain the UK&rsquo;s position as a global leader in education&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn5" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. Through its vast and diverse programme of activities and services which support its mission, the JISC will be at the forefront of the debate about how far the current Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) framework supports or challenges 21<sup>st</sup> Century changing practices of teaching, research and learning.</p>
<p>In this brave new world, JISC is supporting new models of <strong>scholarly practices</strong> which use the web to transcend hierarchical, social, technological, institutional and national boundaries. <strong>Open streams of mined and linked data</strong> and <strong>open source software</strong>, which can be shared and repurposed<a href="#_ftn6" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> are contributing extensively towards the UK economy by inspiring collaboration and innovation. Similarly, open access scholarly research outputs which are enabling <strong>free online access to the outputs of publicly funded research</strong> are proven to bring millions pounds of savings to HEIs and FEI<a href="#_ftn7" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> by challenging <strong>proprietary print based paradigms of journal licensing</strong>. These activities are often supported by <strong>new web based business models</strong><a href="#_ftn8" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>The creation of <strong>digitised resources and Open Educational Resources (OER)</strong>, supported by JISC and the Higher Education Academy is also contributing in multiple ways to the building blocks of a digital Britain in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. These resources are supporting the <strong>formal, informal, work-place and life-long learner</strong><a href="#_ftn9" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, and contributing to UK education, society and culture.</p>
<p>The multiple benefits which universities and colleges, as well as businesses, can harness from <strong>open innovation</strong>, is encouraging many of them to include open innovation models as part of the portfolio of their knowledge transfer activities. By collaborating with external partners in the <strong>co-development of products and services</strong> they are able to experiment with new ideas, develop innovative resources and perspectives, share market intelligence and infrastructure, pool fundamental research as well as filling gaps in areas where they may not have the expertise.</p>
<p>However, despite the speed of technological change and Government support for openness, life long learning, digital access and digital inclusion - <strong>comparative IPR legislative progression has been inert and arguably regressive</strong>. It has changed fundamentally little in three hundred years. Ironically, increased digital access has actually led to <strong>more legislative restrictions</strong> and the <strong>criminalisation</strong> of certain print and web-based practices, such as format shifting and the removal of technical protection measures (TPMs) are used by rights holders to restrict access.</p>
<p>The Gowers Review of IP<a href="#_ftn10" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>&nbsp; was a golden opportunity to address the disparity between technology and the law in the digital age. Albeit well meaning intentions, the recommendations outlined in the Gowers Review have arguably <strong>enough</strong><strong> </strong><strong>not gone far</strong> to create a legislative framework which recognises the <strong>plurality of IP ownership</strong> in a global web-based society, supports the use of innovative technologies and their benefit to the UK PLC and provides a platform for open innovation business models and practices. For example, the problem of <strong>contract law overriding the copyright exceptions</strong> has not been addressed and therefore continues to pose threats for open access and digital inclusion. Provisions relating to <strong>format shifting </strong>have been abandoned by the last Government, despite recommendations in the Gowers Review of IP to address this issue and bring the UK closer in line with some of its European neighbours. Similarly, the UK is out of synch internationally in its implementation of <strong>exceptions to copyright</strong> which are entirely media, technology and location non specific which can actively support researchers, teachers and formal, informal and lifelong learners in a Web 2.0 world.</p>
<p>The recently passed Digital Economy Act, 2010, which includes provisions to crack down on illegal file sharing, will undoubtedly place <strong>unacceptable burdens and costs</strong> on Higher and Further education institutions at a time of economic hardship, <strong>limit digital inclusion </strong>and <strong>undermine the innovative use of technology</strong> for teaching, learning and research<a href="#_ftn11" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. Similarly, provisions relating to Orphan Works (works for which the rights holders are unknown or cannot be traced, &nbsp;estimated to be in excess of 50 million works across the public sector<a href="#_ftn12" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, were removed from the Digital Economy Bill. This was a <strong>missed opportunity</strong> to resolve the potential lock down of digital access to 20<sup>th</sup> Century cultural heritage. In this case, despite the likelihood that many of these works were not created with any commercial intent, many institutions choose not to make them digitally accessible due to institutional <strong>aversion to risks</strong>.</p>
<p>Together, these measures and exclusions will create greater <strong>inconsistencies between the UK and other countries</strong>, placing the UK research and teaching at an <strong>international disadvantage</strong> and reducing the broader benefits of HE and FE led innovation.</p>
<p>How does IPR work in a part of the world where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creators don&rsquo;t care about asserting ownership </li>
<li>Users don&rsquo;t care about respecting rights</li>
<li>Content contains a tapestry of multiple owners of multiple formats, so complex it&rsquo;s almost impossible to express, let alone comply, let alone enforce.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a dynamic digital age, where users are rights holders and vice versa, issues such as the convergence of national <strong>print-based IPR paradigms</strong> applied to <strong>cross-borders innovative technologies</strong> and digital media and debates surrounding <strong>&ldquo;open&rdquo; and closed data</strong> and the <strong>balance between open access, competition and competing business models</strong>, become more complex and relevant to teaching, learning and research. Together, they raise crucial questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How far should traditional models of IP &ldquo;protection&rdquo; be used to reward innovation in a web-based environment? &nbsp;</li>
<li>How can HEIs and FEIs balance their traditional knowledge transfer business models with open innovation and open source paradigms?</li>
<li>How can a suitable balance be achieved between rewarding and remunerating creators and facilitating digital access and use in teaching, learning and research? </li>
<li>Is risk management an appropriate substitute for IPR compliance? </li>
<li>Can open licensing and the current IPR regime co-exist? </li>
<li>Is there a place for IPR today, and if so, what form should it take, to what and how?</li>
<li>How far can technology move forward in this area, without pushing the boundaries of IPR to breaking point or is IPR broken already? </li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, if we are to see UK universities and colleges continue to vibrantly innovate positioned at the forefront of international knowledge creation, these issues associated with digital access, use and rights need to be challenged and addressed.</p>
