        <p>This project aim to design a software engineering teaching unit (module) that can give the students the opportunity to practice agile development mixed with the study of main concepts of software engineering. The challenge is to teach software engineering not following the traditional waterfall model.</p>

                   <p>I think we can discuss here and then try to fill the template if we find useful. There are some assumptions to make:</p>
<p>a. students are face to face or at a distance? does this matter?</p>
<p>b. Do they have any previous knowledge of software engineering?</p>
<p>c. do they have background in programming?</p>

                   <p>a. I think it matters a lot, and you know my preference</p>
<p>I started with the scenarios and wrote a scenario froma&nbsp; student;s point of view. Then I wondered if I should have written a scenario from the educator's point of view.</p>
<p>as for b. and c. it depends on what the focus is. I started with a very concrete scenarion for a student's activity, tbere I assumed previous knowledge as wht I wanted to focus on was the activity. But if we focus at a higher level then we may want to make differnet decisions</p>        </div>

                   <p>a. ok, we can go for distance education - I can use the knowledge to adapt later for face to face. I've read through the Personas book chapter (interesting). It seems to me that the scenario should be from the students point of view, they are the personas. We should look for characterize them, including their expections. The scenario will involve the setting and events as in the template, though I believe there are too many details there.</p>
<p>b. I would be interested to assume that they don't have previous knowledge of Software Engineering (SE) because there is a challenge here and we can reason about Agile Development for teaching. If we assume they have previous Knowledge of SE, then we are assuming that Agile is for management really. As far programming is concerned, it is important because we can, start with activities that involve implementing small requirements stories soon. I would go for it as most students have previous knowledge of programming languages.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I would say a whole "small" module is better because we will be able to see the learning outcome better. What do you think of looking at the requirements stage? Maybe it is not so difficult to understand what agile methods says in that stage. At least they understand that specifying requirements in some way is necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If have time, go ahead in trying to modify the template which is in the google drive. I'll catch up.</p>

                   <p>I shared with you what I had done to the template before this discussion; it is only for a small set of activities and it was assuming previous knowledge of concepts. It will have to be a completely different thing with the change of focus and background</p>        </div>

                   <p>I proposed changes to your template. It is in our shared folder. I renamed the file adding Itana.</p>
<p>I tried to follow the concepts of personas to the descriptio. I am not sure of what the objetive is for (for the module? design? or actors?).</p>
<p>Altough I don't teach at a distance, my evening students, I suppose, are similar personas because they go to University to formalise concepts but they already have market experience which sometimes is a negative force because they work in companies that develop software in a ad hoc manner. Though some claim to use agile methods. They are usually in a setting that push them to delivery the system very fast, even if it is not well tested. Usually they claim to use SCRUM because they have a manager who wants to know what they do every day. Most common roles they play are testers, network support and customer assistance. So there is a challenge in conveying important concepts by make them realize the problem they may face if they don't think of a good requirements specification. Usually it is very difficult to teach them how to draw a meaningful use case, one that has main functions (Jacobson). They usually think of the system by the CRUD operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, I'll try to exploit force maps and Ecology of resources. In a way they seem interesting reasoning support to define system domains.</p>
<p>Looking forward for your comments</p>

                   <p>Itana</p>
<p>Which shared folder?</p>
<p>I have been thinking about the taching of 'solid' SE principles/techniques/etc vs agile, and I am coming to the idea that I would only like to teach agile to students who have a good understanding of the 'solid' SE principles/techniques/etc. Being agile requires great experience and knowledge of principles/techniques/etc so that you are sufficiently secure to adapt, simplify, and chose which techniques are better for the context both of the organisation and of the problem to solve.</p>
<p>So what I am trying to teach at the moment are SE principles and techniques but at each point contrast with more agile ways of developing software and also that only once you have a complete tool box and know it well you can pick, choose and adaprt the right tool for the right context/problem.</p>

                   <p>My main problem is that I want to avoid daily meetings. These students cannot really have these meetings, John is in Germany, Mary in Australia, and Peter in the UK...there is no way, that on topof their busy jobs they can synchronize everyday with their colleagues. However, they can use the technology to simulate these daily meetings, to comments on each other's work and starting building a shared model</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>(1) I understand your points. As far as the MOOC is concerned we have to decide for a context. So if we agree with my proposed changes to template, we will design a course for new learners of SE concepts. If not we have to rewrite the scenario. This is the urgent decision to take. I believe wheather to set a daily meeting is already a design issue, the scenario reveals that they will have problems with meeting timings.</p>
<p>(2) Your point about "being agile requires experience ..." is a long tale. From what I see in conferences, like the industrial track of the CBSOFT, discussion with students and industrial partners like PUC-RS has a technological park and we have been visiting and talking to industry or developing joing research projects; I would say that industry engage developers in projects, even if they don't have previous concepts at all. Most companies state they use "use case model" at best. Please send me references of better experiences, but I would say that we have to consider a scenario where we have this sort of company. I would have a long story to tell about how bad for students is to leave with this scenario and for me a SE teacher I have to make twice as more effort to teach because one think is to teach for a clear mind and another is to teach for people who has bad "habbits". The scenario is pretty messy!</p>
<p>(3) we have to be aware that people are working in global software development scenarios, so even companies are facing time differences problems and continue to use agile methods so what do they do?</p>        </div>

                   <p>(1) I don't have any objections to the Objectives part of the template, that's whay I started commenting on the Events.</p>
<p>As for point (2) I was talking about the educational context, not of a company.</p>
<p>As for point (3) I am thinking about the context of distance education where students really find it very difficult to come together and work ina&nbsp; group that imposes synchronicity and strong dependences on teh work of other.</p>

                   <p>Leonor,</p>
<p>I've shared with you an annotated pdf (OULDI_pedagodic_aspects-itana) and the card selection and the course map view of our project that I've developed for week 3. I am looking forward for your comments.</p>
<p>As in our previous design (ESE course) I don't think it is useful to develop the pedagogy profile before designing the detailed activities.</p>
<p>I have difficult to understand the real meaning of the cards, some seems a jargon that I don't understand like "scaffolded learning", some seems ambiguous like conversational and collaborative or how can I consider an aspect innovative or authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn't also make a reasonable connection between the tools we used before (personas, force maps and EoR), although I find the EoR the most useful to lead to the course map view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it is a &nbsp;key aspect to think about the pedagogic strategy which is practice-based I suppose to convey the desired learning outcomes. If possible we can have an online chat.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Scaffolding (andaimes numa constru&ccedil;&atilde;o) is the support given during the learning process which is tailored to the needs of the student with the intention of helping the student achieve his/her learning goals (Sawyer, 2006).</p>
<p>We never discussed assessment. Why does it have to be exam-assessed; the kind of tasks wea re gthinking about for agile practice are not amenable to an exam.</p>
<p>I am not sure what you mean about developing the pedagogic approach vs, developing the activities. Are you saying thsi shouldn't be done at this point in time?</p>
<p>The personas are definitely reflected in teh course map view...not sure about the rest; I suppose it is just all part of a big toolbox and you pick the tools that fit better the problem/context.</p>
<p>I agree we need to discuss the practical activities.</p>
<p>I have started attempting a very simple pattern (week 4) but it is very reudimentary; I'll share it with you if it gets any further.</p>

                   <p>Leonor,</p>
<p>Ok, thanks for the clarification about the term scaffolding applied to learning.</p>
<p>I'll replace the exam by a project report. I'll try a set of activities to proceed playing with the tools. I can imagine from our chat that there are so many subtle questions about agile teaching to discuss. I'd be pleasure to have more time invest on this, &nbsp;but considering the time scale and purpose of the course maybe we should try to use the tools more that get a precise design at the moment. The design technique itself is meant to be iterative.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I've posted in my portofolio the links to the deliverables I've produced in week 3. For sure they don't reflect an agreement considering the project but my trials with the toolbox.</p>        </div>
