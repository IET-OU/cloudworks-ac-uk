			<h3>OLDS MOOC - WEEK 1 - Reflection</h3>
<p>&nbsp;The learning outcomes defined for Week 1 were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore&nbsp;a variety of definitions of learning design</li>
<li>Initiate own learning/curriculum design project</li>
<li>Define learning design, as a field of research and a practice</li>
<li>Identify some of the grand challenges of using a learning design approach to the design of learning in the 21st Century</li>
<li>Identify specific topics of interest for further exploration</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;I have accomplished all tasks suggested:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have watched the introductory video of Yishar</li>
<li>I have introduced myself in the Google Groups Open Discussion, with a screencast -<a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/M3W6V7yDiqqY" rel="nofollow">http://www.screencast.com/t/M3W6V7yDiqqY</a></li>
<li>I have created two cloudworks: (1)&nbsp;to describe&nbsp;my dream project -&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6778" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6778</a>&nbsp;(I've got only 1 comment); (2) &nbsp;learning journal -&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6789" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6789</a></li>
<li>Regarding&nbsp;my objectives for the week I navigated across the whole programme of &nbsp;OLDS MOOC, tried to go through all tools and use some of them, namely interact in some of the discussion lines in Google Groups and keep feeding my blogs: (1) eportfolio of Ph.D. course &laquo;Ambientes e Pedagogias Emergentes&raquo; (PT) -&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://idabrandao.blogspot.pt/" rel="nofollow">http://idabrandao.blogspot.pt/</a>&nbsp;- and my Posterous Space dedicated to MOOCs, which I adopted as Learning Journal for OLDS MOOC -&nbsp;<a href="http://idabrandao.posterous.com/" rel="nofollow">http://idabrandao.posterous.com/</a>. I have also read some documents in Bibsonomy, such as Lanarca Declaration.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I have produced a compilation of Instructional Design and Learning Design models in a wiki -&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://oldsmooc1week1learningdesigndefinition.pbworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://oldsmooc1week1learningdesigndefinition.pbworks.com</a></li>
<li>I've tried to create a group&nbsp;with portuguese colleagues of Ph.D. course to develop the project in Cloudworks - OER Module for Teacher Training - but this initiative was suspended, since the guidelines of&nbsp;our teacher&nbsp;pointed in another direction, which led to some confusion among colleagues.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I've joined two study circles in Google+: (1) LD in schools -&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/?tab=wX#communities/107176900797507707804" rel="nofollow">https://plus.google.com/u/0/?tab=wX#communities/107176900797507707804</a>&nbsp;and (2) webinar&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/?tab=wX#communities/115822896571786655879" rel="nofollow">https://plus.google.com/u/0/?tab=wX#communities/115822896571786655879</a></li>
<li>I have watched the final Hangout session and made a few comments on Google+&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/?tab=wX#s/Olds Mooc" rel="nofollow">https://plus.google.com/u/0/?tab=wX#s/Olds Mooc</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;I suppose that I can request the Badge for this first week.&nbsp;</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<h3><strong>OLDS MOOC - WEEK 2 - &nbsp;FINAL REFLECTION</strong></h3>
<p>This week was heavy!</p>
<p>Too much stuff to read and digest!</p>
<p>Too many communication tools and interventions to catch up with!</p>
<p>The context in LD is a relevant theme. The learning outcomes were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review &amp; revise your understanding of learner context and it's relevance to learning design.</li>
<li>Increase your awareness of approaches to context for learning design.</li>
<li>Evaluate the relevance of contextual approaches to&nbsp;your own learning design practice.</li>
<li>Plan further learning about contextual approaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried to follow the&nbsp;day-by-day&nbsp;activities, but I&nbsp;feel that I had no time to mature ideas and work my own project on more models and templares suggested. Just used the scenario approach and the narrative to contextualize my &laquo;OER module for teacher training&raquo;. I'm still willing to try the Force Map.</p>
<p>I started to use UDUTU tool (nice graphics and features) to design the module, though this is a content interactive tool and will need to be complemented with discussion/collaborative tools to bridge people.</p>
<p>I made a wiki with the&nbsp;compilation of&nbsp;sections of my readings, mainly the visual templates and graphics -&nbsp;<a href="http://oldsmooc1week2contextualize1learningdesign.pbworks.com/" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://oldsmooc1week2contextualize1learningdesign.pbworks.com</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and a mindmap -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mindomo.com/view.htm?m=6a4258b29c7c4336b6d7e26abcb1d22e" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindomo.com/view.htm?m=6a4258b29c7c4336b6d7e26abcb1d22e</a></p>
<p>I've also posted in Google Groups Open Discussion and tried to participate in the two Study Circles I've joined &laquo;Schools&raquo; and &laquo;Webinars&raquo;.</p>

			<h3><strong>OLDS MOOC - WEEK 3 - FINAL REFLEXIONS</strong></h3>
<p>On the whole I think that the course is well organized and facilitators have been active. The resources are relevant, useful and new to me, so I've been exploring them and&nbsp;applying to my project &laquo;OER module for teacher training&raquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every week I have opened a wiki related to the theme and learning outcomes, which for week 3 embraced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conceptualise the learning design process from different perspectives</li>
<li>Apply some&nbsp;learning design resources, tools and methods to your design</li>
<li>Critique a range of pedagogical approaches and the role that different technologies play</li>
<li>Review, share&nbsp;and discuss the theoretical underpinnings, benefits and limitations of design representations across educational contexts</li>
<li>Develop an innovative storyboard, learning activities and a structure for implementation</li>
<li>Opportunity to gain&nbsp;the 3 Weeks and Resource Gatherer badges&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The links for <strong>my wikis</strong> are:</p>
<p>WEEK 1 -<a href="http://oldsmooc1week1learningdesigndefinition.pbworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://oldsmooc1week1learningdesigndefinition.pbworks.com</a></p>
<p>WEEK 2 -<a href="http://oldsmooc1week2contextualize1learningdesign.pbworks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://oldsmooc1week2contextualize1learningdesign.pbworks.com</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WEEK 3 -&nbsp;<a href="http://oldsmooc1week3designrepresentations.pbworks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://oldsmooc1week3designrepresentations.pbworks.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last&nbsp;two&nbsp;weeks I have applied the Learning Design methods and tools&nbsp;presented in LD Design GRID to my &laquo;OER module for teacher training&raquo;, namely, Scenario, Narrative, Storyboard (in Glogster), Course Map, UML Diagram and Workflow&nbsp;(Gliffy). I suppose the Course Map was&nbsp;my favourite. Some were not so relevant because I have already my project contextualized in my professional activity and as it is a development of work previously done, there's not much brainstorming involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have explored the 7C's of LD slideshare (Conceptualize, Capture, Communicate, Collaborate, Consider, Combine and Consolidade), the course features (pedagogical approaches, principles, guidance and support, content and activities, reflection and demonstration, communication and collaboration), the different templates to organize learning units (course map, activity profile, storyboard).&nbsp;</p>

			<h3>OLDS MOOC - WEEK&nbsp;4 - Final Reflection&nbsp;</h3>
<p>CONNECT - Design Principles and Design Pedagogical Patterns</p>
<p>This week what interested me the most was the use of&nbsp;<a href="http://web.lkldev.ioe.ac.uk/PPC/live/ODC.html" rel="nofollow">PPC&nbsp;</a>(Pedagogical Pattern Collector) tool and trying to adapt some of the existing patterns and examples of activities planning to new ones.</p>
<p>I think that&nbsp;PPC tool has some potential and may help to plan activities, even if the starting point gets completely altered.</p>
<p>As in previous week I made a wiki aggregating some information and individual work with PPC tool, designing activities on &laquo;Copyright-Creative Commons&raquo;; &laquo;Multiple Intelligences Theory&raquo;; &laquo;Open concept&raquo;:</p>
<p><a href="http://oldsmooc1week4pedagogicalpatterns.pbworks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://oldsmooc1week4pedagogicalpatterns.pbworks.com</a></p>
<p>Regarding&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.edu-design-principles.org/dp/viewFeatureSummary.php" rel="nofollow">Design Principles Database</a>, though it's interesting to read the context and framework of the learning&nbsp;activities (and ther's a lot of them) and the different project sites they are linked to, some of these like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pyxisystems.com/" rel="nofollow">Pixysystems</a> seem outdated&nbsp; (the design interface looks like old stuff), some of the URLs are also broken. So, the one I've explored was Cases site (Curriculum Access System <br />for Elementary Science) where we can find learning units/lesson plans&nbsp;structures with extensive descriptions such as this example:</p>
<p>How does a hot air balloon work? -&nbsp;<a href="http://cases.soe.umich.edu/packet.php?dqid=100" rel="nofollow">http://cases.soe.umich.edu/packet.php?dqid=100</a></p>
<p>I was impressed with the high quality of the design of these learning units,&nbsp;following an inquiry based approach&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://cases.soe.umich.edu/topnav.php?nav=unitlist" rel="nofollow">http://cases.soe.umich.edu/topnav.php?nav=unitlist</a></p>
<p>This reflection is also available in my&nbsp;Posterous Space dedicated to MOOCs- <a href="http://idabrandao.posterous.com/olds-mooc-week-4-final-reflection" rel="nofollow">http://idabrandao.posterous.com/olds-mooc-week-4-final-reflection</a></p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<h3>OLDS MOOC WEEK 5 - Final reflexion</h3>
<p>WEEK 5 was dedicated to prototyping,&nbsp;culminating&nbsp;with the application of many of the tools experimented in previous weeks.&nbsp;As my project &laquo;OER module for teacher training&raquo; was decided since the beginning of OLDS MOOC, I've collected some of the work developed before.</p>
<p>I've created&nbsp;a new wiki for WEEK 5 and put together my prototype - <a href="http://oldsmooc1week5prototype.pbworks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://oldsmooc1week5prototype.pbworks.com</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As suggested by prof. Laurillard, I joined the cloudscape discussion -&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2468" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2468</a> - and added my own cloud -&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8001" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8001</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;I've posted some comments on other colleague's prototypes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My OER module in UDUTU LMS is taking shape but there's still much work to do. I keep revising&nbsp;what is already available and progress is not so fast as I wished. I have the course outline completed .&nbsp;Topic 1 - &laquo;'Open' concept and copyright/digital commons&raquo; is also ready. URL: <a href="http://publish.myudutu.com/published/evaluations/4599/Course87369/v2013_2_12_1_47_55/course/course87369.html" rel="nofollow">http://publish.myudutu.com/published/evaluations/4599/Course87369/v2013_2_12_1_47_55/course/course87369.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;I've started working on Topic 2 - Learning Design and Universal Design for Learning. I'm going to take some of the tools we have experimented in OLDS MOOC to apply in the activities I'm going to suggest for creation of learning units.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;the target teachers of OER module are those that deal with SEN pupils,&nbsp;universal design and accessibilities will be focused.</p>
<p>CAST has a nice free tool &laquo;Book Builder&raquo; that has accessible features incorporated, a talking synthetizer - <a href="http://www.cast.org/learningtools/book_builder/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cast.org/learningtools/book_builder/index.html</a>.&nbsp;It has also models for Lesson Builder - <a href="http://lessonbuilder.cast.org/" rel="nofollow">http://lessonbuilder.cast.org/</a></p>
<p>Example - Rocks and their properties - <a href="http://lessonbuilder.cast.org/explore.php?op=static&pid=rocks_1" rel="nofollow">http://lessonbuilder.cast.org/explore.php?op=static&amp;pid=rocks_1</a></p>
<p>The OER Module will include a third topic on &laquo;creation, reuse and remix OER&raquo; where we'll explore repositories of resources in the public domain, suggesting&nbsp;activities&nbsp;to create&nbsp;new accessible OERs.</p>

			<h3>OLDS MOOC - WEEK 6 - FINAL REFLEXION - CURATE</h3>
<p>This week goals were to explore repositories of OER and &laquo;methods of finding and identifying OER, how they differ from the mass of online content as well as the many ways they can be incorporated into learning designs.&raquo;</p>
<p>OER repositories were delivered&nbsp;in the resources&nbsp;for this week and activities of searching OER related to participant's projects were proposed. Issues of copyright were addressed and creative commons licences were highlighted. The discussion in Hangout focused on OER licences and copyrights controversy.</p>
<p>The results for my searches in the proposed repositories were descriminated in my wiki -&nbsp;<a href="http://oldsmooc1week6curate.pbworks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://oldsmooc1week6curate.pbworks.com</a></p>
<p>Most of these repositories are not very easy and efficient to explore and comparing to Google Search Engine we may get frustrated with time consuming and not getting the results we were looking for. But those repositories are rich sources of materials that we should retain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ideal is to organize one's own thematic repositories using&nbsp;curation tools, such as Livebinders, Pinterest, Pearltrees, Vidque, etc, and&nbsp;one can also organize directories of files in one's computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often we&nbsp;adapt and remix resources we find in the Internet using free tools that helps to transform them. In my wiki I include some recent experiences with illustrations (some I've used in my project) with Photovisi backgrounds remixing other images from Dreamstime. I've also embedded in my wiki some video clips reusing VideoBlocks&nbsp;with OnetrueMedia, as illustration of education quotes and animated big titles. The possibilities are immense. One has to dedicate much time in these experimentations, but graphic design&nbsp;has always motivated me.&nbsp;</p>

			<h3>OLDS MOOC - WEEK 7 - Final reflection</h3>
<p>This week&nbsp;learning objectives were focused on&nbsp;formative evaluation of learning design.</p>
<p>Differences between assessment (learners achievements) and evaluation (course, learning units evaluation) were clarified.</p>
<p>The paper&nbsp;&laquo;Learning Design and Formative Evaluation&raquo;&nbsp;was&nbsp;a good basis to address formative evaluation, decisions and questions to make along the process of design for learning, criteria for formative evaluation ( functionality, appeal, usability, accessibility, effectiveness), different methods for formative evaluation (peer review, expert review, learner review, usability testing, prototype testing).</p>
<p>I took some ideas from this paper and produced a short <a title="Formative evaluation in LD" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akGPGpkplQo&feature=share&list=UUdzjhBJSgsJjvrC79z7MTJw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">video clip </a>(testing VideoBlocks&nbsp; in One True Media).</p>
<p>A toolkit of evaluation templates and guides were provided by Prof. Reeves that have practical interest -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.evaluateitnow.com/downloads.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.evaluateitnow.com/downloads.html</a>,.</p>
<p>The evaluation plan was applied to my project OER, described in Cloudworks -&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8107" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8107</a></p>
<p>Prof. Reeves gave feedback and suggestions to evaluate my project.</p>
<p>A wiki was produced for this week, as a compilation of my readings and tasks -&nbsp;<a href="http://oldsmooc1week7evaluation.pbworks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://oldsmooc1week7evaluation.pbworks.com</a></p>

			<h3>OLDS MOOC - WEEK 8 - Final Reflection</h3>
<p>This week's learning outcomes were:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Use design narratives to reflect back on the journey you have completed, your goals and achievements, and what you've learnt along the way.</li>
<li>Compare the use of representations, tools and methodologies within the OLDS-MOOC activities</li>
<li>Discuss the key challenges of learning design and how the field might develop.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Professors:</strong> Professor Gr&aacute;inne Conole from the Beyond Distance Research Alliance at the University of Leicester, Professor James Dalziel from Macquarie University and Dr Yishay Mor from The Open University.</p>
<p>&nbsp;OLDS MOOC - WEEK 8 - Final Reflection</p>
<p>I have produced two narratives:</p>
<ol>
<li>NARRATIVE OF OLDS MOOC EXPERIENCE in cloud: <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8138" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8138</a></li>
<li>NARRATIVE OF OER MODULE PROJECT in cloud: <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8148" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8148</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>In my OER project I have planned a topic on Learning Design,&nbsp; in which I have included some of the tools and resources used in OLDS MOOC.</p>
<p>I have produced a learning unit on OER in UDUTU LMS. As this learning unit is addressed to teachers with SEN pupils, the accessibilities issues and universal design for learning will be highlighted as well. The goal is to raise awareness for the many free tools and resources that exist and where to find them, to readapt or to create new ones according to the needs of pupils. Learning objects are intended to be produced by teachers along this learning unit. As a final deliverable we'll have an aggregation of individual eportfolios and activities/products created by participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the narratives I've produced in cloudworks and some of the comments are quite extensive, I think that this week 8 reflection is quite comprehensive and a detailed wiki was produced embracing all in: <a href="http://oldsmooc1week8reflect.pbworks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://oldsmooc1week8reflect.pbworks.com.</a></p>			<div class="posted-by">
