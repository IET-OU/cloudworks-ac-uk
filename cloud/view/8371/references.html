        <h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>As a tutor within a 16-19 FE college, it is my job to teach and assess work from the Creative Media Production BTEC specification.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>Within a 16-19 FE college, I taught and assessed a group of 14 students within a full time Level 3 programme of study, the Creative Media Production course was well resourced in term of computers and equipment, but not in terms of practical space. Learners were having a difficult relationship with the unit based approach used in the first year and a more project based approach was being used for the second year. Students complained about being over assessed, steps were taken to reduce this problem.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>I was trying to achieve a more flexible approach to assessment that would give variety to the learners while also embracing new technology. In September 2012 a photography unit was a good opportunity to trial new assessment methods (but also giving the students choice). The normal paper based collection and marking of work would be accompanied by the option of producing a blog of research/planning/work as an alternative output for the students&rsquo; work. This approach was intended to increase the students&rsquo; variety of deliverables therefore to improving motivation, ownership and practicalities of saving and submitting work.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>1. Plan to introduce paperless assessment tool</p>
<p>2. Investigate possible mediums (i.e. wordpress) create a blog as practice.</p>
<p>3. Write new assignment brief.</p>
<p>4. Demonstrate and facilitate using wordpress to students.</p>
<p>5. Facilitate and monitor the production of students&rsquo; work.</p>
<p>5. Collect, assess and provide feedback on students submitted work.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The expected results of this change were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less students lost work on memory sticks/through computer file corruption/ or poor file management.</li>
<li>Students stored notes, images, assignment work and research on their blog</li>
<li>Enabled students to work outside the classroom/ at home.</li>
<li>Some students followed the example blog for updates promoting expansive learning.</li>
<li>Some students created personal, attractive blogs to contain their work.</li>
<li>Less printing needed.</li>
<li>Some students were motivated by the use of new technology.</li>
<li>Students received paperless feedback via their blogs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unexpected outcomes were that:</p>
<ul>
<li>After initial enthusiasm for the personalised blogs, take-up of this option for storing work and submitting assignment work was low.</li>
<li>Could this be attributed to the problems students had with the Wordpress UI, as &lsquo;digital natives&rsquo; maybe the students were not familiar with my choice of Wordpress. Maybe take-up would be higher if they could choose a blogging tool they were more familiar with. Or was it that as second year students they already had preconceived notions of the forms college work should take (word docs, presentations) and therefore they had difficulty adjusting to this a new approach.</li>
<li>After gathering rough feedback from the students some students voiced concerns about the security of their work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>In general this was a successful pilot of using blogs as an assessment tool as it showed the potential of this technology, but it also highlighted some key concerns. My reflections are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>This approach should be used from the beginning of a course to increase participation.</li>
<li>Choice of blog should be given to student.</li>
<li>Students are &lsquo;conditioned&rsquo; into thinking some more traditional forms of assessment are easier, maybe to be successful less choice should be given in the assignment brief to increase participation and learning regarding this tool.</li>
<li>Security and plagiarism of students work need to be addressed.</li>
</ul>
