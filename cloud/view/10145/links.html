<p>Fourteen universities, led by MIT, have launched <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/09/20/mooc-based-masters-degree-initiative-expands-globally" rel="nofollow">19 modular MicroMaster&rsquo;s degree programmes</a> in which students can complete up to half of the course work online, earn a credential and then decide whether they want to apply to pursue the full degree. &nbsp;Most programmes consist of 4&ndash;10 edX MOOCs, representing anywhere from one-quarter to half of the master&rsquo;s degrees they feed into.&nbsp; While learners can take the MOOCs free, some of the university partners were hesitant about offering credit for learners whose course work was graded by their peers.&nbsp; Hence, learners must pursue an identity-verified credential, typically paying about $1,000 for it, and they are filtered into separate cohorts, where their papers will be graded by instructors.</p>
<p>Less than a year after the University of Illinois&rsquo; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/10/07/growth-illinoiss-mooc-powered-mba-degree-exceeds-universitys-expectations" rel="nofollow">MBA-through-MOOCs programme</a> launched, it believes a model is emerging that it can use to promote the university abroad, enrol previously untapped groups of students and attract corporate partners.&nbsp; The $22,000 online program (iMBA) has yielded 270 new degree-seeking, tuition-paying students, with a further 80 paying to take individual courses at about $1,000 each. &nbsp;There are also more than 950,000 people taking free versions of the Coursera courses, of whom about 27,000 have paid to receive an identity-verified certificate.</p>

<p><strong>From Retention to Persistence</strong></p>

<p>Syracuse University&rsquo;s Vincent Tinto considers student retention and suggests that institutions often have the wrong focus &ndash; we look at retention whereas most students want to achieve their degree, so they &ldquo;&hellip;do not seek to be retained. They seek to persist.&rdquo;&nbsp; We should therefore consider how we can <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2016/09/26/how-improve-student-persistence-and-completion-essay" rel="nofollow">encourage students to persist</a> and he suggests targeting three factors: self-efficacy (promoting students&rsquo; belief in their ability to succeed); students&rsquo; sense of belonging to a supportive community of learners; and students&rsquo; perceived value and relevance of the curriculum to their own interests, needs and future employment.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Many videos do not have captions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many videos lack an alternative way to access images or visual information (e.g., graphs, charts, animations or URLs on slides), such as audio description, alternative text, PDF files or Word documents)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many documents associated with online courses were inaccessible to individuals with vision disabilities who use screen readers because the document was not formatted properly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some videos that had automatically generated captions were inaccurate and incomplete</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The university justified its potential actions thus: &ldquo;We believe that in a time of substantial budget deficits and shrinking state financial support, our first obligation is to use our limited resources to support our enrolled students. &nbsp;Therefore, we must strongly consider the unenviable option of whether to remove content from public access."</p>

<p>But there are no readiness problems through the lens of <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/think/docs/twg-how-people-use-their-devices-2016.pdf" rel="nofollow">Google Research</a>.&nbsp; They found that 80% of people use a smartphone in an average day, spending an average of 170 mins on their device.&nbsp; Nearly 40% of people search only on a smartphone, 42% watch YouTube only on a smartphone and 25% browse the web only on a smartphone.</p>

<p>One recent completion is an R&amp;D project that looked at <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/rd/projects/digital-student" rel="nofollow">Digital Students</a>, exploring their expectations and experiences of using technology in HE, FE and skills.&nbsp; The study found that 78% of HE students produce work in a digital format and 72% believe that when technology is used effectively by teaching staff it enhances their learning experience.&nbsp; There is also a benchmarking tool, developed by Jisc and the NUS, with the aim helping institutions <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6140/1/Jisc_NUS_student_experience_benchmarking_tool.pdf" rel="nofollow">improve the student digital experience</a>.</p>
<p>There is also an alpha release of an <a href="https://store.data.alpha.jisc.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">App and Resource Store</a>, housing a mix of free and paid-for resources that can be searched, explored and rated.&nbsp; Users will be able to add their own content in a future release.&nbsp; <em>(Note &ndash; It would not load properly for me in IE11 but was fine in Chrome).</em></p>
<p>Finally, for those interested in adopting e-books, <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/students-and-universities-set-to-reap-the-benefits-of-market-leading-e-book-pilot-22-sep-2016" rel="nofollow">Pearson and Jisc are just starting a year-long pilot that will make e-books more readily accessible</a> to students across UK HE.&nbsp; The scheme provides access to whole of Pearson&rsquo;s HE e-textbook collection and Jisc members can select from a range of discounted subscription models, giving students and institutions flexibility to access content in ways that best meet their needs and circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Detrimental Effects of Immediate Explanation Feedback</strong></p>
<p><em>[ResearchGate]</em></p>
<p>Yet more conventional wisdom tells us that including <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306960129_Detrimental_Effects_of_Immediate_Explanation_Feedback" rel="nofollow">formative test questions with immediate feedback</a> in online learning is a powerful way of boosting engagement and learning effectiveness. &nbsp;However, in a recent research paper, German researchers caution that, &ldquo;if adjunct questions are highly demanding, feedback might not only beneficially affect learning because it helps learners revise their comprehension difficulties; at the same time, it could also detrimentally affect learning by causing learners to invest less time in responding to subsequent adjunct questions, which lowers learner performance on these questions. &nbsp;This, in turn, could reduce learning outcomes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Completing the Loop</strong></p>
<p><em>[OU Learning Systems]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://melbourne-cshe.unimelb.edu.au/research/edutech/completing-the-loop" rel="nofollow">Completing the Loop</a> is an Australian project which investigated how learning analytics can be delivered to university teachers in meaningful ways that can help improve teaching and learning practices.&nbsp; The project acknowledges the opportunities to use data generated in technology-based learning systems to inform the enhancement of student support and curriculum design, but notes that many staff often lack the knowledge and skills to make best use of this.&nbsp; Key project deliverables are thus a comprehensive <a href="http://melbourne-cshe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/2083938/Loop_Handbook.pdf" rel="nofollow">handbook</a> (64pp PDF) and an open source <a href="https://github.com/looptool/download" rel="nofollow">toolkit</a>.</p>

<p>Tony Hirst has been compiling >a comprehensive series of blog posts exploring what&rsquo;s what in VR/AR</a>.&nbsp; As is always the case with Tony, you get great amounts of detail, opinions and practical examples (in this case, numerous YouTube clips) from these 30+ posts on his Digital Worlds blog.</p>

<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>The Smithsonian&rsquo;s Global Volcanism Program has been running since 1968, aiming to build a database of all known and confirmed volcanic eruptions for the last 10,000 years.&nbsp; Now a new <a href="http://volcano.si.edu/E3/" rel="nofollow">Eruptions, Earthquakes and Emissions web app</a> has been released, created by the Smithsonian with additional data from NASA and the US Geological Survey, that allows users to track seismic events using an interactive animated timeline.</p>

<p><strong>And Finally&hellip;</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired]</em></p>
<p>There is a new Donald Trump campaign website, <a href="http://www.deepdrumpf2016.com/" rel="nofollow">DeepDrumpf</a>, powered by a chatbot created by MIT researcher Brad Hayes.&nbsp; DeepDrumpf analyses transcripts of Trump&rsquo;s speeches to generate <a href="https://twitter.com/deepdrumpf" rel="nofollow">tweets that seem remarkably Trump-like</a>.&nbsp; According to Hayes, &ldquo;what comes out is stilted, unpredictable, sometimes not particularly comprehensible language &ndash; which means that it&rsquo;s a fairly accurate impersonation of the man himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&ldquo;I'm going to win like you wouldn't believe. I know how to be a politician in the US.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&ldquo;Together we can save America and use her weapons to defeat accountability and take back the world's money.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&ldquo;If I don't win in the end, I'll fire the entire American people. You cannot achieve peace if I don't want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if you donate to the campaign site, your money actually goes to the charity, Girls who Code.</p>    </div>
