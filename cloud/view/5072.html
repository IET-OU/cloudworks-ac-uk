<div>
<p>We are now ready to start some further discussions to support Unisa as it addresses a range of issues in the next few months. During March 2011 we will address topics raised regarding Unisa's Open and Distance Learning Model. &nbsp;Those members present in Kochi suggested we should try a 'Cloud' approach again to keep all comments together but contributions posted on the Cloud will also come into colleagues e mail boxes.</p>
<p>Unisa Colleagues have suggested that we deal with the following issues :</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><strong>March 2011:</strong>&nbsp;The Unisa ODL model-see attachment to email sent separately- is this a fair description of what Unisa is aiming at? Would colleagues please make comments on this and suggest changes if appropriate. &nbsp;Figure 2-- Technology and the Student Walk is perhaps the place to start. ( Can cloud experts tell me how to attach a word document to this cloud)</p>

                   <p>Dear Colleagues...</p>
<p>Thanks Roger for this invite. First...while I am no expert on the use of clouds, I guess you could simply copy the text of your attachment and paste it in the Tab "Add Extra Content" above. That way the content will be available on the cloud.....</p>
<p>To your question then&hellip;.on a quick read of the attachment you sent out, I felt all of that sounded very reasonable to me. But I found the last paragraph particularly useful and on target&hellip;. And the first bullet point in particular.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;First, we need to design a curriculum that is fit for purpose.</li>
<li>Second, we need to design learning pathways and learning activities that model the approaches to knowledge, learners and technology usage that we espouse.</li>
<li>Third, we then need to use the most appropriate technologies in the ways most appropriate to the learning intention taking cognisance of the (changing) technology profile of our students as well as their contexts of practice.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>You see the problem with the many challenges that confront not only DE but all forms of learning and teaching is that we do not pay enough attention to the role of the &ldquo;design of the curriculum including assessment and feedback&rdquo; in dealing with issues surrounding attrition, failure and attendance etc. Many of our DE teaching and learning practices are trying to approximate what happens in a residential classroom&hellip;implying as if that &hellip;that is some sort of a gold standard.</p>
<p>I believe, we need to rethink what comprises great teaching and learning and what&rsquo;s great in a F2F tutorial in a western educational setting might not be great for a DE setting in a developing educational context. And assessment and how is administered is a critical part of minimising attrition and non completion or non-attendance. Assessment should be designed in a way so that it is less cumbersome, easily done as part of one&rsquo;s studies, and not designed to eliminate and discriminate one from the other. Let&rsquo;s make assessment attractive to students for once!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks very much ,Som. &nbsp;Spot on I think. One of the key issues for Unisa is the 'Size and Shape' of the curriculum. &nbsp;By size I mean the number of programmes/courses/modules and by shape I mean the breadth of the curriculum and the methods used for teaching and assessment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any up to date information from Unisa colleagues on these topics? &nbsp;Could you let us have the information. say , of the numbers of courses with less than 100 undergraduate students.</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>Dear Roger and Som (and others)</p>
<p>I think you both pointed to the notion that curriculum design, development and presentation (delivery) is core to DE and ODL (as it is to other educational enterprises). Som pointed to the fact that often curricula are developed in ODL contexts trying to "mimic" residential education and secondly, copying western educational paradigms and models.</p>
<p>At present Unisa offers over 3 200 modules which in certain combinations add up to a number of certificates, diplomas and degrees (617). I will try to find out how many of these modules have less than 100 students. We are in the process of urgently looking at rationalising the number of modules offered, but it promises to be a messy (if not bloody) process. There are many reasons for the current amount of modules. Firstly, there was the merger in 2004 between three institutions, and each one of them had its own OQM. I think at the merger the total number of modules was over 7 000! The second reason for the number is the fact that Unisa is the only dedicated ODL institution in South Africa and therefore many academics feel that Unisa should be everything to everyone. The lastly is the fact that we are also a comprehensive institution meaning that we offer (and are mandated to offer) a range of qualifications and programmes ranging from vocational to academic.</p>
<p>There is currently a discussion document which details the criteria Unisa will use to determine the viability of offerings. These criteria include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; History, development and alignment with Unisa&rsquo;s vision and mission</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; External demand over a given period</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost per CESM category</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Course success rate</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Market share</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quality of teaching input and research</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opportunity analysis of the programme or modules</p>
<p>Lastly from my side, I think you were both very spot-on in pointing to the centrality of curriculum in taking Unisa forward into the next 10 years. But curriculum, as we know, is never neutral and always in service of some orthodoxy and meta-narrative, whether the discipline, the particular interests of an academic, the market, industry, institutional and departmental politics. And all of this is often defended in the name of "academic freedom". Paul</p>        </div>

                   <p>Dear Colleagues</p>
<p>Unisa recently reported on its United Nations Global Compact compliance that in 2010 there were 4180 modules of which 644 or 15% were UNGC compliant. As Paul has noted this is a massive reduction on the 7900 modules in various states ranging from active&nbsp;to phasing out at the the time we were preparing for the COL and HEQC audits. The modules offered in 2010 were distributed over the five Colleges as follows: CAES 473, CEMS 780, CHS 1874, CLAW 397, CSET 656. Actual enrolments by CESM category in 2009 were: SET 28 529, business/management 108 286, education 43 175, other humanities 83 569. On the face of it, business/management seems quite lean but almost everybody else seems to offer too many electives.</p>
<p>I think an obligation of having academic freedom is to make a reasoned argument in defence of your curriculum and in a developing economy in which we need to rob Peter to pay Paul (and Paul certainly deserves to be paid!), input/output viability MUST be one of the criteria. It is always interesting how often the same staff who feel overworked and underappreciated (and we have the odd person servicing multiple modules; and the odd person responsible for 8000 UG students on their own; and even some other odd staff with 20+ post graduate students) will be the very same people fighting to retain modules in the curriculum. Doing fewer things better makes more sense to me. And restricting electives to final year so that when we have the bulk of the numbers we are dealing with generic foundational content also makes more sense to me. But equally key is that the curriculum design process needs to talk about learning resources, assessment and mediation/support in an integrated way. Too often in many of the institutions I have worked with&nbsp;it is, in fact, covered in a linear way: a very broad curriculum outline is approved (with lots of very broad statements about assessment and support), then sometime later assignments and exams are developed; and then sometime later somebody thinks about whether we might need some discussion classes or tutorials etc. The result is a very fragmented learning experience. Of course there are also lots of examples of just the opposite and Unisa has recently provided a number of opportunities for staff to showcase examples of best practice too.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Dear Paul, Tony and everyone</p>
<p>Very interesting points above</p>
<p>I have a few further- heretical - thoughts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choice is not necessarily a good thing- it can confuse as well as offer opportunities.</p>
<p>Tony says&nbsp; 'Doing fewer things bettermakes more sense to me'---- And to me</p>
<p>The curriculum should not be provider (individula academic) driven.&nbsp; It should address the needs of the learners.&nbsp; An institution cannot be all things to all people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One accepts that at post graduate and 3rd year honours levels there will logically be fewer students as some electives are important and also where a programme is vital for the 'balance of a University&nbsp; curriculum, even though not all that many students may wish to study it in a particular year, then thi sshould be 'subsidised' by more popular programmes.</p>
<p>As Paul says difficult things to address but with a new top senior management, in their first year, now is the time perhaps.</p>
<p>Could someone alos update us on whether programmes are still provided in Africaans ( an perhaps other languages), why is this and what is the additional cost/benefit?</p>
<p>What do others think.&nbsp; I am going to copy this into an email to those yet to engage in the hope they will do so</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Hi Roger and Colleagues</p>
<p>In response to the last point, Unisa's statutes define it as a dual language institution - in principle all materials should be made available in both English and Afrikaans. This means that provision should be made for translation and , because a growing number of staff do not have English or Afrikaans as a home language, also provision for general language editing. A few modules are offered only in English.</p>
<p>I think it is a good idea to use email as a back up: maybe more people will contribute then.</p>
<p>I was wondering how other ODL institutions help staff understand the systemic nature of ODL ...?</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p><br /> Hi Roger and colleagues,</p>
<p>Thanks for an interesting document on&nbsp;<em>'Synergy and Systems Coherence in the Core Business of Teaching and Learning at UNISA'&nbsp;</em>and for the useful discussion so far. Broadly speaking, I found the paper appropriate and helpful overall, echoing Som's initial view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few thoughts to contribute:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Just going back to that initial title and paper, I wondered whether in the specification of the&nbsp;'hierarchy in decision-making implied in this section' there is - possibly? - an underlying but unspoken assumption that the whole system &#40;indeed arguably of every educational system whether F2F, ODL, DE&#41; is built on the aim of learner achievement (i.e. effective access, meaningful learning, progression and success (e.g. in terms of UNISA's commitment to making a difference in the communities it serves, in meeting its&nbsp;values of 'excellence, integrity, and social justice and fairness'). i.e., as Glennie and Mays (2009) put it, 'the&nbsp;purpose of a distance education institution is to create opportunities for quality teaching and learning'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am here agreeing with Roger's point that " The curriculum should not be provider (individula academic) driven.&nbsp; It should address the needs of the learners.&nbsp; An institution cannot be all things to all people."</p>
<p>So, just looking at those 3 aspects of decision-making, it&nbsp;<em>might&nbsp;</em>be helpful to say a bit more about students/learners in here, if addressing the needs of learners are a key priority:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we need to design a curriculum that is fit for purpose.</li>
<li>Second, we need to design learning pathways and learning activities that model the approaches to knowledge, learners and technology usage that we espouse.</li>
<li>Third, we then need to use the most appropriate technologies in the ways most appropriate to the learning intention taking cognisance of the (changing) technology profile of our students as well as their contexts of practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it the case that, at every stage of the above, arguably, an overall mission <em>- to achieve effective student/learner access, meaningful learning, appropriate support, retention, student/learner achievement and alumni engagement in a diverse variety of contexts -</em> is the underlying but unstated priority?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the case, would it be worth saying so in those 3 &nbsp;bullet points? (e.g First, we need to design a curriculum that is fit for the purpose .... of academic achievement for a diverse variety of learners? ... of effective learner access and progression, etc?)&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Or </em>would that be making assumptions here that don't fit the purpose? I recognise what Paul says re. the conceptualisation of the curriculum being never value-neutral but always in the service of some orthodoxy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NB - Inter alia, I would of course agree that universities such as UNISA also have many other goals, including quality academic, research and knowledge development, academic freedom, intellectual rigor, etc., so of course the items above need to be seen in the complexity of that overall context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2).&nbsp;<em>Simplicity</em>: I agree with Roger that "Choice is not necessarily a good thing- it can confuse as well as offer opportunities" and with Roger's and Tony's view that&nbsp;'Doing fewer things better makes more sense to me'.</p>
<p>The idea of the hedgehog (one big thing) and the fox &nbsp;(many little things) is interesting here.</p>
<p>I would have thought that, by its nature, UNISA must continue to deliver many things (diverse, large content) to many people (huge audience).</p>
<p>But perhaps a commitment to greater simplicity of systems as well as prioritisation in terms of decision-making processes, numbers of modules, etc., may be helpful. In other words, possibly the 'hedgehog'-like characteristics of 'doing one big thing well' could be applied in terms of <em>systems, processes, technologies, delivery mechanisms, </em>etc., since the audience and content structures are by definition multiple and complex.</p>
<p>3) The 'technology and the learner walk' concept and outline is useful. I agree with the relatively strong emphasis on formative assessment, as, from my experience, that is so crucial for learner support and acheivement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I just wondered whether more detail is needed at the 'Graduation and Alumni' stages. We seem to jump from examination to graduation to alumni without very many 'steps' of processes being specified at the last stage.</p>
<p>I also wondered about the 'teaching and learning' main stage which is described as 'maintenance/ formative assessment' (mmm&hellip; isn&rsquo;t there more about delivery needed here?), re. whether this could be specified a bit more in terms of content delivery processes and also social engagement/formation of a community of learners?&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) I also agreed with Tony that 'the curriculum design process needs to talk about learning resources, assessment and mediation/support in an integrated way' in order to avoid an overly linear and 'very fragmented learning experience'. That is really important, particularly with a very large, dispersed, diverse and complex DE learner group with (in many cases) significant learning challenges.</p>
<p>So in terms of achieving 'simplicity, flexibility, reliability, economy, and acceptability', I would think it is important to ensure that the integration of all of those processes is conceptualised at the design process stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5). Finally, Paul and Som make some useful points re. the fact that&nbsp;'curricula are developed in ODL contexts trying to "mimic" residential education and secondly, copying western educational paradigms and models'. In the redesign of curricula, the extent/feasibility of consultation/trialling/discussion with various diverse ODL student audience groups is worth considering, if you haven&rsquo;t done so already, to ensure these issues are addressed.</p>
<p>Email as a back up might be a good idea if others have not responded within a day or two, maybe?</p>
<p>Cheers - have a great weekend all :-)</p>

                   <div>Hi all,</div>
<div></div>
<div>Just to flesh out what I mean in (1) above, a little more detail might be helpful, e.g.:&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li>First, we need to design a curriculum that is fit for <em>the overall</em> purpose of <em>learner achievement in diverse ways and contexts.</em></li>
<li>Second, we need to design <em>and implement</em> learning pathways and learning activities that model <em>the mission, values</em> and approaches to knowledge, learners and technology usage that we espouse.</li>
<li>Third, we then need to use the most appropriate technologies in the ways most appropriate to the learning intention <em>and needs of students</em>, taking cognisance of the (changing) technology profile of our students as well as their contexts of practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;But maybe this is not really appropriate - so the above is just a rough suggestion for a bit more decision-making focus on learners/ students' achievements, mission and values around that, need to integrate design with implementation, and needs of learners, etc.</p>
<p>All best :-)</p>

                   <p>Hallo all</p>
<p>Apologies for entering the discussion late.</p>
<p>In relation to Roger's point about different languages, I think this is absolutely crucial. There is a very interesting article in Open Learning by Carol Bertram from the University of KwaZulu Natal&nbsp; (21 [1] 2006)which demonstrates that more than a third of students on a PGCE were reading a key text at "frustration level " and 90% were working outside their home language.</p>
<p>I was very interested in figure 2 "the student walk" which has a very similar framework to something we have in the OU Uk which we call "the student journey". Our version varies from this one mainly I think in that we have the equivalent of another column which looks at the process from a student's perspective eg "I need to be able to access the internet" - and then what the institution needs to do to support them.</p>
<p>I'm happy to expand if anyone is interested!</p>
<p>Best wishes to all</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>Dear Roger et al</p>
<p>With regard to the issue of offering tuition in either Afrikaans and English:</p>
<p>Unisa accepted a Lnguage Policy which commits Unisa to increasingly offer tuition (where at all possible and appropriate) in <strong>all 11 official languages.</strong> Many modules already have multilingual glossaries and explanations. At present the Afrikaans students are advantaged above other students and this is a higly contested issue. This is a legay from the Apartheid era and has seriously disadvantaged the "academic development" of other indigenous languages which do not have the necessary vocabulary to engage with subjects such as law, chemistry, physics, computing, etc.</p>
<p><em>There is however more to this very sensitive issue.</em></p>
<p>1. Many Afrikaans students chose to study Computing in English due to the nature of the subject. Generally their competency in English as their second language is better than students of other cultural groups due to the legacy of secondary schooling.</p>
<p>2. Many modules at Unisa make use of prescribed text books that are mostly available only in English. Many of these text books are written from a North-Atlantic context. Should study guides be translated into other indigenous languages, it will still not solve the issue of these "primary" texts. It may help though.</p>
<p>3. If I understand it correctly, the Open University Business School is now offering a management development diploma in Russia in which all materials are translated into Russia and Russian tutors used. Examination papes are written in Russian and the a number of these papers (if I have my facts correct) are translated back into English to allow for moderation. The results of the moderation is then translated back into Russian. Imagine doing this for 11 languages... Except for the immense practicalities involved, South Africa has a huge shortage of skilled people with the necessary academic background who will translate, tutor/teach, mark and moderate these papers.</p>
<p>4. Though studying in yoru home language is an important aspect in student success, <em>I do suspect that it is neither the only issue,nor the most important issue.</em> Many (if not most) students are totally unprepared for higher education and open distance learning.</p>
<p>Unisa has now raised the minimum admission requirements so that only students with 40% and higher in the language of tuition (Afrikaans or English) can register for a diploma or a degree. The decision will serve at our Senate this coming Wednesday. Students between 40-49% in the language of tuition are furthermore restricted to 4 modules in the first year of registration and one of these modules must be a language module.&nbsp; We will also offer specific support to these students. Students with 50% or higher in the language of tuition can study unrestricted.&nbsp; Students with 30-39% in the langauge of tuition can only register for a higher certificate.</p>
<p>This is a highly emotional issue. I think outside of the isue of English and Afrikaans, there is enough international research that shows a correlation between marks in school English and success in higher education where the language of tuition is in English. This is the basis for raising the bar, while we attend to issues such as multilingual glossaries, etc.</p>
<p>And then there is the issue of the globalisation and internationalisation of higher education which actually requires our graduates to be, amongst other things, very fluent in English...</p>
<p>Apologies for this rather lengthy posting, but at least it porvides some background for the debate. Paul</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks very much Paul and Anne</p>
<p>I think we should leave the language issue now--- unless anyone is burning to add something else- it's obviously very difficult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One final point from me; yes it is best if people can study in their first language or at least be assess in it but the costs are horrendous.</p>
<p>The OU does the Russion thing but the Russian's don't half pay for it!!</p>
<p>OU Welsh students can as of legal right get advice and information in Welsh and can attend welsh speaking face to face tutorials ( Anne will correct me here if I am out of date) but it is far too expensive to enable them to study or be assessed in Welsh.</p>
<p>Would any of you like to comment on any other aspect in &nbsp;the original papers?</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>Hello everyone, my response is an attempt to build on comments about curriculum design and planning, how to do fewer things better, and providing access, meaningful learning, and appropriate support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Synergy and Systems discussion paper presents a range of technical and organizational strategies for managing provision, but as Som and Jill have noted, the three points at the end of the document highlight the essential issues about enabling successful learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Someone at UNISA told me some time ago that the entry level distance learning courses include resources and coaching that are explicitly intended to enable learners to become more aware of the range of learning skills they need for university studies, and to begin developing these skills. However, most strategies for teaching and learning listed in Figure 2 do not really address this aspect of developing a range and depth of learning skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does UNISA have model of building learning capacity throughout the earlier levels of programs, in large enrolment courses, so that learners, as they progress through a program, develop their capacity to pursue studies independently and/or collaboratively? If so, can this model be developed further so that more advanced courses, typically with lower enrolments, use much more collaborative learning and independent research? This type of programme structure could achieve educational goals and cost efficiencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As Paul and Tony noted, a typical challenge in planning curricula, especially in distance learning, is finding cost-effective ways of providing the required courses at senior levels, with much smaller enrolments. Yet providing these senior courses is essential for ensuring that learners are able to complete their qualifications. As well, senior courses tend to be more specialized to enable learners to pursue specific areas of interest and develop expertise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If the entry level courses can effectively enable students to acquire the range of learning skills they need for continuing their studies, would it be possible to create a two-tiered model of program design, so that the entry level provides more extensive support that enables learners to gradually develop skills in learning independently, discussion, research, collaboration that they can then use in more advanced level courses? In distance and conventional delivery, although there are usually much larger numbers in entry level courses, the tutor-hours per student tends to be much higher at senior levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, at the entry level, large scale courses tend to be tutored on an industrial model, with each tutor having a large volume of assignments to mark, and tutor-learner interactions tend to be more functional- "you need to fix this"... rather than developmental-- "if you can build on this strength, then you can explore this...".&nbsp; In large-scale courses, tutors (often paid on a per-assignment basis) typically have limited time to respond to each student, and little incentive to engage in the level of coaching and discourse that could help identify which learning skills a student needs to strengthen.</p>
<p>Some strategies in Figure 2 that could help develop learning skills are online or telephone discussions, for assignment preparation and feedback, and for key topics in a course. Are these possibilities to explore and build on?</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>Dear Colleagues</p>
<p>Thank you for the recent additions to this discussion. I am working on a follow up document on OA and find the suggestions and questions very useful.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to the need for a proper curriculum development process to address many of these issues (and thankfully Unisa recently approved a curriculum policy). Jill's further nuancing of the three core issues is very helpful in this respect. A proper curriculum process would think about where students are when they apply. And then look at multiple routes in for different needs. Work has begun on this at both a national and institutional level but there is a long way still to go. One of the challenges is that we could end up paying university level salaries to address school-higher education interface needs and the current funding arrangements militate against this. Unisa and the universities that historically have catered for previously disadvantaged communites tend to attract a disproportionate share of the less well prepared for HE study so there is a need for a lot more support at the entry level - which is obviously very costly. Personally I think the transition from spoon-fed schooling to jump-in-at-the-deep-end HE is not managed very well in HE generally.</p>
<p>In response to one of Jennifer's queries, strictly speaking programmes are offered at different levels of a national qualifications framework in which the move from level 5 (first year) to levels 7/8 (graduation) are theorectially informed by different level descriptors related to increased levels of conceptual complexity on the one hand and increasing levels of student autonomy on the other. I have found it VERY difficult to cajole discipline experts to think in this way, however. It requires a whole programme perspective and mapping of concepts and assessment tasks across modules and levels - in&nbsp;most cases in most institutions I have worked with - different modules are characterised by different content&nbsp;- but the teaching approach does not really&nbsp;change. So I think this is a key issue to address at the curriculum planning level.</p>
<p>On a related issue, a stronger whole programe orientation suggests the need to clarify and support the role of programme managers. Unisa policy supports a teamwork approach to curriculum and materials development but a programme manager also needs to engage with other support systems in a continuous way e.g. assignments, finance, exams, regional centres, ICT, library services as champion for the programme and its students. A fine arts programme has different needs from a physics programme which is again different from the needs of a programme in guidance and counselling. There has to be some flexibility&nbsp;between core systems and processes and the ability to tailor to suit different programme needs.</p>
<p>This takes us nicely into Anne's point about looking at what programmes require from a student perspective - maybe it needs to be a twofold/ three fold engagement: based on evidence from practice and related research e.g. what are the learning needs for a particular programme purpose then: what does this mean for students, what does this mean for teachers and what are the implications for university systems. What compromises can we / should we make?</p>

<p>I think we have come to the end of out comments on this topic. &nbsp;On refelction I don't think it is particu;arly helpful to summarise and so I propose we move on to the next topic for which I will set up a new cloud.Many thanks to those of you who have contributed; I hope UNISA colleagues have found it of some us.</p>
