        <h3>Title</h3>
<p>Teaching Support Workers to Convert Print to Alternative Formats</p>
<h3>Narrator</h3>
<p>I facilitated the session.</p>
<h3>Situation</h3>
<p>Training sessions are scheduled on an ad-hoc basis throughout the year, as required.&nbsp; Sessions are offered to Educational Support Workers (recruited solely to work with disabled students) and to members of staff throughout the institution. Training sessions take place in a small computer room within the library.&nbsp; There are 8 PC&rsquo;s, arranged in 2 rows, and one for the facilitator, which is attached to a projector.&nbsp; Each PC has a book scanner.&nbsp; The room has height adjustable desks, and additional resources, such as a Braille printer and CCTV (<a href="http://www.specialneedscomputers.ca/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1553" rel="nofollow">http://www.specialneedscomputers.ca/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=1553</a>)&nbsp; is available.&nbsp; The room is usually used as an open access lab for students with disabilities.</p>
<p>There were a total of 5 people in the session, myself, 3 support workers and a student with whom one of the trainee&rsquo;s would be working.&nbsp; For this session the student would assess/provide authentic feedback for all learners.</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>The objective of the session was for the support workers to be able to convert inaccessible printed or electronic materials into an alternative format so students could access it effectively.&nbsp; In this session this was Braille.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ol start="1">
<li>Contacted all participants with information about date, time, venue, etc</li>
<li>Welcome</li>
<li>Introduction &ndash; interactive session asking what is Braille.&nbsp; Examples provided.</li>
<li>Alphabet exercise. Braille alphabet provided, along with a brief message in Braille &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to decipher.</li>
<li>Introduction (cont) - What we are trying to achieve and why</li>
<li>Demonstration of process</li>
<li>Materials to be converted handed out</li>
<li>Tutor guided activity &ndash; conversion of materials</li>
<li>Students try to convert further materials &ndash; supported by tutor</li>
<li>Results checked by visually impaired student</li>
<li>Feedback provided to learners</li>
<li>Further attempts of conversion, some with inappropriate (diagrams/photographs/etc) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and electronic texts &ndash; introduction to advanced features if required</li>
<li>Further feedback.</li>
<li>Summary/conclusions</li>
<li>Provision of supporting materials</li>
</ol>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>By then end of the session the learners could take printed text and inaccessible electronic texts and convert to Braille.&nbsp; In addition, they learned why this is necessary, and why in some cases it would not be appropriate/desirable to do this in all situations.&nbsp; As the conversion is a two step process they could also convert to electronic text (where necessary).&nbsp; Students also learned why this was necessary, and what other formats could be created from electronic texts (though not how to do so).&nbsp; Having a student there meant that they were able to receive authentic feedback, and see how results could be improved in real time.&nbsp; This meant that, once completed students were offered high quality support, which is noted in responses to our annual student survey.</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>The best part of this session is the feedback provided by the student, without this it loses much of its authenticity, and believability.&nbsp; Learners seem to be able to better understand the difficulties when they can see them for themselves, rather than having them explained by a trainer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hands on approach also seems to be popular with learners, as this is a practical task and the experience of doing it seems to keep everyone engaged.&nbsp; Working in small groups allows the support workers to discuss problems/progress with one another (especially as the same student evaluates all work so can compare), which keeps the session light-hearted.</p>

                   <p>Hi Ashleigh.</p>
<p>I think this is a fantastic idea. I've previously tried (and &nbsp;failed) to learn Braille.</p>
<p>I just had a couple of questions:</p>
<p>i) How long does this session run for?</p>
<p>ii) This isn't really related to your learning design, but how do visually-impaired students cope with the rigours of higher education? I ask, because i) I imagine that reading Braille is slower than text even for experts, ii) Are the majority of key texts available in Braille?</p>

                   <p>Yes&nbsp; -&nbsp; the important thing seems to be translation process.&nbsp; I would guess they're using some sort of automatic translation technology&nbsp; -&nbsp; they couldn't learn the braille alphabet that fast.&nbsp; I've never learned braille, but I've learned the morse code alphabet, which is comparable.&nbsp; It took me several weeks and a lot of revision, and I'm a fast learner.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks for your comments.</p>
<p>Braille is tough to learn, and I can fully appreciate how you could end up giving up!&nbsp; I learned by default (my Mam is blind and solely uses Braille and my Dad is registered Blind although uses large print too).&nbsp; I must admit though that I can only sight read it, which is common for sighted people.&nbsp; It did require a lot of immersion/practice in order to pick it up (and even now I need to think about it as I dont read much any more).&nbsp; To answer Sreedhar's questions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">i) The session is scheduled for a half day, although there is a break (for those who want it - often people like to work though it (by work, I mean talk about the Braille/conversion process - practical things do tend to increase participation))ii) Although not true for all Braille users, many have been using it as their preferred format for a number of years, and as such they are proficcient in reading this, and can read as quickly as sighted students.&nbsp; You do raise a couple of interesting isses with your question, however, as some materials (such as diagrams/pictures) are not always easily accessible in Braille and other formats need to be used.&nbsp; Also, depending on the course many materials may not be availble (although often electronic versions are available which can be converted).&nbsp; The availability tends to be subject specific - those studying English Literature will find more available texts than Law, for example.&nbsp; The RNIB are building a catalogue of texts to attempt to address this, with more being added on demand.&nbsp; This is, of course, time consuming, and as such many VI students find accedding materials difficult as they do not get hold of a copy of a text until 6-8 weeks into term.&nbsp; This is highlights the importance of the conversion process.&nbsp; Conversion techniques are also important for course packs/handouts, etc, which often consist of extracts from a number of different sources.</p>
<p>In recent years it has become much less common (in my personal experience) for visually impaired UK students to rely on Braille, with many using electronic formats as their preferred choice.</p>        </div>
