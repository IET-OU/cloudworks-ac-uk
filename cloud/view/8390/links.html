<h2>Title <em>Coaching instrumentalists in Military Bands</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>Tutor responsible for introducing the idea of coaching to members of the bands.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>I was requested to give a 1 hour presentation about coaching instrumentalists in Military Bands. The audience was a whole group of experienced musicians, some of these being leaders in their respective instrumental sections. The audience was assembled in a lecture theatre type hall for a whole set of lectures and activities linked to their work within bands. I was presented as the teacher, &lsquo;authority&rsquo;.&nbsp; They expected a PowerPoint presentation comprising set of facts that would allow them to coach younger musicians.&nbsp; This expectation stems from the militaristic culture to learning that they are used to. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>I was trying to get them to think about the concept of learning and support initiated by a provocative act, gain some experience and insight by means of a practical session, as well as offer some personal experience.&nbsp; According to the feedback received, my alternative approach was well received.</em></p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>Initial act: Icebreaker</em></p>
<p><em>I asked them to pronounce my surname &lsquo;Czepiel&rsquo;; after several incorrect attempts, put up &lsquo;Czech Republic&rsquo; then asked some others the same request. After hearing the first &ndash; and correct &ndash; answer, I asked them whether I had taught them anything.&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The group was divided equally into those who thought I had taught them something, and those who felt otherwise. &nbsp;The group were challenged by un-militaristic approach, asking their views and not spoon-feeding them information. This seemed to interest them and initiated quite open and interesting comments and discussions throughout the session.</em></p>
<p><em>Main part: Coaching Scenario.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;I had a real band musician who had agreed to be a guinea-pig learner and asked individuals in the group to come and act the role of a music coach.&nbsp; We worked our way through about ten minutes work of an actual coaching session, which was interpolated by a &lsquo;pause in the action&rsquo; to reflect on what had just happened and to critically evaluate the action of the person coaching, and what others would have done instead.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The primary issue I tried to emphasise was to put the learner at the centre of the activity, the focus for comment. This I needed to repeat several times when asking for comments on the actions observed.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>A few of the group seemed to dominate discussion and answers in particular.&nbsp; This I addressed directly by saying &lsquo;can someone else answer the question...?&rsquo; This worked even though there were some slight pauses, or I had to actually ask individuals to respond.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Concluding summary. </em></p>
<p><em>I summed up some of the more important points raised in the session, stressing the fundamental idea of putting the musician/learner at the centre of the activity and suggesting coachers should not overstep their capabilities.&nbsp; </em></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>Certainly the learners were engaged with the activity.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;I expected there to be those who dominated the discussion, and some more passive learners.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>I id not expect the learners to have such a strong set of viewpoints and heated discussions to take place between the.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>I was surprised they were glad not to have a PowerPoint presentation.</em></p>
<p><em>List the expected and unexpected outcomes of your actions. To what degree did you meet your objectives? What additional outcomes did you engender? Provide evidence to back your claims.</em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>Certainly an older and more experienced individuals can have strong views. Be prepared to cope with these and views contrary to my own.</em></p>
<p><em>Many of the things I wanted them to appreciate was articulated by members of the group. By given them some ownership of the learning, they engaged much more.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I was surprised by the range of reactions to the session, ranging from quite &lsquo;surface&rsquo; approach by a few individuals to much more &lsquo;deep&rsquo;, open and inquiring approaches from others. </em></p>
