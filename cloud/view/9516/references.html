<p>This project consists of a weekly emailed writing tip by subscription, which links back to a website with the writing tip topics further developed on it.&nbsp; It is an open project suitable for any report writer globally.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Many United Nations staff members write reports daily and require support in their often solitary task.&nbsp; For 12 years I have been the only trainer in Geneva to support these writers and my services are in too high a demand to meet the needs. With technology and more limited resources, United Nations trainers are now asked by the General Assembly to design courses online or in blended solutions accessible to staff members globally.&nbsp; We should be more inclusive and efficient in our course offerings, combine our efforts across the duty stations and achieve this by 2017. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The project</h2>
<p>To bridge the gap, I have designed a website and email service with a weekly writing tip to whet writers&rsquo; appetites.&nbsp; This website and email subscription will also serve as a way to make contact with those in the field, to help old students and new ones alike and to broaden my reach to any writer.&nbsp;&nbsp; My theme is inclusion of staff globally, taking care to include those with disabilities too.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This presentation describes the project and the steps taken to bring it to fruition.&nbsp; It presents the challenges I encountered, and my efforts to make my website and service accessible to all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensuring accessibility is the greatest challenge of all, as accessing technology in emerging countries will present difficulties.&nbsp; I will need to be flexible and creative to find solutions when faced with unexpected difficulties with clients located globally.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The website</h2>
<p class="zn-bodyparagraph">For the website, I selected weebly.com.&nbsp; It is accessible on computers, mobile and smart phones, and a tablet.&nbsp; This is important as many UN peacekeepers are located in Africa, which has some of the lowest fixed-broadband subscription rates in the world, and where mobile phones prevail and smart phones are entering the market. &nbsp;It also seems to support the features of accessibility for people with various disabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Selecting content</h2>
<p class="zn-bodyparagraph">First, I am basing my decision on what content to display by consulting the results of a needs survey I conducted.&nbsp; It will also inform my decision on how to display the content.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="zn-bodyparagraph">I will turn my manuals into webpages, using html instead of pdf.&nbsp; According to feedback, I should make the weekly tips short in order to entice busy people into signing up. They will have a link to the website, which can give more information for those interested.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Needs analysis and evaluation</h2>
<p class="zn-bodyparagraph">As a networked practitioner, I carried out a needs survey and solicited feedback and informed my future clients through Twitter, Yammer, Unite Connections, my Facebook, a Facebook writers&rsquo; group, and through email mailings to old students, current students and to focal points in the United Nations.&nbsp; Any unexpected opportunities or challenges that arose as a result of my extensive networking will also be reported on.</p>

<p>Here are quotes from the resolution adopted by the United Nations 69<sup>th</sup> Session of the General Assembly in August 2015 which support my project.&nbsp; Specifically,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Item&nbsp; 46. Requests the Secretary-General to continue the efforts to ensure that training opportunities in the six official languages are <strong>equally available to all staff</strong>; &lsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Item 56. &hellip; encourages &hellip; the Department of Field Support and the Office of Human Resources</p>
<p>Management of the Secretariat to continue to cooperate closely, from within existing</p>
<p>resources, t<strong>o support the language learning needs of staff in the field,</strong> &hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>It also states that: &lsquo;Recognizing further &hellip; &nbsp;the importance of the capacity to communicate to the peoples of the world in their own languages, <strong>including in formats accessible to persons with disabilities.&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>The main audience for this service is United Nations report writers globally, but I have adopted an open approach to broaden my reach.&nbsp;</p>

			<h3>Technology and geographical considerations.</h3>
<p class="zn-bodyparagraph">Factors to consider for technological access include geographical location, internet connection requirements, bandwidth, what device the clients will use - &nbsp;computers, cell phones or tablets (FAO, 2011, p.29, 54), and ensuring that the website is clear on a mobile device (Redish, 2012, pp.119-122).&nbsp; In emerging countries where Peacekeepers and Human Rights officers are mostly stationed, this is a significant factor.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="zn-bodyparagraph">According to Veselinovic and Clements (2015), most people in Africa use a mobile phone.&nbsp; Africa has a weak land-line infrastructure, which makes connecting through a desktop computer difficult. &nbsp;This research is further validated by PewGlobal.org, 2015 in Figure 10 below. &nbsp;&lsquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://pewrsr.ch/Technology2015&text=A median of 84% across the 32 nations own a cell phone, not far off from the U.S. figure of 90%" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A median of 84% across the 32 nations (surveyed) own a cell phone, not far off from the U.S. figure of 90%.</a>&rsquo;</p>
