        <p>This activity is a variant on the idea of a webquest, it provides a fun ways of exploring the cloudworks site and sharing findings. The aim is to explore the site and to give you an idea of what it contains and how it can be used.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you haven't already done so, create a <strong>Cloudworks account </strong>(you can view anything on the site, but to post comments or add anything you need an account)<strong><br /></strong></li>
<li>Spend a max of fifteen minutes <strong>exploring cloudworks </strong>(suggested stategies - browse clouds and cloudscapes, enter keywords in search, explore by tags, look at individual people's profiles </li>
<li>You may wish to open your search in a <strong>new tab or page </strong>in your browser so that you can easily navigate back to this cloud</li>
<li>If you are new to cloudworks you might like to take a look at our <a href="/cloudscape/view/1911" rel="nofollow">'using cloudworks cloudscape'</a>.</li>

                   <p>I've just arrived at Cloudworks and have learnt a lot about using it from this challenge. In fact, I'd recommend students on H800 complete the challenge first before they attempt Activity 4 (which brings us here). I was unclear about what I actually had to do for the activitiy and this isn't a good frame of mind to be in when exploring a new application! When I was more familiar with Cloudworks (via the challenge), focusing on what I was meant to do for Activity 4 was better - but that may say more about me than the activitiy!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hiya Rosemary thanks for this - nope I think it says more about how I set the activities! ;-) I am glad you found the challenge useful. I was stuggling to try and find a way to get users to get to grips with the site and the concepts as it is new and different, without them having to wade through a long, boring click and turn tutorial. Doing something active, looking for things seemed more authentic as that is of course (hopefully!!!) what people will be doing when they come to the sites. Looking forward very much to seeing how you and the others get on with the site and to hear your thoughts on it. The vision behind it is a site to try and harnes the best of web 2.0 practices but specifically to help practitioners share good practice in learning and teaching.</p>        </div>

                   <p>That is precisely the point I made in an Elluminate tutorial with my study group yesterday.&nbsp; I see it as a site that would support educators, reducing the need for google searches, teacher.net searches, etc.&nbsp; I already found several items that will be useful not only for me but also for my trainee teachers.</p>
<p>Having read Conole et al's chapter, familiarity of software is a big driver for such sites and from the feedback my peers gave yesterday I could see their reluctance in using cloudworks.&nbsp; Maybe it also has something to do with word association.&nbsp; To me using this site appeals just because of the entity of clouds as a medium!&nbsp; For others, it may not have the same connotation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has cloudworks been publicised?&nbsp; I haven't heard about it before.</p>
<p>I like it and am definitely going to use it.&nbsp; I presume that anyone can have access by registering?</p>        </div>

                   <p>:-) thanks Khorshed!!! That is totally the vision we have. In terms of your colleagues reluctance I think there are two important things. Firstly, in reality not everyone is going to like this type of site, not everyone likes to participate in such an open way. This is a fact of modern technologies and indeed has always been the case. Some people love the telephone, some people hate it! Secondly, the site is a new way of doing things, there are new concepts to get to grips with and as with all web 2.0 tools it takes time to understand how to appropriate it to your own interests and context.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks for the cloudquest, it was a great way to get to know the site - which I was aware of before (as an OU member of staff) but which I had never properly explored. As someone else said, there is just so much! - it makes me feel like my head is an exploding&nbsp;cloud - but&nbsp;I&nbsp;know it's going to be a&nbsp;really useful resource for up to date info.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I too found the challenge a useful introduction before attempting H800 Activity 4.<br /><br />I would also recommed reading the article <em>Computers and Education</em> (Conole and Culver, 2010) from Activity 11 as it meant exploring the site was more interesting knowing a bit of the background:&nbsp;the vision, concepts&nbsp;and development phases. <br /><br />I think it may also help to explain why the content you're looking for may not be on the site yet - it's still evolving and so as it becomes more widely used hopefully more content will be added.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Another H800 student here...</p>
<p>As a newcomer to education as a student I have been completely overwhelmed by the availability of resources&nbsp; and the use of technology in a creative way to give access to expertise and experience. Great site and great idea.</p>
<p>I am sure it will be very useful and it is very easy to pick it up, concepts and the execution of it very good. So very user friendly.</p>
<p>It seems to be a form of social networking site with a preselected community of interested parties.</p>
<p>I think that the major challenge will be that there is so many sites all forming communities and whilst this has the added benefit of connecting resources to the discussions I wonder whether people will struggle with trying to keep everthing connected.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi everyone - glad to hear that you are finding the site useful and that the challenge was a good way of getting to know it. As Melanie says the computer and education paper gives more details behind the vision for the site, there is also an<a href="http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet25/conole.html" rel="nofollow"> ajet paper </a>which talks more about the theoretical underpinnings.</p>
<p>I agree with your final point Marie about the challenge of how to keep up - to be honest I dont think we can! It's just a fact that we have to accept and we each have to find our own strategies for coping, our own set of sites and mechanisms for communicating that suit us.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi, all I'm also impressed by the range and potential of Cloudworks, and can think of numerous occassions when it would have been useful to me! And will be in the future I'm sure. I do wonder, though, as others have above -</p>
<p>a. whether you are promoting the site in educational communities where it would be useful? - or do non-OU subscribers just 'come across it' if they're lucky? This is something I woinder about a number of non-commercial online resources and initiatives - (word-of mouth is sometimes effective but all too erratic)</p>
<p>and b. How to keep up! I notice, Gr&aacute;inne, that you are very much a presence in most of the clouds! Do you do this full-time? Is this a necessary r&ocirc;le, do you think, for ever, or just to get the ball rolling? How do you see it developing?&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Glad you like the site Jane! We are promoting it by talking about it at conferences and other events and also via blogs and twitter, but alot of the activity has just spread by word of month which is great! I do think some stimulation of activity is important in these spaces in the same way that is true in discussion forums etc and I am pleased to say that we are seeing evidence of that with the emergence of natural cloudworks champions. I find it personally really useful professionally as a way of keeping up and also as a way of communicating various activiites we are doing - I use it routinely now to upload info on talks I am doing and also on draft papers for comment.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I echo many of the sentiments shared by my H800 colleagues. I think cloudworks is a great Social Information Network (SIN) and Community of Practice (COP) tool as it focuses specifically on teaching and learning, thereby having the relevance that is needed to sustain social networks and COPs.</p>
<p>It is very interesting to see who has joined and how they have contributed. As a NZer living abroad I have found it beneficial to find other NZ elearnning organisations and practitioners to follow. This may provide useful links when I return to NZ next year and seek employment. It's great that Cloudworks is not exclusive to the OU, UK or academia.</p>
<p>But what I enjoy the most is the Serendipidy of discovery. eg finding authors of Virtual Worlds: Controversies at the frontier of education publication and following Rebecca Fergusons clouds, cloudscapes, and cloudstreams.</p>
<p>word of mouth, grapevine, cloudsphere.</p>
<p>One question, can you get a "reputation" by "looking and listening" or only by posting?</p>
<p>Well done!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Julie</p>
<p>yep you have picked up the key point - i.e that cloudworks has been devised specifically to support the learning and teaching community. We reviewed how other web 2.0 sites were being used and what practices were emerging - peer critiquing, commenting, collective gathering of relevant resources etc and then used these as the basis for building the site specifically around the needs of the academic community.</p>
<p>The site is deliberately open because we want to harness the power of the collective web and its great to see a genuine worldwide community interacting in here now - we have people from 163 countries now!!!</p>
<p>I would be interested to hear how you all find the discussion in cloudworks as part of a worldwide community vs. the more closed community spaces provided such as of course the H800 forums. In fact I think I'll start a flash debate about it! :-)</p>        </div>

<p>people need to vote a cloud or cloudscape you have created or recommend a link you add to a cloud. Once you have a reputation of 1 you can vote too!</p>        </div>

                   <p>My first attempt at using cloudworks, it is interesting to see the range of technology available for educational purposes.</p>
<p>Am still fascinated by the range of issues that cloudworks can address!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Yes I think that is one of the very interesting things about Cloudworks Godfrey - as a new type of web 2.0 space its interesting to see how it is being taken up by the community and how it is being used.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks for setting up the Cloudquest challenge, it's these sort of activities that make discovery learning very useful and rewarding for me.</p>
<p>I also noticed many clouds started without any content and wondered if you had any plans to address this? I realise you are wanting open discussion but perhaps there should be a minimum requirement which might avoid so many unused clouds.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Grainne, I found the cloudworks challenge a useful exercise to learn about the platform, I also watched your 30 minute presentation. One question, has the interface design changed since you created your presentation? I notice people used to be an option on the navigation bar, but now it has disappeared from my interface. I found the search option for 'people' organisations etc under the support tab. &nbsp;In your video you mention that it is possible to personalise cloudworks... am I missing something obvious or is there a quick way to search by people?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

                   <p>I've used Cloudworks for projects atThe Open University and also used it as a platform for liveblogging (although I tend to use my own blog these days).</p>
<p>I must confess, I'm just working my way through H800 and already feel familiar with CW so I haven't done all the exercises. Not much has changed here over the last few years but there seems to be new content coming through, which means that the site has a community to sustain it. &nbsp;Well done!</p>        </div>

<p>Cloudquest Challenge made me look more throughly than the quick look it would have been given.</p>
<p>Had not used Cloudworks before, made a good intro.</p>

                   <p>This is the first time I have seen or heard of cloudworks so maybe that is why it took me a few hours to navigate around and read contributions along the way! A very informative site - I have &nbsp;already learnt so much from the experience of others. Wish I knew about this site when I was teaching regularly! I have posted on here like Michael and Will in response to the challenge, I am sure this is fine!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Well, Hi everyone,</p>
<p>nice to see some familiar names, which must mean that I have arrived at the correct site!</p>
<p>Just completed some aspects of the H800 challenge and was amazed at the different Open University students on here.</p>
<p>This feels like a good platform to use. We will see.</p>
