        <p><strong>Embedding Functional Skills within Vocational Areas</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;English and maths are now the most important part of any student&rsquo;s education, whether in primary, secondary or further education.&nbsp; The government has set a goal that all students should either have achieved or be working towards a C grade in GCSE English and maths as part of their study programme when they join further education, if they are under the age of 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students who have a grade D in either subject must resit GCSE, but what about the students who don&rsquo;t have a grade D &ndash; what happens to them?&nbsp; Functional skills are the answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;One of the main issues with functional skills is that these are delivered or embedded within vocational areas and are generally from Entry level 3 to Level 2.&nbsp; Many vocational staff:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Are not confident that they have the expertise or ability to cover the necessary skills required by students to achieve a pass&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Feel that they are not proficient enough in English or maths</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t have time to create relevant resources</li>
<li>Can&rsquo;t always see the links between English and maths and their vocational areas</li>
<li>Are terrified at the thought of teaching Level 2 functional skills</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;I have spoken to many lecturers, some of whom are happy to cover English and maths and others who find one or other of the subjects completely alien.&nbsp; Construction lecturers often tell me that they are practically-minded, they can&rsquo;t spell, don&rsquo;t read much and find it difficult to write in an academic style.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would agree that these are issues, but they don&rsquo;t have to be, again it is confidence and a lack of resources. &nbsp;My aim is to make it easy for lecturers to deliver the materials and to gain confidence in areas of weakness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My project will involve creating resources.&nbsp; This will be an evolving project, with input from vocational areas, such as hairdressing, beauty, construction, IT and Art and Design.&nbsp; The resources will be relevant to the areas and based on the individual requirements.&nbsp; In essence I will create a database of materials that will be easily accessible by both lecturers and students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My theme is inclusion and I will rely on the lecturers to advise me on the topics they will be covering.&nbsp; These will change from term to term, depending on the units being taught, but with a whole college approach it should be possible to create a catalogue of resources that can be added to on a regular basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For the conference I will show how the materials are organised within the vocational areas, present some of these materials and demonstrate how they can be used successfully.&nbsp; I will also highlight the exam board website for past papers, together with answers.&nbsp; This will also be an opportunity to provide links to websites, such as TES, Teachit and other English educational sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This will be an invaluable tool for new and existing lecturers.</p>
