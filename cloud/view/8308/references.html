        <h3 dir="ltr">Narrator</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I am the Training Officer for a final year apprentice electrician who failed to pass the &lsquo;Inspection and Testing of an Electrical Installation&rsquo; &nbsp;section in his Final Integrated Competence Assessment. &nbsp;(FICA is the assessment that all apprentice electricians in Scotland need to pass to upgrade to the role of electrician). &nbsp;My role was</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to provide feedback on the apprentice&rsquo;s performance to the apprentice and his employer</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to liaise with the apprentice on what skills he needs to develop prior to his re-sit</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to arrange with the employer the means by which the apprentice might gain the skills he needs</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to arrange an appropriate re-sit date that suits both the apprentice and the employer</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="ltr">Situation</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I met with the employer and the apprentice at an address where they were working together. &nbsp;This is the normal arrangement which causes minimal disruption to the employer&rsquo;s business. &nbsp;The location transpired to be the new house of a friend of the employer. &nbsp;The employer was switching his interactions between me and his apprentice, and his friends.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Under normal circumstances I will have met with the apprentice and employer on numerous occasions over the apprenticeship but on this occasion I have only met the employer once, and the apprentice on two occasions before this meeting. &nbsp;I have only recently taken over this area and don&rsquo;t really have a relationship with either of them. &nbsp;The apprentice has been in employment with this contractor for over four years, &nbsp;This timing turned out to be significant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Initially they were both very cautious about discussing the situation. &nbsp;I suspected this would be the case from the context that I describe below. &nbsp;However there was something more that I didn&rsquo;t understand and whilst the employer was disappointed that the apprentice had failed a section of FICA there was an awkwardness about their personal &nbsp;interaction that I didn&rsquo;t understand. &nbsp;I thought that the apprentice was embarrassed, and that because they both didn&rsquo;t really know me they were being over cautious. &nbsp;This was not so, and only became apparent later.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Task</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I was trying to achieve a number of solutions and outcomes to this situation.</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I was trying to provide a quality of service of support to both the employer and the apprentice. &nbsp;With regard to the employer this is somewhat mercenary in the hope that the employer will recruit a new apprentice when his current one completes the course. &nbsp;Secondly, the employer had already made the claim to me in an earlier telephone conversation that his apprentice had been placed under undue pressure by a member of the test centre staff and was considering making a complaint. &nbsp;I was aware that both the employer and the apprentice were unhappy at the (alleged) performance of my colleague.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Outwith the diplomacy of the above I was trying to facilitate a number aspects of learning. The first was learning on my part. &nbsp;I wanted to identify whether the apprentice had sufficient knowledge and understanding about the subject of &nbsp;inspection &amp; testing (the failed section) that might make their claim of undue pressure justifiable.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The second learning objective that I was trying to achieve was one that</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">ensured that the apprentice gained sufficient on-site training in the inspection &amp; testing subject area so that he would</p>
</li>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">be in a position to pass his re-sit</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">be in a position to perform inspection &amp; testing as part of his role as an electrician.</p>
</li>
</ol></ol>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s a generally held belief in my workplace that the most appropriate place to learn is in the authentic workplace. &nbsp;I arrived at this location and situation with this assumption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before arriving on site I had a clear idea of what would be successful outcomes. &nbsp;These were</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">that the employer and the apprentice were content with the service my employer provides;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">that the apprentice would be informed about his performance at FICA; and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">that training would be agreed upon that would make possible 4a and 4b</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">As the meeting progressed these outcomes it became increasingly obvious that these aims were unlikely to be met. &nbsp;It was only after the meeting that I understood why.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Actions</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I started by reviewing the diagnostic report of the apprentices first attempt at FICA. &nbsp;This allowed me to get oral testimony of what the apprentice had done during the assessment. &nbsp;This was firstly designed to allow me to guage the apprentice&rsquo;s &nbsp;overall knowledge about the subject and secondly to suggest areas where he might have lost marks during the assessment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was quickly clear that the apprentice knew very little about one of the tests in question (the second out of 6 in total). &nbsp;His employer, witnessing his confusion, tried to assist by reminding the apprentice about what the test entailed. &nbsp;Unfortunately it was clear that the employer knew just as little about the test in question as his unfortunate apprentice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was when I had to correct the employer that he himself admitted that he had trouble understanding the topic of inspection and testing. &nbsp;This effectively put the sand in the engine of my learning plan, and &nbsp;I was now making it up as I went along. &nbsp;I suggested that I approach the local college with a view to them providing the apprentice with some training. &nbsp;The employer was only happy with this arrangement when I agreed that we would fund the training.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When we got onto the topic of when a re-sit could take place the employer told me that it had to take place before a certain date the following month to ensure that he would be able to claim funding should the apprentice be successful. &nbsp;I was unaware of this necessity and this placed an unexpected time-limit on the apprentice&rsquo;s college supported training.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With this new on-the-hoof plan agreed I took my leave of the meeting and the apprentice walked me back to my car which was parked at the other end of the street. &nbsp;It was at this point that the apprentice told me that he has never received any on-site training on this subject because the employer 'doesn&rsquo;t have a clue' about electrical testing. &nbsp;The apprentice also told me that the previous Training Officer had been aware of this and had numerous discussions about this with the employer. The apprentice had assumed that I knew this.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Results</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">An expected outcome was that the apprentice would gain the training to prepare him for his FICA resit. &nbsp;The outcome wasn&rsquo;t achieved in the way I had planned though</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Whilst I think that it is possible that the college training will provide the apprentice with the training to perform well in his resit, i suspect that there is very little chance that I will meet the objective to allow the apprentice to perform inspection &amp; testing as part of his future role as an electrician.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">An &nbsp;unexpected outcome was that my employer was now going to have to pay for this additional college training and which, if successful, will result in the employer receiving a &pound;1000 grant.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I had hoped that I would leave the meeting with the complaint possibility becalmed and the good name of my employer restored. Instead as the meeting went on I began to feel like a character in a Pinter play who allows suppressed tensions to become manifest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">Reflections</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I was very pleased to read recently that John Seely Brown described learning as messy. &nbsp;This messiness isn&rsquo;t just down to the difficulties of putting something as complex as learning into words but includes an understanding that learning involves financial motivations, personal tensions and resentments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The assumed expectation in a Community of Practice, in which an apprentice moves from the periphary to full membership of a discourse, is that the gatekeeper is sufficiently competent to be a gatekeeper. &nbsp;This situation has caused me to reflect on the value of a discourse that can allow the gatekeeper to be without competence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The situation has also shaken my confidence in the value of assuming that the workplace is the site of authentic learning. &nbsp;Since, in this situation, the FICA assessment itself takes place in the inauthentic setting of a test centre then perhaps the &lsquo;inauthentic&rsquo; setting of a college workshop is actually the most authentic place to learn.</p>    </div>
