			<p>Actor:</p>
<p>Bernie is 36 years old. He has been working for ClouldWork Pharmaceutial company for 5 years, he has just got a promotion, now he is the regional sales manager for the YunNan Province in the southeast part of China. He is married to Serena, a nurse working in the local hospital. &nbsp;There are 35 sales representatives, a sales assistant and a financial assisstant in his team.&nbsp;YunNan province &nbsp;is made up of 15 cities and 20 rural areas, each sales representative looks after either one city or one rural area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bernie was very passionate about his job, he was a succuessful sale person, and learned about through everyday sales activities. He believes that it is his job to training his people, and he plans to teach his team everything he knows about selling OTC products. &nbsp;He wrote a series training sessions called "ACE" Selling strategies. He talked to Marketing and training departmant, trying to get help from them so he can combine the marketing strategy, product knowledge into the selling skill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His team members very very different, (list above under the actors section by Chris) they all work alone in their area, use cellphone and email to comunicate with Bernie. Sometime, they will go online to company's website, trying to get connected, often disappointed. They feel they need more support from each other and particularly from their manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goal for Bernie: to develop a training framework for his team, use 6 month to implement his ACE selling strategies.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp;Is 21 years old and very energetic and very chatty. He is single and stays with some of his friends who all pay rent for the apartment they live in. He has many friends and spends his available time socializing. He is outgoing and believes that life is what you make of it. It always seems as if he is having fun wherever he goes not taking life's strains too seriously. After Tom left school he started his career as a journalist at a local newspaper where he did quite well for himself. He supplemented his income with the commission&nbsp;he received from selling advertisements. His success with sales motivated his decision&nbsp;to get involved with over the counter sales where the commission, if he was successful, stands to be quite a sizable amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He started new in the company as a sales consultant and it is his first experience with over the counter sales. He is a very sociable at work and quickly creates relationships with his fellow employees. Everyone seems to like him as he is always there to help when it is needed. Mostly it is with menial office tasks as he does not have a lot of on the job knowledge. He seems to be very clued up regarding anything technological and could navigate the company's system in no time at all. He likes to learn and seems to have a lot of time to do so. He amazes &nbsp;everyone with the amount of communication devices that he has and he always seems to be connected with his friends on social networks. When the manager asked for someone to organize the Christmas&nbsp;party he volunteered immediately. He was quite successful in organizing&nbsp;everything assigning small tasks to his fellow employees, even the manager. He sometimes hangs around the office after work to chat with people or to read some of the communications the company sends out. He always takes pamphlets or reading material that he emails to his personal account to study them and gain more knowledge that way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the learning intervention that his manager enrolled all the employees in he was the first one to access the new website. He created his own profile and played with the system so after not long he was able to help others do the same. He came in one morning boasting that he has already completed the first exercise on his iPad while he was lying in bed. He was quick to create connections or links to each one of his colleagues. He was even able to tell his colleagues about interesting features of the system. In the group exercises he was keen on exploring the new approaches to learning and posted a lot of his ideas on the system. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><em><br /></em><strong>James&nbsp;</strong>is 42 and lives in a house that he and his wife&nbsp;had bought&nbsp;soon after their marriage. James has worked for the company all his life. The company went through&nbsp;a restructuring process&nbsp;about a year ago where he was moved from his old job as a data analyst to an unfamiliar field of over the counter sales. It was a stressful period for him but after the process he was just too lucky to have a job, even if it meant doing something he does not really like. He has lost faith in the company being true to its promises and only invest as much energy as is necessary&nbsp;to get him through the day.</p>
<p>He does not seem to be one of the companies'&nbsp;best sales people but he is not one of the top performers even. He knows everyone in the office but does not regard them as friends. It generally takes a long time for him to be comfortable in a new crowd&nbsp;of people and he took some time before he started feeling relaxed amongst his new colleagues. Of all the people in the office he is the one that knows the company's Computer system the best and have even connected his iPad and iPhone to the network for him to be able to work remotely. He always seems to have a lot of time on his hands and but he is not willing to work after hours even if he could see the benefit&nbsp;in it. He always seems happy&nbsp;to go along with what the rest of the group decides but never provide any suggestions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His manager signed&nbsp;him up for a new learning solution&nbsp;that forces him to work with his colleagues in virtual groups. Although he understands the technology behind it he had always found the world of "social Interaction" over a network to be superflicient. He would rather talk to people than send them messages and he is not one of the most talkative people in the company. He sees this new training intervention as something that he is forced to deal with and only engages in it as much energy as possible to get by. His supervisor&nbsp;once remarked that he could contribute more to the topics under discussion on the learning system.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

<td>Name: Joseph<br />Gender: Male <br />Age: 54<br />Lives in Shangri-la &nbsp;with his wife. He has two children all left for university. He has been working for this company for over 15 years, after all these years hard working, he has established very good client base and client relationship. He and his clients are now friends. &nbsp;His sales performance is stable, not among the top 10 percent, but always above the average. And he only has to spend half of his time to achieve the sales target allocated to him. <br /><br />He is good at taking his clients for dinner, and other entertainment, so his selling cost is rather high.<br />Shangri-la is very far way from the head office in KunMing, so Joseph is used to work on his own, as long as he can achieve his sales targets, the previous managers always choose to leave him alone. So he kind of have set up his own way of working. But this is not the case with the new promoted manager, Bernie. Bernie wants to bring him back to the team. One of the option on Bernie&rsquo;s mind is to relocate Joseph to KunMing, the head office, so he can work with him closely. But Joseph hates this idea. <br /><br />Because of his achievement and his long service for the company, he doesn&rsquo;t follow the new sales manager&rsquo;s order and refuse to take on more sales targes/volums. And &nbsp;he also doesn&rsquo;t think he needs any training, he is coping very well, he is always able to slip away from &nbsp;f2f training session even under the watch of trainers, let alone online training, he simply wouldn&rsquo;t do it. <br /><br />However, he does feel the need to access information of the products he is selling and marketing promotion plans for his territory, he sometimes complains that the organization is failing him by not providing enough information/support for him when he needs it, for example, one of his client suddenly asked about a side effect of a OTC medicine he is selling in the middle of a dinner event, and he couldn&rsquo;t answer the question, and he couldn&rsquo;t get hold of any people from head office to help, he felt really embarrassed and complained to other sales agents that the smartphone given by the company is useless! And the company website has everything but useful information! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></td>

<tr>
<td>Education and experience</td>
<td>Joseph doesn&rsquo;t hold university qualifications, when he started working for the company, they didn&rsquo;t ask for university qualification, he works very hard, and earned his reputation through hard working.
