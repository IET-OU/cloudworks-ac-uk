			<p><strong>Summing Up from the seminar by John Arnold&nbsp; C.Psychol, FBPsS<br />Professor of Organisational Behaviour and Director of Research<br />School of Business and Economics<br />Loughborough University</strong></p>
<p>In his closing comments, John Arnold thanked all the speakers and panel members for their excellent presentations, and all participants for playing a part in making a very stimulating and informative day. As had been noted by several present, the seminar was held on a very significant day in carers guidance, particularly in England &ndash; the last day of the employment contract for many careers guidance professionals.</p>
<p>John drew attention to eight points arising from the presentations and discussions:</p>
<ol>
<li>In order to have collective influence, it was probably not necessary for all careers guidance professionals to have the same approach to their work. After all, members of many professions differ in how they meet the requirements of their work, clients, employers and professional bodies. What is needed, however, in unity about the role, values and ethics. </li>
<li>Given the negative experiences of former Connexions staff in England reported in Helen Colley&rsquo;s presentation, perhaps the only viable course of action (albeit still unlikely to be successful) for careers guidance staff from their point of view is to resist or subvert the managerialism they believe to be undermining good practice. This would certainly require unity, and the sharing of case studies and experiences of success in doing this.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In academic writing on careers, a popular concept is the so-called &ldquo;boundaryless career&rdquo;. The idea is that boundaries (e.g. between organisations, functions, occupations) are barriers to mobility, self-expression and labour market success that individuals need to be able to overcome. Sally Aldridge&rsquo;s comment that &ldquo;when you have a boundary, people tend to make it hard to cross&rdquo; is in line with this view, though it should also be noted that a boundary in itself only marks territory. Such markers may actually be helpful to people in navigating and making sense of their careers. Nevertheless, Sally&rsquo;s point that career boundaries aren&rsquo;t just &ldquo;there&rdquo;, but are created by people who use them for various purposes emphasises the de facto importance of boundaries, and indeed of careers guidance professionals in enabling people to understand and traverse them.</li>
<li>The idea that people often hold puzzlingly contradictory perceptions of work and career cropped up several times. This is something that Amal El-Sawad, along with John Arnold and Laurie Cohen, has written about in the academic literature. It can be argued, and indeed demonstrated, that people routinely hold contradictory views, and seem either oblivious to the tension, or not nearly as bothered by it as social psychologists would expect. Rather than seeking a &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;true&rdquo; view, it is perhaps more useful to embrace contradiction and use it to explore a person&rsquo;s perhaps competing values and experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>A number of points made in presentations and the panel session pointed to the importance of the &ldquo;social&rdquo; side of career development, particularly the use of networks for job-seeking and also for support at difficult times. Given the fragmented nature of the careers guidance profession, and also the fact that careers guidance is often implicitly seen as an &ldquo;add on&rdquo; in many contexts, it is easy for careers guidance professionals to become isolated. Therefore it is important for careers guidance professionals and their professional bodies to take action to support each other, especially at local level and perhaps especially at this time.</li>
<li>In the panel session, Danny Saunders referred to the use of metaphorical terms such as &ldquo;army&rdquo; in trying to communicate the nature and potential of careers guidance work. As he noted, however, it is vital to get a metaphor that appeals to the audience. This is echoed in research on cross-cultural leadership, where cultural variations in hierarchy vs equality and individualism vs collectivism mean that different metaphors (e.g. army, family, sports team, community) can gain dramatically different levels of acceptance (or not). So, both in expressing the importance/role of careers guidance work, and in trying to foster professional integration, it is important to pick the right words.</li>
<li>There was some suggestion through the day that different types of contractor (e.g. individual schools, local authorities) may well tend to produce different types of ethical dilemmas for careers guidance professionals. The professional bodies may want to pay some attention to likely ethical issues affecting the work of members in different settings.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Rachel Mulvey&rsquo;s presentation was a welcome reminder of the importance of focusing on identity and a holistic sense of self expressed and modified through action. It is helpful to have this fusion of &ldquo;being&rdquo; and &ldquo;doing&rdquo;. Also, too often there is a tendency to break down individuals into atomised competencies or interests. A focus on identity is a good counter-balance. Care might however be needed to avoid the notion of &ldquo;self-improvement&rdquo; becoming an overly guilt-ridden activity, or one where the ethical/moral dimension to self-improvement is used by employers to control and define employees&rsquo; behaviour.</li>
