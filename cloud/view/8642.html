    <div class="user-entry">

        <p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>I was host of a seminar for teachers from SW England who came to explore how digital tools can be used to enhance learning inthe classroom,</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>This was an afternon session beginning with lunch held in a modern school library. &nbsp;All participants (eight in all) were mostly female teachers, &nbsp;some of whom knew each other as colleagues. It was intended to be a peer-to-peer exchange. &nbsp;Although the levels of experience using computers in the clasroom was varied, all seemed keen to develop their use of technology, primarly as a motivatinal tool. &nbsp;The setting is airy, spacious and calm and lunch enabled extensive interaction to take place before the main part of the discussion began. &nbsp;The chief limiting factor was that I was given two days notice of the event so the preparation time was very tight. &nbsp;A key factor in the physical location was the availabilkity of tablets (Surfaces running Windows RT) and an wireless internet access.<strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>Participants should leave with a number of tools which they could use in the classroom for both teaching and assessment purposes and which they would feel confident enough to share with others. &nbsp;This would be assessed by verbal feedback and by response to activities.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>1</em>) Found a list of participants.</p>
<p>2) Looked for clues and used personal knowledge of some to decide where to pitch the opening statement.</p>
<p>3) With no specialists apparent, I decided to provide some illustrative examples from my own experience using Prezi as a vehicle. &nbsp;To engage the group, to show the ease of embedding video in Prezi and to show how learning can take place without any direct intervention form teachers I used clip of Amira Willighagen (aged 9) singing an aria on a Dutch talent show.</p>
<p>4) To encourage participation and to give experience of using tools I had the group access a site (mural.ly) on the tablets which is a virtual noticeboard and asked them to post comments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5) I asked the group to share their own ideas and to discuss what they had seen and done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chief obstacle was passivity - none had come with ideas to contribute so what should have been more of a discussion became something of a lecture. &nbsp;I was glad that I included an interactive activity and some strong visual elements. &nbsp;The discussion, once it had begun turned on the ways in which the tools I had identified might be used without any new suggestions being made. &nbsp;Fortunately this was free flowing</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>Expected outcomes -</p>
<ul>
<li>using and discussing the ways in which digital tools could be used by classroom teachers for a variety of purposes. Discussion and the responses on the practical exercise confirmed that the group might use and could see applications for them.</li>
<li>Develop the range of tools open to the group. &nbsp;It was apparent from discussion that these mostly new to all the other participants. &nbsp;I ddi not pick up any new tools though the range of ways in which they might be used was expanded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evidence: discussion revolved around how teachers specialising in different subjects might use tools - for example using an e-picture-book for story-telling or story-writing. &nbsp;The use of the interactive session showed both inposts and discussion its potential for brain-storming and informal assessment. &nbsp;While the greatest discussion took place over the active session, the most enthusiasm seemed to be aimed at Prezi and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional outcomes: a list circulated to all participants of the tols discussed and a summary of the discussion ideas for there use. &nbsp;The list was planned but the tabulation with suggested uses was not.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Reflections</strong></p>
<p>Be prepared for those who would rather listen quietly than participate and expect that even after a good lunch it may tae time before anyone is comfortable to air their own opinions. &nbsp;Do not expect anyone else to come with any ideas of their own - or at least not the willingness to share them. &nbsp;If doing this by purely digital means, it may be necessary to force participation if the purpose is to be achieved. &nbsp;Never under-estimate the importance of a hook when trying to capture an audience: the 9-year-old opera singer was a knockout. &nbsp;It may be difficult to gauge reactions over the internet - for all the passivity of the group, all were attentive. &nbsp;This is difficult to see remotely. &nbsp;Participation works. &nbsp;So does listening quietly. &nbsp;</p>    </div>

                   <p>Hi, I was interested to note that you say 'no new suggestions being made'.</p>
<p>Would you say that you over-fed the activity?&nbsp; By showing too much?&nbsp; So there was nothing new for them to develop for themselves?</p>
<p>Did you have a specific activity that you gave them to do?&nbsp; Like create a Prezi account and access the templtates to make something?&nbsp; Or with Mural.ly?</p>
<p>Sorry - it's always much easier to critique than create - I just wondered how you felt about that?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Rather I had to feed the activity due toa lack of response!</p>
<p>Yes, they had to contribute using mural.ly which forced them to engage.</p>        </div>
