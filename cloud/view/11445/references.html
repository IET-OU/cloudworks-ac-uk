<p><strong><strong>UK HE</strong></strong></p>
<p><em>[Peter Horrocks; THE; Avril Jameson; Steve Parkinson; The Guardian; HEA; Wonkhe]</em></p>
<p>Peter Horrocks discusses <a href="http://www.hepi.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Fixing-the-Broken-Market-in-Part-Time-Study-final.pdf" rel="nofollow">Fixing The Broken Market In Part-Time Study</a> in a new report that identifies the main benefits to the economy and society of supporting PT HE, discusses failures that affect our capacity to deliver these benefits, and proposes solutions to these failures.&nbsp; Whilst acknowledging that institutions&nbsp; need to improve, particularly by becoming more commercial, employer-focussed and flexible, he believes there are a number of areas where the UK Government could make improvements ranging from better guidance, FE-HE pathways and credit transfer through to &lsquo;ambitious reform&rsquo; of the various financial barriers to learning and earning.</p>
<p>Lords Willetts and Browne appeared before the Treasury select committee&rsquo;s inquiry on student loans on 13 Dec. &nbsp;&ldquo;Part-time students: <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/david-willetts-i-plead-guilty-part-time-student-decline" rel="nofollow">I plead guilty,&rdquo; said Lord Willetts</a>. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was surprised at the time and remain shocked by what happened.&rdquo;&nbsp; The government had &ldquo;hoped and expected&rdquo; that the extension of fee loans &ldquo;would help part-time students, and it clearly didn&rsquo;t work out that way&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The government has published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-building-a-britain-fit-for-the-future" rel="nofollow">Building a Britain fit for the future</a>, a lengthy industrial strategy white paper that recycles a number of previously announced policy and funding measures.&nbsp; Those that could most impact the OU and the HE sector as a whole include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A strategic role for the Office for Students in addressing employer and student needs and skills gaps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A major review of funding across 18+ education, slanted towards technical education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A &pound;64m National Retraining scheme focusing initially on basic skills in digital and construction training</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A comprehensive careers strategy (due soon) that will set out plans to improve the quality and coverage of careers advice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&pound;725m HEIF funding that supports universities and businesses working together to innovate and commercialise research</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jo Johnson has announced that students in England will be offered <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42268310" rel="nofollow">two-year "accelerated" degrees</a> with a &pound;5,500 saving in tuition fees.&nbsp; Mr Johnson said he wants to "break the mould" of a system in which three-year degrees have stifled more flexible ways of studying.&nbsp; "This policy will be particularly attractive for mature students who are looking to change their skills and adapt to changes in the economy - and who might want to go through higher education at a faster pace," he said.&nbsp; However, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said there was no evidence that "squeezing three years of learning into two will stop the huge drop in part-time students".</p>
<p>UCL&rsquo;s Ludovic Highman reports that the EU is considering doubling its research and innovation budget to &euro;160bn, making it even more disappointing that the Government seems no nearer to its aspiration of a &ldquo;more ambitious and close partnership with the EU than any yet agreed between the EU and a non-EU country&rdquo;.&nbsp; On the contrary, the EU has already warned British <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/dec/05/will-the-uk-get-a-brexit-deal-on-research-thats-the-160bn-question" rel="nofollow">Horizon 2020</a> applicants that in the event of a no deal Brexit, EU funding to current British recipients would stop, and that they may be required to leave the research project altogether.</p>
<p>The &gt;Higher Education Academy (HEA), the Equality Challenge Unit (ECU) and the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education (LFHE) are to merge from 1 Aug 18.&nbsp; Further details will follow but it has been confirmed that the HEA Fellowship scheme will remain unaffected.</p>
<p>An end-of-year poll by Hepi found that <a href="http://www.hepi.ac.uk/2017/12/18/two-thirds-68-students-now-back-labour-think-labour-55-jeremy-corbyn-58-back-remain/" rel="nofollow">62% of students want a second referendum on the final Brexit deal</a>.&nbsp; Student support for Labour has grown to 68% since the General Election and most of these think the Labour Party (55%) and Jeremy Corbyn (58%) back Remain but, if Labour overtly backed Brexit, 42% of their student supporters would be less likely to vote for them.</p>

<p><strong>Aston Reflects on Lessons from Online Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Avril Jamieson]</em></p>
<p>Prof Helen Higson, Aston University's lead on the implementation and delivery of its academic strategy, reflects on the first year of <a href="http://wonkhe.com/blogs/what-online-can-teach-on-campus/" rel="nofollow">Aston Online</a>, its series of taught PG programmes delivered in partnership with Keypath. &nbsp;She identifies the following key lessons from online delivery, many of which will resonate at the OU:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Online learners have high expectations and want to be treated like customers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The learning environment, communication systems, and online materials need to work like clockwork and be backed up with a strong student support network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A clear communications strategy is crucial; Aston aims to make contact with students at least once a week and achieves a strong retention rate of 96%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Course content must be designed carefully and the most talented staff engaged in online delivery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Old ways of doing things need to be challenged; the university must work around the needs of the student not vice versa</p>

<p><strong>Have Open Universities Had a Negative Impact on Online Learning?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>I reported last month on a WCET survey on <a href="https://wcetfrontiers.org/2017/10/19/new-survey-tracks-online-and-distance-education-in-canada/" rel="nofollow">Online and Distance Education in Canada</a>, showing widespread uptake and double-digit enrolment growth.&nbsp; This led Tony Bates, who has a long and distinguished background in this field, to question <a href="https://www.tonybates.ca/2017/11/11/why-does-canada-have-so-much-online-learning/" rel="nofollow">whether open universities may have had a negative impact on online learning</a>.&nbsp; He notes that &ldquo;Most open universities were designed in the 1970s around a heavy, front-ended print development model requiring a very large investment. &nbsp;It is common in such institutions for it to take two years or more to develop a course, with an army of support staff as well as faculty.&rdquo;&nbsp; This he believes now makes it difficult for those institutions to move their offerings online in ways that are sufficiently innovative and timely which, in turn, is having an adverse effect on enrolments.&nbsp; There is of course some truth in this but he does not touch on the dire PT funding situation, particularly in the UK.&nbsp; He also refers to evidence from the Canadian survey that suggests the presence of a fully distance or open university inhibits or slows the adoption of distance/online courses in F2F institutions elsewhere in that province.&nbsp; If true this suggests that, although virtual, there remains a perception that open/online universities are somehow &lsquo;local&rsquo; in Canada, even though this is not the case in the UK.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>As Corporate World Moves Toward Curated &lsquo;Microlearning&rsquo;, HE Must Adapt</strong></p>

<p>There is a certain irony in (US) industry complaints about a lack of workers with current skills whilst, at the same time, they are spending less time and money per employee on learning and development.&nbsp; EdSurge looks at the world of life-long learning and how organisations are starting to curate and use short, free <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-11-06-as-corporate-world-moves-toward-curated-microlearning-higher-ed-must-adapt" rel="nofollow">microlearning</a> solutions from MOOCs and &lsquo;learning experience platforms&rsquo; such as Degreed and EdCast that allow them to draw on learning materials from an ecosystem rich with options. &nbsp;&ldquo;Rather than only buying huge catalogues of materials off-the-shelf, we&rsquo;re moving toward a more-searchable ecosystem,&rdquo; says PVH&rsquo;s Lori Bradley. &ldquo;Our team is constantly vetting material, and we have a &lsquo;dean&rsquo; of each academy&rdquo;.&nbsp; SAP tells a similar tale: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a shift from formal to more informal learning &ndash; bite-sized training and the application of experience&rdquo;.&nbsp; And is there still a place for HEIs?&nbsp; &ldquo;Academic credit is not always the selling point that universities think it is&rdquo; says Bradley.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>90% have written policies describing the support and provision for disabled students</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>60% rate themselves at 6 or higher (on a scale of 1-10) in terms of inclusiveness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>78% use lecture capture although only 20% of these recorded more than half of all lectures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>52% have an accessibility plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>88% encourage disclosure at all stages of the student lifecycle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>67% engage with their students&rsquo; union on issues around disability services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>85% are currently or have recently taken steps to review their support for disabled students</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>98% sought to evaluate the effectiveness/impact of their support for disabled students</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Reading 20 of the words to themselves silently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reading 20 words out loud to themselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listening to a recording of someone else reading 20 words</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listening to a recording of themselves saying 20 words</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A recognition test followed, comprising the 80 words they&rsquo;d just studied and the other 80 words used two weeks&rsquo; earlier. &nbsp;On seeing each word, the students had to indicate whether it was one they had just studied or not.&nbsp; The most effective revision method was reading the words aloud, leading to an average of 77% correct answers.&nbsp; This was followed by listening to a recording of themselves (74%), hearing a recording of someone else (69%) and reading in silence (65%).&nbsp; The authors suggest that a combination of motor information (speaking) and self-referential information (&ldquo;I said it&rdquo;) contribute to the production effect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A blockchain is a distributed ledger that provides a way for information to be recorded and shared by a community. &nbsp;In this community, each member maintains his or her own copy of the information and all members must validate any updates collectively. &nbsp;The information could represent transactions, contracts, assets, identities, or practically anything else that can be described in digital form. &nbsp;Entries are permanent, transparent, and searchable, which makes it possible for community members to view transaction histories in their entirety. &nbsp;Each update is a new &lsquo;block&rsquo; added to the end of a &lsquo;chain&rsquo;. &nbsp;A protocol manages how new edits or entries are initiated, validated, recorded, and distributed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report takes users through the various components, how they operate/interoperate and what issues arise along the way, all supported by case studies (including the OU, p64), examples, usage scenarios and links to useful resources.</p>
