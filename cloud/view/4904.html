        <p>Hi, everyone! I am Kleio Akrivou, a Lecturer (Organizational Behaviour and Management) in the Henley Business School, University of Reading.</p>
<p>Last year in HBS we have created a 4 year degree Undergraduate program in Management and Business Administration, and as part of reviewing and re-designing the curriculum in this degree, I was asked to develop a Part 1 Module in Organizational Behaviour.&nbsp; This has been both a pleasure but also a challenge, as there were a few tricky issues i was juggling with.&nbsp; First, in Part 2 we do already have an OB module which takes on a rather critical approach to teaching OB and aims to increase students critical thinking about organizational studies.&nbsp; In addition, this part 2 module's main focus is drawing from the EU organizational behaviour which i would describe as utilizing mainly social theory as a tool for analyzing organizations, while i see myself as bridging the USA tradition, utilizing mainly social psychological and behavioral theories to study organizational systems (I completed my PhD in the USA in one of the famous Schools in this line of theory) and the European understanding of social theory, philosophy, sociology, but also politics and anthropology.&nbsp; So, my first challenge was for the new module to work well in bridging these two, and as a result fit in well with and feed harmonically into the Part 2 OB module. I called my module "People and Organizations:&nbsp; A critical and Eclectic Introduction to Organisational Behaviour and Socio-technical Systems".&nbsp; Those who would understand the terms would see that it attempts the bridging and integrative role i described.</p>
<p>Second challenge i wanted to deal with is that different to our UoReading and HBS traditions in UG programs that emphasize critical thinking and analysis, I/we wanted to increase the emphasis in the development of both reflective and case study / applied learning skills to the curriculum.&nbsp; I thought Part 1 is a great place to start as students are still finding it a bit hard to produce really good critical essays,&nbsp; Besides, my Org Behaviour module was a good opportunity for me to do pedagogically something of this sort, as&nbsp;for a thorough&nbsp;foundation in people and organizational systems, I&nbsp;decided there should be&nbsp;quite a bit of theory to teach in the module, which at the same time could be felt heavy or cognitively too demanding to students of this young age, dealing with a complex subject matter and lacking work experience and even life experience, i would say.&nbsp; To "solve" this i designed two case studies to specifically allow students to deal with two complext theoretical parts of the module, and a pedagogy on how to teach them.&nbsp; Also, a lot of emphasis was given in reflective type of assignements as part of the assessed coursework. The pedagogy behind it was that students should learn to reflect on how theory could/would/should apply to their own lives and potential managerial career dillemmas and prepare them for what is coming by inviting them to reflect on their identity and the kind of managerial work and values they would like to contribute.&nbsp; Finally, exams are based in both case study examinations and the provision of reflective accounts in response to questions that invite them to "put themselves" in the case study "hero" shoes.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the module is designed in a way to encourage students to avoid dogmatic or black vs. white thinking on people and organizations, and the intended aim pedagogically is to increase their ability for epistemological relativism, differentiation and thus speed up integrative development. I should say that this latter constitutes anyway my research and specialization area, which pays back a good feeling of my own ability to integrate my teaching (pedagogy) and research.</p>
<p>Thinking ahead, i find difficult to communicate to colleagues and even the students and tutorial group leaders effectively on the intended pedagogy and relationsships between different features of this newly designed module.&nbsp; Besides, myself being an assimilative learner i always tend to find time for "marketing and communication" of my work or achievements even a loss from more productive time for research and social / educational action, but in this case i am hoping to share knowledge with my colleagues. Therefore, Rebecca enlightened me by proposing to use the curriculum design initiative to "map out" relevant pedagogical intentions, tools and features fo the module.</p>
<p>I am about to complete (looks like relatively successfully) the first time teaching this module. In retrospect and having now had the experience of the module brought into life, i am quite satisfied with the outcomes and of course welcome further learnings and improvements.&nbsp; Dr. Kleio Akrivou</p>    </div>
