<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[Steve Parkinson; Wonkhe; University World News; BBC; JISC]</em></p>
<p>A new report from the Social Market Foundation, <a href="http://www.smf.co.uk/publications/widening-participation/" rel="nofollow">Widening participation in Higher Education</a>, predicts that the Government will not achieve its ambitions for widening participation &ndash; doubling numbers from disadvantaged backgrounds entering HE and increasing BME numbers by 20% &ndash; by its goal of 2020.&nbsp; In response, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/government-will-miss-ambitious-2020-higher-education-widening-participation-targets-report-finds-a6967976.html" rel="nofollow">Peter Horrocks</a> said, &ldquo;current efforts fail to take into account the vital role part-time and lifelong study has to play in driving social mobility.&rdquo;&nbsp; He added, &ldquo;More than a third of such students entering the English university system last year were mature.&nbsp; These individuals make a huge contribution to our society and economy, and it is in the national interest to make sure this is recognised in any future policy developments."</p>
<p>HEFCE has published a <a href="http://wonkhe.com/blogs/new-quality-system-digested/" rel="nofollow">Revised Approach to Quality Assessment in Higher Education</a> which it claims, &ldquo;builds on established strengths and good practice, including institutions&rsquo; own robust quality assurance systems.&rdquo;&nbsp; The scheme is based on an initial assessment, annual provider review and an assessment visit at least every five years.&nbsp; Piloting will take place during 2016/17, with full implementation the following year.</p>
<p>A report from Universities UK, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160316191317601" rel="nofollow">The Future Growth of Degree Apprenticeships</a>, suggests these new awards have the potential to help fill the country&rsquo;s skills gaps and meet employers&rsquo; needs. &nbsp;The government has pledged to create 3 million new apprenticeships in England by 2020 and an estimated 1,500-2,000 Degree Apprenticeships are due to start in 2016 across 40 universities. &nbsp;The report finds that they can be particularly attractive to non-traditional students, they offer a way for universities to develop alternatives to traditional full-time on-campus study, but there is a need to raise awareness among potential apprentices, parents and careers advisers.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35862599" rel="nofollow">University of Reading</a> has opened the doors of an ultra-modern campus, with state-of-the-art teaching and research laboratories and social spaces including an indoor park and amphitheatre, based in Malaysia&rsquo;s purpose-built education hub, EduCity.&nbsp; Reading has invested &pound;13m in the project so far, and intends to increase the initial cohort of 200 students to 3,000 in five years.</p>
<p>A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests that UK <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36028368" rel="nofollow">medicine and economics graduates are likely to command the largest salaries</a>, with those qualified in the creative arts earning least.&nbsp; Graduates of LSE, Oxford and Cambridge also earn more, and the male-female divide is still alive and kicking.</p>
<p>As of 1 Apr, all UK HEIs will need to comply with the new <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-research-excellence-framework-ref-open-access-policy-01-apr-2016" rel="nofollow">Research Excellence Framework Open Access policy</a>. &nbsp;The REF OA policy applies to journal articles and conference proceedings with an ISSN number accepted for publication and the move should support research outputs to become accessible both by academic and non-academic audiences, so that everyone can reap the economic and social benefits resultant from scientific research.</p>
<p>The University of Arizona&rsquo;s Gary Rhoades has researched universities in the US, UK and South Africa and concluded that, in trying to appeal to foreign students, rather than moving to distinctive niches, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160323143056759" rel="nofollow">British and American universities are managing differently to be largely the same</a>.&nbsp; Although they are situated in quite different settings with quite different strengths, those universities studied set their sights on the same privileged populations of well-resourced students from China and India interested in the private purposes and consumption value of higher education.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Seb Schmoller; EdSurge; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>The government has cancelled a contract with LearnDirect to manage <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1677293/taxpayer-pays-out-over-driving-test-fiasco" rel="nofollow">Britain's driving theory tests</a> and instead retained Pearson for up to four more years without a further re-tendering of the deal.&nbsp; LearnDirect has received &ldquo;a multimillion pound settlement&rdquo; funded by you and I.</p>
<p>Barnes &amp; Noble has acquired <a href="http://loudcloudsystems.com/" rel="nofollow">LoudCloud Systems</a> &ndash; a developer of a learning management system used by schools and HEIs &ndash; for $17.9m.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/distance-learning-universities-must-prove-their-relevance" rel="nofollow">Open and distance learning universities must determine their competitive advantage</a>, according to the director of the Observatory on Borderless Higher Education.&nbsp; Richard Garrett said that the trend of traditional institutions becoming more versatile means that &ldquo;the tide is against&rdquo; ODL universities, citing the OU&rsquo;s recent &pound;7m loss amid a national collapse in part-time study.&nbsp; He believes our involvement in FutureLearn is quite healthy but, &ldquo;Can they claw back some of their market share by proving that if you go to the OU you&rsquo;re going to get a better experience as a non-traditional part-time adult student than you get by going to some random UK university?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve answered that question.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>MIT Calls for Learning Engineers</strong></p>

<p>MIT&rsquo;s new report, <a href="https://oepi.mit.edu/sites/default/files/MIT Online Education Policy Initiative April 2016_0.pdf" rel="nofollow">Online Education: A Catalyst for Higher Education Reforms</a>, includes a recommendation to support the professional category of Learning Engineer.&nbsp; This would be: &ldquo;a creative professional who helps build bridges between fields of education and develops additional infrastructure to help teachers teach and students learn.&nbsp; Learning engineers must integrate their knowledge of a discipline with broad understanding of advanced principles from across the fields of education.&nbsp; They must be familiar with state-of-the-art educational technologies, from commercial software to open-source tools, and skilled in the effective use of new online tools.&nbsp; Moreover they must be able to work with educators, both to create new learning experiences from scratch and to integrate new technologies and approaches into existing experiences, whether online or in-person or both.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Why Use Social Media to Support Learning?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Steve Parkinson]</em></p>
<p>Steve Parkinson wonders: <a href="https://medium.com/@GoTeamLTS/why-use-social-media-to-support-learning-db0534ef48ec#.69rwnfwin" rel="nofollow">can using social media support learning</a>, or is it simply a distraction?&nbsp; He explains why he thinks it&rsquo;s a good idea, what tools you might use and what sorts of things you might do with them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a very readable post with lots of examples, from which the takeaways seem to be that, used in the right way, social media can add a lot of value to learning and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that complicated or expensive to achieve.&nbsp; But he cautions: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just do social media because everyone else is. &nbsp;Do it because you have an idea of how you feel it will enhance the learning experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Web Use Differs With Age</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; Nielsen Norman Group]</em></p>
<p>No big surprises here but a report from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/24/email-is-dying-among-mobiles-youngest-users/" rel="nofollow">App Annie</a> finds that those aged 13 to 24 now spend more than 3.5 times overall usage time in messaging apps than those over 45 years old, while the older users still default to apps that replicate desktop functions, like email and web browsers.&nbsp; Video streaming is also highest in this younger age group; however, it&rsquo;s the 25-44 group that are leading the mobile retail boom.</p>
<p>NNG also reports on the differences in web and social media behaviour between >teens, young and older adults</a>.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Teens enjoy sites that provide interactive features like games and quizzes, but young adults want interactivity to serve a purpose and supports their current task</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Young adults are much more confident than older users when encountering and navigating new interfaces, but this makes them error prone &ndash; they often click first, and ask questions later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teens tend to be poor readers and prefer multimedia content. &nbsp;Young adults are stronger but don&rsquo;t enjoy reading large amounts of online text online &ndash; they prefer content that is easy to scan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The visual appeal and tone of sites can vary greatly between teens, younger and older adults</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants came from 7 English-speaking countries, including the UK, and the researchers concluded that there were no significant differences between them.</p>

<p><strong>How do US Employers Rate For-Profit Colleges and Online Degrees?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>The US for-profit HE sector has declined in recent years but is still big business, but how is it regarded by employers?&nbsp; <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/research/do-employers-frown-on-for-profit-degrees" rel="nofollow">The Value of Postsecondary Credentials in the Labor Market: An Experimental Study</a> reports the outcomes of an audit study, in which researchers submitted fictitious applications to companies offering entry-level vacancies, and then monitored call-back rates.&nbsp; For business job openings that required a BA, &ldquo;applicants&rdquo; from public colleges saw a call-back rates of about 8.5% but this fell by 10% for those from F2F for-profit colleges and by 25% for those from online for-profit colleges.&nbsp; For jobs that also required some professional accreditation or licence (e.g. pharmacy), the provenance of the degree made little difference, but for jobs with no degree requirement, a for-profit degree often did not result in higher call back rates than for applicants with no college experience listed at all.</p>

But he cautions that, &ldquo;desired learning results won&rsquo;t come from online tutoring websites that allow anyone to become a tutor.&nbsp; Genuine learning comes from tutors who can provide in-depth subject knowledge and who can connect with students in a way that promotes development.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>How Students Try To Bamboozle Online Proctors</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Proctoring software uses a student's own webcam and microphone to keep an eye on what's occurring as they take an online test.&nbsp; US company Examity analysed 62,534 final exams taken online and scrutinised the 6% in which students tried to violate the rules.&nbsp; They found the use of "cheat sheets" is the most common way students try to <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/04/06/how-students-try-to-bamboozle-online-proctors.aspx?m=2" rel="nofollow">cheat in online tests</a>. &nbsp;The second most common tactic is to use Google Search and Translate, followed by copying test questions for distribution, hiding flashcards underneath the keyboard and hanging answers on walls.&nbsp; Perhaps the most extreme example of cheating discovered by Examity was somebody positioned just outside the room and coughing answers in Morse code.</p>
