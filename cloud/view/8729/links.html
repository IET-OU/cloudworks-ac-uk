        <h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>As a parent my role is to follow instructions given by teachers about how to assist children at home. I am in a position of receiving information about helping my son to learn letters and sounds so that I participate as many other parents in complementary tasks alongside with the main tasks applied at school by teachers at early stage to learn alphabet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>We are inviting to participate at a parent session offered at school for kg 2 classes. This occurs last year in a Lebanese school and the aim is to share with parents the importance of keeping up-to-date with children&rsquo;s homework and shedding light on the way our children can benefit from what has been learnt from school. This gives the opportunity to meet other parents, communicate with teachers by asking questions about specific contexts related to children, meet different people and share experiences.</p>
<p>The key actors are a group of teachers and supervisors that present an educational program in the aim of enhancing learning with very young children and mastering foundation skills in English language taught as a second language and also used as the language of education alongside with Arabic language.</p>
<p>The session was illustrated using the whiteboard technology which shows a PowerPoint presentation that explains the reasons of undertaking such event and focuses on the advantages of collaborating with children in the process of learning. The idea is to inform parents about what is been taught at school concerning letters and sounds and how can this be revised at home with some adult&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>The school actors believe that children can achieve better at school if they are well supported at home so the role of parents become essential in helping children performing their practice of the letters and sounds related.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The session raised important issues. In fact, it has been explained that very young people learn about letters and sounds by visual and auditory memory.&nbsp;A child can know about a letter and the sound related to it by the means of pictures. How can children learn about it through technology and by the use of digital tools? How can we help our children at home&nbsp;and enhance the process of&nbsp;learning at early age? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the strategies used to encourage children in their experience of learning about letters and sounds?</p>
<p>Education is considered to be acquired from teachers and the social environment in which children live so at early age, children rely on both school and home. So for children to have a solid background in English, parents are trained to repeat sounds at home and practice the letter been taught for the week. The aim is to ensure a good pronunciation of the words and the recognition of letters and sounds by children. The success of the session was measured by the number of people including parents that took part in the event and their appreciation of the main ideas promoted in the presentation of the topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li>Presentation of the purpose of undertaking such an event.</li>
<li>Explaining how learning letters is scheduled in class throughout the academic year and how homework should be performed.</li>
<li>In week 1, children learn about a sound at school, in week 2 children should be able to recognise the letter and sound related in different vocabulary words, in week 3 homework is given and this needs parents&rsquo; help.</li>
<li>Drinking tea, coffee</li>
<li>Distributing worksheets and CDs to parents and starting to work on first letter</li>
<li>Working on the visual (picture attributed to the letter like A for apple) and hearing the audio sound related.</li>
<li>Encourage parents to practice sounds and read book stories to their children.</li>
<li>Filling a questionnaire about how parents found the session and how it has been useful for them in assisting their children at home.</li>
<li>Discussion and final part where people are invited to ask questions or give account about their own experience with their children.</li>
</ul>
<p>The session was organised in English language but switching to Arabic was used when some parents or member of the audience encounter difficulties of comprehension.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The session has been designed to give an insight on learning letters and sounds. There was a large audience so this shows how much the topic is for interest of parents. It was expected to see more mothers at the event but it was very interesting to see fathers as well.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>As a parent, I felt satisfaction of knowing how to deal with my son in some of the tasks performed in class. My experience of working with my son on some activities shows successful results at school so I agree that the more we collaborate with our children at home, the more children can get better skills because language is all about practice. The session gives an insight for parents to know what is going on about classes.</p>
