        <h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>Workshop/network facilitator </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>HE (Higher Education) led workshops for small scale primary and secondary classroom Action Research (AR) projects as CPD (Continuing Professional Development) or school research focus. The AR projects to form case studies for analysis and research by the lead university.<br /> <br /> </em></p>
<p><em>Initial workshops took place face to face either in whole school INSET days or &lsquo;twilight&rsquo; workshops in the nearest university provider to the school. 2<sup>nd</sup> &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup> workshops initially delivered face to face but due to realities of time-poor teaching profession increasingly looked to move to on-line/distance learning offering after analysis of project feedback.<br /> <br /> The key actors were the lead HE Education research unit, with HE partners also facilitating sessions and teaching professionals from primary and secondary sector<br /> <br /> Focus for the workshops and AR was &lsquo;Expansive Education&rsquo; http://www.expansiveeducation.net/page-1730518</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>To achieve improved engagement amongst participants after the initial workshop and increase final written AR reports.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions (KW &ndash; me)</h2>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project sign up request from school (or university) request lead member name and member e-mails from the school for enrolment on GroupSpaces (GS) system</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School and joining members receive welcome e-mail from Groupspaces system inviting them to confirm membership by logging in and setting a password &ndash; they then have access to member only area with all workshop resources and case study library.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead member also receives e-mail from KW welcoming to network (and making sure system invitation has not been caught by firewall)</p>
<p><strong>issue 1 : participants needed to set passwords for site &ndash; unclear reset procedure &ndash; many e-mails asking for manual re-set &ndash; time consuming</strong></p>
<p><strong>issue 2 &ndash; Groupspaces site stops providing backend support 2015 &ndash; migration of full project listing and material to new group hosting Wild Apricot</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notify university tutor of school enrolled. University tutor sends out e-mail to invite to AR1 workshop. If no workshop scheduled tutor sets date and books room for AR1 workshop.</p>
<p><strong>issue 3: HE partner tutors variable in engagement and understanding of GS system I often ended up organising for them</strong></p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tutor informs KW of workshop, KW posts to website event page with map and sends system invitation to all enrolled for it.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortnight prior to workshop GS reminds teachers to RSVP to event. Week prior to workshop GS prompts again and reminds attendees about workshop</p>
<p><strong>issue 4: automated e-mailing not always reliable, due to firewall and sheer volume of e-mails some teachers received</strong></p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AR1 workshop &ndash; Tutor and participant resources on Dropbox &ndash; Facilitator Guide, Powerpoint&nbsp; and agenda template also resources R1 &ndash; 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>issue 5: Dropbox more widely used &ndash; participants reluctant to engage in GS site to the barrier of logging in</strong></p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attendees go away from AR1 workshop with idea for AR question and tutor sets date for next workshop AR2 with them, if possible.</p>
<p><strong>issue 6: High rates of attrition from AR1 to 2 &ndash; offered Skype or Adobe Connect session for AR2 and AR3 &ndash; much higher rates of uptake</strong></p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to AR2 KW send invites and prompts out, tutor sends out e-mail to lead member reminding them to bring Emerging AR plan (R4) to next workshop</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AR2 workshop &ndash; consolidate AR question and help teachers on path to AR3 - presenting findings</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AR3 workshop presenting findings &ndash; then on to publishing final report on Wordpress</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>Expected outcomes: &nbsp;More participants finishing course of workshops, greater involvement of staff researchers from the university, small increase in final reports submitted.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Unexpected outcomes: More international schools participated wholly via distance learning, further research and development of the project with TEL (Technology Enhanced learning Department) of project resources on the internal learning network (this did not quite work as more passwords and logging in required, developed links with Aberdeen Universities TEPL (Technology Enhanced Professional Learning Unit)</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>The success or failure of the AR projects came down the motivation for the teachers taking part. If the school lead was very engaged and active&nbsp; &ndash; so was their cohort. For these schools offering a more flexible way of taking part not only helped with time issue but gave them direct access to the lead researchers on Expansive Education project through smaller online sessions<br /> <br /> Some teachers were not quite sure why they were taking part and barely made it through the first workshop &ndash; usually a head had simply &lsquo;signed them up&rsquo; (it seemed hoping that research CPD would have some sort of magical positive effect ) If there was any perceived problem in the process (ie logins, time between workshops, change of senior management) these teachers would quickly disengage.</em></p>
