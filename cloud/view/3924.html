                   <p>It was a wonderful presentation - very well-planned delivery, thoughtful, clear, friendly approach and sound in all respects. Sometimes you watch an excellent movie and you can't get it out of your mind for days - it was that kind of a presentation.<br />&nbsp;<br />Regards,<br />&nbsp;<br />Shailey Minocha (MCT)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Yes, I really enjoyed the session.&nbsp; It was most informative and Doug's presentation was a good mix of explanation and responding to questions from the audience, so there was no boredom.&nbsp; I even thought about studying S159 Neighbourhood nature!&nbsp; It's an interesting site and I look forward to tracking its development.<br />&nbsp;<br />Regards<br />&nbsp; <br />Jan Jones (IET) <br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I thoroughly enjoyed Doug&rsquo;s iSpot presentation, I had no idea it was such a comprehensive site and reached out to so many people.&nbsp; It really is a fantastic tool for any nature lover/spotter and I am very impressed that it is being used in OU courses &ndash; well done Doug and the team!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sue Roberts (IET)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />A very good session &ndash; an enthusiastic presentation. The only slight disappointment was that Doug didn&rsquo;t have enough time to put across some of the pedagogical ideas that he&rsquo;d clearly prepared for on his slides.</p>
<p>Overall very good.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Martin Smith (IET)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I found the session very informative and inspirational. I gained an idea of how the website could be of use to a wide range of stakeholder groups, saw how a vibrant community with a specific interest was having a service delivered, and was excited enough by what I&rsquo;d seen to sign up as an iSpot member! (Currently thinking of studying T189 so I can perfect my photography before having a go at S159).</p>
<p>Doug&rsquo;s presentation was very well delivered, and was well thought out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d have loved to have known how many people have come through the site, studied S159, and then gone on to further studies with us.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>Jason Clark (Marketing and Sales)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I found the presentation very informative and loosely linked to one area of research I am involved with &ndash; that is looking at evaluating the new online learning design sharing interface called OpenDesignStudio.&nbsp; Although different from iSpot the interface is based around a similar platform where students upload images of their work and share it with others by actively commenting.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is linked with the new Design course U101 Design Thinking.&nbsp; What&nbsp; I found most informative about the session was how iSpot has been evaluated and I it would be good to find out more about this &ndash; as currently I am trying to analyse a huge amount of data which is proving very challenging!&nbsp;&nbsp; So any advice would be appreciated?</p>
<p>Also...the research papers mentioned were also very interesting of which I have since looked up and read.</p>
<p>So many thanks to all.... it is was a great session.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jenny Hart (MCT)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />What a great session and a wonderful project.&nbsp; I just love these projects where the OU works with the BBC and other relevant agencies to produce something worthwhile.&nbsp; It is nice to be included in the gathering of data from ordinary folks like me and you. <br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am inspired to use this with a Sunday School group I sometimes teach.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Jackie Dagger (IET)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I thought it was really interesting to see how this website is being used, the learning it is encouraging and the community it is creating.</p>
<p>I will definitely come to other IET coffee mornings in the future.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Sonia Burton (FELS)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I thought it was an excellent mix of explanation, demonstration and theory. I learned much more than I was expecting to!</p>
<p>Love Doug&rsquo;s presentation style too.<br /><br />Thanks</p>
