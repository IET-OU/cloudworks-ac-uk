We got lucky with the name - 'The Open University' has stood the test of time. Probably better than 'University of the Air'.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">If you were starting an OU now, there are lots of things that are open now that could be a focus - open source, OER, open courses, etc. Now the the idea of the open scholar - Gideon Burton; an agenda building up. Sharing as default is a definining characteristic.</div>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Also a political dimension.

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Notes from Peter Scott:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Project is not in itself about openness. Launched in with Apple 2 years ago, idea was to get OU materials out widely, not about making it open. All the material so far is widely accessible and in reasonable demand by the community.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">None of this is specific to Apple - building back-end systems to reach many people through new channels. Channels could be YouTube, our own VLE, or when a new set-top box turns up. Future proofing.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Need to get metadata right, so have a back-end team working on this. So it'll work for the Apple systems, and any others.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Http://podcast.open.ac.uk - main OU podcast site.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Also http://www.steeple.org.uk/wiki/Main_Page</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Idea is to have a central core repository that feeds out RSS, but can feed it out in to iTunesU, YouTube, Miro, VLE, the web, wealth of open resources.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">iTunes - although it's closed system, people like it because it's well integrated. Significant portion of downloaders of our stuff consume it on the move. In browsing their site, visual browsing is very important - so want to make our albums attractive and striking.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Mira suggests (in chat) that hardly anyone - say 14% - use mobile devices. But Peter says that in surveys of our users, significantly more than half always consumed their media on their mobile device - will publish this soon. (Russell Gurbutt says in chat that 98% of a first-year group had mobile devices.)</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">We produce small file sizes (to make easy downloads) - few people want the large file HD versions.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Apple have been in this channel for a long time. We're not charged to be in the channel, and we're promoted inside it. The browser is a simple web browser and only renders a small subset of HTML; HTML5 is becoming more important. Our content fits very well with this channel, and they're doing nice things. Fun to work with an innovations company.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Have to make it visually striking. Not just American students browsing - wide range of students.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Closing on 20m downloads, by about 2m unique visitors. Warwick have 1m. Our stuff works well here.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">All of our stuff is hosted in Amazon S3; Apple take some of the load too when things peak. Our internal systems wouldn't cope.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Americans do show up very strongly, as you'd expect. Apple promote it to their own market in America. Graph of weekly downloads is very bursty.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">When you're showcased by Apple, you get a lot of traffic. If it's good stuff that you're proud of, can get a lot of people interested.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Want to let OU students consume our media more intelligently. Apple say about half the universities use it primarily for their own students, not in an open way. We are exploring this. Will make sure it's all available to our students in a variety of formats. It's all RSS - some is secured, some isn't. The private stuff isn't freely available. Students may find this very useful, in addition to the VLE.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Are now adding a range of other services now. iPad is giving new ideas. Accompanying apps and so on for interaction. His vision is that if you have a nice mobile device, want OU students - and potential OU students - to have a nice experience of the OU on it. Android will catch up very quickly.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Mobile used to suck, but is significantly easier to develop for the platforms, huge enthusiasm. Was with 5000 Apple developers last week. Don't care what platform, but pleased that Apple are bringing innovation to an easy-to-develop-for and exciting platform.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Lots of universities are taking this up. The platform doesn't matter, designing an experience. Doesn't care if it's Android or Apple or what. Apple promising an 'open' video platform, and HTML5 as the core, as an open standard. Also ePub for books, which is another open standard. That helps with the other platforms too.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Questions:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">How much is it bringing other people in? E.g. not traditional students? Do you have a breakdown? How it related to student signups?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Peter: The OU doesn't do a lot in the market that people are downloading this for - we don't have a lot of American students, and we don't work for them - and about 1/3 of our downloaders are in the UK. So not many come through directly from iTunesU to OU study. But 2m have come to hear about the OU - open learning, new ways to learn.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Linda Wilks: How does your team encourage academics to put their materials on iTunesU?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Peter: We work hard with Faculties to see how to improve their content. KMi have led the charge, as innovators, now moving over to mainstream via LTS. Being led by Andrew Law in Open Media office. Just one of many channels - successful and cool one, is better with mobiles and audio than e.g. YouTube. Andrew's challenge is to have an overarching strategy.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Chris: HTML5 - will it become a standard?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Peter: Apple good at forcing the market. Battle with Flash is depressing. Hope they work it out.</div>

<p>iTunes - although it's closed system, people like it because it's well integrated. Significant portion of downloaders of our stuff consume it on the move. In browsing their site, visual browsing is very important - so want to make our albums attractive and striking.</p>
<p>Mira suggests (in chat) that hardly anyone - say 14% - use mobile devices. But Peter says that in surveys of our users, significantly more than half always consumed their media on their mobile device - will publish this soon. (Russell Gurbutt says in chat that 98% of a first-year group had mobile devices.)</p>
<p>We produce small file sizes (to make easy downloads) - few people want the large file HD versions.</p>
<p>Apple have been in this channel for a long time. We're not charged to be in the channel, and we're promoted inside it. The browser is a simple web browser and only renders a small subset of HTML; HTML5 is becoming more important. Our content fits very well with this channel, and they're doing nice things. Fun to work with an innovations company.</p>
<p>Have to make it visually striking. Not just American students browsing - wide range of students.</p>
<p>Closing on 20m downloads, by about 2m unique visitors. Warwick have 1m. Our stuff works well here.</p>
<p>All of our stuff is hosted in Amazon S3; Apple take some of the load too when things peak. Our internal systems wouldn't cope.</p>
<p>The Americans do show up very strongly, as you'd expect. Apple promote it to their own market in America. Graph of weekly downloads is very bursty.</p>
<p>When you're showcased by Apple, you get a lot of traffic. If it's good stuff that you're proud of, can get a lot of people interested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to let OU students consume our media more intelligently. Apple say about half the universities use it primarily for their own students, not in an open way. We are exploring this. Will make sure it's all available to our students in a variety of formats. It's all RSS - some is secured, some isn't. The private stuff isn't freely available. Students may find this very useful, in addition to the VLE.</p>
<p>Are now adding a range of other services now. iPad is giving new ideas. Accompanying apps and so on for interaction. His vision is that if you have a nice mobile device, want OU students - and potential OU students - to have a nice experience of the OU on it. Android will catch up very quickly.</p>
<p>Mobile used to suck, but is significantly easier to develop for the platforms, huge enthusiasm. Was with 5000 Apple developers last week. Don't care what platform, but pleased that Apple are bringing innovation to an easy-to-develop-for and exciting platform.</p>
<p>Lots of universities are taking this up. The platform doesn't matter, designing an experience. Doesn't care if it's Android or Apple or what. Apple promising an 'open' video platform, and HTML5 as the core, as an open standard. Also ePub for books, which is another open standard. That helps with the other platforms too.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>How much is it bringing other people in? E.g. not traditional students? Do you have a breakdown? How it related to student signups?</p>
<p>Peter: The OU doesn't do a lot in the market that people are downloading this for - we don't have a lot of American students, and we don't work for them - and about 1/3 of our downloaders are in the UK. So not many come through directly from iTunesU to OU study. But 2m have come to hear about the OU - open learning, new ways to learn.</p>
<p>Linda Wilks: How does your team encourage academics to put their materials on iTunesU?</p>
<p>Peter: We work hard with Faculties to see how to improve their content. KMi have led the charge, as innovators, now moving over to mainstream via LTS. Being led by Andrew Law in Open Media office. Just one of many channels - successful and cool one, is better with mobiles and audio than e.g. YouTube. Andrew's challenge is to have an overarching strategy.</p>
<p>Chris: HTML5 - will it become a standard?</p>
<p>Peter: Apple good at forcing the market. Battle with Flash is depressing. Hope they work it out.</p>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Diane Brewster: Curious as to whether students use open content for information or inspiration. Suspicion is the latter, not the former.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Martin: May be something in that. Like Wikipedia, Google, want something right now. Now have had the first phase of web, will people do more complex things? Weave together educational resources and put them in a meaningful context. Inspiration is interested. Has started doing Flickr photo-a-day thing; use Flickr already posted as inspiration.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Diane Brewster: Replacement for idea of inspiring lecturer - perhaps we've lost a lot of that in HE. But some of the OU content on e.g. iTunesU is quite inspiring. Informative too, but more to kick start me sometimes, put me in the zone to go on and learn more. The content not so important as the motivation.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Martin: True. Get inspiration from good Slideshare or YouTube - it's about creativity, seeing what you can do. Ran a project on trying to get people to produce digital outputs. Best way was to show cool stuff people had done.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Simon Buckingham Shum: Distinction between inspiration and content might not be clear. As people mix things together, they become more personal and useful. An OER at the moment was designed by someone, for someone else (probably). But as more comes online, and people weave more threads through them - statistically there's a better chance that there'll be something that suits you. A prediction that we might see this happening in the years to come.</div>

Telling students how they could use OERs, rather than letting them find them for themselves. Giving some guidance. Teachers having responsibility to help learners find and use content.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Simon: In one sense, teachers and educators already send students out on to the web. Some teachers might avoid their responsibilities, but it is their job to create a meaningful learning task.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Michael: Made an initial foray with podcasts.

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Simon: Tension between learner and educator-defined journeys? I don't see one. OU learners want someone to have crafted a learning journey for them. But the social web lets people see they can take other routes. Will say more this afternoon.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Marie Arndt: Example of daughter being asked to 'research' on web.

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Live notes from Frank Rennie - Using OER for course design</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Martin: Frank Rennie is the Indiana Jones of rural development</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Frank:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Images to show about making HE available where you are. sideCAP - staff innovation in distance education in the Carribean and [some other countries]. Looking at supporting universities - Fiji, Mauritius and somewhere else.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Looking at OER in particular. Many of these university sectors, there may be a main institution, but if it cost anything at all, they couldn't afford it. So move away from customised/bespoke products to software that's free, and to OER. Then contextualisation of those, to make them relevant.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">There are two camps. First, adoption of resources for education - some luddites won't use them no matter what. Early adopters who will use them no matter what. And bulk of people in the middle. Secondly, for OER, the vast proportion of people using them use them as-is - download them, or link to - and just customise what they do in the classroom or VLE around that. They don't modify; they may ignore part of the whole thing. A smaller proportion of the users take it and modify or customise. And an even smaller group will then create their own and make them available.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Four components of what a learning situation is about - tutorials, peer-to-peer discussion, assessment, and certification/award. But they can be provided in all sorts of different ways and ends. And they all benefit from improved resources at the base.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">One key thing from sideCAP - identifying how you create courses using OER. There are hundreds of thousands of OER, but fewer courses. Made a flowchart, to show it's important to retain a broad focus at the start - don't narrow options at the start.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">To create a course: Start wide, see what's available by searching widely. Write wrap-around materials. May find that you don't have enough specificity at that point, so then add your new materials to localise/make specific. Only then do you decide what the bigger issues are about how it's to be hosted/what format. Sets the conventional methodology upside down - where you're specific at the start and do a lot of the writing. 20 years ago you had to write the textbook to start. But not now - only write the bits that are not available in the quantity or context that you want.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">They created a course to demonstrate this process. What does it mean in practice? Course on climate change and sustainable development and rural areas.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Went through the process of course creation, then put on UHI VLE - Blackboard. But just have one link - to a wiki where all the stuff is. Blackboard supplies all the surrounding facilities (internal links, discussion, etc), but the main teaching materials are elsewhere. Used WetPaint as a wiki. So people who want to add things can do so if you give them the password, everyone benefits. Very practical solution. But breaches internal security procedures since is an externally-hosted site.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The course is available on wetpaint, OpenLearn, and in a printed report, and OpenOffice, and on a DVD for places where their online access is patchy or lowband.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Questions:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Martin: Having worked on those projects, interesting cultural attitudes to reuse. Had feeling that people were quite resistant because they had to fight hard to become a professional academic, so reusing was undermining that.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Frank: Varies widely from country to country. In Nepal, will cheerfully tell you there's no such thing as copyright in Nepal. In other countries, place a lot of faith in the master or senior person there, who doesn't then want to lose face by looking like they don't know about something. Their knowledge of educational technology may be weak. Need to encourage people to step on each others' shoulders. So project began about cultural shift. Less problem with adopting materials from the Internet - the biggest and most frequent hits for OER, open degrees, etc - comes from India, Thailand, rest of Asia, not Europe/N America/Australia.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">John: How do you identify quality in resources? And (Juliette question) lack of appropriate content was the main issue.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Frank: So much material out there it's staggering, frightening. Now we're trying to use a new application of technology with an old etiquette. Haven't made the shift in to that. It's quite different to reuse, share. His children think nothing of sharing images, videoclips and so on. Last thing they think about is copyright. We have been inculcated by idea that copyright is sacrosanct. Copyright is actually a barrier to getting information out there and shared. Worries less about books and slides being copied than people who want them not seeing them. Relates to quality question - Martin and I have had discussion about big-OER and small-OER. Big-OER is institutional, small-OER done on the fly, very quickly. Has to meet in the middle. Question about institutions recognising the change in etiquette. Need to embrace OER creation and sharing, get best of both worlds: institutional support, peer review - but doesn't stultify or stagnate. &nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">edevUOD: Interested in thoughts about reliability of open source material, and how that should feature in the pedagogical design.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Frank: Very broad question. We spend a lot of time in academia, from primary level, teaching kids and students how to recognise quality in print materials. If we're training people how to recognise these resources, need to start a long way back. How to recognise a good quality website is really hard, never mind a good OER. Simply getting a report on what websites are useful and why on a topic from students can be hard. If you search for farming and agriculture, will get very different results. Get mediocre value in the middle where it's fudged. In creating digital material emphasis has to be on sharing and opening up. In sideCAP, the resources page was them trying to filter down resources useful for OER that are tried-and-tested as a first base to go to. Repositories, how-to guides, etc. It's only by reputation and reuse that we establish a hierarchy of usefulness. This approach can shrink the time to produce a course - only 2-4 weeks, rather than many months building it from scratch. Some clever Amazon-recommendation system, or rating system for resources, would be good. But copyright stands in the way by blocking access.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">John Pettit: Tension between hierarchy and self-directed learners.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Wendy Maples: Interested to hear it reduces time to make a course. Can see how that might work if you're a single academic working alone on a course, trying to create something small. Other thing - the reverse, the creation of online/open educational resources. How small universities might feel in the face of the volume of material created by big institutions like the OU. Have immense power in what we can accomplish, much resource to go in to these. Small institutions don't seem to have that. Small OER versus big OER?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Frank: Small institutions are not prohibited. Too often we've spent vast sums of money on Rolls-Royce resources, but they become useless quickly because things move on. So argument for producing something less polished but immediate - good quality enough to be used in that context, and has an immediacy. Not suggesting that less used stuff should fall off the bench, but less good quality stuff. See this happening - the inter-institutional sharing of material to make broader, wider, deeper resources than either could make themselves. We over-anguish about producing e.g. TV-broadcastable quality. That has a place, but can get things on YouTube that are much more grainy and stilted, but illustrate the point very well. Working with Iceland and Sweden on materials for their areas; contextualised differently, but the general material the same and the pedagogy very similar. We can use things if we come off our high claims. Sometimes we have an over-dependency on specialist resources.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Wendy: Agree with much of this. Getting learners to do informal or formal learning pulling things together themselves from OER. To what extent can we ask students to do that on a regular basis? What we as educators offer is platforms to enable them to engage with the wider world of information. Bit different from personal learning activities. But effectively creating their own courses. They've always done this - choosing the bits of what chapters to read, discussing with their peers. This is an opportunity for recognising this.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Frank: Yes. Similar process to 10-15y ago, when student had trouble with a textbook, have a discussion, send them to another book on same topic. On Academia.com there are good lectures, but also some ropey things of people writing on a blackboard for an hour - deemed to be quality only because it comes from somewhere important. Fine line. Also chunking things too big - e.g. whole lecture or nothing but. Small snippets can be very useful. TED talks are like this - small, snappy.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Bieke Schreurs: Anybody know about a PhD on OER/Open Courses</div>

Worries less about books and slides being copied than people who want them not seeing them. Relates to quality question - Martin and I have had discussion about big-OER and small-OER. Big-OER is institutional, small-OER done on the fly, very quickly. Has to meet in the middle. Question about institutions recognising the change in etiquette. Need to embrace OER creation and sharing, get best of both worlds: institutional support, peer review - but doesn't stultify or stagnate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>edevUOD: Interested in thoughts about reliability of open source material, and how that should feature in the pedagogical design.</p>
<p>Frank: Very broad question. We spend a lot of time in academia, from primary level, teaching kids and students how to recognise quality in print materials. If we're training people how to recognise these resources, need to start a long way back. How to recognise a good quality website is really hard, never mind a good OER. Simply getting a report on what websites are useful and why on a topic from students can be hard. If you search for farming and agriculture, will get very different results. Get mediocre value in the middle where it's fudged. In creating digital material emphasis has to be on sharing and opening up. In sideCAP, the resources page was them trying to filter down resources useful for OER that are tried-and-tested as a first base to go to. Repositories, how-to guides, etc. It's only by reputation and reuse that we establish a hierarchy of usefulness. This approach can shrink the time to produce a course - only 2-4 weeks, rather than many months building it from scratch. Some clever Amazon-recommendation system, or rating system for resources, would be good. But copyright stands in the way by blocking access.</p>
<p>John Pettit: Tension between hierarchy and self-directed learners.</p>
<p>Wendy Maples: Interested to hear it reduces time to make a course. Can see how that might work if you're a single academic working alone on a course, trying to create something small. Other thing - the reverse, the creation of online/open educational resources. How small universities might feel in the face of the volume of material created by big institutions like the OU. Have immense power in what we can accomplish, much resource to go in to these. Small institutions don't seem to have that. Small OER versus big OER?</p>
<p>Frank: Small institutions are not prohibited. Too often we've spent vast sums of money on Rolls-Royce resources, but they become useless quickly because things move on. So argument for producing something less polished but immediate - good quality enough to be used in that context, and has an immediacy. Not suggesting that less used stuff should fall off the bench, but less good quality stuff. See this happening - the inter-institutional sharing of material to make broader, wider, deeper resources than either could make themselves. We over-anguish about producing e.g. TV-broadcastable quality. That has a place, but can get things on YouTube that are much more grainy and stilted, but illustrate the point very well. Working with Iceland and Sweden on materials for their areas; contextualised differently, but the general material the same and the pedagogy very similar. We can use things if we come off our high claims. Sometimes we have an over-dependency on specialist resources.</p>
<p>Wendy: Agree with much of this. Getting learners to do informal or formal learning pulling things together themselves from OER. To what extent can we ask students to do that on a regular basis? What we as educators offer is platforms to enable them to engage with the wider world of information. Bit different from personal learning activities. But effectively creating their own courses. They've always done this - choosing the bits of what chapters to read, discussing with their peers. This is an opportunity for recognising this.</p>
<p>Frank: Yes. Similar process to 10-15y ago, when student had trouble with a textbook, have a discussion, send them to another book on same topic. On Academia.com there are good lectures, but also some ropey things of people writing on a blackboard for an hour - deemed to be quality only because it comes from somewhere important. Fine line. Also chunking things too big - e.g. whole lecture or nothing but. Small snippets can be very useful. TED talks are like this - small, snappy.</p>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Martin: Frank Rennie is the Indiana Jones of rural development</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Frank:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Images to show about making HE available where you are. sideCAP - staff innovation in distance education in the Carribean and [some other countries]. Looking at supporting universities - Fiji, Mauritius and somewhere else.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Looking at OER in particular. Many of these university sectors, there may be a main institution, but if it cost anything at all, they couldn't afford it. So move away from customised/bespoke products to software that's free, and to OER. Then contextualisation of those, to make them relevant.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">There are two camps. First, adoption of resources for education - some luddites won't use them no matter what. Early adopters who will use them no matter what. And bulk of people in the middle. Secondly, for OER, the vast proportion of people using them use them as-is - download them, or link to - and just customise what they do in the classroom or VLE around that. They don't modify; they may ignore part of the whole thing. A smaller proportion of the users take it and modify or customise. And an even smaller group will then create their own and make them available.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Four components of what a learning situation is about - tutorials, peer-to-peer discussion, assessment, and certification/award. But they can be provided in all sorts of different ways and ends. And they all benefit from improved resources at the base.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">One key thing from sideCAP - identifying how you create courses using OER. There are hundreds of thousands of OER, but fewer courses. Made a flowchart, to show it's important to retain a broad focus at the start - don't narrow options at the start.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">To create a course: Start wide, see what's available by searching widely. Write wrap-around materials. May find that you don't have enough specificity at that point, so then add your new materials to localise/make specific. Only then do you decide what the bigger issues are about how it's to be hosted/what format. Sets the conventional methodology upside down - where you're specific at the start and do a lot of the writing. 20 years ago you had to write the textbook to start. But not now - only write the bits that are not available in the quantity or context that you want.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">They created a course to demonstrate this process. What does it mean in practice? Course on climate change and sustainable development and rural areas.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Went through the process of course creation, then put on UHI VLE - Blackboard. But just have one link - to a wiki where all the stuff is. Blackboard supplies all the surrounding facilities (internal links, discussion, etc), but the main teaching materials are elsewhere. Used WetPaint as a wiki. So people who want to add things can do so if you give them the password, everyone benefits. Very practical solution. But breaches internal security procedures since is an externally-hosted site.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The course is available on wetpaint, OpenLearn, and in a printed report, and OpenOffice, and on a DVD for places where their online access is patchy or lowband.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Questions:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Martin: Having worked on those projects, interesting cultural attitudes to reuse. Had feeling that people were quite resistant because they had to fight hard to become a professional academic, so reusing was undermining that.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Frank: Varies widely from country to country. In Nepal, will cheerfully tell you there's no such thing as copyright in Nepal. In other countries, place a lot of faith in the master or senior person there, who doesn't then want to lose face by looking like they don't know about something. Their knowledge of educational technology may be weak. Need to encourage people to step on each others' shoulders. So project began about cultural shift. Less problem with adopting materials from the Internet - the biggest and most frequent hits for OER, open degrees, etc - comes from India, Thailand, rest of Asia, not Europe/N America/Australia.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">John: How do you identify quality in resources? And (Juliette question) lack of appropriate content was the main issue.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Frank: So much material out there it's staggering, frightening. Now we're trying to use a new application of technology with an old etiquette. Haven't made the shift in to that. It's quite different to reuse, share. His children think nothing of sharing images, videoclips and so on. Last thing they think about is copyright. We have been inculcated by idea that copyright is sacrosanct. Copyright is actually a barrier to getting information out there and shared. Worries less about books and slides being copied than people who want them not seeing them.
