        <p><br />The goal of this workshop is to develop the notion of technology-enhanced <br />formative assessment (TEFA) further, combining expertise from pedagogy, <br />educational measurement, cognitive science and information technology. The <br />workshop aims at promoting formative assessment and evaluation as a component <br />for extending existing or new technology-enhanced learning approaches. <br />Formative assessment has already demonstrated its positive impact on learning <br />in general, and helps the learner to achieve self-regulation skills. Furthermore,<br />learner models can provide valuable information for the adaptation of learning <br />resources and processes in the online learning environments of today.</p>

<p><em>Abstract </em>&mdash; a very important part of the education process is the feedback learners get from their teachers and tutors. Sometimes the feedback is not adequate because the concentration of educators is on grading. In this paper the focus is on the development of the new software tool eAAM (electronic assignment assessment &amp; moderation), which combines grading and formative assessment for different formats of assignments.</p>

<p>In this <strong>position statement</strong> we address the issue:</p>
<p><em>What is required to empower the users </em><em>(</em><em>students, peers, teachers, parents, employers</em><em>) to make best use of Technology Enhanced Formative Assessment (TEFA) in order to guide learning?</em></p>
<p>Peer assessment is an important component of a participatory culture of learning (Kollar &amp; Fischer, 2010) and an important component in the design of learning environments implementing this contemporary culture of learning. Fadel, Honey, and Pasnik (2007) argue that as we have moved towards more participatory culture, such as collaborative learning and knowledge building, new methods of assessment are required.&nbsp; In our work we are focused on providing &ldquo;playful&rdquo; peer assessment possibilities in a science learning environment. Peer assessment <strong><em>empowers</em></strong> students and peers by enabling students to take charge of their learning, and become active learners who take responsibility for, and manage, their own learning (Black, Harrison, Lee, Marshall &amp; William, 2002; Boud, 1995; Dochy et<strong> </strong>al., 1999; Topping, 2003; Yang, Badger, &amp; Yu, 2006). For example, it enables students to learn to assess and to develop assessment skills, either when they enact peer assessment themselves or when receiving an assessment from their peers, and at the same time, it enhances students&rsquo; learning through knowledge diffusion and exchange of ideas, even when they are incorrect.</p>
<p>We believe that <em>peer feedback</em>, a form of formative peer assessment, needs to be <em>lightweight</em>, <em>easy to use</em>, and <em>seamlessly integrated</em> into the learning process. We are inspired by interaction mechanisms in participatory communities such as digit.no (photography site).&nbsp; Our ideas are being implemented in the European 7<sup>th</sup> framework integrated project SCY (Science Created by You; <a href="http://www.scy-net.eu/" rel="nofollow">www.scy-net.eu</a>). SCY takes an approach to learning where student developed artefacts are central (de Jong et al., forthcoming). During a SCY mission learners gather and process information, design and conduct experiments, make interpretations and abstraction, and communicate their conclusions; in other words they have to engage in processes of active learning, based on inquiry, knowledge building, and learning by design.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, students embark on a mission such as &ldquo;Design a CO2 friendly house&rdquo; and through inquiry learning activities supported by resources, tools and scaffolds embedded in SCY-LAB (the SCY learning environment) create a number of ELOs (Emerging Learning Objects to complete the mission. The collection of ELOs developed during the mission represents the acquired knowledge and skill of the student. Thus, in our approach to assessment (Vold, Wasson &amp; de Jong, forthcoming) these ELOs are central. ELOs placed in the SCYePortfolio form the basis of summative evaluation to be carried out by teachers after the mission is completed, while peers provide formative assessment, through a specially designed tool, during the mission. In this workshop we are interested in discussing our approach to peer assessment and describe the design of SCYFeedback, a tool that will be used for &ldquo;playful&rdquo; peer feedback during the learning process. We refer to this as &ldquo;playful&rdquo; as we aim to provide a tool that will entice and motivate students to give and receive feedback on the ELOs they create, thus <em>empowering</em> them during the learning process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, our perspective on and approach to empowering students and peers is inspired by:</p>
<ul>
<li>an increasing view of learning as a participative activity (Kollar &amp; Fischer, 2009) </li>
<li>feedback, as an integral part of the students&rsquo; learning process, has the potential to make the process more productive (Dysthe, Lillejord, Wasson, &amp; Vines, 2009).</li>
<li>the recognition that peer assessment can motivate students to engage in the learning process (Sluijsmans, et al. 2002)</li>
<li>Ronen and Langley (2004) who point to the benefits of peer assessment when students are provided the opportunity to learn from artefacts created by their peers, </li>
<li>Falchikov (2003) who shows how peer assessment assists students to create higher quality artefacts,</li>
<li>the recognition that many people (students included) take part in participatory worlds that offer interaction among the participants around a common interest</li>
<li>research that indicates that formal instructional intervention asking students to reflect on feedback from peers does not significantly increase learning gains (</li>
<li>students are more willing to accept feedback given in &ldquo;student-speak&rdquo; (Frost and Turner, 2005) <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>an interest in trying &ldquo;something new, lightweight and motivating&rdquo; within the field of peer assessment utilising the benefits of using a lightweight Web 2.0 tool<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>SCYFeedback will be tested during the upcoming field trials in the SCY project. Important research questions will be: Are students empowered during the learning process by using SCYFeedback? When do the students use the SCYFeedback tool? Is this form of playful peer assessment motivating? Is feedback actually provided? What other items could be added to the tool? For example, a means of rating whether or not the feedback was useful could also be added to the playful peer assessment tool. Peer assessment data, including observations, video, data logs, screen shots and ELOs, collected from this field trial will be analysed to determine how much the tool is used, how it is used, the content of the peer feedback and its impact on the learning process. Only after this analysis will we be able to say anything conclusive about this approach to peer feedback.</p>
