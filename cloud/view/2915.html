<p><em>Learning Design overview</em></p>
<ul>
<li>New field of e-learning, focus on describing and sharing sequences of learning activities</li>
<li>Supports both individual and collaborative learning</li>
<li>Sequences can provide generic pedagogical methods (e.g. role play), where teachers add their own content or can include discipline specific information (e.g. role play on climate change) ready for immediate use</li>
<li>Learning Design systems support the authoring and running of sequences &ndash; running a sequence can include automatic set up of appropriate learning tools (eg forums, quiz, chat, etc); System steps students through the sequence and monitors their progress; Examples include Coppercore, SLeD, GLM and LAMS</li>
<li>Learning Design systems can integrate with Learning Management Systems &ndash; link to sequence(s) from course page</li>
<li>While a teacher can create and use a sequence on their own, the great promise of Learning Design is sharing of good e-teaching ideas (that is effective sequences) among teachers</li>
<li>Good e-teaching ideas may include advice on how to edit or adapt a sequence template for different topics</li>
<li>Online communities exists for sharing and discussing</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Learning Design and pedagogical theories</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Learning Design is not a traditional pedagogical theory: it does not propose a model of how students learn or how teacher should teach &ndash; aspires to be pedagogically neutral, that is, able to describe many diff ped. models</li>
<li>Provides a language or framework for describing many different kinds of teaching and learning activities &ndash; based on descriptions of each learning activity (who, what, how?) within a sequence of activities</li>
<li>However LD gives prominence to the role of both the teacher and learners</li>
<li>It also gives prominence to collaborative learning, how students interact with each other to learn</li>
<li>Taken together, LD is often seen as fostering more collaborative learning</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Collaborative learning</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Many recent pedagogical theories focus on student engagement and motivation, how students construct meaning, authentic assessment, etc.</li>
<li>Collaborative learning is one of the main ways that teaching can be changed to support these theories, foster groupwork, discussion, debate, and other group tasks</li>
<li>Also collaborative learning fosters development of generic skills, such as teamwork and critical thinking</li>
<li>So LD can be used to implement online collaborative learning to support recent pedagogical theories and development of generic skills</li>
<li>And sharing of sequences allos many teachers to benefit from good idea from a few teachers</li>
<li>So LD can enhance student-centered learning through more collaboration and increased sharing of good ideas between teachers</li>
</ul>
<p>James gave two case studies examples - one on open questions and one on role play and demoed these live in LAMS, links to each are provided (note you need to create an account on the LAMS community space to access)</p>
<p>Case study 1 &ndash; open questions</p>
<ul>
<li>For information-dense lectures, it can be helpful to pose open questions to students from time to time &ndash; students consolidate their understanding of new ideas by trying to answer questions, teachers can gain some appreciation of students understanding from answers given</li>
<li>But students may be shy or concerned about giving a wrong answer in front of others or may take too long it many students answer</li>
<li>A solution is to use online questions where each students answer the question (anonymously) then sees others&rsquo; answers &ndash; students can privately reflect on their understanding and on ideas from other students, can be before, during or after the lecture</li>
<li>The teacher can benefit from seeing a range of different answers, and may use some answers to link ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>Case study 2 &ndash; role play</p>
<ul>
<li>More advanced pedagoical method</li>
<li>Students go to an imaginery situation and each has a differnt role in that situation, and play that role</li>
<li>Particualry effective at helping students to see complex problmes from a perspective otehr than their own personal ideas - where understanding multiple points of view is important for learning</li>
<li>Normally 4 parts: introduction to the role play, allocation to roles, main role play and then stepping back and reflection on the role play</li>
<li>While there can be a differnt role for each student it is more common to have a small numer of roles and have several students within each role group - to allow for discussion of ideas within role groups as well as between role groups</li>
<li>Timing is important to the success of role play - students need enoigh time to develop their ideas and debate diferent viewpoints - for async. online role plays this may take several weeks</li>
<li>While role plays are designed for student interaction (rather than teacher direction), the teacher must still monitor discussions closely and help redirect students if they go off track</li>
<li>Role plays are complex and take time to organise and run, but they can be very rewarding for topics that benefit from discussion of differnent viewpoints</li>
<li>If students are unfamiliar with role play they may need simpler collaborative tasks before doing a role play</li>
<li>Useful to provide a step-by-step walk through of the role play</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the specific LD sequences teachers can also use generic templates and adapt to their own interests.</p>
<p>By using these examples means it can be re-used by many other teachers in different topic areas. The sequence itself can be extended, for example by adding an online discussion forum.</p>
<p>Almost 500 case studies are now available on the LAMS website. also many research papers available on the site</p>
<p>Has a Japanese version of site see Yamazumi and Yoshida (2008)</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides a framework for creating and sharing effective teaching methods</li>
<li>LD systems can implement these methods to run with students and track their progress</li>
<li>LD communities provide support for sharing sequences - both as templates and ready to run topic examples</li>
