<p class="qote" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>I'd rather leave the job I love than teach the government&rsquo;s propaganda</em></p>
<p class="qote" align="right"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/may/18/gove-leaving-teaching-curriculum-changes-history?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487" rel="nofollow">the secret teacher</a></p>
<p class="main">The secret teacher speaks for himself; we don't know how many other teachers and lecturers would endorse this condemnation of curriculum abuse.&nbsp; But he may well get a cheer from educators who would not call themselves &lsquo;teachers&rsquo; or &lsquo;lecturers&rsquo;.&nbsp; Education has agencies other than schools-and-colleges.&nbsp; Every locality has some such free-standing voluntary agency or social enterprise. organising help in what is called &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="main">My shot at explaining all this is set out in an earlier <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8484" rel="nofollow">account of education and policy</a>.&nbsp; I examined influences on education, the beliefs they call upon, and the risks they pose.&nbsp; Here I ask how education can respond to those pressures, by forming and activating stakeholder groups as part of civil society.&nbsp; Civil society, by definition, acts independently of commercial and political pressures.&nbsp; And stakeholder groups give voice to that independence.&nbsp; This blog asks what kind of conversations about education that independence sets up.&nbsp; It means probing what different groups want from curriculum, what commitments they each seek, and what varied outcomes they try to realise.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">The possibilities are far-reaching, especially when education for selection is set alongside education for well being.&nbsp; I look for what gets argued when education for competitiveness is set alongside education for fulfilment.&nbsp; The term &lsquo;learning-for-living&rsquo; crops up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">Curriculum development needs all the independent support it can find in schools and colleges.&nbsp; But an independent education may need civil society more than is yet obvious, even to the secret teacher and his allies.&nbsp; This blog faces the probability that education will be privatised; government is in no position to resist the leverage of commercial interests looking for new markets.&nbsp; Thinking about the future of education needs, then, to grapple with all the possibilities - if not in the public service then in civil society.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">It&rsquo;s a long-term project - bigger than a parliament.&nbsp; But Labour is calling for local communities, in partnership with businesses, to be free of arbitrary demands for unsustainable growth, and working for locally-valued outcomes.&nbsp; Those calls resonate with the forward-looking possibilities signposted here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on priorities</strong></p>
<p class="intro">Most people can answer to their own satisfaction the question &lsquo;what&rsquo;s education for?&rsquo;.&nbsp; Everybody has some experience to go on.&nbsp; But agreement in a group is less likely - people have different experiences.&nbsp; Some claims are at such levels of word-playing malleability to be useless: talk of &lsquo;inspiration&rsquo;, &lsquo;confidence&rsquo;, &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo; and &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; can obscure more than it illuminates.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not easy for stakeholders to get enough detail on the action that such claims call for.&nbsp;&nbsp; They need to get to grips with how far such underlying priorities can stretch...</p>

<p class="sub"><strong>education, interests and 'noises-off'</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/education-a-very-short-introduction-by-gary-thomas/2002267.article" rel="nofollow">Gary Thomas</a> has distilled curriculum thinking into an hour-or-so of reading.&nbsp; He maps a six-thousand-year history of education.&nbsp; I find his account riveting - it&rsquo;s of a struggle.&nbsp; In the blue corner, an insistence on the need for formal and reliable facts.&nbsp; In the red, trust in the case for an open and progressive process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, before the bruising starts, it&rsquo;s a pointless match - have you ever come across an unprocessed fact? or a fact-free process?&nbsp; So we should be able to find a consensus.&nbsp; But it's hard to find.&nbsp; Educators and their stakeholders need to understand why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author helps by taking a close look at pragmatics, constructivism and marketisation.&nbsp; I've tried here to take account of all that.&nbsp; But I can't help noticing that the author leaves out pretty-well all of what neurology, the social sciences and cultural theory bring to an understanding of curriculum.&nbsp; So where are the clues to understanding?&nbsp; Are they in what we can see included? or in what we can't see because something's left out?&nbsp; We'd have to ask who ignores what?&nbsp; And why would they do that?</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve managed to set out here, I find it hard to lose the suspicion that this is not really a debate about ideas, it&rsquo;s about whose interests are being served.&nbsp; A content-driven factual understanding of how things are suits some, and they are glad to see it included.&nbsp; A process-driven curriculum addressed to critically scrutinising how things got this way will upset some apple-carts</p>
<p>Assembling this account of what educators can do has repeatedly come across those conflicting interests.&nbsp; Any claim made, or research reported, or policy announced stands in a frawework of one set of interests or another...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>neo-lib&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; shareholder &lt; &gt;&nbsp; cosmopolitan&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; street-level&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; civil society&nbsp; &lt; &gt; stakeholder</strong></p>
<p>It also finds the interests managed in a range of settings...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>systemic&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; institutional &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; conversational</strong></p>
<p>Some of this is &lsquo;noises-off&rsquo; - hard-to-decipher murmers of what is somewhere being canvassed, or the wangling of manoeuvres, or - eventually - what turns out to have been downright misleading.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found some of what is signposted here in the news, but the news can also be a daily parade of immediate events, short-term consequences and facile solutions.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s too little time, space or attention-span to pose uncomfortable questions - just enough for evasive answers.&nbsp; Claims to transparency are so narrowly framed as to be laughable.&nbsp; Education needs larger frameworks, demanding disclosing answers.&nbsp; Am I paranoic to sense that there's some probing to do here?</p>
<p>And probing done before any compromises are made.&nbsp; A resolution can only be negotiated from what is put on the table.&nbsp; There's no compromise with absolute beliefs.&nbsp; And compromise with partial disclosure is a commitment to little that's worth having.&nbsp; Garry Thomas&rsquo;s story is in part an account of what kind of limp resolutions are left dangling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educators are not responsible for any of this, but neither can they afford to ignore it. This account of what they can do is widely-enough framed to take account of the gamut of interests and the reach of exchanges.&nbsp; So there&rsquo;s a lot here.&nbsp; But the more educators take into consideration, the more bases for action they can search.&nbsp; And this blog has argued that the action can include root-and-branch curriculum reform - with or without the support of the 'noises off'.</p>
