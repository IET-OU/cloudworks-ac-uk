<td style="border:1px solid #000000;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px">Disclaimer  before I begin: I use the word MOOC below, but more related to the  model and theory behind them, because I&rsquo;m very aware that in a corporate  environment &ldquo;Massive&rdquo; means &ldquo;All or Many people of the company&rdquo; and  &ldquo;Open&rdquo; means &ldquo;Inside company boundaries&rdquo;.<br /><br />The  most part of my career was developed inside a corporate environment  (either public or private). Sometimes on the in-house end, other times  as outsourced. One of the common barriers I encountered was the  difficulty of sharing inside knowledge and best practices. I couldn&rsquo;t  (can&rsquo;t) wrap my head around this, as a lot of money was being invested  in developing training programs that were sometimes unnecessary: the  knowledge was right there at our disposal, in the people from different  fields that worked at the company.<br /><br />Complex  communications systems would get installed, but people communicated  less (not in quantity, mas in quality terms). Knowledge would not flow  due to a multitude of factors (bureaucracies, power games, non  valorization of training, &hellip;).<br /><br />As  I began to learn about MOOC&rsquo;s, I related to the theoretical aspect  (mainly Connectivism), but I could only see it become a reality in  environments where learning was the main goal (schools, universities or  self-learning). In corporations, the main goal isn&rsquo;t learning, it&rsquo;s  achieving business results. And if for me it&rsquo;s obvious that lifelong  learning is a definite influence on that goal, for many (all?) companies  I&rsquo;ve worked with, all I ever heard was &ldquo;training can&rsquo;t be longer than X  hours, because people have to get back to work&rdquo;.<br /><br />MOOC&rsquo;s  do take up a lot of time and dedication. The Connectivist approach does  require engagement and dedication from the learner, not to mention  resilience. <br /><br />Nevertheless,  I believe that being part of a common learning course MOOC-style would  be a beneficial experience for &ldquo;corporaters&rdquo; (aka, people who work in  companies and that receive training provided by the company) and that  their learning ability would be exponentially higher than &ldquo;usual&rdquo; online  learning courses (aka, readthrough multimedia courses available to  corporaters, sometimes without tutoring).<br /></td>

<tr style="height: 0px;">
<td style="border:1px solid #000000;vertical-align:top;padding:7px 7px 7px 7px">There are several goals that I believe would be obtained:<br />- The &ldquo;simple&rdquo; sharing of experiences and knowledge throughout the company<br />-  To construct a common knowledge database (that would even allow new  hires to benefit from that learning experience, even if they haven&rsquo;t  participated directly in it)<br />- To create relations between people scattered throughout the globe.<br /><br />What would be different?<br />-  Regular courses would cease to be dominant (I&rsquo;m not a fan of extremes, I  do believe there is always a time and place for different learning  experiences, methods and theories). People would themselves ask for  immersive learning experiences where they could benefit from peer  knowledge.<br />-  Informal Learning would happen not just to those two or three people  who usually go have a coffee break together. Informal learning would be  an experience from which anyone could benefit.<br /></td>

Maybe a  &ldquo;semi-Connectivist&rdquo; approach, because of the confidential nature of the  subjects and because the resources would have to be in-house.<br /><br />There  are some technologies available: corporate LMS and Intranet, corporate  Sharepoint document repository and corporate email. <br /><br />Social  media technologies (Facebook groups, bookmarking web tools, Google Docs  or cloud repositories, etc.) would have to obtain authorization.</td>

                   <p>Is there a particular topic you would want to use to&nbsp;explore the feasibility of developing a MOOC corporate learning platform? As a corporate trainer facilitator, I'm also curious as to whether a MOOC would work in a corporate training environment. I share your concerns about the amount of time required and the limited time allocated to training currently. It's a struggle to hold a 1-day class in a corporate training environment. I'm not sure how a corporate professional would participate in a MOOC. This is one of three proposals that I'm interested in (other than me own, of course) but would need more relative to a topic to decide whether to join in or not.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Lauri ... I'm interested in looking at corporate training too and find similar reactions to Tiffany.&nbsp; I'm keen to pursue my own need for the corporate sector but am interested to share ideas and consider feedback from a simlar context.</p>
<p>(Although I work for a University, my role provides learning programs to staff which face the same issues in timeframes, availability. geographical locations and connections)</p>        </div>
