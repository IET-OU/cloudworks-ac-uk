<p><strong>EXTERNAL NEWS</strong></p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[Peter Horrocks; Steve Parkinson; University World News; BBC]</em></p>
<p>The OU is set to launch <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/ou-makes-significant-reorientation-towards-apprenticeships" rel="nofollow">three degree apprenticeship courses</a> in the coming months, with more to follow, in what Peter Horrocks said could amount to a &ldquo;significant reorientation&rdquo; of the OU&rsquo;s activities following changes in government funding that have led to a collapse in part-time study.&nbsp; The apprenticeships &ndash; in management, healthcare and computing &ndash; have been co-designed with employers, who will pay apprentices&rsquo; tuition fees in full. &nbsp;Students will combine work-based learning with online tuition and will be supported by a team of &ldquo;practice-led tutors&rdquo; who will travel around the country offering face-to-face support.</p>
<p>As the government encourages 'challenger' HEIs to compete with established state universities, the growing for-profit HE sector has a new voice.&nbsp; Study UK, which has represented independent HE and FE providers, was relaunched last month as <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160712170151216" rel="nofollow">Independent Higher Education</a> and will scale back its support for non-higher education members.&nbsp; It will stand alongside Universities UK, which speaks for almost all state universities, and GuildHE, with members drawn from the university and specialist higher education sectors.</p>
<p>The DfE has confirmed its final ministerial team as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secretary of State for Education, Minister for Women and Equalities - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/justine-greening" rel="nofollow">Justine Greening</a></li>
<li>Minister of State for School Standards - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/nick-gibb" rel="nofollow">Nick Gibb</a></li>
<li>Minister of State for Apprenticeships and Skills - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/robert-halfon" rel="nofollow">Robert Halfon</a></li>
<li>Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/jo-johnson" rel="nofollow">Jo Johnson</a></li>
<li>Minister of State for Vulnerable Children and Families - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/edward-timpson" rel="nofollow">Edward Timpson</a></li>
<li>Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Women, Equalities, and Early Years - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/caroline-dinenage" rel="nofollow">Caroline Dinenage</a></li>
<li>Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the School System - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/lord-nash" rel="nofollow">Lord Nash</a></li>
</ul>
<p>HESA has released data on 63 of the largest HE providers (of the ~700 currently operating) outside of publicly funded universities and colleges, reporting that there were 50,245 undergraduate enrolments on designated courses at <a href="https://www.hesa.ac.uk/blog/3973-appreciating-alternative-providers" rel="nofollow">alternative HE providers</a> in 2014-15.&nbsp; The Greenwich School of Management is the largest institution, accounting for 14% of the entire student population.</p>
<p>University watchdog the Higher Education Degree Datacheck has identified a total of 62 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/02/more-than-30-fake-uk-universities-closed-by-watchdog" rel="nofollow">bogus &lsquo;degree&rsquo;-awarding institutions</a> in the past year.&nbsp; So far, 32 have been closed by law enforcement and trading standards agencies (25 based overseas), and 30 investigations are still in progress.&nbsp; The agency is advising another four institutions, which are legitimate businesses, to make clear to prospective students that they cannot award UK degrees.&nbsp; Since 2011, 220 bogus UK universities have been identified and 80% of them are no longer active.</p>
<p>It is accepted that graduates tend to earn more over their lifetime than those with lesser qualifications.&nbsp; However, the Intergenerational Foundation (IF) lobby group claims that having to pay back <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36916009" rel="nofollow">student debts wipes out any graduate premium for most professions</a>.&nbsp; Someone borrowing the maximum for tuition and maintenance would, with interest, owe &pound;53,000 after three years.&nbsp; If unpaid for the full 30 years before being written off, IF calculates that debt would reach &pound;282,420.&nbsp; IF believes the current graduate premium is around &pound;100k but a government spokesman said it amounted to an around &pound;170,000 for men and &pound;250,000 for women over a working life, after student loans, tax and national insurance had been taken into account.</p>
<p>An increasing number of UK employers are worried that they will not be able recruit enough high-skilled employees, according to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36783460" rel="nofollow">CBI's education and skills survey</a> of 500 employers employing more than three million staff between them.&nbsp; The survey found 69% were concerned about not being able to find enough highly-skilled staff, compared with 55% last year. &nbsp;Demand for low-skilled workers was likely to continue to fall and employers were more likely to rate "attitude to work" as more important than formal qualifications.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; Allison Littlejohn; Paul Hollins]</em></p>
<p>MIT President L Rafael Reif has written to MIT faculty and instructors regarding <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/letter-regarding-future-opencourseware-0720" rel="nofollow">the future of OpenCourseWare</a>.&nbsp; MIT &ldquo;surprised the world&rdquo; by launching OCW in April 2001, attracting 200m worldwide visitors since then, but a new committee is now charged with proposing &ldquo;two to three paths for the future of OCW&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Prof Allison Littlejohn has had a major hand in developing two documents recently published by The Commonwealth of Learning. &nbsp;<a href="http://oasis.col.org/bitstream/handle/11599/2362/2016_Guidelines-QAA-MOOCs.pdf" rel="nofollow">Guidelines for Quality Assurance and Accreditation of MOOCs</a> is designed for use, &ldquo;by governments, accreditation agencies, institutions and learners with an interest in developing, running, accrediting or participating in MOOCs, to improve quality assurance (QA) and accreditation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The guidelines are based on an extensive review of literature and practices in both MOOCs and quality in education more generally which identified a range of issues and contradictions in quality measures developed from different perspectives, and these are presented in <a href="http://oasis.col.org/handle/11599/2352" rel="nofollow">Quality in MOOCs: Surveying the Terrain</a>.</p>
<p>The first student cohort has just started <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-07-21-smartly-debuts-a-free-mba" rel="nofollow">Smartly&rsquo;s free online MBA</a>, representing 7% of the thousands who applied earlier this year. &nbsp;The programme is &ldquo;recognized&rdquo; by the Washington DC Office of the State Superintendent of Education &ndash; which is subtly different to being accredited (by anyone).</p>
<p>The BBC reports on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36796998" rel="nofollow">GetSmarter</a>, a South African company that is currently working with universities such as MIT and Chicago to design, build and manage MOOCs and other online learning &ldquo;five to seven times cheaper than in the UK or US&rdquo;.&nbsp; According to MIT&rsquo;s Prof Sandy Pentland, the GetSmarter model includes a &lsquo;course coach&rsquo; for every 25 or 30 students, and peer-to-peer knowledge and experience sharing is encouraged &ndash; all of which leads to a much richer and deeper learning experience and retention rates of around 90%.</p>

<p><strong>Do Students Lose Depth in Digital Reading?</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Conversation]</em></p>
<p>Naomi Baron gathered data from 429 university students across five countries, finding that <a href="https://theconversation.com/do-students-lose-depth-in-digital-reading-61897" rel="nofollow">print was aesthetically more enjoyable</a> (&ldquo;I like the smell of paper&rdquo;) and afforded a sense of &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; and &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; where they were in the book.&nbsp; Almost half the participants complained about eyestrain from reading digitally and 67% indicated they were likely to multitask, compared with 41% when reading print.&nbsp; When asked on which medium they felt they concentrated best, 92% replied &ldquo;print.&rdquo; &nbsp;For long academic readings, 86% favoured print, and they also reported being more likely to reread printed academic materials.&nbsp; But what about the learning?&nbsp; She refers to several studies showing that test scores are often similar for print and on-screen, but suggests that those tests often do not measure deeper levels of understanding.&nbsp; She cites research by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/19/readers-absorb-less-kindles-paper-study-plot-ereader-digitisation" rel="nofollow">Mangen</a> that showed better reconstruction of a plot sequence using print, and from >Ackerman and Goldsmith</a> showing that, given a free choice, students spend more time studying print and achieve better comprehension.&nbsp; Baron concludes that print stands out as, &ldquo;the medium for doing serious work&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Change, Innovation and Transformation in HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Stephen Downes keynoted at this month&rsquo;s Campus Technology conference on the theme of <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/08/09/why-todays-moocs-are-not-innovative.aspx?m=2" rel="nofollow">innovation in HE</a>, noting that "Change is done to you.&nbsp; Innovation you do."&nbsp; He described innovation as idea + execution + benefit, whereas simply solving a problem does not qualify.&nbsp; Also, as co-creator of the first MOOC in 2008, he suggested that MOOCs are delivery methods &ndash; not necessarily changes in curriculum; if we want to change education, we have to change how we think about teaching and content.&nbsp; He also reminded the audience that innovation should relate to student success, and that current issues or perceptions that need innovative solutions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students pay too much for education;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment is unreliable and unfair;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources are unavailable;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content is poorly communicated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life as a student is incredibly stressful;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research studies are poorly designed; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education science rarely replicates successes</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MIT Previews 'Interactive Dynamic Video'</strong></p>
<p><em>[TheNextWeb]</em></p>
<p>Creating life-like AR/VR environments can cost thousands of developer-hours, but MIT researchers have previewed <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/08/02/mit-just-changed-the-vr-game-with-interactive-dynamic-video/" rel="nofollow">Interactive Dynamic Video</a> (IDV), which uses traditional cameras and algorithms to generate interactive vibrations of objects without the need for green-screen or controlled environments.&nbsp; These items can be pushed, pulled and stacked, just as in real life, through use of a new imaging model that costs a fraction of 3D modelling.</p>

<p><strong>Half of Online Students Would Not Opt for Live Courses</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; Education News]</em></p>
<p>An estimated 3.5m US students are enrolled in online degree programmes this year and, according to &lsquo;research&rsquo; from &ldquo;Your Online Education Partner&rdquo;, LearningHouse, half of these said they either <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/07/20/half-of-online-students-would-not-opt-for-live-courses.aspx" rel="nofollow">would not or were not sure they would attend live courses</a> even if they were available to them.&nbsp; The survey also found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cost was the key factor driving online programme selection. &nbsp;Almost 90% of students said they could be swayed to pick a particular school with the promise of a scholarship of as little as $500.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearly three out of four students picked a school that had a physical campus within 100 miles of their home, with 32% saying they planned to visit the campus at least once a year and 44% saying they planned to visit it more frequently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two-thirds of students reported they had no or minimal knowledge about alternative credentials such as MOOCs, badges and microdegrees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And distance learning students should benefit from proposals by the US Dept of Education to introduce <a href="http://www.educationnews.org/online-schools/dept-of-ed-proposes-new-distance-learning-regulations/" rel="nofollow">regulations to improve oversight and protection</a> of the more than 5.5 million studying at degree-granting institutions.</p>

<p><strong>More Professors Know About Free Textbook Options, but Adoption Remains Low</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>A new Babson Research survey of more than 3,000 full-time and part-time professors, <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/More-Professors-Know-About/237252" rel="nofollow">Opening the Textbook: Educational Resources in US Higher Education, 2015-16</a>, finds that awareness of free or openly licensed educational resources has increased slightly over the past year, but only 6.6% are "very aware" of them.&nbsp; Others said they had been deterred from adopting OERs "there are not enough resources for my subject" (49%) or it is "too hard to find what I need" (48%).&nbsp; Cost (to students) was an important factor in decision making (87%) but many professors were interested in additional features such as sample tests, and so tended to choose products from commercial publishers.</p>
<p>Interesting article from Hewlett Packard&rsquo;s T J Bliss on the use of >OERs and Open Educational Practice (OEP) in HE</a> which includes a nice example from the University of British Columbia, when a professor of Spanish decided to work with his students to improve and author Wikipedia articles related to Latin American literature. &nbsp;The project yielded three &lsquo;featured&rsquo; articles and eight &lsquo;good&rsquo; articles, as rated by the Wikipedia community.&nbsp; Bliss notes that &ldquo;When one thinks about the traditional disposable assignments students are asked to complete in most higher-education courses, the authentic contribution made by these students at UBC is tangible evidence of improved teaching and learning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Estimating Student Workload </strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/estimating-student-workload-for-your-courses/62515" rel="nofollow">Estimating student workload</a> is a perennial hot chestnut (implausible metaphor, but work with me), so it&rsquo;s interesting to see the <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2009/credit.html" rel="nofollow">US federal definition of a credit hour</a> and also Rice University&rsquo;s <a href="http://cte.rice.edu/workload" rel="nofollow">Workload Calculator</a> and its accompanying guidance.&nbsp; This gives helpful examples of reading and writing rates, and reminds users that it&rsquo;s the quality of work that counts, not just the duration.</p>

<p><strong>Exploring Students&rsquo; Negative Engagements with Digital Technology</strong></p>
<p><em>[Phil Vincent]</em></p>
<p>We tend to focus on the benefits of technologies to enhance learning but, in <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13562517.2016.1213229?journalCode=cthe20 - /doi/abs/10.1080/13562517.2016.1213229?journalCode=cthe20" rel="nofollow">Digital downsides: exploring university students&rsquo; negative engagements with digital technology</a>, Neil Selwyn surveyed over 1,600 Australian undergrads on the downsides &ndash; and four distinct themes emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Distractions (e.g. phones, tablets and social media)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disruptions (e.g. kit failing to work)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Difficulty (e.g. inconsistent application/screen designs; digital reading and not-taking)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detriment (e.g. &lsquo;death by PowerPoint&rsquo;; poor quality materials; staff now more distant)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also revealing were some of the softer/sociological issues to emerge, such as technology reconstituting &ldquo;old problems in different (and often amplified) forms&rdquo; &ndash; for example, students may tolerate a lecturer starting late because she mislaid her notes, but they are less tolerant of a similar length delay due to computer problems.&nbsp; Respondents also believed that &ldquo;making information and resources &lsquo;available&rsquo; online has increased the pressures on students to be active in finding out and making sense for themselves&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the digitally driven fragmentation and dispersal of the time, space and place of academic study has clearly altered how students are (dis)engaging with university &ndash; making the act of studying something that spills over into hitherto private spaces and periods of &lsquo;free&rsquo; time.&rdquo; (p12)</p>

<p><strong>The Internet of Things for Educators and Learners</strong></p>
<p><em>[EDUCAUSE]</em></p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) comprises sensors, wearables, embedded and other devices, all sharing data via the cloud.&nbsp; In Nov 15, Gartner estimated a 30% growth in the number of devices connected to the IoT in 2016, meaning more than six billion connected devices, with 5.5 million added every day.&nbsp; So what does this mean for education?&nbsp; I had hoped <a href="http://er.educause.edu/articles/2016/8/the-internet-of-things-for-educators-and-learners" rel="nofollow">EDUCAUSE Review</a> would tell us, but I found the &lsquo;Key Takeways&rsquo; banal (viz: it&rsquo;s important and we need to do something about it) and the subsequent article not much better.&nbsp; Still, follow the embedded links and then you&rsquo;ll learn something.</p>
