        <p>First post. Jan 10th. Jus' noodling. Trying to get some kind of picture of what's going on. Generally, I like a bit of confusion, a bit of an intellectual 'soup', but so far things are a bit too far out here. I have little concept of what we are trying to do or where we should do it, or how, or with whom. Hopefully, meaning will begin to form...</p>    </div>

			<p>I'm wondering if what I write here IS my portfolio and this is simply where I should post my objectives. Can anyone advise?</p>
<p>My learning objectives at this point are modest and general:</p>
<p>1. To stay with the course for more than 1 week.</p>
<p>2. To learn something positive from it.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Sunday 13 Jan,</p>
<p>Checking in. I am only able to commit about 4 hours per week to the MOOC, which may not be enough to build momentum or establish working relationships.</p>
<p>Thanks to Joshuau and Stephen Wheeler I was able to at least add my cloud to the OLDSMOOC Introduce Yourself cloudscape.</p>
<p>I can see how meaning and structure can quickly form in such scenarios around groups of people interested in similar stuff and willing to help each other. This is very significant as one can start out feeling very lost and confused but patterns and structures can quickly form and disperse that confusion, provided the social aspects quickly come into play - as they often do these days on social media.</p>
<p>Sent out a couple of tweets seeking ppl interested in interdisciplinarity and learning design. Let's see what happens.</p>
<p>Also just edited the 'Mindmap'. Quite fun, lots of ideas on there. Hard to tell value at this point though, as ever, even skimming around it will have lodged some ideas in the brain.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Monday Jan 14th.</p>
<p>OK, stayed with the course 1 week. Objective 1 met. Today added a cloud to the DreamBazaar and left two comments seeking collaboration on two other MOOCers clouds.</p>
<p>Can feel a little lonely ;-) doing this - like the party's always somewhere else - but several comments seem to say the same thing. For such a big group, there hasn't been massive interaction for me yet.</p>
<p>One tweep got in touch from the US to say he's interesting in interdisciplinarity. I replied, but no comeback at yet.</p>
<p>Next objective. Make some headway in forming a team.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

                    <br />

                   <p>Hi Carl,</p>
<p>You asked a question about where to put your 'cloud' and what to do with it on my 'cloud'.</p>
<p>I think this cloud "Carl Gombrich's cloud" could serve as your "learning journal" and you could add this cloud to the "Introduce yourself!" Cloudscape by clicking&nbsp;<a style="color: #6b4824; border: 1px solid #cccccc; padding: 5px 5px 5px 20px; text-decoration: initial; font-weight: bold; opacity: 0.9; background-image: url(http://cloudworks.ac.uk/_design/icon-add.gif); background-color: #fafafa; border-top-left-radius: 6px; border-top-right-radius: 6px; border-bottom-right-radius: 6px; border-bottom-left-radius: 6px; background-position: 0.5em 0.6em; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/add_cloud/6890" rel="nofollow">Add to a Cloudscape</a>&nbsp;up there on the right and choosing the "Introduce yourself!" Cloudscape.</p>
<p>I think that is what the instructions are for week 1 activity 2 and that is what several people (and I) have done.</p>
<p>You can also create your own cloudscape to use as your portfolio. As I understand it a cloudscape is a place where you can aggregate clouds.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>
<p>There are more detailed instructions here (possibly you already saw those).</p>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Thanks for your comment and I shall try to answer your queries. I should point out, though, that I find Cloudworks confusing at the best of times and not the easiest of platforms to understand.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Your assumptions, however, seem to be correct. I would agree with you that Cloudscapes are in effect our portfolios.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">How I understand it is that Cloudscapes are made up of individual Clouds. These Clouds can be whatever we decide to name them, in this instance individual learning journal entries and learning objectives.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Once we create a Cloud we have to assign it to a Cloudscape, otherwise it just floats unattached. We can assign Clouds to more than one Cloudscape.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">I hope this makes some sense as I've struggled with Cloudworks in the past and I'm just trying to muddle through with it again. This time I may use another system and just post a link in Cloudworks.&nbsp;</div>
