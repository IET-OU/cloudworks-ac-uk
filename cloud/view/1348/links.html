        <b>Layered learning design – Tom Boyle</b><br />
<ul>
	<li>Why layers of design?</li>
	<li>Designs operate at many levels of granularity from small to very large</li>
	<li>We need to make pedagogical design of this design space</li>
	<li>LDSE aims to produce a set of tools and to support the full range of activity across this design space</li>
	<li>Explore productive relationships – with learning object aggregation models</li>
	<li>Delineating the layers – work from 50 years ago design futures of language – why is language so powerful?</li>
	<li>Concerns – conceptual accuracy and adequacy and usability</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
JISC D4L framework <br />
1.    Course design, <br />
2.    Session planning, <br />
3.    Activity design, <br />
4.    Learning object development
</p>
<p>
<b>Articulating the layers: <br />
</b>Module and sessions: simple session (class), module of 12 lectures, but also compound session (lecture plus labs)<br />
Session and learning activity – base-level learning activity, LAMS tools for orchestration of sequences of activities<br />
Where does dialogue based learning fit into this? At the compound level? 
</p>
<p>
Basis of any dialogue is exchange – question, answer, feedback as a base interaction
</p>
<p>
Can also have compound sessions
</p>
<p>
ALCOM abstract reference model for aggregating learning objects – Verbert et al. <br />
Series of levels: .1. Learning object designs (GLOs) 2. session plans 3. module design
</p>
<p>
A learning object is an instantiation of a learning design<br />
<b></b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Helen Beetham – designing for learning: educational sense in digital contexts<br />
</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>JISC Design for learning programme</li>
	<li>Extrinsic design – educational meaning</li>
	<li>In a teaching context are working within a designed context – the space has been designed, the books have been designed, the tools the students use – many of these artefacts were not explicitly designed for an educational context</li>
	<li>Move to intrinsic design – through the digital environment , can take more control of the design you are using than we could in the past</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Why design for learning?<br />
</b>Design 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is intentional purposeful approach to learning (of others)</li>
	<li>Represents intention so that it can be communicated and acted on in new contexts</li>
	<li>Supports structure or scaffolds actions</li>
	<li>Relies on general principles or rules of thumb but leaves room for contingent responses</li>
	<li>Is a skilful reflective evidence-based practice</li>
</ul>
<p>
Pedagogic intention can be articulated and enacted with the support of technology<br />
These articulations can be shared with other people and systems involved in the learning process<br />
•    The people are adopting new roles<br />
•    The systems are likely to be digital<br />
•    The learning process takes place in a TEL context
</p>
<p>
Communicating educational meaning through design<br />
Designer with a design intention who designed something – a mediating object which is delivered to a learner<br />
•    OpenContent, OpenCourseware, OpenLearn<br />
•    RLOs, GLOs, widgets<br />
•    IMS Learning Design, TENCompetence, ReCourse
</p>
<p>
But in reality this design is usually mediated by some other person, different kinds of representation might be needed for this level<br />
•    Communities of practice, Community tools, rules/protocols<br />
•    Ontologies, folksonomies, taxonomies<br />
•    Patterns and patter languages
</p>
<p>
Existing design practice is very varies<br />
Tools are rarely experienced by practitioners as pedagogically neutral
</p>
<p>
Design tools must enable collaborative design<br />
Tensions – diff levels of design, design for learning/design for teaching, representation, structure/flexibility of designs, aggregation/orchestration approaches and tools, the role of face to face interaction<br />
Orchestrating technologies – VLEs etc course or module as base unit, focus on purposes of the designer/institution. Top-down management<br />
But there has been a shift in recent years towards aggregating technologies<br />
Aggregating technologies – feeds, aggregators, drawing on web services, RLOs, widgets and applets, small scale learning outcomes, object or activity as base unit, focus on needs of user, modularity, reusability and interoperability, self-organising systems<br />
•    Old educational users – user requirements, text book ets tv, curriculum,<br />
•    Users 2.0 – agile development – tell us what you want today, searchers, wikis, youtube etc learners are doing the designing<br />
<br />
<b>Liz Masterman and Marion Manton<br />
</b>Pedagogy theory and pedagogic planning in digital worlds<br />
•    What is the value of theory to teachers?<br />
•    Pedagogical planners<br />
•    What do we mean by theory?<br />
•    How has theory has been embedded into three areas?<br />
(Lawes, 2004) Theory gives a framework of understanding that ultimately improves the quality of practice and leads to the transformation of subjective experience
</p>
<p>
Theory can provide a glue between technology and practice<br />
Teachers need help with using technology; the Trojan mouse effect (Sharpe and Oliver 2007). Planner tools can help with this providing advice and guidance about going about the design process<br />
How might we use theory in these planners?<br />
•    Theories – Cook, 2002 a means of understanding and predicting explanatory power<br />
•    Models – such as Kolb’s leaning cycle <br />
•    Frameworks – such as Laurillard’s Conversational 
</p>
<p>
Framework: a structure and vocabulary that support concepts<br />
What theories? Whole load of them –range of names, don’t correspond to each other<br />
What power do we endow their theories – strongly directly or just for device<br />
Comparison of three pedagogical planner tools – DialogPlus, phoebe, LPP<br />
•    DialogPlus – followed Mayes and De Freita classification of learning theories – associative, cognitive and situative. Learning outcomes related to Blooms and linked to tool type Laurillard. Provided context sensitive guidance for creation of learning activities<br />
•    Phoebe – context-sensitive guidance’s planning tool alongside a guidance tool provides just general guidance<br />
•    LPP Distilled theories and principles based on conversational framework
</p>
<p>
Practitioner’s responses to using these tools <br />
•    Many see theory as a cornerstone of professional practice<br />
•    But do teachers consciously espouse formal theories or are they more driven by prior experience and reflective practice?<br />
•    Distinction between theories of learning and e-learning is contentious<br />
•    Volume of explicitly material on theory on Pheobe could be daunting particularly for novice teachers<br />
New work in the TLRP TEL LDSE project<br />
•    Aim is to assemble a web-based environment for teachers – will be researching and trialling a number of tools<br />
•    Theories – Bloom’s taxonomy, Briggs CA, Laurillard CF and Kolb’s learning cycle<br />
•    Show uses how different models result in different kinds of learning experience<br />
•    Challenges – how do we deal with intuitive theories based on reflective practice, local institutional models, what kind of pedagogy model underpins the tool – need to shift from ‘present, practise, produce’ towards. ‘activate, engage, contribute’<br />
