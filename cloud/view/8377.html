        <h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I am a secondary school technology teacher/integrationist. I provide training and workshops to help teachers integrate technology into their subject curriculum.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>Our students in elementary school, Grade 2-5, create and maintain their own e-portfolio as an evidence for their Personal Development Plan (PDP), and we would like them to continue with it when the move on into secondary. Additionally, teachers should be given the option to create their own e-Portfolio for their Continued Professional Development (CPD). Such an initiative would help teachers in guiding students in creating and maintaining their PDP.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>I wanted to inform teachers of the benefits of e-Portfolios for CPD and PDP. Moreover, I wanted to find out teachers&rsquo; attitudes towards the introduction of e-Portfolio in Secondary school by answering the following questions:</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Elementary students in grades 2-5 have own e-portfolios. Should students in Secondary School continue with their e-portfolio?</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What impact does an e-portfolio have on student learning?</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a professional educator, should you build your own e-portfolio? Why?</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How could e-portfolios impact teachers?</p>
<p>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we use e-portfolios? Why?</p>
<p>The replies to these questions were a mix of positive and negative answers. The teachers also posted their own questions with regards to e-Portfolio implementation.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>I presented a PowerPoint presentation by first defining what e-Portfolio is and how it is structured using diagrams and images outlining the processes in creating and presenting an e-Portfolio as a PDP and CPD. Additionally, I outlined that an e-portfolio engenders pride and the sense of personal ownership over one&rsquo;s accomplishment. Furthermore, an e-portfolio is a reflection of the student undergoing continuous personal development, not just a store of evidence. Moreover, I outlined the e-portfolio drivers, such as, Life-long Learning, Students-centred learning, Authentic Assessment, Staff Development, Employability, and Whole person Development.</p>
<p>Teachers were presented with Videos, animations, and examples of web based e-portfolios implementations for teachers and high school students.</p>
<p>All these forms of presentations had desired effects on the teachers in the workshop, as many of them started showing interest by posting questions requesting further explanations.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The feedback I got in the form of answers to the questions did show some acknowledgement of the benefits e-Portfolios but also some reservations with regards to workload and whether as one teacher put it &ldquo;this is another thing on our plate and nothing coming off&rdquo; and where another teacher states &ldquo;I am not sure if the juice is worth the squeeze&rdquo;. However others found usefulness in the use of e-portfolios as evidence of CPD and the benefits it might have on the prospects of future employment. Due to the mostly positive results we will pilot e-portfolio with grade 6 next year by allowing them to continue with their e-portfolio which they have started in grade 2.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Overall, I think the presentation was successful in accomplishing the aims to introduce e-portfolio to high school. All teachers were new to the idea of e-portfolio and had some hesitation with regards to extra workload. However, this will be overcome as time will be allocated to allow students to continue with their portfolios. Conversely, I am not sure how successful we will be in implementing e-portfolio in secondary school, as the curriculum is intensive and there is very little wiggle room for additional activities. Moreover, teachers are tasked with first and foremost to cover the whole syllabus.</p>

                   <p>Hi, Ed!</p>
<p>I have been trying for some years to get the school I work for to adopt an e-portfolio system for students (and hopefully, for teachers), so I was drawn to your cloud.</p>
<p>I thought your design narrative was very clear, and the use of media helped me visualize both what learners (in this case, the teachers) had access to and the stages involved in the task you proposed. Your design seems to have been successful in the sense that most teachers did come around and bought the idea of building their own e-portfolios, as well as helping students with theirs.</p>
<p>The only thing I missed was a stage in which teachers were trained on how to build their portfolios at the end. At the school I work for, whenever something new is introduced, best practices say we should train teachers for about 6 months before the actual implementation, even though this is not always possible. Did you have something similar? I think more teachers would jump in. :)</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Cintia,<br /> Thank you for the encouraging words :)</p>
<p>Most of the teachers at my school are international and they have found it beneficial to have an e-portfolio to represent their accomplishments. However, the implementation of it does take time and I being the integrationist at school have to allocate workshops to help teachers learn how to develop their e-portfolio. I will provide them with e-portfolio template, which they can populate on their own. The school has Google site domain and creating personal websites for students and teachers is very easy. This week, I introduced Grade 6 on how to create their own website e-portfolio and it took no more that 30 minutes to present it. The rest is up to the teachers which most of them use technology daily. Therefore, there is no need for it to take 6 months before actual implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck with introducing it to your school. It might be best to introduce it on a small scale to few teachers and a class or two and see how it goes. Also look at some of the documents which I found to be very useful provided by City University of Hong kong:&nbsp;http://www.cityu.edu.hk/edo/eportfolio/</p>        </div>
