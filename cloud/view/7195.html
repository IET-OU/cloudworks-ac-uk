        <p>A cloud relating to the OLDSMOOC Digital Literacies projects and dicsussions.</p>
<p>The Dreambazaar projects</p>
<p>I feel that several ideas have been proposed around the ideas of Digital Literacies.</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 12px;">Anne Bradbury: Unit 0 :&nbsp;<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7142" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7142</a></h4>
<p>An initial course to prepare students for studying online, technologies, collaborative working, attitudes, privacy etc. This is specifically aimed at Post Grads taking the OU's MA Online and Distance Education modules. This cloud also contains a great set of questions we should be asking.</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 12px;">Anthea Wilson: My dream: Learning design project proposal - level 1 inexperienced learners&rdquo; :<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7103" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7103</a></h4>
<p>Also in the context of the OU in this case Health and social care. It concerns the use of technology in providing clearly defined, concise and accessible online learning material that improves the learning experience.</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 12px;">ARTiFactor: My Dream: a Digital Literacy MOOC :&nbsp;<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6942" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6942</a></h4>
<p>Big dreams for a Digital Literacy MOOC so, potential to break this down into several sub-projects covering different elements of Dig. LIt.. as well an overall design. I think it lends itself to a non-linear approach with open start dates. This progression from newbie to coach/mentor could make great use of Open Badges. Peer reviewed and linking to evidence within the MOOC environment.</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 12px;">Catherine El-Bez: My dream: a MOOC on 'Digital Literacy and Personal Learning Environment' :<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7075" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7075</a></h4>
<p>Helping university students to evaluate, develop and reflect on their information Literacy and ICT skills through a cMOOC format. I am interested by the consideration of reflection as CPD In practice was one of my MA modules, and I feel would be of real benefit to the skill set of any learner.</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 12px;">Helen Crump: Design Project:: Digital Me -Understanding Digital Literacies :<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7057" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7057</a></h4>
<p>Digital Literacies in and social learning in an HE or CPD context. The&nbsp;<a style="color: #00822b;" href="http://pedagogyfirst.org/wppf12/" rel="nofollow">Pedagogy First&nbsp;</a>MOOC which is refered to looks like a useful reference for other projects looking at Dig. Lit.</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 12px;">Katharine Reedy - My dream: digitally literate distance learning and teaching :<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7098" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7098</a></h4>
<p>Embedding Dig. Lit. into degree programmes with a very useful link to the OU's framework for Digital and Information Literacy&nbsp;<a style="color: #00822b;" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/pages/DILFramework" rel="nofollow">http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/pages/DILFramework</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Jane Challinor&nbsp;Digital Identity and Social Media :&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7190" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7190</a></h4>
<p>"..online identity and how to use social media for effective collaboration and learning".</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 12px;">Shirley Williams:Will this help me learn? :&nbsp;<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7062" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7062</a></h4>
<p>Evaluating Resources - Fits in nicely with Belshaw's 'Critical' element of Digital Literacies. [Then] "offer learning resources ourselves..." I think several of the other elements could come into play here and there could be an opportunity to have the students to develop them?</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 12px;">Joe Nicholls CPD for digital and information literacies :&nbsp;<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7138" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/713</a>8</h4>
<p>"organisational structures and processes dedicated to the creation and delivery of flexible and agile CPD tailored for Professional Services staff roles". "More often than not, what people experience is something that is pre-packaged and removed from context in which they work."</p>
<p>Aimed at staff in Information services, I am sure that some of the skill set will see a cross over with other projects. I also wonder if the Digital Literacies MOOC idea might lend itself to this specific subject area. Expanding the participants and knowledge base across a number of institutions?&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 12px;">Jos&eacute; Luis Casta&ntilde;o: My dream: Learning design project proposal :<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7059" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7059</a></h4>
<p>Primary education, looking at developing collaborative working between students in a school were technology (netbooks) are provided on a 1:1 basis. I think Doug Belshaw's 8 elements of digital literacies could provide a good framework from which to devise a variety of learning activities.<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://neverendingthesis.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://neverendingthesis.com/index.php?title=Main_Page</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Primary classes (as above) so a definite link there, and in this case specifically collaborative writing. Wikis are mentioned, Google documents would be another area to explore as would be the whole G. Apps for Education package. There could also be an opportunity to link with those involved with ESL/EFL teaching.</p>

<p>A university continuing education course for those in the energy industry. Peer to Peer learning and assessment. This refers to Salmon's 5 stage model&nbsp;<a style="color: #003366;" href="http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimod.com/e-moderating/5stage.shtml</a>which could be useful as part of the learning design for other projects.</p>

                   <p>Brilliant Clem</p>
<p>I too had noticed a plethora of proposals all around some aspect of digital literacy. I started pasting the links into my own Evernote account as this was the only way I could think of rounding them up in one place and being able to find them again.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Still more Dreambazaar Clouds forming</p>
<h4>Doug: Open and online teaching and learning support for faculty, tutors, &amp; students : <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7238" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7238</a></h4>
<p>"the idea is very simple, but very large - create an open, online (or 'virtual') center for teaching and learning support, with all the resources openly licensed, and not connected to a particular university.!"</p>
<p>Doug appears to be looking at the technical side of building and hosting such a platform (although, not as part of this MOOC?). The projects grand aims are not limited to Digital Literacies but, what I like is the open and OER aspect.</p>
<p>Doug also refers to low attendance at training and development sessions. This matches my understanding of current training; people want to be able to dip in to a system which meets their precise learning needs at that moment. As such, people often go to where they feel this need can be met i.e. not the L&amp;D/training departments and the workshops/courses they provide; but instead, their friends and colleagues (either internal or external to the organisation).</p>
<p>Looking at potential 'grand' designs like the Doug's platform and Arts complete Dig. LIt. MOOC, makes me consider if it might not be easier to workout who would want to part of a Dig. Lit. Study group and then break off into teams? I also have a feeling that there are some (a bit like myself) who would be interested in following a couple of projects and jumping to help as they can, whereas others want to focus on a singular design. I'm thinking of along the lines of Belbin team roles (McHarg et al, 2012)</p>
<p>Completer-ﬁnisher (CF) <br />Co-ordinator (CO)<br />Implementer (IMP) <br />Monitor-evaluator (ME) <br />Plant (PL) <br />Resource-investigator (RI) <br />Shaper (SH) <br />Teamworker (TW)</p>
<p>MIght also be worth having a naming convention? e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital Literacies Study Circle Cloudscape<br />(Which we can all add clouds and information to)</li>
<li>Digital Literacies Study Circle Cloud<br />(Where one person summarises the people, projects so that it can be added to the OLDSMOOC study circle Cloudscape)</li>
<li>DL "Team Project Name" Cloudscape<br />(In which the team places all their relevant clouds)</li>
<li>DL "Team Project Name" Cloud<br />(A summary cloud that is placed in the Study Circle Cloudscape)</li>
</ul>
<p>Would this (or similar) help us make sure we have the right clouds in the right cloudscapes? Just sharing some thoughts and open to ideas.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Oops in what way? :)</p>
<p>In my post above there was a 'Digital Literacies Study Circle Cloud' to go in the Study circle cloudscape. Only the name is different?</p>
<p>You can edit the names of Clouds and Cloudscapes if you are the owner of a cloud or, (I'm presuming) have admin rights to a cloudscape.</p>
<p>Using your cloud in this fashion means only that you are responsible for keeping it up to date :) From what I wrote above, the content of this (my) cloud might actually be better as the 'Digital Literacies Study Circle Cloudscape'. What do you think? Still only week 1 and all of it does take longer with asynchronous chat. :)</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Art,</p>
<p>I think it is important to realise that people will bring different strengths and contributions to a team. For example, I do not think everyone needs to present their 'dream'. That's one role. Have you read Doug's post/blog (above)? He talks of a MOOLE Massive Open Online Learning Experience. Might be something that fits in with your idea. Not so much courses with start and end dates but a learning resource one can drop into, learn, progress and subsequently help others?</p>

<p>Yes, my vision is for something like Doug's MOOLE, something dynamic, totally open source, and hopefully, mostly free.</p>
