        <p><strong>The '<em>Make thinking visible</em>' principle.</strong></p>
<p>This use of technology creates a significantly different kind of learning experience from the more usual informational resources (texts, audio, video), discussion environments (forums, social media) and user-generated content sites (photos, videos, slideshare, wikis, blogs). The most important feature of a simulation or model is that it gives informational feedback to the student. They manipulate parameters and see the result of their action - that's how we learn about the world, and it's a great way of learning. So if we can provide models of the world for learners to explore ('microworlds', as Papert called them) then it's a way for students to learn for themselves, guided by what happens as a result of their actions.</p>
<p>However, the description of the principle only refers to 'exploring the effects' of actions. From my experience of observing students using this type of program, it can be too easy for them to <em>merely</em> explore - 'oh so that's what happens' - without focusing on why it happens. If instead of just enabling them to explore and see what happens, you set a goal, e.g. 'find the combination of parameters that maximises X' - then they have to focus on interpreting the result in terms of how to improve the result. That makes a significant difference to the challenge of the task. And that should provide a deeper learning experience.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is the Pedagogical Patterns Collector an example of 'making thinking visible'? As a tool for teachers it is designed to make their thinking about pedagogi visible. To what extent do you think it achieves that?</p>
<p>Please submit your response by Mon 4 Feb - thank you!</p>    </div>

                   <p>I don't think we will see what happens till we experience the use of the patterns with actual learners. I can't grasp much of the effect with what I've done so far. but I thought I should make a start if Monday is a deadline.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Might be a little too hopeful that this is 'making thinking visible'?&nbsp; It is certainly making&nbsp;goal directed output visible but&nbsp;a human&nbsp;learner and an artificial intelligence learner&nbsp;in your example and telling them both to 'interpret the result in terms of how to improve the result' &nbsp;will produce the 'right', and possibly the same, results/outputs - but I cannot see any reason to suggest that their 'thinking' has been made visible.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have every reason to suppose that their 'thinking' (by this term I am interpreting to mean &nbsp;information processing?) processes were quite different.&nbsp; The reason for this is that human beings of course don't just 'process information' in light of parameters and goals set as AI units might - they do it on the basis of associative historical connections, motivational and affective biases, and salience of information in that context.&nbsp; Which is possibly the engine of the **creativity** for the&nbsp;human learner&nbsp;that might result from such learning&nbsp;(which in the&nbsp;example above is called 'deeper' perhaps?)&nbsp;application to novel even unusual contexts, desire to apply in practice to test, &nbsp;and account for, model non-conformant results in particular ways, and so on, which an AI unit won't produce...and that, for me,&nbsp;exemplifies the 'hard problem' of conceptualising how learning works.</p>
<p>very thought provoking principle and exposition&nbsp;- thank you.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Will that's a fair point, but the PPC is a tool for teachers, and the question is about whether it makes teachers' thinking visible. I should have made that clear in the question, so now I've rewritten it - thank you!</p>
<p>But in any case, it should be possible to look over a pedagogical design and judge whether it intends to 'make the student's thinking visible', and how likely it is to succeed in that. Not all patterns will do that, and may not need to, but you can judge in advance the extent to which it might?</p>
<p>Of course we cannot evaluate whether our designs are effective until we try them out with actual learners, I agree.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Diana, thanks for your comments. I am getting used to the scope that this is mostly about the design stage.</p>
<p>I have added a cloud on Design Science that may be a bit off beam. Because I missed most of last week I am behind in pairing but do discuss things on a Thursday as background for local radio. We may catch up later. (JD is not yet registered for Cloudworks but i can report on his take.)</p>        </div>

<p><em>Is the Pedagogical Patterns Collector an example of 'making thinking visible'? As a tool for teachers it is designed to make their thinking about pedagogi visible. To what extent do you think it achieves that?</em></p>
<p>Is the Pedagogical Patterns Collector an example of &ldquo;making thinking visible&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found that this tool enables one to see the changes they are making in their designs and to rethink those changes if necessary. Using this tool the teacher is able to link the learning outcomes to the learning activities and even decide on the nature of assessement. This is indeed an example of &ldquo;visible thinking&rdquo;.</p>
