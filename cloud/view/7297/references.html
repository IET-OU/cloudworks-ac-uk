        <p>I&rsquo;m an adult literacy tutor and I live on the West Coast of Ireland. I'm also a very recent graduate of St. Angela's College, Sligo where I completed an M.A. awarded by NUI Galway in Technology, Learning, Innovation and Change.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in digital literaciesand social learning, which ideally I'd like to teach online in a Higher Education or professional development context. For that reason I'm developing my skills and knowledge in relation to online pedagogy and instructional design; that's why I&rsquo;m glad to be here taking part in OLDS MOOC "Learning Design for a 21st Century Curriculum"</p>    </div>

    
<h2 id="extra-content">Extra content</h2>
    		<div class="extra-content">
			<a name="content-1811"></a>
			<p><strong>Week 1 - Initiate</strong></p>
<p>Here, I forgot to articulate my learning goals. I just figured they would be the same as those that the course designers envisaged. However, as the week wore on and things didn't easier with all the group/team formation, my goal became simply to hang on.</p>
<p>I hung on!!</p>
<p>I decided to pair up with Jane Challinor and work on her design project - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cloIM2LhBN6bTIEXnwUST28_sPROEYjMePBwIjtQ6O4/edit" rel="nofollow"><strong>"Let's Get Digital!</strong>"</a>. It seemed like the closest match to my ambitions but her project had a real context in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Week 2 - Inquire </strong><br />This week focuses on context. What is learner context? How does learner context affect ways learners interpret and enact learning designs? How can we use context in learning design? How can we personalise designs to individual learners' needs and contexts?</p>
<p><strong>Design outcomes:<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explore and represent context in relation to your design challenge.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicate and receive feedback on your analysis of context for your design challenge.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gain insights into your design challenge by applying one or more contextual learning design approaches.</p>
<p><strong><br />Learning outcomes:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Review &amp; revise your understanding of learner context and its relevance to learning design.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase your awareness of approaches to context for learning design.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluate the relevance of contextual approaches to your own learning design practice.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plan further learning about contextual approaches</p>
<p><strong>My objectives:</strong> the first&nbsp;objective&nbsp;of the week is to establish effective collaborative tools for working with my co-collaborator on this project.</p>
<p>Then, as directed, develop an initial scenario for learners on the undergrad Health and Social Studies course. Here, it might be good to develop 2 scenarios, 1 for a traditional undergrad student and 1 for a mature&nbsp;undergrad&nbsp;student. It might also help to focus on the attributes or influences that will impact each scenario particularly in relation to the Professional Skills module - (broadly digital native/immigrant, professional identity/experience, academic identity/experience).</p>
<p>Complete the series of activities/ reading in order to understand the importance of context in learning design context and, on a basic level, be able to evaluate the&nbsp;different context design tools&nbsp;(scenarios, personas, ecology of resources etc.) and apply the most appropriate to the design project.</p>
<p><strong>Activity 1: Scenarios and personas</strong></p>
<p>1) Brainstorm components of your scenarios<br />Actors: PJ, 36 year old male, father of 3 young girls aged between 3 &amp; 8, in the process of changing career, formerly worked in a technical role in the construction industry, has been out of education for 12 years, his previous education had a strong vocational &amp; technical emphasis.<br />He works part-time at the weekends in a residential care home. He got the job in the care home because his wife is a nurse and she was able to recommend him for the job. <br /><br />Goals: (why?) PJ is motivated to gain a professional qualification in Health &amp; Social Care as there is a strong economic imperative to do so. He is a caring person and likes helping others.<br /><br />Settings: (where &amp; when?)&nbsp; he attends classes on campus on a full-time basis where he has access to IT facilities. He also has access to the college's VLE. He studies on campus when he can but this is dependent on timetabling and childcare duties at home. At home he has access to a laptop and can generally spend 2-3 hrs per night, Mon- Fri studying<br /><br />Objects: (what things are involved?) He has access to a laptop, Google email account and a mobile phone. He has a Facebook account, which he uses to keep in touch with family and friends<br /><br />Actions:&nbsp; (what do actors do?) The Professional Skills module is a mandatory part of his Health &amp; Social Care course<br /><br />Events: (what happens to actors?) PJ has patchy research skills and tends to use Google and/or Google scholar for his coursework assignments. He finds it difficult to organise relevant information/links and is not confidant with regards to the conventions relating to referencing or plagiarism. <br />Although PJ has a Facebook account, he is skeptical about social media in general. He cannot see the point of applications like Twitter and has never heard of LinkedIn.<br /><br />Results: (what is achieved?) PJ's work is of an average standard but he is capable of producing better researched and more polished pieces of work<br /><br />Your design: (what role does your design play?)&nbsp; Our design helps him: find better ways to research and present his coursework, develop a PLE, build a professional profile and a PLN<br /><br />2) Develop a narrative scenario/s<br />PJ has a supportive group of fellow students on the course. There are 8&nbsp; mature students in his Professional Skills module. They get on well and tend to form a group of their own, but they also get along and work well with the younger traditional students. PJ has exchanged mobile numbers with a few of his classmates, mainly the mature students and communicates about projects via college email. He knows that some of the students keep in touch via Facebook but he doesn't have the time for that and it doesn't seem quite right for him to use it.<br />&nbsp;<br />PJ finds the Professional Skills module outline to be a bit bewildering with all its references to social media and digital identity/online professional profile.<br /><br />3) Scrutinize your scenario &amp; revise as necessary<br />I am claiming that PJ will be interested to develop his professional /academic skills but will be slightly daunted by the addition of the online and social media aspect of the module.</p>

<p>This week proved valuable in understanding more about situated meaning within context and the promise that EoR model offers for developing digital literacies in HE. The scenario and personas activity proved useful as did Jane Challinor's Force map.</p>
<p>Although, I didn't complete an EoR template this week, I'm keen to have a go at one doing one. What's more, I think I have access to lecturers&nbsp; and students in an undergrad&nbsp; social care context. Fingers crosssed. Let's see how it goes.</p>
<p>A comment Jane made about who takes responsibility /ownership for delivering the digital skills/ academic skills in question has really intrigued me.&nbsp; I'm interested to explore different delivery models for this.</p>
<p>in regards to collaborative tools, the project has kind of become a dual track process. My "design partner" and I haven't found what you might call collaborative tools. We just do parts of the project and compare notes/ outlooks. It seems to be working.</p>
<p><strong>Week 3 - Ideate - Objectives</strong></p>
<p>This week's objectives are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conceptualise the learning design process from different perspectives</li>
<li>Apply some learning design resources, tools and methods to your design</li>
<li>Critique a range of pedagogical approaches and the role that different technologies play</li>
<li>Review, share and discuss the theoretical underpinnings, benefits and limitations of design representations across educational contexts</li>
<li>Develop an innovative storyboard, learning activities and a structure for implementation</li>
<li>Gain the 3 Weeks and Resource Gatherer badges</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that I'll achieve all of the objectives, but I'm especially interested to conceptualise the design process from different perspectives. I wonder if this includes different models of delivery too.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Activity 1:</strong> asks us to post our initial ideas about how we (usually) set about conceiving of and describing learning designs and asks, "which part/s of the design do you usually think about first when you begin a new learning design? Do you start with &ndash; the learners...?" Yes, yes, yes. Most definitely, <strong>I start with the learners</strong>. It's literacy skills and practices that I'm interested in developing and designing learning for. Literacy is not a topic or a subject; it's a practice. Literacy is a person. That's my take on it.</p>
<p>The activity also asks "what difficulties do you encounter when trying to describe your design ideas to colleagues or to yourself?" This is an excellent question, because I find that I struggle massively to articulate what I mean by literacy/literacies, and by extension digital literacy/ies. The term is so broad and so vague that it means different things to different people and besides, it's largely discussed in terms of a deficit. Everyone has literacy, and literacy practices but no one thinks or talks about theirs. I think that when I do start to talk about literacy practices and that these practices really mean something to people. I get the impression others think I've grown another head. It's just that literacy is embedded in everyday stuff and for the most part traditional literacy and what it means has become invisible. The discussion about digital literacy is unsettling all of that though.</p>
<p>I liked <a href="http://edtech-insights.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/context-is-all-ensuring-learning-design.html" rel="nofollow">George Hobson's reflection from last week on context </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>There is a lot that we take for granted in schools. Context is one of them. Obviously, when starting out in teaching in a new situation, the context in which the teaching and learning is going to take place is investigated. Soon, an understanding of what works in that context takes over and, apart from ideas such as differentiation or learning preferences, the task is about lesson planning. </em><em>At times a particular contextual topic may be raised. For example, are we doing enough for our second language learners? How can we use through-school language approaches to support these learners language development AND learning in other subjects? But it is rare to go back to basics and consider the complete contextual situation afresh.</em></p>
<p>I've got to get better, much better, at articulating what I mean when I talk about literacy. Hey, what do you know? Jotting it down helps.</p>
<p><strong>Activity 2: Ideate tools</strong></p>
<p><strong>Course features cards</strong>: here are the 12 course cards that I chose:</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Activity 4: Assembling your toolkit - part 1<br /></strong></div>
<div>On Grainne's slide representing pedagogical approaches the word <strong>vicarious</strong> jumped out at me. I've been thinking about something like this as being appropriate to supporting online learning, and the development of a student's online identity. Just going to have to figure out what it means exactly and what it involves practically.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I think it ties in to my "wildcard" specialist literacy support/coaching/mentoring notion above.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Activity 5: Assembling your toolkit</strong> - <strong>part 2</strong></div>
<div>Decide what tools/activities you want to use for imagining or describing your learning design.&nbsp;To help make your selections think:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Are you looking for tools and activities that <strong>challenge and disrupt</strong> the way you currently think about your course? <strong>YES</strong></li>
</ul>
I chose to explore the course features cards. I spent all afternoon and I had nothing more to show for my labour than I had back at activity 2. Made a simple mind map so I could represent the course visually and so I add notes from 7Cs model about the various approaches. No idea how to add it to a cloud. Can't embed it as it's not a web based doc. Should have spent the time researching more about some of the approaches and writing it up. Pants!!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Approachesthat appeal from the 7Cs course principles:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Principles:</div>
<div>Practice,professional, community based</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Pedagogical approaches:</div>
<div>Inquiry, situative, vicarious, dialogic, authentic, constructivist, collaborative</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Guidance &amp; support:</div>
<div>Mentoring, peer support, scaffolded, literacy [digital &amp; academic] /library support, study skills</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Content &amp; activities:</div>
<div>Modeling, information handling, learner generated content, assimilative (??)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Reflection &amp; demonstration:</div>
<div>ePortfolio, reflective blog, vicarious, peer feedback, formative</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Communication &amp; collaboration</div>
<div>I don't really understand most of these headings. Chat sounds alright to me (structured or unstructured...none of these headings sound like they fit with the type of communication &amp; collaboration that happens on Twitter, for example).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Activity 7: post what you have produced</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Activity 8: feedback on colleagues'</strong> <strong>design </strong></div>
<div>yes</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Week 4: Connect</strong></div>
<div>This week we assume that the 'teacher-designer'. The idea is to start not with the <em>content</em> as the object of reusable design knowledge, but the <em>teaching pattern</em> (or pedagogical pattern, or learning pattern, or lesson plan, or teaching plan). We leran to use the Pedagogical Pattern Collector.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Learning outcome:</strong> To develop insights into the principles of pedagogic design</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Activity 2: Pair tutoring on a design principle</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Chosen principle: Encourage Reflection</strong></div>
<div><strong>http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7926</strong></div>
<div>
<p>When learners reflect they make their thinking visible to themselves, monitor their progress, and reach new insights. The pattern of conducting an exploration and then reflecting improves inquiry projects. Integrating reflection with action comes up repeatedly in inquiry projects. In many cases prompts that intend to elicit reflection instead motivate learners to move on to the next step or to conclude that they were successful. Combining an experiment, investigation, or research endeavor with reflection can improve both activities but requires testing in the context of use to ensure that learners engage in productive reflection.&nbsp;Generating reflections on the topic helps students develop a more robust understanding of the material (Davis, 1998; Linn &amp; Hsi, 2000) and,&nbsp;hopefully, promotes autonomous lifelong learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the Research and Professional Skills module, we propose that students develop a reflective blog to record and support their learning. However, the description of the principle only states that reflection "makes their thinking visible to themselves" yet&nbsp;typically&nbsp;a blog is&nbsp;published on the open web. Thus, publishing a personal reflective blog not only makes&nbsp;learning visible to the wider world, but also invites comments from that wider readership as well.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What are the dangers, or pitfalls, of asking students to post their learning reflections to a blog?&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;Activity 4.1 4.2</strong></div>
<div>I wanted to use the PPC&nbsp; to make a learning outcome of my own from the beginning but I could not find any buttons on screen after I pasted in the learnoing outcome, so I adapted the "Relating Theory to Practice" design.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is the link to my Pedagogical Pattern. <a href="http://web.lkldev.ioe.ac.uk/PPC/live/ODC.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>http://web.lkldev.ioe.ac.uk/PPC/live/ODC.html</strong></a></div>
<div>You will then have to navigate to the "Browser" &gt; "User Generated Content" &gt; <strong>"</strong>Demonstrate the ability to use a variety of online contacts and social networks to find out information [Digital Literacy Level 2: Understand and Engage in Digital].</div>
<div>I now realise that the title is too long/explicit to be useful within the PPC User Generated window because all you can see is "demonstrate the ability".</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm reasonably happy with the design pattern, for a first attempt, although the time allocated for the activity,&nbsp;1440 minutes, reflects that the activity is to be conducted over&nbsp; one or two semesters. I don't think that this aspect is obvious in the PPC.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Week 5 -Prototype</strong></p>
<p><strong>Learning outcome:</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong>You should be able to design, construct and test a simple prototype for a learning design</p>
<p>This week we go from design idea - the sketch - to the first stage of implementation - the prototype. By treating teaching as a form of 'design science' we acknowledge the iterative nature of the process - the need to build on what others have done and learned, to experiment and test, and then use this to improve the design (Laurillard, 2012).<br /><br />The week's activities include prototyping activities for digital learning of the type that could be done by any teacher, no programming experience necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Activity 4:</strong>&nbsp;Plan and review a prototyping tool</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; paperbased prototyping tool to plan interactive&nbsp;syllabus&nbsp;design&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Activity 4.1</strong>&nbsp;Plan how you would design a prototype for a learning design in your own context,&nbsp;using what tools; decide on your hypothesis (usually, that learners will achieve the intended learning outcome);&nbsp;plan the testing and data collection technique you would use to test the hypothesis/learning outcome&nbsp;and any open evaluation questions about your design.</p>
<p><strong>My response: </strong> "In the online classroom, students will seize upon your syllabus as if it were a map. Students will want to know how to proceed and where everything is&nbsp;located. So, one of the first things you must do, whether through the syllabus or in an introductory message, is to explain the &ldquo;geography&rdquo; of the course (Ko and Rossen, 2012 ,p.20). Therefore, I need to design that "geography" with the hypothesis&nbsp;in mind&nbsp;that students will be able to navigate the online course site&nbsp;and syllabus with ease and&nbsp;efficiency as a result of my design.</p>
<p>To best design for the "navigational" aspects of the course syllabus, namely the&nbsp;hyperlinks,&nbsp;taxonomies,&nbsp;drop down boxes etc, and to ascertain how students would like to interact with such functionality, I think that a paper based prototype tool will best serve my purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, having undergone the exercise and designed the prototype, I'd seek to collect feedback on the design experience by asking a group of students to undertake a "trial run". After which, I'd invite them,&nbsp;in pairs,&nbsp;to discuss their experience. I'd record the discussion and analyse their feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Activity 5:</strong>&nbsp;Plan and carry out an observation &gt;&gt; observation of a student search</p>
<p><strong>Activity 5.1</strong>&nbsp;Adapt the typical observation examples in slides 11-12 (see Activity 1 above) to suit your context and set up a short observation task with a colleague or friend. This should be on something related to your prototype but not necessarily produced by you. E.g.&nbsp;if you want to understand what people think about and do during search, you could ask them to find a resource in the OLDSMOOC Bibsonomy. If you want to explore adding information then use Cloudworks (or whichever tools you wish to consider).&nbsp;<em>Having set a task, you must try hard not to help them, and if you do, make a note of what you had to say or do to help them. Record what they said, how long it took them to do things, and their own reflections on the process, and then you will have an observation report that would be useful for evaluating this interface.</em>&nbsp;If you have a way to video record (e.g. smartphone or webcam) then you can also see how useful that is for further analysis.</p>
<p><strong>My Response: </strong>It's not possible to conduct an observation that's related to my prototype at the moment, so I have decided to conduct a general observation in order to learn what students think about whilst conducting an online search. I think that this will be very beneficial seeing as a large part of the&nbsp;module&nbsp;being designed relates to search and information skills. With a "sketchy" brief, &nbsp;I'm going to observe a&nbsp;student&nbsp;trying to locate a specific resource on the web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>The brief:</strong>&nbsp;on the Guardian website there's a section for professionals, one such section is for Social Work and Social Care. There's an article on that website about Social workers and implications for their professional use of social media. Can you find that article?</p>
<p><strong>The observation: </strong>by undertaking this simple observation I was able to observe the difficulties, lack of strategy and the extent of the student's perseverance in undertaking this task. The exercise was eye-opening because it exposed not only the complexity of a search task but also the fragility of an important underpinning skill like internet searching.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Week 6 Curate [OER]</strong></p>
<p>This week introduces the principle of the open licensing of online content and the relevance of Open Educational Resources (OER) to curriculum and learning design. We will investigate methods of finding and identifying OER, how they differ from the mass of online content as well as the many ways they can be incorporated into learning designs.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Learning outcomes:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; Understand what open licensing and OER are.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify open licensed materials and the some places to find them.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Analyse the role that OER can play in your designs, and the implications of using OER as an on going practice.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicate the pros and cons of incorporating and/ or producing OER.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Produce or remix OER in the context of your own design project.</p>
<p>3. <strong>TASK</strong> &ldquo;<strong>Seek and Deploy</strong>&rdquo;:&nbsp; See if you can find any OER for your design.</p>
<p><strong>My response:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whawicjQdSDh1ohWF4-CDnSrrpkjfFtnpc6632vGBvg/edit" rel="nofollow"><strong>Syllabus: Social Media Literacies (College/University Level) by Howard Rheingold</strong></a></p>
<p>Although the introduction to this topic gave us plenty of places to source OERs, I think that one very simple method was overlooked. Namely, often a great way to find OER resources is through your PLN. This is how I found the Howard Rgeingold Social Media Literacies resource. Having been signposted to the reource through a member of my PLN, I already had it bookmarked because I thought it might be useful at a later stage. It's definitely worth tagging and book marking OERs that you think might be useful to you in the future as and when they crop up. That way you can make your own archive of&nbsp;searchable&nbsp;OER resources and you're not&nbsp;starting&nbsp;from scratch because you&nbsp;already&nbsp;have a bank of resources suitably vetted by your peers.</p>
<p>In relation to the resource itself, the following permission is given by the author: "please feel free to use, modify, and share this syllabus. Reorder the modules, add or subtract required or recommended texts and learning activities. Use your own assessment methods".</p>
<p>In the context of my design project, I particularly intend to use this OER to deliver the following learning objective: understand the need for critical consumption of information. Afterall, it aligns so well with the objectives of the module we're developing, that is to say, Research and Professional Practice.</p>
<p><strong>6. TASK "Prepare to launch" </strong>You may want to adapt an OER you have found or openly license some content of your own.</p>
<p><strong>My response:</strong> Let's take it one step at a time. Yes, I'd be happy to licence some of my future content as OER, but in the meantime, I ensure that my blog posts have a creative commons share a like licence.</p>
<p><strong>Week 7: Evaluation</strong></p>
<p><em>Whatever happened to week 7? Quite simply, I needed a breather.</em></p>
<p><strong>Week 8: Reflect</strong></p>
<div>This week we will step back and reflect on the concepts discussed so far by asking you to prepare and share a design narrative. We also consider something of the wider perspective, including the direction that learning design is now taking and what you might want to do going forward. There are also some optional activities for those who want to probe the background of learning design.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Learning outcomes</strong><br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use design narratives to reflect back on the journey you have completed, your goals and achievements, and what you've learnt along the way.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compare the use of representations, tools and methodologies within the OLDS-MOOC activities<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss the key challenges of learning design and how the field is might develop</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Activity 2:</strong> Construct a design narrative of your own experience on the course.</p>
<p>S.T.A.R.R outline:</p>
<div><strong>Situation:</strong><br />Where are you coming from? What is the context in which you are working and participating in OLDS MOOC?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I was a complete "rookie" at the start. No prior experience or knowledge what so ever of learning design. See my OLDSMOOC intro:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>I&rsquo;m an adult literacy tutor and I live on the West Coast of Ireland (originally from Nottingham). I'm also a very recent graduate of St. Angela's College, Sligo where I completed an M.A. awarded by NUI Galway in Technology, Learning, Innovation and Change.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in digital literaciesand social learning, which ideally I'd like to teach online in a Higher Education or professional development context. For that reason I'm developing my skills and knowledge in relation to online pedagogy and instructional design; that's why I&rsquo;m glad to be here taking part in OLDS MOOC "Learning Design for a 21st Century Curriculum"</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Task: </strong>What did you hope to achieve? What were your goals in joining OLDS MOOC?</p>
<p>My goals were nothing grand, simply to find out what learning design was and to see how it might help me to design and deliver learning online. I signed up in the hope that OLDSMOOC would complement another open course that I was undertaking, <a href="http://pedagogyfirst.org/wppf12/" rel="nofollow">Pedagogy FIrst</a>, focusing on online pedagogy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div><strong>Actions</strong><br />What did you do? What were the main events, interactions, practices and activities in which you participated? What were the obstacles - and how did you tackle them?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Having posted a brief, even vague, outline of my learning project entitled <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7057" rel="nofollow">Digital Me - Understanding Digital Literacies</a>, as per my Pedagogy First initiative, I then started to look around for people to collaborate with, either to develop my idea or to work on something closely related.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There was a lot of activity and alot of confusion (chaos) in the first week as participants went through the process of negotiation. In particular, there was alot of activity around design projects pertaining in some way shape or form to digital literacies. Having noted that I was originally from Nottingham, <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/user/view/5433" rel="nofollow">Jane Challinor</a> struck up a conversation with me&nbsp; relating that she was a lecturer in Nottingham Trent Uni and that her envisaged design project was similar to mine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Shortly after, Jane initiated a cloud called <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7190" rel="nofollow">Digital Identity and Social Media</a> which generated alot of discussion about different aspects of digital literacy. At this point&nbsp; negotiation for design groups was getting quite frenzied, but what I did was to&nbsp; park myself in this cloud and wait and see what transpired. At the end of the day, I was happy to work on my own, if it came down to it. By the end of week 1, it was agreed that Jane and I would form a partnership and work on her project, <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7109" rel="nofollow">Let's Get Digital</a> , a design project to incorporate digital literacies into an undergrad study skills module.I liked this idea because Jane's project was real, which would add real context and purpose to me.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Results</strong><br />What were the outcomes of your participation? Did you meet your goals? What went well, what didn't? What unexpected outcomes did you notice?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I could not have wished for a better project or a better "design partner". Through out, the project both was focused and fun. Each week we managed to achieve the OLDSMOOC goals and, what's more, to have something of real practical value to take away from it too. At first it was difficult to set up channels of communication because things were so hectic, but somehow, and this was truly amazing, with very little discussion we just seemed to do the tasks in tandem, working intutitively to compliment each other. After surviving on snatched tweets and huried DMs, we eventually caught up with each other on Skype over the weekeds. It worked really well. Also, as luck would have it, I was going to be in Nottingham one of the weekends so we were able to meet up over lunch. All very agreable, I must say.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I also enjoyed the Twitter stream for the course. It really helped to breathe some life into the course; I found Cloudworks to be very sterile, indeed stiffling almost.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In terms of the narrative and unexpected outcomes or incidents, the project was very fortunate in Week 3, when the resource <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7833" rel="nofollow">Digital Literacy Facilitation Cards </a>were rolled out and Jane was able to incorporate them into the project's learning outcomes.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Reflections</strong><br />What did you learn? What advice could you give others?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I learned lots, and not just about learning design. Primarily, I&nbsp; think I Iearned about&nbsp; context and ecologies and the design tools that enable you to factor for this. And certainly, I learned the joys of collaborating with like minded, passionate people. If I had any advice to give as a result of this experience, I would say be clear about your purpose for participating and seek out people with similar aims, be prepared to be flexible and adaptable after that because essentially you'll be heading in the right direction :)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Week 9: Plenary</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;This final week will provide opportunities to review your learning and plan any next steps in developing your curriculum and learning design practice.</p>
<p><strong>Learning outcomes</strong><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reflect back on the journey you have completed, your goals and achievements, and what you've learnt along the way.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compare your experiences to those of other participants.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify questions for further exploration and plan your path ahead.</p>
<p>Phew, where do I start? Well, instead of reviewing my learning, because I think I've sufficiently blogged my learning reflections as the course has gone on, I'm going to use this plenary session to look back and review the &ldquo;social&rdquo; design of the course and take a closer look at Sheila MacNeill&rsquo;s prototype, which addresses the problem of visualizing networks and content within Cloudworks. It's a blatant attempt to collect the "reviewer" badge.</p>
<p>So here is my review: <a href="http://learningcreep.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/a-review-or-two-giving-the-heads-up-for-social-learning-designs-oldsmooc/" rel="nofollow">http://learningcreep.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/a-review-or-two-giving-the-heads-up-for-social-learning-designs-oldsmooc/</a></p>
<p><strong>Going forward: </strong>I feel that I've gained a lot of valuable skills and knowledge in relation to learning design, which will be of enormous benefit as I continue to develop my online offer in the area of digital literacies and social learning. As you may know, I took this course to compliment another open course that I've been taking, <a href="http://pedagogyfirst.org/wppf12/" rel="nofollow">Pedagogy First</a>, but now what I need is to get is a better understanding of the technology that can be used to deliver this learning experience or build the learning community that I have in mind. Lucky for me an <a href="http://octel.alt.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">Open Course in Technology Enhanced Learning</a> offered by the Association for Learning Technologists starts in April, so I'm off to do that before I start to put all the pieces of the jigsaw together. Pretty excited really.</p>
<p>Finally, if anyone reads this learning journal/blog, I'd like to say thay your interest is appreciated and don't be shy to look me up to see how I'm getting on. I'd love to hear from you :)</p>
