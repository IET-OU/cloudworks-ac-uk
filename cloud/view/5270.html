        <p align="center">IRF Discussion Forum</p>
<p align="center">Theme 2:</p>
<p align="center">Exploiting digital courseware</p>
<p>Unisa is a founding member of the African Council on Distance Education (ACDE). It sits in a technical coordinating committee (TCC) which is tasked with developing a framework for collaboration that will cover collaboration related to materials, research, staff capacity development and cross-border education provision. One of the first activities for the TCC was to complete audits of course materials and staff capacity needs. Unisa has not yet completed these audits and in discussion at a recent ACDE TCC meeting held in Potchefstroom, it became clear there was some ambivalence about both the sharing of materials and the increasing emphasis on digital resources and the potential of e-/on-line learning. The first of these issues will be addressed in the second IRF discussion forum and the second in the third.</p>
<p>Three sub-themes are envisaged for the current discussion forum:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sharing materials</strong>. What are the advantages and disadvantages of HEIs sharing materials? What have been IRF members&rsquo; experiences in this regard? Under what conditions might an HEI choose to share materials? How can sharing materials enhance the core business of teaching and learning?</li>
<li><strong>OER</strong>. What is OER? What are the main premises of the OER movement? How should an institution like Unisa engage with OER and how does it currently engage? How can involvement in the OER movement enhance the core business of teaching and learning?</li>
<li><strong>Digital libraries</strong>. With journals, textbooks, learning guides and other resources increasingly available in digital format is there still a need to provide for physical library resources? What is a reasonable balance between provision of digital resources (on CD or flashdrive or downloadable from one or more websites) and expectation that students will source their resources at first year, graduate and post-graduate levels?</li>
</ol>
<p>It is suggested that Catherine Ngugi and/or Neil Butcher of OER Africa be invited to participate in this forum.</p>
<p>There are three parts to this briefing document providing a starting point for the discussion of each sub-theme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 provides some suggestions about sharing materials from a the recent ACDE TCC meeting </li>
<li>Part 2 provides a definition of OER and some initial ideas about a rationale for engagement and some current limitations/ reservations at Unisa</li>
<li>Part 3 provides some preliminary ideas on the notion of digital libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing materials</h1>
<p>The sharing of materials (draft or final; policies, tools, learning resources etc. whole or in part) should help to reduce unnecessary duplication, expand the base of materials available to all participating institutions and could result in higher quality due to the increased internal and external review mechanisms which usually support joint publication and sharing.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the sharing of learning and teaching resources could happen at three different levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutions might choose to share information about their learning and teaching resources but not the resources themselves, except subject to a bi- or multi-lateral agreement.</li>
<li>Institutions might choose to share both information about their learning and teaching resources as well as the resources themselves with like-minded institutions, specifying the conditions under which those other institutions might or might not use and/or adapt the resources. This would require some form of password protected access. </li>
<li>Institutions might choose to share both information about their learning and teaching resources as well as the resources themselves as open education resources (OER) &ndash; the latter obviates the need to manage the kind of agreements required above.</li>
</ul>
<h1>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploiting the potential of OER</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of Open Educational Resources (OER) was originally coined during a UNESCO Forum on Open Courseware for Higher Education in Developing Countries held in 2002. During a follow-up, online discussion, also hosted by UNESCO, the initial concept was further developed as follows:</p>
<p>Open Educational Resources are defined as &lsquo;technology-enabled, open provision of educational resources for consultation, use and adaptation by a community of users for non-commercial purposes.&rsquo; They are typically made freely available over the Web or the Internet. Their principle use is by teachers and educational institutions to support course development, but they can also be used directly by students. Open Educational Resources include learning objects such as lecture material, references and readings, simulations, experiments and demonstrations, as well as syllabuses, curricula, and teachers&rsquo; guides.<a href="#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>Although the concept of OER unsurprisingly means different things to different people, it rests on the following key assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increased availability of relevant, need-targeted learning materials can contribute to more productive learners and faculty members. </li>
<li>Because OER removes restrictions around copying resources, it holds potential for reducing the cost of accessing educational materials. </li>
<li>The principle of allowing adaptation of materials contributes to enabling learners to be active participants in educational processes, whereby they learn by doing and creating, not just by passively reading and absorbing.</li>
<li>The potential of OER is best achieved through a collaborative partnership of people working in communities of practice, both within and across institutions (although sometimes also within them). Collaborative OER processes built on networks of peer members can lead to increased availability of relevant, need-targeted learning materials, achieving a better understanding of learners&rsquo; needs and motivating meaningful contributions from participating institutions.</li>
<li>OER has the potential to build capacity in African education by providing educators with access, at low or no cost, to the tools and content that they need to boost their ability to produce high quality educational materials and complete the necessary instructional design to integrate such materials into high quality programmes of learning.</li>
<li>Without collaborative partnerships within Africa, and between African education institutions and those from other parts of the world, and the ensuing active ownership by African educators of resulting OER products (whether developed from scratch or adapted from existing resources), OER is likely to have limited, if any, meaningful impact on African education systems. Simply importing content into Africa from other parts of the world will do nothing to solve capacity and resource constraints in African education systems.</li>
<li>To be successful and sustainable, development of OER cannot be a sideline activity within an institution or education system. Development of learning resources needs to be integrated into institutional or systemic processes in order to both leverage its potential and provide for its sustainability. Likewise, policies, particularly around intellectual property rights, remuneration, and promotion, need to be adapted to support and sustain licensing of educational materials as OER. </li>
<li>The potential of OER includes facilitating collaborations between educators and students at different institutions, as well as establishing a new economic model for procuring and publishing learning materials. Ultimately, a key to its success will be to demonstrate that, in the medium- to long-term, OER will help over-stretched educators to manage their work more effectively, rather than adding new work requirements to their job descriptions. (Saide 2009)</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>Unisa hasn't entered the OER arena yet in that it has not allowed any of its study material to be open source although there is an excellent open source repository in the Library.</p>
<p>Moreover, the institution is currently considering a code of practice for social networking that expressly talks about intellectual copyright and warns staff that if they converse on Facebook or Twitter they do so in their private capacity only and must be prepared to sign a disclaimer.</p>
<p>In addition, several proactive staff members are running discussion groups on Facebook for their students which Unisa fears will allow for non-paid up members of the public to have access to Unisa materials. This worries the Senate Tuition and Learner Support Committee.</p>
<p>So the question for the group is:</p>
<p>What role does intellectual copyright play in OERs and what policies and guidelines do other universities have about their study materials going opensource officially through engagement with global OER repositories and unofficially via social networking?</p>
<h1>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reflecting on libraries</h1>
<p>Unisa has one of the largest and most used libraries in the southern hemisphere. Students and staff can access library holdings on line and have books/ journals/ articles couriered to them. However, there are time and cost issues to be considered, especially in a short semester system and for students outside of SA&rsquo;s borders. For institutions in many countries it has proved impossible for library stocks to be kept up to date. In addition, programme developers need to take cognisance of what can reasonably be expected of students at different levels of study. It is suggested:</p>
<ul>
<li>At first year UG level, when students are struggling to manage the transition from secondary to tertiary education, course materials should be self-contained. Everything the student needs &ndash; including textbooks and selected journal articles, with integrated pre-, during- and post-reading activities, should be supplied as part of the study package on a CD/DVD/flashdrive.</li>
<li>At second/third year level, key resources could continue to be supplied in this way but students might reasonably be expected to access supplementary resources from designated repositories (but be aware of time and bandwidth costs for students)</li>
<li>At postgraduate level the pendulum should probably swing more towards the student locating, evaluating and synthesising his/her own resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>At whatever level, it is an anachronism to require students to access physical resources in a physical library and is not a sustainable option.</p>

                   <p>Hi All</p>
<p>An interesting practice that I have encountered at more than one institution is that of academics writing textbooks that then become prescribed textbooks for courses, by themselves or others (e.g. academics at two different institutions agree to prescribe each others' &nbsp;textbooks). In such cases there is obviously a financial reason NOT to share!</p>

                   <p>Well I waited a week before making my ill-informed comments. &nbsp;I do hope those of you with more experience in these areas will be able to contradict me!</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Materials</strong></p>
<p>I think there are huge theoretical advantages in HEI sharing materials. &nbsp;Unfortunately I don't know of any cases where this has happened to &nbsp;a significant extent. &nbsp;Yes , some institutions offer materials on Open Source ( OU UK/ MIT) but do they use others' materials? I don't think so</p>
<p>But please contradict. &nbsp;Does UNISA for example use any materials from elsewhere? &nbsp;I don't think the block is cultural- it's academics a) worried that they might not be needed as content generators in future and b) don't believe anyone else apart from them can teach well</p>
<p><strong>OERS</strong></p>
<p>Not an expert but would someone please give examples of how OERs have been used in HE institutions. &nbsp;We all know of OERs being made available , but are they used.</p>
<p>Unisa could make its materials available to the whole of Africa-- as a move 'Towards and African University' but it would have to train others in how to use them.</p>
<p>I don't believe the content of HE materials in now worth much-- so make it all available.</p>
<p><strong>Libraries</strong></p>
<p>Unisa library should make journals and books available electronically to all its students.</p>
<p>Get advice from Nicky Whitsed of OU UK if not already received.</p>
<p><strong>Tony May's "interesting Practice"</strong></p>
<p>Academics should not be able to recommend their own text books-- but course teams could.</p>
<p>If academics write books in University time then the University and not the academic should have the copyright. &nbsp;Discuss!</p>
<p>What Tony describes above is, to my mind, a corrupt practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you all agree with me?</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>This is a topic close to my heart.</p>
<p>A dimension I think that needs inclusion is the extent to which digitization of content will force changes in business models. Distance education institutions that assume that their core business is selling materials, and therefore seek to protect this intellectual capital through all rights reserved copyright, will - in my opinion - increasingly find that people are copying this IP with or without their permission anyway. And the more this happens and the more content becomes openly accessible online, the more people will find what that such institutions offer as 'education' is not worth paying for.</p>
<p>so, the&nbsp; challenge for institutions is not to protect their IP; it is to change their business models in order to remain relevant in a context where digitized content is increasingly openly accessible. The best way to build these business models is to embrace openness, not to fight it.</p>
<p>I think this has a few implications:</p>
<p>1. The shifts outlined above imply that increasingly the value of distance education will lie not in the materials, but in the quality of learner support, efficient administration, and supportive, meaningful assessment. All DE institutions should be focusing on improving these services in cost-effective, sustainable ways.</p>
<p>2. The logic of embracing openness sohuld not primarily seen as being about sharing 'our' IP, but rather integrating 'our' IP with the growing network of information on the Internet, as a strategy to improve the quality of teaching and learning materials. Thus, use of OER should be driven first and foremost by a desire to improve the experience of oru students, not to make an altruistic contribution to the global knowledge pool.</p>
<p>I hope these few thoughts are useful.</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>This is a topic dear to my heart as well, and the post I wrote just disappeared as my undependable computer crashed after I completed it and tried to copy the text to Pam's email.</p>
<p>So let me first comment on Neil's remarks while I try to remeber some of my points.&nbsp; The OER movement and its philosophy has an important impact on distance education institutions because of theri different business model and the investment and quality of their materials.&nbsp; That investment means that the materials are sometines referred to as the crown jewels, too valuable to be given away.&nbsp; Yet the quality of them makes the materials of high value to a learner, for example, who is trying to study independently.&nbsp; The OER&nbsp;produced by the Open Learning Initiatve at Carnegie Mellon might come closest - intended for a complete learning experience and very expensive to produce. If they are to participate in the OER movement, distance education institutions will have to find an approach that complements rather than breaks the current business model.</p>
<p>One point I wished to make is that it is a challenge to communicate clearly to policy makers and potential creators and users exactly what OER is and what it does.&nbsp; There are of course a number of definitions and the OER community seems comfortable with them, but outside the community it may not be so obvious. It could be productive to focus on what it does - the various purpose of various initiatives -&nbsp;what different uses have been made, such as Rice University Connexions, which&nbsp;can be seen as&nbsp;a publishing initiative.&nbsp; In a discussion of OER in an institution, the specific purpose needs to be considered and the institutional context as well as the existing policies and preactices that may hind and/or be perturbed.</p>
<p>A second point relates to the importance of the library - and librarians.&nbsp; Tony's remarks about the stepped approach from full course packets for the initial year to independent search and synthesis at advanced levels makes sense, particularly considering the issue of Internet access - its feasibility and cost for the student.&nbsp;&nbsp;With more independent searching for appropriate resources, the librarian and library services have a key role to play in teaching the skills essential to dealing with the wealth of information on the Internet, including OERs.</p>
<p>Finally, with respect to Pam's comment about the approach to use of oER at Athabasca University, this is not strictly correct. AU does not control how professors design their course, but they are encouraged to explore the possiilities of OER.&nbsp; The learning designers work collaboratively with them to identify the resources that are most appropriate for the intended learning outcomes - and help them understand the implications of the online world for teaching and learning.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Susan</p>

<p>Jennifer O'Rourke had some difficulty with access to the Cloudscape but here are her very interesting comments</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<div style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Hi Roger, greetings from our wet west coast.&nbsp; I read your comments with interest, and I hope you don't mind sharing the following commentary with colleagues on Cloudworks and email. I haven't been able to get back into Cloudworks, after one brief stint online, and then my computer crashed two days ago and had to be replaced. Although almost all my files were saved, thankfully, I wasn't able to re-register into Cloudworks today.</div>
<div style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Here, for what it's worth, are my thoughts on sharing learning resources.</div>
<div style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Warm regards</div>

<div style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">IRF Discussion Forum 2: Exploiting digital courseware<br /><br />I've been musing over the discussion paper for some time, considering how to respond most effectively, from several perspectives; course author, proponent of accessible distance learning,&nbsp; wary observer of increasing globalisation of learning, and technoskeptic concerned about investment in technology rather than human support.<br /><br /><strong>Sharing materials<br /></strong>Some time ago as a distance learning specialist in dual-mode universities, I actively supported and negotiated arrangements for sharing distance learning resources with other institutions. These arrangements enabled institutions to acquire one or more courses that were needed to offer a complete degree program to their distance learners.<br /><br />Acquiring courses tended to involve a series of steps; faculty agreement to the concept of using an acquired course;&nbsp; a review of the course materials by the appropriate faculty member according to criteria we had developed; development of a leasing arrangement; and (at the receiving institution) preparation of supplementary materials to customize the course for their own distance students.<br /><br />In these situations, there was very little sharing of information about how the course materials were used, i.e., the kinds of interactions that the course materials prompted between learners and instructor, or among learners. This is a crucial piece of the learning process. A formal agreement between provider and user institutions could incorporate provisions for sharing teaching/learning approaches. However, it is difficult to see how to build in this type of shared professional expertise with OERs.<br /><br /><strong>Exploiting the potential of OERs<br /></strong>The term "exploiting" is disconcerting, because it implies a one-way transaction, rather than a reciprocal process.<br /><br />While I agree with assumptions 4 to 8 about the potential and requisite conditions of OERs, I have doubts about assumptions 1 to 3- greater productivity, lower costs, enabling active participation in learning. Here's why:<br /><br />1. Availability and dissociation from context<br />What is the evidence that components of learning materials, such as readings, case studies, short lessons, etc, can be relevant and effective without being embedded in the rest of the learning resources and learning context for which they were designed? Are learning materials an organic whole, without which a severed part is not viable, or just a collection of replaceable parts?<br /><br />2.&nbsp; In the drive for cost-effectiveness, who or what is exploited?<br /><br />Typically, educators invest considerable time and effort in preparing learning materials, usually for clearly identified learners with known needs, and developers are compensated for their work.<br /><br />Will educators be as willing to prepare resources that can be used by learners in many different contexts, and with many different learning needs, for the same compensation? If not, cost-savings may be elusive.<br /><br />Will instructors feel as committed to learning resources developed by an unknown person for a different context? Or is this situation comparable to colonial times when children in African countries read texts designed for English children?<br /><br />Cost effectiveness needs to consider effectiveness as well as cost.<br /><br />3. Adaptation<br />Adaptation of materials is potentially a good learning experience for the course developer(s) and for those adapting materials, providing everyone has carefully considered and agreed to guiding principles and practicalities of adaptation, and is committed to retaining the learning core of the materials in the process.</div>
<div style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"><br />However, adaptation is tricky, because well-designed learning materials are carefully articulated so that each element is interconnected. Changing one part can have unexpected repercussions on an apparently unrelated component elsewhere.... a bit like dropping a pebble in a pond and creating waves that affect every dimension.<br /><br /><strong>Digital Libraries<br /><br /></strong>While print has drawbacks, it has the huge advantage of being readable without electricity. Despite the widespread use of mobile phone and related technologies, it is difficult to imagine how they could be used to read entire articles or books. As well, there is considerable evidence that people tend to read more superficially from a screen than from the printed page.<br /><br />These factors should be considered when contemplating a large-scale transfer from print to digital resources.</div>

                    <br />

                   <p>Greetings to old friends and new colleagues belonging to this reference group!&nbsp; I am Fred Litto, retired professor of communications of the university of s&atilde;o paulo (where i taught for 36 years) and now about to enter my fifth term of president of the brazilian association of distance education, a learned society made up of the professionals and institutions involved in ODL in Brazil.&nbsp; The pressures of trying to complete several projects has prevented me from participating earlier in this ongoing discussion, but i hope i can make up for this from here on in.&nbsp;&nbsp; So here goes my response to Tony May&acute;s thoughtful document on OERs and UNISA.</p>
<p>1. On digital libraries:&nbsp; most definitely yes, it will be necessary to continue to provide for physical library resources, due principally to the fact that far from "everything" is, or will be, available on line.&nbsp; in my own research, dealing with public policy and DE, and OERs, i can never be satisfied merely with that which i&acute;m able to find on the web, because experience has taught me that a great deal of current publishing of interest to scholarly study simply never gets to the web, or winds up locked behind proprietary sites (such as conference papers, government reports, think-tank papers, "grey'&nbsp; literature, among others.&nbsp; And since we still do not know how the Google Book project will turn out from a legal point of view (will ALL of the contents of the 32 million titles be available without charge on the web?&nbsp; this seems unlikely at the present time), we&acute;d better be prepared to have retrospective collections available in coming years.&nbsp; many of us study contemporary subjects, but must have frequent recourse to pre-digital age materials--physical, hardcopy books and journals.&nbsp; hence, sorry, but the bricks-and-mortar and metal shelving guys are going to be with us for a long time.</p>
<p>2. On the "reasonable balance"&nbsp; between physical and virtual libraries for universities, i think we have to recall Harvard university&acute;s experience in the implanting of specialized undergraduate libraries in the 1960s: after studying the needs of its undergraduates, grad students and researchers, they concluded that it was possible to identify the books and journals most needed for the undergraduates (using pareto&acute;s law of 80% and 20%), and build a separate library for them, thus relieving the grad students and professors from competing for a lot of the advanced study material.&nbsp; so successful was this action, that other HEI requested from Harvard copies of their undergraduate shelflist, so as to replicate it.&nbsp;&nbsp; i think we must now do the same, at least for the lower division (first two years) courses, identifying content (hardcopy or digital) resources and working them up into "packages"&nbsp; for the newcomers into higher learning.&nbsp; this will require looking at the question of "to what extent are the readings for chemistry 101 and economics 101 <em>necessarily </em>different on all our campuses, and can we make them uniform, for reasons of cost and other considerations?"&nbsp; and this brings us to the next point.</p>
<p>3. it has been a good number of years since stephen downes wrote about student expenses for books and OERs.&nbsp; Sloan Foundation reported that the typical undergrad in the U.S. apends about US$ 900.00 per year buying required textbooks....and that if there were a consortium of 1,000 institutions collaborating on producing OERS, the annual cost for materials for each student would come to US$ 3.00.&nbsp; If our colleague Roger Mills found "a corrupt practice" the fact that academics required their students to purchase their textbooks for courses, or that some wrote textbooks on university time and still wanted the royalities on the books, then all i can say is that the academic community&acute;s disinterest in downes&acute;s modest proposal is even more shocking. &nbsp; If i were the minister of education of a country, especially a developing country, and even more especially one which is "saddled"&nbsp; with a minority language (like portuguese, or turkish), my highest priority would be to find the funds to get (and remunerate) the best authors in my country&acute;s universities to prepare a "standard version" of textbooks for all of the basic disciplines in an undergraduate education, and make this available on the web without any charge to university students and the public at large, thus permitting self-directed, independent learning.&nbsp; of course, there would have to be updating of the material at least once every three years, whether it be textual/graphic material or knowledge in the form of videos.</p>
<p>4. I&acute;m beginning to become ever more skeptical about the true value of intellectual property rights, especially when talking about learning materials.&nbsp; when we consider the increasingly rapid advances in knowledge in the sciences and humanities, the shelf-life of knowledge is very short indeed.&nbsp; the concepts of OERs and Creative Commons licenses came about at just the right time. &nbsp; "i&acute;ll defend unto death"&nbsp; the right of a university professor to make full use of his eligibility to maintain the intellectual property rights over his or her work.&nbsp; but for those researcher/teachers who are lucky enough to have regular academic "jobs,"&nbsp; i believe that they should, insofar as possible, contribute the products of their work (especially when supported, directly or indirectly, by public funds) to the sum of human knowledge in the form of OERs.</p>
<p>5. Tony May&acute;s document makes only one very brief mention of "incentives" for professors to produce OERs.&nbsp; i believe that it&acute;s an issue that deserves a very high priority in the battle for greater rationality in the academy.&nbsp; i recall from studying years ago in the U.S., that research (done by the MLA?) showed that only 10% of those who obtained the Ph.D. degree (a research degree, mind you!), subsequently produced any kind of research. &nbsp; this is to say that we must rethink our system of "rewards"&nbsp; for intellectual efforts:&nbsp; judge a researcher for the quality and quantity (the dominant standard in his/her field) of research produced and published; judge someone who excels in teaching by <em>that </em>standard; judge someone who does excellent work in extension activities by <em>that </em>standard; and, finally, judge he or she who contributes significantly to the store of human knowledge, especially in the form of OERs, for those actions. &nbsp; rewards through promotions, grants, recognition are powerful motivators for those who entered the field of scholarship knowing its limitations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>6. i believe that third year students should be required to have contact with scholarly journals in their respective fields, either online or in hardcopy.&nbsp; it will improve their writing, perhaps incentivate a desire to do graduate studies, and, at the least, teach them how to think better.</p>
<p>7. When our friends at UNISA start feeling troubled over their problems, i recommend that they recognize the advantages they have by way of (1) inheriting the consolidated "architecture" of higher education of the united kingdom; (2) carrying out most of their educational activities in the english language (which dominates the web with about 80% of its content, as well as being the standard in scholarly publication).&nbsp; those positive points are not to be everywhere around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; UNISA has a great head start in becoming a great institution;&nbsp; after reading Tony May&acute;s document, i&acute;m convinced that UNISA needs only a little bit of "calibration"&nbsp; to get to where it would like to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; an enviable position, indeed!</p>

                   <p>Dear Colleagues</p>
<p>Thank you for the contributions to date. Sorry to hear about the computer problems some are having: having typed this submission previously, I lost my internet contact and lost what I had typed ... so here we go again.</p>
<p>I agree with the need to recognise and celebrate different kinds of academic contributions. However, I think if I accept a position as a university lecturer a core part of my job is to teach. I think it is often possible to find synergies between the teaching, research and community engagement functions but still a big chunk of my time is teaching. That means I have a curriculum to service and need to identify &nbsp;learning resources. It is logical then to start with what already exists and then make decisions about whether I can adopt or adapt or whether I need to create new content. In programme developments that I have been involved with, it has always been possible to find useful existing materials but they have always needed some adapting and contextualising and there have always gaps that needed to be filled. The process is much easier if you know that your source materials CAN be used and adapted. And then why not share these revised materials back again? OER for me are then a means to an end, not an end in themselves. &nbsp;Over the past three years I have been involved with curriculum development initiatives at three different institutions where any real curriculum innovation was stymied, however, by the fact that responsible academics had prescribed their own textbooks and did not wish to rewrite them!</p>
<p>Regards, Tony</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks for this Tony; I couldn't agree more with the above.I think we should now call time on this topic unless there are any final valedictory comments from others.&nbsp;I make no apologies for mentioning again the OU UK's Openlearn materials which cover all subjects and are available for use and modification under the Creative Commons Copyright agreement. &nbsp;I have used the science &nbsp;and environment materials and they are great- bring life into even what some might consider as dull topics.</p>
<p>One final issue from me.&nbsp;If, as has been said, African Institutions are unlikely to use materials produced out side africa would it be possible for Unisa to apply for a large grant to make some of it's materials available as OERs? &nbsp;The OU was funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation which has a particular interest in OERs and there may be similar Foundations specialising in African Education.&nbsp;This would help Unisa move 'Towards the African University'Of course the SAfrical Virtula University may be doing this already but I don't know much about it.</p>
<p>As there has been only a modest take up using the clous, it has been suggested we revert to an email distribution for the next session which will start on May 1st and deal with 'Quailty online learning' &nbsp;where we will be joined by&nbsp;Prof Michael Mariasingam.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
