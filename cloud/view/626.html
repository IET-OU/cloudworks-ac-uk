        <p>There are things that occur without or in spite of human intervention; there are things that</p>
<p>people bring into being; and then there are things that occur within the context of things people</p>
<p>have designed. The Grand Canyon in the USA&nbsp;is an example of something that has developed</p>
<p>without or in spite of human intervention. People have created dams and irrigation policies that</p>
<p>have made relatively minor changes to the canyon, when then continues to evolve after</p>
<p>those people made those changes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>People are learning naturally and without conscious effort throughout their waking hours. Then</p>
<p>instructional designers and educational planners come along and create environments and</p>
<p>tasks intended to further learning and contribute to what people know and can do. During these</p>
<p>activities, people do various things, some of which might be consisten with what planners had</p>
<p>in mind. After engaging in these designed activities, people go on learning, sometimes building</p>
<p>on those activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Perhaps this relates to Peter Goodyear's distinction between designing learning tasks and then</p>
<p>observing and recording what people do in carrying out those tasks as they engage in various</p>
<p>learning activities. The learning task is designed. The learning activity is an internal process</p>
<p>that is not designed in same way that the task is designed.</p><p>Contact details: mspector@uga.edu</p>    </div>

                   <p>The point is we an influence what happens in the learning process, that is the whole point </p>
<p>of design, albeit we can't guarantee that our intended design will actually be enacted. </p>
<p>In the runtime it depends on the context and what the learner brings to the situation. </p>
<p>Nonetheless we know what some designs are better than others and we can therefore </p>
<p>steer and during the runtime orchestrate the learning process.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Wittgenstein said, in the <em>Tractatus</em>, that we picture facts to ourselves. We do this naturally</p>
<p>and without much thought most of the time. The creation of internal representations of our</p>
<p>experiences is a naturally occurring process. We might influence this process by becoming</p>
<p>better at self-regulation, by developing particular habits of observation, and by improving our</p>
<p>metacognitive skills. Nonetheless, creating internal representations occurs regardless of our</p>
<p>conscious efforts and the intentions of those around us. We construct internal representations.</p>
<p>That is a fact about the nature of being a person. We create internal representations and then</p>
<p>we have evolved the capacity to talk about those internal representations with others. Is this</p>
<p>not quite amazing?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We sometimes realize that some of these internal representations are particularly helpful or</p>
<p>on occasion particularly bothersome. Some facilitate further learning and some may inhibit</p>
<p>learning. Eliciting and examining these internal representations and understanding how they</p>
<p>are influenced by surroundings and others seems to be a critical factor in coming to </p>
<p>understand how individuals learn.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Superbly put. I think this is a key facet of this. We think naturally, internally about our </p>
<p>design practices and hence as teachers feel comfortable within that space, take it for </p>
<p>granted. But now there is a need to make some attempt at making more of that </p>
<p>internal representation external and explicit whilst also acknowledging it will never be possible </p>
<p>to totally represent the internal, externally.</p>

                   <p>Hi Paul </p>
<p></p>
<p>nice to meet you in Sydney - I agree totally about the semantics!! I think the argument</p>
<p>is simply that at the end of the day the learning happens within the individual and </p>
<p>no matter how you 'design' the learning experience you cant control totally what </p>
<p>happens at runtime. This is why Peter Goodyear makes the distinction between task </p>
<p>ie what the teacher sets and actiivity what the student actually does.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I'm happy to argue about the importance of using language accurately, but the main point of my task:activity distinction is to say that we need conceptions of design that acknowledge the autonomy of the learner and the professional responsibilities of the designer. My 2000 chapter in Mike Spector's book talks about 'reflexive task design', which is task design informed by the knowledge that what the learner does is neither determined nor unpredictable. Drawing on evidence about the things that influence students in the shaping of their activity, we can make a better stab at educational design. Going back to Skinner, I'd say that it's not so much the tightness of the connection between a stimulus and a response that I'm concerned with; it's that students walk away from such offerings.</p>        </div>
