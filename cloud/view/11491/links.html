<p><strong>&nbsp;<strong>UK HE</strong></strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; BBC; Wonkhe; The Telegraph; The Independent; The Guardian]</em></p>
<p>When the music stopped at Theresa May&rsquo;s cabinet reshuffle party, Damian Hinds and Sam Gyimah found chairs available as Education Secretary and Universities Minister respectively.&nbsp; This was made possible by Jo Johnson winning some Tonka trucks and an enormous box of Lego to go off and construct Heathrow&rsquo;s third runway.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Justine Greening didn&rsquo;t much care for her present and chose to go home early without cake.&nbsp; HEPI&rsquo;s Nick Hillman believes the new appointments will make it easier to proceed with the <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/reshuffle-paves-way-bold-review-english-he-funding" rel="nofollow">major review of university funding</a> announced last May.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think a big and bold review is now more likely than it seemed a week ago,&rdquo; Mr Hillman said, although Liverpool&rsquo;s Roger Brown thinks &ldquo;&hellip;it was already clear that the review of higher education finance was being done at No 10&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The review of funding is just one of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-42413636" rel="nofollow">the challenges facing universities in 2018</a>, according to the BBC&rsquo;s Sean Coughlan.&nbsp; In fact, other than issues relating to free speech, he believes all other challenges are economic: VC pay, financial independence and data from HEPI suggesting only 32% of students in England thought their courses represented good value for money.</p>
<p>But universities must be getting something right because student numbers are up again.&nbsp; HESA reports &gt;a 2% rise in the 2016/17 student population, with the total number of HE students standing at 2,317,880.&nbsp; This includes all nations and UG qualifications such as HNC/D and Foundation Degrees.&nbsp; That all seems fairly healthy until you investigate the FT-PT breakdown, showing a 6.9% FT rise since 2012/13 against a 21.2% PT drop.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://wonkhe.com/blogs/a-beginners-guide-to-the-office-for-students/" rel="nofollow">Office for Students (OfS)</a> is officially up and running, despite the arrival and rapid departure of Toby Young.&nbsp; There is currently little experience of PT study in the board members appointed so far.&nbsp; These include Sir Michael Barber (Chair, previously Chief Education Advisor at Pearson) Nicola Dandridge (CEO, formerly CEO of Universities UK) and Carl Lygo (formerly VC of BPP University). &nbsp;The OfS will formally replace Hefce as the principal regulator of HE in England from 1 April.</p>
<p>Figures released last week by HESA show that three quarters of graduates now obtain a first class degree or a 2:1.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2018/01/11/three-quarters-graduates-get-21-firsts-regulator-issues-warning/" rel="nofollow">Persistent grade inflation</a> resulted in 100,495 students graduating with top honours last year, a 40% increase in just four years.&nbsp; The OfS has already warned it will name and shame universities found to be deliberately inflating grades.</p>
<p>A Guardian piece on the OU by Peter Wilby is based mainly on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/09/save-open-university-peter-horrocks-changing" rel="nofollow">an interview with Peter Horrocks</a> who, we learn, &ldquo;looks and dresses like a bank manager&rdquo;.&nbsp; Ah, so Horrocks is just a money man who slashed the BBC, closed OU regional offices, brought the OU &ldquo;to the brink of failure&rdquo; with a dodgy IT system and is now looking to slash &pound;100m from its annual budget?&nbsp; In fact we also learn of some of the intricacies of running a university, the background to the current situation and the proposed changes.&nbsp; And how does he find working with academics?&nbsp; &ldquo;Their job is to help students think critically. &nbsp;A vice-chancellor can hardly complain when they&rsquo;re being difficult and argumentative&rdquo;.</p>
<p>New figures show a 19% increase in departures of European staff from universities last year compared to before the EU referendum, with more than 2,300 EU academics resigning from British universities in the past year amid concerns over a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-news-uk-university-eu-academics-resign-immigration-brexodus-citizens-europe-a8143796.html" rel="nofollow">Brexodus</a> of top talent in higher education.</p>
<p>With continuing doubts over the robustness of A Level results, schools and universities are looking at alternative measures, including BTEC.&nbsp; However, HESA data shows that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/nov/29/students-with-btecs-do-worse-at-university-heres-how-we-close-the-gap" rel="nofollow">BTEC students perform more poorly at university</a>: over 10 years, 13% of students with BBB at A-level failed to complete their degree course at the first attempt. &nbsp;The figure for those with equivalent BTECs was 27%. &nbsp;For those with CCC at A-level or equivalent, the gap is even bigger, at 17% compared with 37%.</p>

<p><strong>M(O)OC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Diana Laurillard and Eileen Kennedy challenge whether the novelty of MOOCs is wearing thin, noting how platforms and teaching models have improved, and how certification has grown in importance.&nbsp; Whilst it is currently the case that courses often serve those who are academically and financially well-placed, they believe the next essential step is to reach those millions of remote or underprivileged learners who have long been cited as the audience who could and would derive the most benefit from MOOCs.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we are to achieve the Unesco Sustainable Development Goal of universal basic education, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/moocs-can-still-bring-higher-education-those-who-really-need-it" rel="nofollow">we need tens of millions of as-yet untrained teachers to educate school-age children</a>. &nbsp;MOOCs cannot directly teach those children, but they can train non-professional adults to become those teachers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a related theme, a recent paper by van de Oudeweetering &amp; Agirdag presents the findings of a review of 31 empirical studies to examine <a href="http://www.ifets.info/journals/21_1/1.pdf" rel="nofollow">how MOOCs benefit the socially privileged in comparison to underprivileged groups</a>.&nbsp; They conclude that &ldquo;&hellip;there are fewer barriers to MOOCs than to higher education [but] the remaining barriers seem to specifically hamper access for underprivileged populations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ten of the studies reported an average of 70% employed learners (typically in &lsquo;good&rsquo; occupations such as ICT, education, business and management).&nbsp; Whilst the UN describes 83% of the world&rsquo;s population as living in less developed countries, only around 30% of MOOC learners do so, with the majority of these described as &ldquo;highly educated&rdquo;.&nbsp; Fifteen of the studies reported on learners&rsquo; educational qualifications, with the highest being a Penn State MOOC on GIS (84% had a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher) and the lowest a Southampton course on Web Science (43%).&nbsp; The researchers noted that this and also the second lowest (Understanding Dementia, 51%) &ldquo;both accommodated their instructional design to the needs of less experienced learners&rdquo; (e.g. flexible pacing, assessment resits, materials written to be &lsquo;understandable&rsquo;).</p>

<p><strong>OERs to Hit the Mainstream</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>Mike Silagadze believes 2017 was a breakthrough year and that <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-12-28-oer-had-its-breakthrough-in-2017-next-year-it-will-become-an-essential-teaching-tool" rel="nofollow">OERs will become a mainstream solution in 2018</a>, as evidenced by the $millions being invested in production by US universities and new legislation being introduced in many states.&nbsp; He suggests there are 3 key actions that are required now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>OER content quality needs to improve</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OER needs bells and whistles (<em>not</em> pointless gimmicks, but value-adding interactivity and supporting services)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OER needs to be easier to find and adopt</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope he&rsquo;s right but I disagree with his prediction that &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t be long before we&rsquo;ll have an iTunes-style central repository for all OER materials in higher education&rdquo;.&nbsp; Apple were in the right place at the right time with millions of cool devices and music-hungry users.&nbsp; Compare that to the number of competing textbook publishers and platforms, all of whom can smell a lot of profit in &lsquo;free&rsquo; content.</p>
<p>In a separate piece, Jeffrey R Young sees <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-01-04-as-campuses-move-to-embrace-oer-college-libraries-become-key-players" rel="nofollow">libraries becoming key players as universities move to embrace OER</a>, with examples emerging such as the Open Textbook Library (led by the University of Minnesota) and OhioLink (funded by a $1.3m grant from the Ohio Department of Education).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>94% of Students Want to Use Their Phones in Class</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>In the first completely unbiased industry survey of the year, Top Hat (supplier of technology that allows students to use their own devices to participate in discussions and access course content) reports that 94% of US students want to use their own devices to participate in discussions and access course content.&nbsp; In fact what they seem to have found is that <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2017/12/12/students-want-to-use-their-cell-phones-in-class.aspx" rel="nofollow">6% said they <em>don't</em> want to use their phone in class for academic purposes</a>.&nbsp; Still, if we take the exact proportions with a pinch of salt, there does seem to be interest and support from students for the interactive enhancements (e.g. quizzes, rich media, polls) digital materials can offer over print.</p>
