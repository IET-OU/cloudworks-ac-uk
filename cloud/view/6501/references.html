The seminar will consider the difficulties in developing employability opportunities for those who may already be working in low paid employment and for those with non-traditional educational histories.</p>

The students were selected from each of the three levels of the Open University&rsquo;s professional qualification in Youth Work. In seeking to elicit biographical narratives the study is able to make connections between the personal, social and occupational factors which shape the hopes, fears and performance of these students. In examining these narratives of progression towards professional status we hope to gain some insights into the challenges faced by those designing and delivering work based programmes of study for mature students in higher education.</p>

<li>Establish the nature of the professional field in which this programme is located, acknowledging that journeys to professional status differ between occupational groupings.</li>
<li>Identify the nature of the programme these students are pursuing &ndash; work based learning within a distance teaching format and conforming to a specific regulatory framework.</li>
<li>Examine the narratives of progression which have emerged from the research and the kind of questions these raise for educators.</li>

<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, 'Lucida Grande', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.200000762939453px;">Dr Martha Caddell, Third Sector Internships Scotland / The Open University in Scotland and Fiona Boyle, Third Sector Internships Scotland<br /><br />With record levels of graduate unemployment, renewed focus is being directed to the role of volunteering and internships as mechanisms for enhancing employability, gaining work experience, and securing routes into permanent jobs. There has been widespread recognition that a &lsquo;degree is not enough&rsquo; and work relevant skills and experience are crucial in a highly competitive job market. Yet there is also concern about the potential elitism of (often unpaid) internship and work placement schemes, where access to opportunities are based on who you know or your ability to work without pay rather than on merit. Much debate has focused on the implications for young people seeking to enter the graduate labour market, yet there are clearly parallel concerns for mature students wishing to return to work after a career break or change career.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, 'Lucida Grande', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.200000762939453px;">This session offers space to discuss this increased focus on internships and work experience and the particular challenges faced by mature students? Can internships offer meaningful opportunities to enhance skills and open opportunities for career change or development? What are the practical challenges facing students, universities and employers in developing placements and internships that will genuinely help enhance student employability?</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, 'Lucida Grande', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.200000762939453px;">In highlighting the emerging issues, we will draw on our experience developing and implementing Third Sector Internships Scotland (www.3rdsectorintern.org.uk). This is a collaborative programme developed by Scottish universities and the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations. Focusing in particular on how mature students have engaged with the programme, the discussion will explore key issues including:</p>
<ul style="color: #333333; font-family: Tahoma, 'Lucida Grande', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.200000762939453px;">
<li>Mature students motivations in applying for internships, and their experience on and post internship.</li>
<li>Making internships meaningful for employers and students.</li>
<li>The challenges of working across multiple universities and with small and micro organisations.</li>
<li>The practicalities of getting an internship scheme up and running.</li>
</ul>
