<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; Stephen Downes; Audrey Watters; MIT, Fortune]</em></p>
<p>Six universities &ndash; Delft University of Technology; Swiss Federal Institute of Technology; the Australian National University; the University of Queensland; the University of British Columbia; and Boston University &ndash; are seeking to establish a new alliance in which each organisation&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/moocs-international-credit-transfer-system-edges-closer" rel="nofollow">MOOCs are formally accredited by partner institutions</a> in a scheme similar to the European Credit Transfer System.</p>
<p>According to Class Central, <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/moocs-2015-stats" rel="nofollow">more people signed up for MOOCs in 2015 than did so in the previous three years</a> and more than 500 organisations now offer 4,200 courses to which 35m students have signed up.&nbsp; Coursera remains the largest provider, accounting for around 50% of all MOOC students, followed by edX with FutureLearn in third (275% growth last year).&nbsp; However, when measured by course numbers, Canvas.net (291 courses) knocked FutureLearn into fourth place (239).&nbsp; Business &amp; management tops the list of course titles (705) followed by science (477) and social sciences (453).&nbsp; Computer science (410) and programming (313) have been split this year but, had that not been the case, they would have claimed the top spot.</p>
<p>Coursera has published its <a href="https://blog.coursera.org/post/135791038302/the-most-popular-courses-of-2015" rel="nofollow">top ten most popular MOOCs of 2015</a>, the top three being:</p>

<p>Udacity has announced a new programme that <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/With-New-Promise-by-Udacity/234911" rel="nofollow">guarantees its graduates will land a job in their field within six months of completion</a> &ndash; or their money back.&nbsp; However, enrolees are advised to read the small print: the offer only applies to its most marketable topics (machine-learning engineer, Android developer, iOS developer and senior web developer); students must fully complete their course; and they must pay an extra $100 a month for that peace of mind (a total of $299 for each month of course &ndash; typically six to eight months x 10 hours per week).</p>
<p>MOOCs were supposed to help democratise access to education but there has been plenty of evidence and news items to suggest this is generally not the case.&nbsp; Now researchers from MIT and Harvard have investigated <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2015/how-socioeconomic-status-impacts-online-learning-1217" rel="nofollow">the effects of socioeconomic status on online learning</a>.&nbsp; Using demographic data from 68 HarvardX and MITx MOOCs, they found a correlation between three indicators &ndash; parental educational attainment, neighbourhood average educational attainment and neighbourhood median income &ndash; and performance and course completion, especially among younger students.&nbsp; Those enrolling in HarvardX and MITx on edX live in neighbourhoods where the median income is 38% higher than typical the US norm. &nbsp;And among teenagers who register for a HarvardX course, those with a college-educated parent are twice as likely to complete their course compared to students whose parents did not complete college.</p>
<p>Fortune reports on how an early move into <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/12/22/wharton-online-learning/" rel="nofollow">MOOCs made Wharton a major player in online education</a>.&nbsp; Most Wharton learners are aged 25 to 44, have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher, are employed full time and, since 2012, some 2.7m have enrolled in Wharton&rsquo;s 18 Coursera MOOCs and the school has awarded 54,000 x $95 verified certificates.&nbsp; Since last April they have also awarded 32,000 verified certificates in Specialization courses, adding to the estimated $5m MOOCs will generate for the School in 2015. &nbsp;Wharton expects to double that in 2016 as it launches at least two dozen new online offerings, including its first three SPOCs on the EdX platform.</p>
<p>Gilly Salmon and chums examined <a href="http://www.researchinlearningtechnology.net/index.php/rlt/article/view/28507" rel="nofollow">the use of social media (Facebook and Twitter) by participants in a MOOC</a> developed to enable educators to learn about the Carpe Diem learning design process.&nbsp; Based on interviews with 29 participants, 31% used Facebook in connection with the course, 3% used Twitter and 14% used both, but 41% did not use social media at all because, &ldquo;First, they did not believe that there was any learning value in using social media sites, and that it was a waste of their time. &nbsp;Second, they found the social media landscape too confusing and intimidating. &nbsp;Third, they did not want to blur what they perceived as the social-professional divide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coursera reveals some interesting (but brief) <a href="https://tech.coursera.org/blog/2016/01/10/scaling-content-production/" rel="nofollow">under-the-bonnet details of its MOOC platform and content editor</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>

<p>New data from HESA show that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35312229" rel="nofollow">part-time student numbers have hit a new low</a>, with the number of first-year students studying part time in 2014-15 falling by 6% on the previous year, and by 38% in five years &ndash; from more than 428,000 in 2010-11 to below 266,000 last year.&nbsp; The NUS blames much of the decline on government cuts to student funding, claiming, &ldquo;Their commitment to social mobility and widening participation is only at surface level, and they do not realise that part-time education is essential to this agenda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An investigation by The Times found that the UK is suffering a <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160108183149801" rel="nofollow">cheating epidemic</a> with almost 50,000 students caught in the past three years and students from outside of the EU more than four times as likely to cheat in exams and coursework.&nbsp; For example, at London&rsquo;s Queen Mary University, 75% of those found to have plagiarised were from overseas with a third from China; and at Sheffield, three in four cheats came from overseas, although they made up only 18% of the student body.&nbsp; The article also reports a growth in essay mills, particularly based in India.</p>
<p>Jackie Njoroge writes about the need for better business intelligence and improved competitive insights in UK HE, given the growing importance of efficiency and greater student choice.&nbsp; She has been part of the HESA/Jisc Business Intelligence project which was responsible for the rollout of <a href="http://wonkhe.com/blogs/with-big-data-comes-big-responsibility/" rel="nofollow">Heidi Plus</a> which will make it possible for decision makers at all levels of an organisation to more easily access, analyse, understand and act on business.&nbsp; However she warns that &ldquo;with big data comes big responsibility&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>What Next for US For-Profit HE?</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; Tony Bates; Phil Hill; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>The Chronicle reports that, at the height of their growth, for-profit colleges enrolled 1 in 12 students at US degree-granting institutions.&nbsp; But those days are over and <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/For-Profit-Colleges-May-Be/234808/?key=FDRAVdqtk3RswdiVh3rC189aM4gXxXgxf1qK1BqNVqFtTFZjblNycWxEQXlCLUYycG85TTNKV0VXRDhobWJvdWR1ZVhtNDNDYnVj" rel="nofollow">enrolments at for-profit colleges have fallen by 26% since 2009</a> compared with a 9% overall decline in US postsecondary enrolment.&nbsp; Some private providers have folded (e.g. Corinthian) while many others have experienced significant shrinkage: Apollo Education Group (owners of the University of Phoenix) has seen its corporate value decline from $10bn in 2009 to under $800m today, and a look at Phoenix enrolments shows the extent of its downsizing.&nbsp; However, writer Goldie Blumenstyk thinks all is not lost and that there are already signs of providers reinventing themselves, their offerings and their financial models.</p>
<p>CNBC profiles <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/15/a-controversial-education-model-us-is-exporting-to-the-world.html" rel="nofollow">Laureate Education</a>, the world's largest for-profit HE company by enrolment (~1m students), noting that 84% of its revenue comes from outside the US, thus avoiding intense US government scrutiny.&nbsp; The company notes the demand for low-cost HE far outstrips the supply in such places as Latin America, where HE has traditionally been the purview of Catholic colleges and state-run universities which, although cheap or free, have only limited student places.&nbsp; Critics say Laureate puts too much emphasis on marketing, advertising, executive salaries and recruitment of students and too little on quality education.&nbsp; For example, after it took over Centro Universitario in 2010, the school's quality ranking among small colleges in Brazil plunged from 41<sup>st</sup> place to No 132.</p>
<p>Tony Bates discusses data from WCET that shows <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2016/01/04/in-the-usa-fully-online-enrollments-continue-to-grow-in-2014/" rel="nofollow">US distance education enrolments continuing to grow</a> slowly but steadily.&nbsp; But a breakdown by provider confirms the Phoenix situation described above: private non-profit enrolments grew by 22% from 2012-14, public by 9%, but private for-profit declined by 11%.</p>
<p>However, the New York Times reports that <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/parent-company-of-university-of-phoenix-could-be-sold-to-owner-of-mcgraw-hill-ed/" rel="nofollow">Apollo Education Group (Phoenix) is in &ldquo;advanced talks&rdquo; to be purchased</a> by Apollo Global Management, a NY private-equity firm, (similar name, different company), owner of McGraw-Hill Education.&nbsp; NYT believes the deal could be worth about $1bn and an agreement could be reached in the next few weeks.</p>

<p><strong>The Three Laws of eLearning Failure</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Short and sweet descriptions of his <a href="http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/1848/marc-my-words-the-three-laws-of-elearning-failure/pageall" rel="nofollow">three laws of e-learning failure</a> from Marc Rosenberg, but so very true:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Great e-Learning technology combined with bad content results in more efficiently delivered bad content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When great e-Learning comes up against a lousy learning culture, the culture wins every time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>e-Learning that is compensation for bad documentation, tools, processes, or management will ultimately prove to be a waste of time and money.</p>

<p><strong>Who are the Open Learners?</strong></p>
<p><em>[EURODL]</em></p>
<p>A new IET paper presents the results of a <a href="http://www.eurodl.org/?p=current&article=707" rel="nofollow">survey of more than 3,000 OER users</a> of three repositories: OpenLearn, iTunesU and Saylor Academy. &nbsp;In addition to demographic data, they report on patterns of use, user profiles, attitudes towards OER, types of materials used and popularity of different subjects. &nbsp;The researchers found that, on the whole, learners were highly positive about their use of OER, their experiences were fairly consistent and they believe they will continue to use them.&nbsp; However, when asked whether their informal studies would now make formal study more likely, some degree of polarization was observed for iTunes and Saylor students (Table 2) but OpenLearners were much more inclined towards future formal study.&nbsp; The authors note that this may be explained by, &ldquo;the existence of planned pathways between OpenLearn content and degree level content provided by The Open University (UK) which are intended to facilitate the transition from non-formal to formal study&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Should Students Be Partners In Curriculum Design?</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>Chris Havergal examines <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/should-students-be-partners-in-curriculum-design" rel="nofollow">the role of students in pedagogical design decisions</a>.&nbsp; For example, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Bryn Mawr and Haverford colleges have involved about 250 academics and 200 student consultants since 2007.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most people who come into the programme think: &lsquo;What could a student teach me about teaching, and particularly a student outside my subject area?&rsquo;&rdquo; says director, Alison Cook-Sather. &ldquo;They also feel vulnerable that people will be watching them and judging them. [But] what happens for 99 per cent of the people who participate is that they realise it isn&rsquo;t about expertise in a subject area: it is about understanding how the student experiences pedagogy, curriculum and assessment in the class.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Bloom Revisited</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes;</em> <em>TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Bloom&rsquo;s (1956) Taxonomy might be regarded by many as a bit old hat and &lsquo;instructional&rsquo;, but it does offer a useful sanity check for authors and designers of teaching, learning and assessment to consider whether they&rsquo;re pitching things at an appropriate cognitive level.&nbsp; Anderson &amp; Krathwohl&rsquo;s 2001 revised taxonomy improved matters by swapping Bloom&rsquo;s levels 5 and 6 and introducing more friendly action verbs, then I discovered Andrew Churches&rsquo; <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/8000050/Blooms-Digital-Taxonomy-v2-12" rel="nofollow">Bloom&rsquo;s Digital Taxonomy</a> which links the categories and activities to social media and a variety of digital tools/techniques.&nbsp; And finally, via Stephen Downes, comes Eric Sheninger&rsquo;s new <a href="http://esheninger.blogspot.ca/2015/12/improving-instruction-in-digital-world.html" rel="nofollow">Rigor and Relevance Framework</a>, which he describes as, &ldquo;an action &shy;oriented continuum that describes putting knowledge to use&rdquo;.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t change the world but it&rsquo;s another useful perspective and, as with the Digital Taxonomy, it helpfully relates the action verbs to relevant learning technologies.</p>
<p>TechCrunch also looks at Bloom&rsquo;s more recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/09/how-startups-are-solving-a-decades-old-problem-in-education/?ncid=tcdaily#.vlxkaj:jmQu" rel="nofollow">Two Sigma research</a> which showed that students receiving 121 tuition using mastery learning techniques performed an average of two standard deviations better than students who learned via traditional classroom methods.&nbsp; Bloom himself concluded that this is, &ldquo;too costly for most societies to bear on a large scale&rdquo;, but Roshan Choxi considers how educational technology might help to provide or support a similar &lsquo;online mentorship&rsquo; approach.</p>
