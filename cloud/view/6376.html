			<p>We have now also created a survey form in which you can record your experiences with MOOCs; about what&nbsp;MOOCs do well,&nbsp;potential issues or problems to watch out for and suggestions for designing MOOCs better. We would like to invite anyone who has participated in, designed, facilitated, tutored, or evaluated a MOOC (or many MOOCs!) to complete this survey.</p>
<p>MOOC Survey link: <strong><a href="http://tinyurl.com/MOOCSurvey" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/MOOCSurvey</a> </strong></p>
<p>MOOCs you may have participated or been involved in include: Change.MOOC, eduMOOC: Online Learning Today and Tomorrow,&nbsp;PLENK, DS106: Digital Storytelling, MobiMOOC, CCK11, Crypt4you, Georgia Tech MOOC, P2PU, bonkopen2012, etc.</p>
<p>We will&nbsp; review&nbsp;the&nbsp;survey results&nbsp;and summarise these in&nbsp;a public&nbsp;document. We will also use the wisdom, lessons and advice offered in designing our Learning Design MOOC. In the meantime, please continue to use the discussion thread below to discuss your MOOC experiences and pass this link on to others.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p style="line-height: 18pt;">Thanks to everyone who has responsded to the survey and for recording&nbsp;your experience of MOOCs (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/MOOCSurvey" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/MOOCSurvey</a>). The following is an interim review of two of the survey&nbsp;questions based on the 40 responses so far recorded: what did you enjoy most about the MOOC you were involved with? and what advice would you give to someone designing a MOOC?</p>
<p style="line-height: 18pt;">The survey results recorded so far reveal people enjoyed: engaging with other participants, the contributions of those providing teaching or facilitation, freedom for self-directed learning and the amount of information provided. Seven said they enjoyed &lsquo;being part of a community&rsquo;, &lsquo;building professional networks,&rsquo; or &lsquo;sharing and learning from front-runners in the field.&rsquo; This offered, as a further two respondents put it, a &lsquo;glimpse of international communication&rsquo; and a &lsquo;chance to interact with people around the world.&rsquo; Three others stated they had most enjoyed the contribution of the lecturer, tutor or facilitators who &lsquo;put in a lot of time responding to student feedback and [creating] extra wiki notes and forum answers&rsquo;. Another three mentioned they had enjoyed the freedom the MOOC offered for self-directed learning and tailoring information and the space it provided for reflection. The scale or range of resources on offer was also specifically mentioned as something people had enjoyed, whether this was the sustained focus of a single theme MOOC, live sessions, blog posts, or the &lsquo;huge amount&rsquo; or &lsquo;relevant information&rsquo; provided. For some, the MOOC also offered an opportunity to develop personal expertise in teaching online, for example, two used the MOOC to learn about the platform or develop skills in open academic practice. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 18pt;">Respondents offered a variety of advice for designing a MOOC. One category of suggestions focused on the MOOC experience: five mentioned the importance of structure: &lsquo;be very clear about where the main home page is&rsquo;; provide &lsquo;clear&rsquo; and &lsquo;plenty of&rsquo; structure&rsquo;; explain &lsquo;what you see as essential and desirable and a luxury&rsquo; and don&rsquo;t make it &lsquo;too overwhelming.&rsquo; Whilst another five provided suggestions about the type and balance of tasks: have a balance between activities and the time required to develop them; set some interactive engagement; link to the curriculum and learning objectives; and set a variety of reading, doing and collaborating. One person suggested trying to &lsquo;be disruptive.&rsquo; Synchronous sessions were mentioned by two: one stressing it was important to explain the reasons for having synchronous sessions and the other to ensure options for such activities that caters for different time zones. Two suggested having a co-ordinated communication strategy with participants: &lsquo;don&rsquo;t bombard participants with too much push emails,&rsquo; &lsquo;keep communication steady&rsquo; and &lsquo;keep the schedule up to date.&rsquo; Two respondents advised to keep in mind the expectations of participants and not to &lsquo;assume all are at the same level of understand the tools.&rsquo; One final comment in this category related to ensuring the &lsquo;pace and depth of topics [is] higher than a traditional course.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="line-height: 18pt;">A second category of advice related to what MOOC organisers should provide. Three stressed the importance of guidelines - for how to behave, how to pace yourself, and for how to do peer support &ndash; whilst another asked that instructions for tool use etc. are given &lsquo;based at the lowest common denominator.&rsquo; One respondent advised that self-study resources should be included, and another that the team should have a policy on how to manage discussion forums. Three mentioned the importance of good tutors who needed to be &lsquo;very communicative guides&rsquo; and &lsquo;prepared to offer constant feedback and examples&rsquo; whilst one respondent also warned not to &lsquo;underestimate the time and resource required.&rsquo; One person said it would be important to think carefully about how group interaction would work &ndash; thinking in terms of &lsquo;cohorts and other usable group[ing]s&rsquo; and a final comment suggested the course designers consider how people will access the MOOC away from their desk on mobile devices.</p>
<p style="line-height: 18pt;">The survey will remain open until the end of the project, so if you know of others&nbsp;who have&nbsp;been involved in&nbsp;MOOCs so please pass the survey URL on to them.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

<p>...maybe coupled with some kind of MOOC project/tasks the results of which are displayed to individual participant's online (shareable, embedable &amp; +able) protfolios (e.g. something like behance)...</p>

                   <p>I contributed to the Change MOOC, back in April, and agree with Yishay's comment that this is a series of short courses. There were very few participants, Mini Open Online Course, perhaps, but those who commented were good and interesting. Some followed up further on email and twitter. There was some central glitch that did not put up the resources in time, so not smooth, but I could see the point, if there were sufficient central support to make it a serious enterprise. Some of them have had good support.</p>
<p>I found it difficult to plan and design it properly in advance, as there is no access in advance to who the participants might be, no means to negotiate the curriculum, no way to plan how much time people might spend on it, no form of assessment can be negotiated or managed. So it's not really a course. You really need to play it by ear and have resources ready to respond to what comes up, and be prepared to use what the participants can contribute, so it is a model that lends itself to something that is more like facilitating peer learning, than a teacher-learner model.</p>
<p>So I think you have to approach the learning design in a rather different way, being suggestive of what might be covered, open to negotiation, but clear about some particular kind of journey you want to take people on, even if the details are not fully specified. Learning outcomes would not be set, rather we set aims, like 'in this MOOC we want to explore the issue of... or the problem of... or we want to share some ideas on...' something like that.</p>

                   <p>I've been closely involved with ds106 since it's inception, and have participated in numerous iterations. It takes the connectivist, multi-platform nature of the earlier cMOOCs but uses it to deliver a very popular mainstream subject - with credit-bearing undergrads working alongside open participants. It's also been "franchised" in a few places. Happy to talk more about it on the 25th.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Yish and all in the thread</p>
<p>You say, "I can see the advantage of Moodle, but that means that the MOOC content  is not visible without registration. It also means that you need a host  who is willing to allow open registration."</p>
<p>Moodle MOOC content IS (or can be) visible to "guests". Set: allow guest registration. This means that you cha have click-through to any discussion, etc. Posting to discussions does require registration.</p>
<p>Because of the open registration issue we have an externally hosted Moodle on openbrookes.net.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>My experience of Moocs is <a href="https://p2pu.org/" rel="nofollow">P2PU</a> or<a href="https://p2pu.org/" rel="nofollow"> peer-to-peer university</a>. It's been around since Sept 2009, when it run short 'boutique' courses, ranging from creative writing and cyberpunk literature, to copyright for educators. Courses used to run for 6 weeks, offering a basic learning design that put emphasis on engagement with resources, small tasks and peer to peer critiquing (from mentors and peers), using web 2.0 tools as well as synchronous and asychronous modes of interaction. Huge endorsement from Mozzila and lots of basic computer, web literacy courses raised profile. Not quite a self-proclaimed MOOC, and has several iterations in the interface and learning design, but difficult to see content at the moment unless you join. Strong sense of the core community in the past, but I haven't followed recently...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of presentations/papers about it: <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/24628/" rel="nofollow">Distributed mentoring&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/23392/" rel="nofollow">http://oro.open.ac.uk/23392/</a></p>        </div>

It provides a map to learning Python, but doesn&rsquo;t discourage folks from careening off the beaten path. This is the open web, after all."</p>
