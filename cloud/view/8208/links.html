        <p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>Where are you coming from? What is the context in which you are working and participating in OLDS MOOC?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>This is an incomplete narrative as I wanted to get something up to show that I have been doing something not just lurking....ther's loads that needs adding but anyway....</em></p>
<p><em>I am an e-learning consultant and trainer.&nbsp; When I enrolled on the MOOC, I was e-learning facilitator (aka learning technologist) at Staffordshire University, with particular responsibilities for the Faculty of Health Sciences.&nbsp; We have just (two days ago) moved to Birmingham so am no longer working at the University but hope to gain work at a local University as soon as I have time to regroup! </em></p>
<p><em>My participation in the MOOC has been in the middle of designing and implementing a complete lifestyle change.&nbsp; Now that the kids are all grown up (mentally independent if not fully financially independent!) we decided it was time to have some fun and move to a city into a 2-bed apartment (from a&nbsp; 5-bed house) which we did on Wednesday this week.&nbsp; So, what with the move and work and everything else, I have only been able to dip in and out but have been reading all the emails and surfing (or is it lurking) in the clouds.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>What did you hope to achieve? What were your goals in joining OLDS MOOC?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I wanted to participate in the OLDSMOOC for experience of a MOOC and to learn about learning design as I can use my learning when facilitating course design in my work.&nbsp; The expectation of technology has always been that it will &lsquo;transform&rsquo; learning and teaching and I want to &lsquo;transform&rsquo; my own ways of thinking about designing courses and here&rsquo;s a thing....as I write this I have a sudden revelation that we have been talking about learning design and not course design which I have realised already has worked in changing the angle at which we were coming at this learning from.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>What did you do? What were the main events, interactions, practices and activities in which you participated?&nbsp;What were the obstacles - and how did you tackle them?</em></p>
<p><em>This is a hard one, because the honest answer is not as much as I wanted with the lame excuse of pressures on time but I think I will forgive myself as I was trying to fit in an awful lot of events into a short space of time &ndash; decluttering 12 years worth of accumulated possessions, moving and job-seeking being a few of them.</em></p>
<p><em>Having got involved in two linked projects from many that were interesting and enticing, the outcome was being involved in one project (sorry Alan) on creating a course on learning design for further education teachers, topslicing through the research and evidence provided in the MOOC.&nbsp; This was simply because I was able to jump on and help build on the work already started by the project members, Elisabetta Lando and Dan McCafferty, further education learning and teaching is an area I have experience and supported some of the other work I was doing at the time.</em></p>
<p><em>The idea was to create a learning design course in Moodle for FE teachers using only a few of the essential resources, frameworks and models discovered and debated in the MOOC.&nbsp; This was so it was manageable and didn&rsquo;t involve too many forays into the myriad of tools available.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><em>What were the outcomes of your participation? Did you meet your goals? What went well, what didn't? What unexpected outcomes did you notice?</em></p>
<p><em>The outcome to date is the beginnings of a learning design course based in Moodle for FE teachers following on from a toolkit flowchart created in Lucidchart.com.&nbsp; The flowchart was based on the 7S model of design for experiential learning and then converting this into a course with suggested tasks and activities for individual or group learning using the templates, resources and links discovered in the MOOC.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/4e55-dbd4-51099474-a8b0-0bff0a005798&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The deadline for the prototype is May when we will encourage a group of FE teachers to evaluate the design by working through the course.&nbsp; Once it has been tweaked (!) it can be made available (not fully thought out how) as an open course.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>What did you learn? What advice could you give others?</em></p>
<p><em>The simple answer here is &lsquo;loads&rsquo; but not as much as I could have if I had given it the time it deserved.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>Whilst making and giving time is important, don&rsquo;t let it put you off because whatever time you can give to it adds to your learning.&nbsp; </em></p>
