<p><em>Abstract </em>&mdash; a very important part of the education process is the feedback learners get from their teachers and tutors. Sometimes the feedback is not adequate because the concentration of educators is on grading. In this paper we report the development of the new software tool <em>tsAAM</em> (technology supported Assignment Assessment &amp; Moderation), which combines grading, assessment moderation, and formative assessment for different formats of assignments.</p>
<p align="left">Keywords - e-assessment; formative assessment; feedback; grading; summative assessment</p>
<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Introduction</h1>
<p>Students are not satisfied with the feedback they get. The feedback is not in time and it is also not clear enough so it does not support the improvement of students learning behavior. The National Student Survey 2009 of Great Britain showed a minimal improvement but it is still alarming that approximately 40% of the students in higher education institutions are unhappy. Another fact that turned out was that about 30 % do not agree in terms of clear assessing criteria and fair assessment arrangements and marking (NSS, 2009).</p>
<p>According to these facts this project concentrates on the development of a system which supports clear and prompt feedback and guarantees that feedback is directly connected to the assessment criteria.</p>
<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motivation and Related Work</h1>
<p>Assessment in higher education is a large and important part of teaching and learning, especially in regards to formative assessments (Boston, 2002; Chappuis &amp; Chappuis, 2007).</p>
<p>Computer supported learning environments like WebCT and Blackboard (Blackboard, 2010) or Moodle (Moodle, 2010) do not usually support the specific assessment and feedback requirements, generally merely providing the possibility to give an overall mark and a comment to two for every student submission. The one positive aspect about these environments is that they are web-based and therefore accessible for students and tutors at any time from any place via an Internet connection. <strong></strong></p>
<p>Based on these facts our <em>tsAAM</em> system is a web-based application which combines summative assessment and detailed feedback. Moreover, <em>tsAAM</em> supports tutors in assessing large classes by concentrating on supporting detailed feedback rather than grading. The feedback statements are directly linked to a grade which is crucial for a transparent and consistent assment process.</p>
<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp; III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System Structure and Components</h1>
<p>Feedback is essential in the educational process and should be available for students as detailed and specific commentary on their work in relation to the standard published in the assignment assessment rubric. Also, feedback which is provided soon after assignment submission is more useful and valuable than delayed feedback. We have not found a pre-existing system to meet our requirements and therefore constructed a prototype which tutors have the possibility of using at any time they want and students can access their assessed work as soon as it is assessed. The turnaround time of feedback to students is substantially reduced which helps students closing the gap between the actual level and the level expected in an efficient way (Baroudi, 2007).</p>
<p>For the implementation of the system a web-based technology was chosen due to flexibility, time, and place considerations. The project is split into two parts, the main web application for moderation and assessment for lecturers and tutors called <em>Assessment &amp; Moderation Tool (A&amp;MT)</em> and the <em>Student Center</em> for course subscription and feedback access.</p>
<p>The needs of an efficient and flexible application in the sense of user interface and stability led to the development of the tool with GWT (Google Web Toolkit) (Google, 2010), an open source framework for flexible development of AJAX applications. The main features of the <em>Assessment &amp; Moderation Tool</em> for lecturers and tutors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexible assignment assessment rubric creation for lecturers including (suggested) feedback statements linked to the marking criteria</li>
<li>Reuse of existing rubrics with possibility for extension, amendment, and adaptation</li>
<li>Moderate assignments using existing rubrics</li>
<li>Expand an existing rubric with extra feedback statements during the assessment process</li>
<li>Easy organization of courses (teaching-learning units), assignments, feedback, assessment, and moderation reports</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second part of the project, the <em>Student Centre</em>, is built within a Drupal environment, a common content management system &#40;Drupal, 2010&#41;, where students have the opportunity to create an account for course registration, assignment upload and the most important part, accessing the assessed assignments and related feedback. After the tutor has finished assessing an assignment students get an automatically generated email with the confirmation that feedback for their work is available. Students then can access the feedback and improve learning behaviors based on this information, and if necessary via a meeting with their tutor.</p>
<p>Both, the <em>Assessing &amp; Moderation Tool</em> and the <em>Student Centre</em> use the same database so the needed data are consistent and up to date at any time. The relationship of the system components and the user environment is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp; IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion and Future Work</h1>
<p>Feedback in the assessing process is very important to students for improving the learning behavior. If students know what is essential for reaching a better level and they get prompt feedback on their work it is easier for them to react on poor.</p>
<p>Actually, <em>tsAAM</em> is designed to cover the needs of feedback for every kind of assignment with an opportunity of grading based on the feedback given. Lecturers need to construct a comprehensive assessment rubric with sample feedback for given performance levels according to the rating scale in operation. Future development will include statistical features based on former assessments and courses.</p>
