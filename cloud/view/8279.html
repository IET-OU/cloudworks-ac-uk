        <p><strong>Applying Co-operative Values and Principles</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong></p>
<p>My role was to reorganise text from a number of authors then sense check, format, illustrate and proof read the finished (paper based) document to ensure that it both covered the learning outcomes for the unit and met the specification of the client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>
<p>Mid 2012. I was office based in central Manchester with a small team. The client that had commissioned the piece was another company based nearby.</p>
<p>The authors of the materials being incorporated into the piece were self-employed contract staff based at varying locations in the UK, communicating with me through phone and email and having attended a preliminary face to face meeting with the client and ourselves to discuss their requirements.</p>
<p>Myself and my team have an excellent and well established relationship with the client, as do the majority of the authors. All the actors in this narrative have detailed knowledge of the co-operative movement and are passionate about promoting the co-operative model as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>
<p>Applying Our Values and Principles was (and is) a mandatory unit towards the Certificate and Diploma in Co-operation at the Co-operative College.&nbsp; These qualifications are aimed primarily at the elected members of co-operatives in order for them to carry out their roles more effectively with emphasis on co-operative values and principles.</p>
<p>The previous version of the workbook was tired and dated. The new version to be developed was to adhere to the same learning outcomes (to comply with the awarding body) but be &lsquo;fresher&rsquo; with more recent case-studies, including more up to date theories and practice, more images, and to include more &lsquo;FYI&rsquo; information for learners taken from the National Co-operative Archive which is based at the College. A post-workshop assignment was also to be developed where one hadn&rsquo;t been with previous versions (to increase the rigour of the assessment). Success was to be measured through improved feedback from learners and the client, high take up of the post workshop assignment and learners continuing on to complete the full qualification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Initial planning meetings between the College and the Client.</strong></p>
<p>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the whole smooth as we had been through similar processes before. Slight disagreement when client wanted to change the wording of the learning outcomes but, as these were externally accredited by the awarding body, the client agreed to continue as was.</p>
<p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Authors given their remit &amp; timescale for submission</strong></p>
<p>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again smooth as all involved had been through the process before and were experienced in the field of co-operation.</p>
<p><strong>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Authors submit their respective sections via email</strong></p>
<p>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some difficulties in emailing due to the size of files, but overcame this through either zipping or using discs/ pen sticks.</p>
<p><strong>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Material evaluated by the College</strong></p>
<p>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some issues in content detected and amended between College and author.</p>
<p><strong>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Materials formatted and illustrated in-house to College house style</strong></p>
<p>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No issues</p>
<p><strong>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Draft of final piece submitted to client for sign-off</strong></p>
<p>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minor issues in formatting and content identified and rectified by the College</p>
<p><strong>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Achieve final sign-off by College and Client.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Expected outcomes: </strong>Slight disagreements between the College and Client &ndash; all easily resolved; good quality new materials developed; excellent feedback from learners.</p>
<p><strong>Unexpected outcomes: </strong>CDP opportunities for authors identified; more developmental work with same client contracted (evidenced over more recent months with the same process being applied to two more outdated units.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives met:</strong> 100%</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reflections:</strong></p>
<p>This activity helped in my own development in that I am less experienced in the field of co-operation than most of my colleagues&rsquo; ad exercises such as this add valuable knowledge. The same can be said of the formatting and illustration of the document.</p>
<p>Also useful from an interactional point of view between the College/ Client/ Authors &ndash; we know more about what is expected of each other and can communicate much more effectively.</p>    </div>
