                   <p>The time taken to complete the activity is about an hour. I have &nbsp;posted my comments, and few suggestions on improving the 'Design process lifecycle' model.</p>
<p>The &nbsp;instruction and content are fine. The activity can become interesting with few specific examples to work on. For example, designing an activity for basic computing skills using the design process model or any other model. Also, there can be few &nbsp;references in the document.</p>
<p>Being &nbsp;the first posting in the activity cloud, will have to wait for any comments/feedback.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Yes, Manfusa, I found I needed about an hour as well. The reading does not take too long, but the thinking and commenting take time!</p>
<p>I also agree with Manfusa in regard to instruction and content, and I also thought some examples would be useful, as it is so abstracted.</p>
<p>However, that is also a source of difficulty, as choosing particular examples for a universal audience, teaching across many disciplines at a wide range of levels, could be difficult. Some readers might be offput reading about computing skills, others by something 'fluffy' like social science.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When John Naysmith and I put together a manual for associate lecturers on Action Research, we tried to put in examples from across all the courses in available in the Open University at the time (2002) so as to engage a broad range of readers. Perhaps in this cloudscape there could be links to illustrations &nbsp;of this 'Design process lifecycle' from various faculties? I'm guessing that such records actually exist, since the OU has been studying itself and how it designs and delivers courses since the early 1970s?</p>        </div>

                   <ol>
<li>How long did you take to complete the Activity? not long at all - maybe 1/2 hour depending on whether I remember to come back and read the comments when more have been made [my email notification doesn't seem to happen though]</li>
<li>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? If they weren't how could they be improved? clear, although if I felt that i didn't actually use a design then this meant a chunk was obviated.</li>
<li>Was the content of the Activity informative? If not what would you have liked to see? yes and useful as a structured way of approaching the design process.</li>
<li>What did you like about the Activity? the structures nature of the information which very much fits into my ordered way of doing things</li>
<li>What did you dislike about the Activity? being asked to draw the learning design. no chance as that is totally alien to me.</li>
<li>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? If you did not post any comments can you say why you didn't? i did.</li>
<li>If you did post comments to the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback? not sure yet as i am completing this evaluation straight after finishing the activity so no chance for feedback yet</li>
<li>How useful was the feedback?&nbsp; n/a </li>
<li>Do you have any other comments you would like to make? preferred this activity to the 1st one.</li>

                   <p>What a good idea Richenda and I do hope that links will be put up.</p>
<p>Interestingly I didn't find it took as long as the others mentioned so maybe it does vary according to how one approaches it. I found it simple and straightforward, which reduced the time input.</p>        </div>

                   <p>How long did you take to complete the Activity? about three hours.&nbsp; It is becoming clearer to me that in my learning, I am unconcerned with time; I set about a task with an outcome in mind and I persue the process until I am satisfied that I have been successful in what I have identified as my personal learning intention; with this in mind, I may well ignore this question in the subsequent activities</p>
<p>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? yes;&nbsp; I have captured the second activity in a Microsoft Word document so that I will be able to return to the concepts as I will want to refresh my review of the issues considered within the activity</p>
<p>Was the content of the Activity informative? yes; I did find some of the text opaque</p>
<p>If not what would you have liked to see? &nbsp;I agree with previous comments that diagrams, graphic depiction of the concepts might enhance the presentation</p>
<p>What did you like about the Activity? &nbsp;I was exposed to a clearly conceived, systematic method of interpreting the learning design process</p>
<p>What did you dislike about the Activity?&nbsp; in order to examine the items listed within each of the six stages, I found that I required a printed version and so I downloaded the script and that allowed me to review the information in hard copy as well as the screen version</p>
<p>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? &nbsp;yes</p>
<p>If you did post comments to the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback? not yet&nbsp;</p>
<p>How useful was the feedback? not applicable</p>

<li>How long did you take to complete the Activity? - about 15mins!!</li>
<li>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? Yes, except that it might have been helpful to say whether&nbsp;it actually wanted us to draw our process - asking 'Can..' doesn't mean that we actually should</li>
<li>Was the content of the Activity informative? -&nbsp;ok, &nbsp;I've seen lots of things like this, variations on a theme before, so perhaps less informative for me. I agree, examples would have livened it up. It is all very well in theory but applying these things in practice can be very different.</li>
<li>What did you like about the Activity? - it was quick!!</li>
<li>What did you dislike about the Activity? - lack of examples</li>
<li>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? - Yes</li>
<li>If you did post comments to the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback? - only just done it. Also, I am also not getting email notifications of comments even though my preferences are set correctly.</li>

<p>Most were but did leave options for missing out creating your own design process.</p>

<p>Yes it is amazing what needs to be covered.</p>

                   <p>Hi&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took me about 15 minutes to complete the activity however I didn&rsquo;t draw of how I would approach designing an activity as it would be very similar to the Design life cycle. I thought the instruction were clear. The content was interesting and I liked the format. I agree examples would have made it more interesting but would also have increased the time to study it. I did post a comment but very recent so no feedback as yet</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks</p>
<p>Dee</p>        </div>
