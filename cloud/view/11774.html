<p>The OU has seen <a href="https://ounews.co/around-ou/ou-speaks-out/phasing-out-of-government-grant-underlines-need-for-new-funding-system/" rel="nofollow">the end of direct grants</a> from the government for &lsquo;transitional students&rsquo; (who began their studies prior to the 2012 fee increases), removing &pound;10.6 million from the University&rsquo;s income.&nbsp; A dramatic fall in overall OU student numbers from 240,000 to 174,000 coincides exactly with the introduction of the changes, with acting VC Mary Kellett commenting, &ldquo;Stripping people of the ability to learn while they earn deprives them of the chance to improve their lives and deprives the economy of the skills needed to tackle our low productivity [&hellip;] The Government says it values the role of part-time and flexible study. If so, it must urgently consider some form of &lsquo;flexible learning incentive&rsquo; that would help bring down direct costs to students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, data from HESA shows an increase in students starting full-time and part-time taught PG courses in 2016-17, up by 22% on the previous year for FT courses and 8.6% for PT.&nbsp; However, further analysis by OfS shows the increases are almost entirely attributable to courses eligible for <a href="https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/news-blog-and-events/news-and-blog/more-students-taking-up-postgraduate-masters-degrees/" rel="nofollow">masters&rsquo; loans</a>, introduced in 2016-17, while non-eligible courses witnessed a 1% decline.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tes.com/news/post-levy-apprenticeships-starts-continue-crash" rel="nofollow">drop in apprenticeship starts</a> since the introduction of the levy is getting more severe, with provisional figures showing 23,900 starts in March &ndash; down by more than half from the 50,000 who started in March 2017 &ndash; prompting Apprenticeships and Skills minister Anne Milton to defend the programme. &nbsp;Meanwhile, <a href="https://wonkhe.com/blogs/if-we-are-serious-about-social-mobility-then-degree-apprenticeships-are-essential/" rel="nofollow">Tim Blackman claims that degree apprenticeships are bucking that trend</a> and so they should if we are serious about social mobility.&nbsp; School leavers from disadvantaged areas are still far less likely enter HE than other young people, especially young men, and the number of part-time students has collapsed since the 2012 fee increases.&nbsp; He also believes they &ldquo;have the potential to break the mould of a prestige-ridden higher education system&rdquo; and can open doors to address national shortages in professions such as teachers, nurses, social workers and police officers.</p>
<p>The neglect of part-time and mature students is short-sighted warns a new House of Lords report, <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldeconaf/139/139.pdf" rel="nofollow">Treating Students Fairly: The Economics of Post-School Education</a>, to which the OU was a contributor.&nbsp; Chapter 5 deals with flexible learning and the evidence and commentary on pp 57-65 makes depressing reading, such as this from Prof Sir Alan Tuckett: &ldquo;If you tried to design the decline of adult learning opportunities in Britain over the past 15 years, you would struggle to do it as well as we have done it by accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A HEPI survey of 14,000 UK students found less than 40% thought they were getting <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-44373231" rel="nofollow">value for money</a> and that tuition fees, teaching quality and lack of contact hours were the biggest causes of dissatisfaction.&nbsp; Although many students thought fees were too high, there was also support for the principle of students making a financial contribution for their degree.&nbsp; The study also showed that almost two-thirds of students, if they had to make the choice again, would still continue with the same course and at the same institution.</p>

<p>The New York Times famously called 2012 the &ldquo;year of MOOCs&rdquo; and now Dhawal Shah believes <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-05-21-the-second-wave-of-mooc-hype-is-here-and-it-s-online-degrees" rel="nofollow">the second wave of MOOC hype is here &ndash; online degrees</a>.&nbsp; So far, ten universities have announced a total of 25 MOOC-based online degrees, with over 9,000 students already enrolled and more than a thousand graduated &ndash; which he estimates represents a combined potential revenue of over $80m.&nbsp; One of the attractions for providers is that content which is initially free creates a large user base and therefore a marketing advantage over traditional online degree programmes where &ldquo;the cost to acquire a single paying student can reach several thousand dollars&rdquo;.&nbsp; His main concern is that that the majority of that content continues to remain freely available, thus extending the breadth and reach of MOOCs.</p>

<p><strong>Growing demand for short courses</strong></p>
<p><em>[</em><em>Avril Jamieson]</em></p>
<p>Studyportals, an international platform covering over 170,000 courses across 110 countries, reports that <a href="https://thepienews.com/news/short-courses-growing-popularity-studyportals/" rel="nofollow">demand for short courses is growing twice as fast as that for degree courses</a> on its study choice portal. Prospective international students are particularly interested in short courses &ndash; around half of which are delivered online &ndash; in Business and Management (24.9%), followed by Engineering and Technology (12.2%), and Social Sciences (10.6%). &nbsp;Although demand for degree courses has not decreased, the company suggests that providers should take note and expand their offer to include short courses which cater for the growing trend towards the 'unbundling' of degree content for the modern knowledge economy.</p>

<p><em>[Martin Weller]</em></p>
<p>Academic institutions risk overcomplicating ePortfolios by customising them and moving the focus away from users.&nbsp; Martin Weller reflects on a tool that was once intended to collect evidence of lifelong learning but which itself has become a tool that students must first learn to use, creating an unnecessary barrier.&nbsp; He suggests that perhaps <a href="http://blog.edtechie.net/25yearsedtech/25-years-of-edtech-2008-eportfolios/" rel="nofollow">the blog remains a better route to establishing a lifelong digital identity</a>.</p>

<p>The seventh annual edition of <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2018/06/13/online-students-price-matters-doesnt-dictate-choice" rel="nofollow">Online College Students 2018</a> has examined the attitudes and behaviours of 1,500 current or soon-to-be [US] students in fully online academic programmes on a range of topics.</p>
<p>Findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mobile-friendly content is critical because virtually every online college student owns a smartphone or tablet which they use to search for their online programme of study (87%) and complete online course work (67%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three-quarters of online college students pursue a degree for employment-focused reasons and so good career services and the support of a career advisor are increasingly seen as applicable to their post-graduation success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sixty percent of those who recently searched for an online programme had completed one in the past and, for those who have experienced both F2F and virtual classrooms, 85% feel that learning online is as good or better than attending courses on campus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although cost is the most important factor in choosing a particular academic programme, many students were willing to pay a little more for one that &ldquo;best matched my interests/needs&rdquo; (24%)&nbsp; or institution with the best reputation (13%) &ndash; and 86% felt the value of their degree equals or exceeds the cost they paid for it.</p>

<p><strong>Lecture capture, friend or foe?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wonkhe]</em></p>
<p>While there are clear benefits of <a href="https://wonkhe.com/blogs/capturing-the-lecture/" rel="nofollow">lecture capture technology</a>, its use is littered with controversy that cannot be easily addressed through policy-making.&nbsp; It is ironic that the process of recording lectures for the purpose of widening access can reduce active participation, stifle open conversation and change the tone of delivery.&nbsp; Additionally, where a session includes group activities, students accessing the recording miss out on opportunities to collaborate, making them assimilative observers rather than more active participants.</p>

<p><strong>Can the universities of today lead learning for tomorrow?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Steve Rycroft; MIT]</em></p>
<p>A new report from Ernst &amp; Young asks if <a href="https://cdn.ey.com/echannel/au/en/industries/government---public-sector/ey-university-of-the-future-2030/EY-university-of-the-future-2030.pdf" rel="nofollow">higher education needs a new paradigm</a> to serve Australia&rsquo;s needs in the Transformative Age, with the authors considering 4 scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Champion</strong>.&nbsp; Universities are strategic national assets, streamlined by transforming service delivery and administration.&nbsp; Most students enrol in traditional degree programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commercial</strong>.&nbsp; Universities are financially independent with closer teaching and research links to industry.&nbsp; Students favour degree programmes that offer work-integrated learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disruptor</strong>.&nbsp; Government deregulates the sector to drive competition, efficiency and expansion into new markets and services. &nbsp;On-demand learning and micro-certificates dominate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtual</strong>.&nbsp; Integration of HE and FE, focused on continuous learning and employability through unbundled digital/online courses as humans begin to be replaced by machines</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, they recommend that all universities should begin to consider their potential to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Embark on double transformation to optimise and grow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the shift from being faculty-focused to learner-centric</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate with industry to co-create and collaborate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-imagine the physical campus for the digital world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unbundle degree programs and the university value chain</p>

<p><strong>Greater contribution to OER will increase benefits</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Improved instructional design compared to face-to-face counterparts, often with support from learning designers or educational technologists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased guidance and triggers as the course environment provides a clear path through resources, activities, and assessments with explicit guidance each step of the way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easier access to learning activities online, allowing more students to engage with these as and when their learning and circumstances needs allow, which may lead to more complete learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individualized learning opportunities according to needs, with automated assessments providing immediate, corrective feedback that directs students to revisit materials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased engagement through social interaction, class discussions, collaboration, etc, which may increase the amount of student-to-student interaction, engagement and motivation</p>

<li>
<p>Greater time on task through intensified student focus on more relevant work through the course website, with analytics accurately tracking student behaviour</p>

<p><strong>And Really Finally&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>This will be my last Digest before I leave the University next month.&nbsp; What began as a short email for about 70 LTS software and web developers back in 2004 survived and evolved over 165 months and an OU Teaching Award into what you see now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m proud of that, and of the fact that I simply got on and did it &ndash; no permission, no reviews, no approvals, just a whole bunch of stuff and a touch of irreverence I thought people would find interesting.&nbsp; My apprentice, Dot Coley, takes over the reins fully next month; she has lots of ideas and I wish her well in delivering them for a further 165 editions.</p>
