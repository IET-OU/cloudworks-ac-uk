        <p>Title ... designing learning forum for CFOs of SMEs</p>
<p>Narrator ... manager in team, support to forum co-ordinator</p>
<p>Situation .. about three years ago, as a help to clients struggling with the economic crisis, we decided to set up a group&nbsp;catering for CFOs in exporting SMEs ... We are a support function for frontline teams dealing direclty with clients and so consulted with these teams as&nbsp;to its value and potential&nbsp;- our own intellegence suggested there was a need and this was confirmed ... we also spoke to some clients and again the usefulness was confirmed ... the question of delivering in a flexible way arose, and provided the&nbsp;basis of our approach &nbsp;.. our project manager has a financial background</p>
<p>Task ...we were seeking to increase our clients knowledge of key financing issues, the options and bodies involved in addressing them (banks, investors etc.) and the toolkit to be used by the target group ie CFOs in exporting SMES; and thus their capacity to address such issues Our test of sucess was numbers attending, nos attending regularily, and satisfaction ratings.</p>
<p>Actions</p>
<p>1 we consulted as to need ... see above ... there was some questioning at first as to the value of yet another forum, but that was addressed as we piloted the approach first</p>
<p>2 we discussed and planned a structure to forum, as follows ...</p>
<p>halfday every month in two locations .. each year a set of themes is proposed by us and agreed with forum members ... themes are cashflow planning, finance for growth, sources of finance and relationships, growth finance, finance for export working capital, etc. ...each session is self-contained and clients can join whicheever monthly session they wish</p>
<p>halfday is introductions, presentattions on months theme, q n a, case study from peer client , discussion of case study, networking opportunities &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 we got a number of key clients to give us feedback in design and help us bring the groups together</p>
<p>4 we started the sessions and now have been runmning them for about three years ...the&nbsp;obvious issue is&nbsp;ensuring the staffing&nbsp;time &nbsp;needed to make it work is allocated</p>
<p>5 we asessed the impact of each session by client feedbvack froms and also by annual survey of what attendees wished to have discussed ... it was sometimes a bit unclear as to what were crtical issues</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>the CFO Network has about 40 to 80 attendees each month, with about 35% being regulars ie attending over half the sessions each year and with client satisfaction bieng high, according to feedback</p>
<p>Reflections</p>
<p>the roles of&nbsp;the curator and of the key clients are very important .... the&nbsp;cyclle of themes worrked, as did the drop-in model ..&nbsp;</p>
<p>while the themes were relatively constant, the content varied in response to client feedback eg we added in a subtheme of hrd in SMEs as many of the CFOs wore the HR hat within their company as well as carrying out the financial role</p>
<p>the use&nbsp;of new technollogy is only now starting, and early days yet to assess</p>
<p>transferrable learning for me&nbsp;is that the&nbsp;flexible dropin&nbsp;model can work ... the question is it just abut transfer of knowledge&nbsp;or has it a role&nbsp;to play in more leadership transformational programs &nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Interesting design narrative Niall that raises some questions about we elicit peer review. Can I ask how you selected your <strong>key clients</strong>?&nbsp; Would you consider them as an elite group?&nbsp; Do you believe they operate in the same "assumptive worlds" as your <em>group&nbsp;catering for CFOs in exporting SMEs?</em></p>        </div>
