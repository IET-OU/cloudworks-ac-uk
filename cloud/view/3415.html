        <p>Notes cut-and-pasted from my blog -<a href="http://dougclow.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/an-overview-of-cloudworks/" rel="nofollow"> original version here.</a></p>
<p>It's Wednesday, so it's another liveblog from an <a href="http://kn.open.ac.uk/public/workspace.cfm?wpid=7034" rel="nofollow">IET  Tech Coffee Morning</a>! Today it's Gr&aacute;inne Conole on  'An overview of Cloudworks'. Much material also available on <a href="/cloudscape/view/2065" rel="nofollow">the Cloudscape  on Cloudworks itself</a>.</p>
<h3><img title="More..." src="http://dougclow.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" />Context</h3>
<p>First, a changing Open University. Big change  from original black-and-white TV broadcasts, to multichannel.  Significant recent activities - OpenLearn,  iTunesU, OLnet, Elluminate for conferencing.  (Some debates on Cloudworks at the moment comparing FlashMeeting and Elluminate.) ReLIVE 08 - SecondLife. And Google Apps. How  does that translate to day-to-day activities of course teams? And what  do they need?</p>
<p>A move towards  student-centred learning, and a blurring of roles between  student/teacher, teaching/learning, content/activities. Much wider range  of media, content, activities, control loci. Learning Design initiative  is trying to understand and support this.</p>
<p>Locating educational approaches against these  along two axes from Teacher-  to Student-centred, and Activity-  to Content-based. Teacher/Content quadrant: e.g. TV broadcast,  lectures; formal, traditional courses. Teacher/Activity quadrant: e.g.  tests; home experiment kits; problem-based learning. Student/Content :  e.g. online resource - learner-defined learning; often  professional/skills development. Student/Activity: co-creating content,  informal web-based learning (amateur photography). Move from standard,  traditional models in at least two directions: means you need new  approaches to design to help teachers make informed choices about  pedagogies and technologies.</p>
<p>Converging  practices - modern technologies (RSS feeds, mashups, micro-blogging, Cloud)  and modern pedagogy. Big gap between promise and reality. E.g. even  Moodle not used to its full potential. Why? Not knowing where to start,  overwhelmed, time, research, benefit, skills, belief; resistance  strategies - say yes/do nothing, undermine initiative/person, do it  badly. Classic mistakes: emphasis on technologies not people/processes,  funding for tech devt  but not use and support.</p>
<p>To  help: adopt a learning design approach. Conceptual tools, collaboration  tools, and visualisation tools. Many developed over the project, taking  forward with course&nbsp;  business models work. Collaboration tools - is mainly Cloudworks, topic  for today. But also resources and activities wrapped round all this lot.</p>
<h3>Cloudworks</h3>
<p>Helping to bridge gap between potential and  actuality. Set up two years ago. Origins in interviews with people in OU  about how they design courses, and how they might use technology more  effectively. Two main findings: (1) they want examples, case studies  where it's worked, preferably in their subject; and (2) they want  someone to talk to - a guide (preferably a 24h available personal one),  people to discuss it with. Web 2.0 technologies look like a good match.  Lots of great case studies online, many ways of engaging and networking  online. But when examined closer, only a very few people were doing it.  Cloudworks aimed to be a social networking site to help academics share  good practice and discuss and debate. Harnessed best of Web 2.0 practice  in to an evolving, growing space, adapting it in the light of user  behaviour.</p>
<p>It's a space for  sharing and discussing learning and teaching ideas and designs.  Technical development and social intervention tied together. Team:  Juliette Culver, Rebecca Galley, Nick Freear.</p>
<p>Aim:  bridge gap between technologies and use. Real issue in skills  development. Theoretical basis is 'social objects' (Flickr, core object  is photo, YouTube video, etc - Engestrom  argues social network is nothing without a shared object to anchor  discussion) and framework for sociality.</p>
<p>In response to the request for case studies  (especially on Moodle), many <a href="/index.php/cloud/view/66" rel="nofollow">case studies (44  of them)</a> commissioned and written up - but when people looked at  them, were not quite what people wanted, not used widely.</p>
<p>Key  concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud - core object. Ideas, design or case  studies, tools or resources, questions or problems.</li>
<li>Cloudscapes  - collections of clouds</li>
<li>Activity streams - dynamic  filters of new activity</li>
<li>Follow and be followed - personal  activity and stream.</li>
</ul>
<p>[Demo/introduction to the site]</p>
<p>Interpersonal  conversation is the most powerful way to transfer knowledge and  expertise. They don't want a 10-page case study. It's specific snippets,  tailored to the audience, and relevant, and personal.</p>
<p>The  idea of the <strong>cloud</strong> is that it's the kernel of an idea - with ways  to augment, expand and discuss. Long decision about whether to make the  original cloud wiki-able; decided not, but people can  extend/expand/discuss below.</p>
<p>Types include current topics,  questions, flash debates, presentations, resources.</p>
<p>Used to  support events - worked effectively at the <a href="/cloudscape/view/1963" rel="nofollow">Learn About Fair</a> this year.</p>
<p>Clouds can belong to more than one <strong>cloudscape</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Cloudstreams</strong> let you see the latest activity on the site.</p>
<p><strong>Follow</strong> (and be followed) - can follow cloudscapes and people.  Helps you filter and signal your interests.</p>
<p>Recent new  features - <a href="/events/events_list" rel="nofollow">events lists</a> and deadlines. Anyone can add to this. Hard to  find a comprehensive list like this for our area anywhere else. Also  added Favourites - will appear on your profile. Expanded user profile -  including reputational score (based on 'like's). Shows clouds and cloudscapes produced, who's  following them, who they follow.</p>
<p>By design, includes multiplicity of trails,  pathways, filters and personalisation  tools - and a notion of serendipity - unexpected discoveries.</p>
<p>Now have viewers from 163 countries, range of  users (e.g. schoolteachers in Argentina giving advice to lecturers in  Canada). Multiple languages - communities in Dutch and Spanish, and two  others (as well as English). Now have facility to make Cloudworks itself  (as opposed to the content) available in other languages, like changing  Facebook. Greek is next up. Possibly German.</p>
<p>Works very  well at events, conferences and workshops. Flash debates also popular;  some very rich. Also eliciting expertise, open reviews, and aggregating  resources.</p>
<p>Often actively  moderated by Gr&aacute;inne - important to success of site.</p>
<p>Used a lot at OU. Some very active for a period of  time, but then quiet; ebb and flow of activities. Also includes  Learning Design work.</p>
<p>Stats: just over 200 registered  users. 57k visits from 160 countries since launch on 1 June 2008 to  date. Much activity from team, but not insignificant from others.</p>
<p>One community moving over from Ning - ELESIG - because Ning closing  down for free.</p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<p>Question: Does a  person who sets up a cloud get seen as the OU's expert on it?</p>
<p>Gr&aacute;inne: They might become seen as that over time  by the community. But no official endorsement. Martin Weller well known as a Web 2.0  guru, OU expert on blogs. It's the community that decides, not an  individual.</p>
<p>Joe (KMi): How real  and how virtual is it? The debate around it becomes an artifact in  itself. It's hard to ask people to do anything extra, and the virtual  space is often seen as extra. But people like doing them anyway. Where  would you position Cloudworks in that 2D space at the beginning?</p>
<p>Gr&aacute;inne: It works in real and virtual space.  Works well as complement to real events - e.g. workshops. People engage  at different levels: majority lurk, discussing is another level - but  e.g. adding a link is a lower-scale input, and has generated more and  wider activity and participation. In terms of Teacher/Student vs  Activity/Content - depends on what you're using it for. Could do it very  Teacher/Content style. Or very open on either or both axes. It's the  design of the activity that matters.</p>
<p>Rob: Worry about the  potential pitfalls of democracy. Very open system. (Deliberate design  decision.) A great virtual. Perennial problem - just because something  is widely thought doesn't mean it's right. Seems that only quality  control is partly commenting, which depends on others doing it.  Reputation, except that doesn't necessarily transfer. Danger if looking  for advice, think someone must know what they're talking about since  they're talking about it. Also, too much information problem, bit put  off the whole thread, just want the small specific thing they're looking  for. Anti-democratic concerns.</p>
<p>Gr&aacute;inne:  This is the reality of modern space. Pandora's box is open and we can't  limit or control things. We can - e.g. Jenkin's digital literacy work  (added in Cloudworks) - part of the new skills is about making  judgements about what's good and bad. Overwhelmingness - H800 students playing in this space,  having debates - some were quite overwhelmed, 'there's just so much'.  But that's the reality. That's why we provide multiple routes through.  Can see the students going through, initially overwhelmed, then finding a  route through, becoming more adept. Everyone is too busy. But people  are going in there - why? Engaging if it's useful and valuable to them,  if it's motivational. Some people will hate it - don't like the look, or  the open-ness. True of all these tools - Facebook, Twitter, etc.</p>
<p>Someone (one of the H800 students!): We do adapt,  we learn to use. But that doesn't discount our initial reaction. We go,  woah, don't like this,  then get in to it and learn. [Yaka-wow happening.] Very new to learning  and teaching, are a real beginner. Like and understand the concept. Are  learning very much at the moment. People use different terminology to  talk about the same thing - e.g. learning design, student-centred  learning - and you're just typing in the wrong keyword!</p>
<p>G:  Another known problem of the current space. No more fixed taxonomies.  That's why serendipity is important.</p>
<p>Graham:  Cloudworks is open at the moment. Going to develop closed versions for  groups?</p>
<p>G: Hot, contended debate. Vision to connect  worldwide, get the connection going. Tend to be very insular at the OU,  and over-cautious. Being open is taking that power to connect. A lot of  people in the OU put off because it's open. Her argument is if you want a  closed space, use a discussion forum or email list. Are going open  source with the product in the summer - which would mean people could do  a closed locked-down version. Wouldn't be surprised if a closed OU  version happens.</p>
<p>H800 student:  Important to become accultured  in to these spaces, really important to be open.</p>
<p>Me: Fan  of both closed and open spaces. Closed spaces can be helpful for people  who are learning and uncertain. [This is a version of my <a href="http://dougclow.wordpress.com/2009/03/20/wild-woods-vs-walled-gardens/" rel="nofollow">Wild  Woods vs Walled Garden</a> point.]</p>
<p>Joe: Not fair to dichotomise closed versus open. There are some aspects  that are not entirely open.</p>
<p>Someone2: An issue about flow  and osmosis between spaces. On a course there might be times where you  do want a lot of closed, trust, confidence - and times when you want to  open up, and flow and interconnect between the two.</p>
<p>G: Also danger of being seen as cliquey. H800 has had standard  discussion forum through, but experimenting throughout-  preference/experience?</p>
<p>H800  student: Some people really busy in the forums, some not. Hers is quiet  today, they're using other tools this week. Hard to comment. Feels a  tension in writing - curious mixture of academic-style paragraphs and  conversation style of writing. And when you don't have time, you need  short sentences. Funny hybrid of writing style, hard to judge, and takes  a lot of time to form an appropriate answer.</p>
<p>G: Problem with all these spaces. Need to find own  style - Gr&aacute;inne's is a  stream of consciousness on her blog. Some people on Twitter have the art  of great well-crafted one-liners, others just splurge out what they're  thinking.</p>
<p>Simon: Seems very community-oriented, but little  collaborative capability with an object, like Wikipedia.</p>
<p>G:  Surprised. Different with e.g. a wiki and a shared culture of changing  the object. Can add to objects, though - very important.</p>
<p>Simon:  Reputation, how's that worked out?</p>
<p>G: Reputation line - you get it  when someone favourites a cloud or cloudscape they created. Gives you a  score of 1 each time. When you recommend a link - moves the link up the  list, and adds 1 to your reputation. Not actively promoted yet, but can  start to see their reputation. Can't yet see what the reputation is  based on, will come, but can also see what each user has  favourited/recommended.</p>
<p>Rob: Link up with ratings from papers from  elsewhere?</p>
<p>G: Yes, don't want to duplicate features.</p>
<p>Paul:  Concern that people will learn to game the system? Groups, like  reference clubs where you all recommend each other's stuff.</p>
<p>G: Always an issue. Happens already across the board. Also the  peer community having enough nous to spot that's going on. Have tight  moderation for spam - if you promote a product you'll soon be kicked  out.</p>
<p>G: Also can migrate content around the site, ideas and  aggregation coming together very quickly. Example of mindmapping. Then  in four different cloudscapes.</p>

                   <p>Just to clarify - ELESIG is not moving over to Cloudworks from Ning. ELESIG uses a range of technology to support our members' activities including Ning, Twitter, pbwiki, DimDim and Elluminate. We are trialling using Cloudworks to run a reading group and link to some of our resources - a small part of what we do. Incidentally, we don't use the Ning free services and hope that we won't be affected by their withdrawal - although we don't have the details yet.</p>        </div>
