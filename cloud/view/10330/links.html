			<h2>Title: Let&rsquo;s play Making Spanish Friends</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong></p>
<p>I was teaching Spanish as an extra curriculum subject to primary children in year one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>I volunteered to teach Spanish to a primary school where one of my children was studying.&nbsp; The school arranged this to be done within the school hours.</p>
<p>The school decided to start with my son&rsquo;s class, year one.</p>
<p>The main teacher divided the whole class in groups of nine or ten children and I had to take one group at a time from their classroom to a different room (usually the music room). The room we had was not a standard classroom, there were few chairs and tables but it had musical instruments and a layout to teach music. There was not a blackboard, nor digital or electronic devices.</p>
<p>The children were eager to learn some Spanish and some of them had been to Spain on holidays before. The children were seeing the whole experience as a kind of game, so I realised that the teaching had to be done as a playful activity. I sat the children on the carpet and in a circle around me. I had 30 minutes session with each group.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>My target was to teach the children some Spanish conversation. As the children are from year one their writing and reading was still developing. So I could not use writing and reading as a supporting medium to teach the foreign language. Everything had to be through oral expression. The children did not know any Spanish, they were total beginners. The children&rsquo;s attention span at that age is quite short and their retention capacity is also limited. Therefore to teach foreign languages at that age you have to do it with actions and role play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to start teaching them to introduce themselves and greet others in Spanish.</p>
<p>I wanted the children to capture not only the linguistic side of the language, but also the social and cultural cues when greeting in Spanish. I knew children are quite quick in picking up these cues. So I also developed some movements and gestures to greet each other. I set up a role play to pretend they were meeting a Spanish child during their holidays in Spain. In the game, they were only allowed to speak in English when they were addressing me, but not among themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>First, I wrote in English the script of a potential greeting conversation among young children, with the Spanish translation beside it. The script had to be for their age level of talking and without introducing too many new words or expressions as they are young learners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key targets to learn were:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>To say hello</li>
<li>To say and ask your name</li>
<li>To ask where do you live or where do you come from</li>
<li>To ask and say your age.</li>
<li>To say good bye</li>
</ol>

<p>For the first section the children were sat in a circle around me. I asked a child to point at one child and say <em>hola</em> and then the other child in return had to say <em>hola. </em>Then the first child will say<em> adi&oacute;s </em>and the second child would say<em> adi&oacute;s </em>too. I asked them to greet moving the hands with passion! This first section made the children giggle and laugh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once all the children knew how to say <em>hola</em> and <em>adi&oacute;s</em> to each other, we moved to the second section. The second section was divided in two stages. For section 2a, first I recited the questions and answers, and I asked the children to repeat them to me together. Then I followed the same process as section 1: I asked a child in the circle to start asking another child the questions in the script (I was saying the question first to help them remember them). And the other child had to answer the questions (again, with me repeating the answering to help them). After that it was his/her turn to ask questions to another child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the children knew how to do section 2a we incorporated section 2b to the game and followed the same process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the final section I divided the group in three subgroups. I followed the same process as for the previous section but this time each subgroup would ask questions to another subgroup (the idea was that there were now three children helping each other to ask the questions to another subgroup and so on and they had to try to remember the questions before asking me).</p>
<p>When the children were able to ask the questions in subgroups, I requested volunteers to do in pairs part or the whole conversation (asking each other questions in front of the whole group). And I asked the rest of children to judge whether it was right or not and to contribute if they knew the answer.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Section one and section 2a were easy to achieve by all children. The difficulty started with section 2b where some children struggled to do all the questions.</p>
<p>The big challenge was for the children to remember the whole of the section 3. When they tried in groups they were able to help but when they volunteered individually in pairs they struggle to remember the whole conversation, however the rest of the group were able to help with bits here and there.</p>
<p>I was pleased to see that the children, after each session, going back to their main classroom and reciting some of the questions they had already learnt with me to the peers or main teacher. It proved that not only they learnt some Spanish conversation but also they enjoyed it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>To keep young children motivated, you have to put a lot of play and actions. When the children lose attention they start to move a lot. So rather than having them sat in a circle perhaps it would have been better to actually create an artificial situation by having the children pretending to be in a street meeting people. Perhaps mixing a bit of drama or acting lesson with foreign language learning and recreate a real meeting situation on the street!&nbsp;</p>			<div class="posted-by">
