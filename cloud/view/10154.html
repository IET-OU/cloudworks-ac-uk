<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[Peter Horrocks; HEA; The Telegraph; BBC]</em></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re too busy to read this short UUK article on <a href="http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/blog/Pages/how-to-reverse-the-decline-in-part-time-study-learn-from-our-overseas-competitors.aspx" rel="nofollow">funding of part-time HE study</a>, the two graphs tell you all you need to know &ndash; the US and Australia seem to have got it right, whereas the UK has not.&nbsp; Although one in five undergraduate students in England currently study part-time, over the last six years the part-time student body has declined by almost 40%.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s hope the Department for Education&rsquo;s consultation on maintenance loans for part-time students in England helps turn things around.</p>
<p>Results from the >HEA&rsquo;s undergraduate engagement survey</a> show that 94% of students report taking responsibility for their own learning and 88% are &lsquo;challenged to do their best work&rsquo;, but just 51% reported that they have strongly developed the skills that ready them for the world of work and will help them get a job, and only 20%, had talked to staff about their career plans.</p>
<p>Scottish education minister John Swinney has announced that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/14/john-swinney-announces-eu-students-will-get-free-tuition-after-b/" rel="nofollow">EU students who win a place at Scottish universities next year will have their tuition funded by the taxpayer even after Brexit</a>, an arrangement that last year cost them over &pound;75m.&nbsp; This funding does not apply to English students but, when pressed as to whether he was discriminating against the English, Swinney said: &ldquo;You have your view, we have ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is rumoured that the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-37921815" rel="nofollow">Scottish Funding Council</a> is set to be comprehensively merged into a new &lsquo;superquango&rsquo;, possibly chaired by a minister, that would oversee Scottish post-16 education, skills and enterprise policy and funding.</p>

<p><em>[Martin Weller; THE; Audrey Watters; Stephen Downes; EdSurge; Martin Hawksey]</em></p>
<p>Microsoft is sponsoring five new edX MOOCs &ndash; developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Michigan and the University of Queensland &ndash; to help guide K&ndash;12 principals, headmasters, superintendents and school leaders through <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/10/12/microsoft-unveils-5-moocs-on-k12-digital-pedagogy-and-leadership.aspx?m=2" rel="nofollow">the challenges and opportunities of digital transformation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37975359" rel="nofollow">Oxford University has announced its first MOOC</a>, to be run on the edX platform. &nbsp;&ldquo;From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development&rdquo; will launch in Feb 17 and will examine the role that governments play in boosting economic development.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blog.edx.org/edx-welcomes-university-edinburgh?track=blog" rel="nofollow">University of Edinburgh has joined edX</a>, with two initial courses: <em>Introduction to Marketing: Tools to Set Enterprises Apart</em> and <em>Statistics: Unlocking the World of Data</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Planet Trump</strong></p>
<p>Well, you know it was a shock when Emily DeRuy&rsquo;s article in the Atlantic on <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/11/donald-trump-on-education/507167/" rel="nofollow">Donald Trump and the Future of Education</a> starts, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be honest; I&rsquo;d pre-written a piece on what a Clinton presidency might mean for education&rdquo;.&nbsp; Statements and comments made during the campaign were so thin and changeable that she finds she is only able to conclude: &ldquo;The short answer to the complicated question about what education looks like under Trump is: No one knows for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip Altbach and Hans de Wit suggest the Trump result could be the first of many shifts to the right as elections loom in France, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria.&nbsp; They do some US crystal ball gazing and predict <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20161110203906750" rel="nofollow">a bleak future for the internationalisation of higher education</a>, particularly as a country that has long been regarded as quite inward looking contemplates erecting yet more metaphorical walls.</p>
<p>So how about tech?&nbsp; Other than calling for a boycott on Apple products (good luck with that), Trump expressed very little in the way of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/11/09/why-technology-may-prevent-trump-from-delivering-on-his-jobs-promise/" rel="nofollow">opinions or plans for technology</a> during his campaign.&nbsp; However, the Washington Post observes that Trump&rsquo;s election success was notably aided by technology (especially social media) but it may now be technology that impedes delivery of his job promise &ndash; as robots, cheaper clean energy, digital tutors, digital doctors, etc, start to mature.</p>

<p>A new report from HEPI, >Remaking Tertiary Education: can we make a system that is fair and fit for purpose?</a> focuses on sub-degree tertiary qualifications, pointing out that despite politicians&rsquo; ambitions and the fact that they are cheaper to deliver than degrees and can have equal or better labour market outcomes, fewer and fewer such qualifications are being awarded.&nbsp; Lead author, Prof Alison Wolf is particularly critical of the number of graduates entering non-graduate occupations and the failure to encourage take-up of tertiary awards through income contingent FE loans.&nbsp; She argues that &ldquo;the government must also act to recreate a national system of sub-degree tertiary awards which can be offered in further education colleges as well as universities&rdquo;.</p>

Lecture capture/recording moves up the rankings to joint third place with Technical infrastructure, linked to the return of Legal/policy issues as a Top 5 challenge, and lack of support staff/specialist skills/resources moves into fifth place.&nbsp; VLEs top the list of centrally supported software and Moodle remains the most commonly used system across the sector, but its coverage is declining, possibly due to rising adoption of alternatives such as Canvas.&nbsp; In second place are e-submission tools, followed by text matching tools (e.g. Turnitin, SafeAssign and Urkund).&nbsp; Formative and summative e-assessment tools both feature, along with asynchronous communication tools.&nbsp; The other key change since 2014 has been the rapid increase in the adoption of document sharing tools and the steady rise of lecture capture tools.</p>

<p>Michael Feldstein reports on <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/the-great-unbundling-of-textbook-publishers/" rel="nofollow">traditional textbook publishers&rsquo; shift from physical to electronic products</a>.&nbsp; He notes that early efforts tended to involve providing extra services and products that were still variants of print (e.g. custom publishing) but there is now a much greater focus on exploiting the affordances of online through offerings such as practice tests, adaptive learning and learning management &ndash; &ldquo;straight ebook conversions of textbooks have never sold very well.&nbsp; What we&rsquo;re really talking about is not analog versus digital but flat content versus interactive educational support&rdquo; and &ldquo;if current trends continue, then textbook publishers will soon find that it no longer makes sense for them to be selling products based on the value of the content&rdquo;.&nbsp; He predicts future growth in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High-end digital products that directly or indirectly improve student outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Related services that help colleges improve student outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Dyson see themselves a problem-solving tech company rather than simply a manufacturer of premium domestic goods and, with that in mind, they have devised a teasing <a href="http://www.thememo.com/2016/10/19/want-a-job-interview-with-dysons-ceo-solve-this-cryptic-video-puzzle/" rel="nofollow">four-stage "ReThinkers" online challenge</a> with the ultimate prize of a job interview with Dyson CEO, Max Conze. &nbsp;Applicants must be about to study, already in further education or a recent graduate and, whilst not everyone will get a job, all those who complete the challenge will have their CVs reviewed by Dyson.</p>
