<p>Too often &nbsp; inquiry-based learning environments introduce curricular topics in an &nbsp; isolated and over-simplified manner. In many cases topics are presented as &nbsp; disconnected from one another, which lead to the constructing of superficial &nbsp; knowledge that lacks integration. When students are introduced to real world &nbsp; problems they have the opportunity to struggle with the complexity of the &nbsp; topics and to engage in thoughtful debates. In this manner students can make &nbsp; connections between various ideas of central topics, develop integrated &nbsp; understanding, and be prepared for future learning.</p>

                   <p>Hi</p>
<p>the problem I see in the PPC is that it doesn't give the opportunity to schedule over weeks/terms/years the activities you plan. It just gives an aggregated time pie chart. How you then divide this up and schedule sessions is maybe for &nbsp;another planning tool. I suspect each stage in the scaffold would require its own PP?? But that then comes back to the issue of topics appearing disconnected. So could you maybe add further boxes under each heading and make it clear that they relate to time sequencing eg label them week 1/week 2 etc?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know the answer!! &nbsp;Maybe there are simpler tools to be used :)</p>

                   <p>Jane,</p>
<p>Very insightful comment, I had this issue as I planned out one learning objective within my business psychology class. Some of the activities for the objectives occurred offline and some were synchronous and the staging of them was important but was hard to reflect within the tool.</p>
<p>Thanks for the response.</p>

                   <p>This is not a direct answer to the question regarding the PPC ... but as I was reading the "<em>The Engage Learners in Complex Projects Principle</em>" for me it is important&nbsp;to consider&nbsp; how you frame&nbsp;a particular&nbsp;problem or "problem space"&nbsp;to be able to then adequately find or define a solution. So, there are&nbsp;often multiple ways to solve a problem&nbsp;...here I found parallels with a design patttern from <a href="http://www.pedagogicalpatterns.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pedagogicalpatterns.org/</a></p>
<p>LARGER THAN LIFE *<br />This pattern was originated by Donald Bagert as the Concept, Glossary, Problem, Analyze, Discuss,<br />Design (CoG-PADD) [DB] pattern and by Joe Bergin with this same name.<br /><br />You have a new concept to introduce that has important high-level characteristics.<br />❊❊❊<br />When faced with a new concept, students often focus on low level details,<br />ignoring its higher-level aspects. Students are able to read, understand, and<br />modify artifacts larger and more complex than they can themselves build. They<br />also need to see problems of a realistic complexity so that they don&rsquo;t get the idea<br />that all problems are small and simple.<br />❊❊❊<br />Therefore give students an example problem or artifact that is too large for<br />them to be able to focus on the details in the time available. Structure the<br />assignment so that they can work effectively with large-scale conceptual or<br />structural knowledge of most of the artifact.<br />Provide a very large artifact that is well structured and well integrated and on<br />which the students will modify a small part. Make sure they must conceptually<br />understand the whole and at an interface level the components, but only the local<br />point of change in detail. It helps to provide a question-answer session in which<br />you focus on the high level content and defer questions on detail. A good initial<br />assignment is to diagram or otherwise explain the artifact. See Explain It Yourself<br />[EBS]<br />❊❊❊<br />This approach allows students to understand a new idea without worrying about<br />the details, to appreciate the concept using a real-world problem example, and to<br />work in small groups to solve a problem, which helps them to quickly understand<br />a new concept. You may also want to give the students an artifact that is too large<br />for them to understand at all unless they work in groups. This leads to GROUPS<br />WORK, of course, if you permit it, as you should. If it has features that cover the<br />entire course and is given early, it may also be a Lay of the Land (JBx).</p>        </div>

                   Steven,

Thank you for that perspective. The larger than life pattern seems to address one of the challenges with trying to engage earners in big picture thinking. I would live to find some larger than life scenarios that have already been created and the learning concepts that they are designed to reinforce.        </div>
