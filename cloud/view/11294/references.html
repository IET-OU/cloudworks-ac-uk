<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[Peter Horrocks; Avril Jameson; Wonkhe; Gill Smith; BBC; The Guardian; University World News]</em></p>
<p>Peter Horrocks continues his funding crusade with a blog post on the UUK site on <a href="http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/blog/Pages/The-real-casualty-of-2012-tuition-fees-shake-up-mature-and-part-time-learners.aspx" rel="nofollow">the plight of mature and part-time learner funding</a>: &ldquo;It is no exaggeration to say that &lsquo;earning while learning&rsquo; is in crisis in England. &nbsp;The roots lie in Labour's reforms but the accelerator was the UK coalition government's decision to slash grants and treble student tuition fees. &nbsp;In the past six years numbers of new part-time students in England have fallen by an extraordinary 56 per cent.&rdquo;&nbsp; When you think of all the column inches and broadcast minutes devoted to the &pound;1,600 cost of a floating duck house a few years ago, it&rsquo;s a crying shame the media doesn&rsquo;t get behind this.&nbsp; If only Peter had some contacts at the BBC&hellip;</p>
<p>The cost of HE is addressed by 2 pieces of recent market research, with <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/sky-data-poll-one-in-three-britons-say-university-not-worth-it-11045812" rel="nofollow">Sky Data</a> finding that 36% of those surveyed (and 53% among 18-24 year olds) feel the cost of university is &lsquo;probably&rsquo; or &lsquo;definitely&rsquo; not worth it for people currently considering applying; 63% think tuition fees should be lowered or scrapped. Separate <a href="http://wonkhe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Does-Cost-Matter-How-the-HE-finance-system-affects-student-decision-making-NEON-Research-Brief.pdf" rel="nofollow">research by the National Education Opportunities Network</a> amongst English final year school students shows over 30% would choose a course based on future earnings rather than their interest in the subject and 40% are likely to choose to live at home, while 57% would widen the range of HEIs they would consider if maintenance grants were available. &nbsp;Costs would also cause 19% to consider studying part time (up from 10% in 20165 and 16% in 2016).&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s hope Theresa May&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20171002142901212" rel="nofollow">review of funding</a> has an arboreal workstream devoted sole to the quest to find a money tree.</p>
<p>Jo Johnson has announced the establishment of the <a href="http://wonkhe.com/blogs/a-new-framework-is-born-meet-kef" rel="nofollow">Knowledge Exchange Framework (KEF)</a>, which aims to reveal and incentivise better performance in this area. &nbsp;KEF will be led by Research England, which will take on the research and innovation activity currently carried out by HEFCE, and will work alongside the Office for Students.&nbsp; Johnson has also asked the QAA to develop guidelines that not only <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41530287" rel="nofollow">clamp down on &lsquo;essay mills&rsquo;</a> but also provide support and engagement with students to make them less necessary or attractive.</p>
<p>The Tech Partnership &ndash; the network of employers collaborating to create the skills for the UK digital economy and the body accrediting degree apprenticeships in the digital sector &ndash; has announced it will <a href="https://www.thetechpartnership.com/news-events/announcement-listing/The-Tech-Partnership-to-cease-operations-in-September-2018/" rel="nofollow">cease operations in Sept 2018</a> because, &ldquo;It has become increasingly clear that collective action by employers on a sector basis is no longer supported in [government] policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The BBC reports on a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/41599034" rel="nofollow">downturn in Apprenticeship popularity</a>, with applications down almost two thirds on the same period last year despite a new funding scheme which started in April.&nbsp; The reporter attributes this to a combination of low pay, with one apprentice shifting from &pound;5.00 per hour to &pound;8.50 by moving to bar work, and dissatisfaction with apprenticeship content: &ldquo;I had to email people and ask for references for jobs, do the filing and the post, answer the phones and do the photocopying.&nbsp; I didn't need a two-year apprenticeship to do that&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/sep/13/two-year-degrees-solution-drop-mature-student-numbers-higher-education" rel="nofollow">Two-year degrees</a> &ndash; announced by Jo Johnson in February &ndash; have so far received a mixed reception, with demand from students and employers, but with some universities arguing that the complexity of three-year programmes mean they cannot readily be adapted.&nbsp; However, others, including London&rsquo;s GSM disagree with chief academic officer Debi Hayes claiming, &ldquo;Mature students want the option of completing degrees in two rather than three years so that they can quickly return to the world of work. &nbsp;This is particularly true among those from less privileged backgrounds&rdquo;.&nbsp; In this Guardian article, she discusses some of the implementation issues they have faced.</p>
<p>Jo Johnson last month signed a <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20170923043523613" rel="nofollow">UK-US Science and Technology Agreement</a> with US Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Judith Garber, marking the first umbrella agreement between both countries.&nbsp; The first project under the agreement includes a &pound;65 million UK investment to increase knowledge on the origin and structure of the universe, and which includes the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), a particle detector in a disused gold mine.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://repository.alt.ac.uk/2373/" rel="nofollow">Design Guide for Open Online Courses</a> (Jennings, Pratt, Schmoller and a cast of thousands) is described as &ldquo;a comprehensive summary of how we went about creating Citizen Maths, an open online maths course and service.&nbsp;&nbsp; The guide shares our design principles and the techniques we used to put them into practice.&nbsp; Our aim is to provide &ndash; with the appropriate &lsquo;translation&rsquo; &ndash; a resource that will be useful to other teams who are developing online education initiatives.&rdquo;&nbsp; The guide is available from the ALT Open Access Repository.</p>
<p>George Siemens and colleagues published their (free) <a href="https://solaresearch.org/hla-17/" rel="nofollow">Handbook of Learning Analytics</a> back in May.&nbsp; Now they&rsquo;ve launched a series of related MOOCs on edX &ndash; see MOOC listings above &ndash; with the longer term aspiration of them leading into a MicroMasters in Learning Analytics through the University of Texas.</p>
<p>The OU's TESSA (Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa) programme will be launching its first MOOC on Mon 30 Oct: <a href="http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/teacher-education-africa/" rel="nofollow">Making Teacher Education Relevant for 21<sup>st</sup> Century Africa</a>. &nbsp;The 4 wks x 4 hrs course is aimed at anyone who works with or trains teachers in Africa, including teacher educators, head teachers, education officers, lecturers, tutors and teachers themselves.</p>

<p><em>[Phoenix New Times; TechCrunch; EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>US for-profit <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/university-of-phoenix-phasing-out-more-campuses-9722920" rel="nofollow">University of Phoenix</a> is phasing out on-campus teaching at around 20 locations, including Detroit, Tucson, El Paso, Albuquerque and San Bernardino, although the University emphasized that "no current student's courses will be affected." &nbsp;The University enrolled around half a million students nationwide in 2010 but, by 2016, this had fallen to around 139,000.</p>
<p>UK-based Curiscope has developed a printed T-shirt (the <a href="https://www.curiscope.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Virtuali-Tee</a>) combined with an AR app which &ldquo;brings anatomy to life with magical illuminating experiences for you, your friends and family&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s yours for just &pound;25.&nbsp; Good idea?&nbsp; Venture capitalists LocalGlobe think so &ndash; they&rsquo;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/curiscope/" rel="nofollow">just invested $1 million</a>.</p>
<p>Varsity Tutors facilitates online tutoring sessions and claims to have more than 30,000 experts on its platform. &nbsp;The US company has raised more than $57 million in recent years and the first step towards its broader global ambitions is the acquisition of UK-based First Tutors, whose online marketplace matches tutors with learners for offline sessions.</p>

<p><strong>What Do OU Students Really Want?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Gill Marshall]</em></p>
<p>The OU is currently investing a great deal of effort in trying to provide the optimum student experience &ndash; and I use &lsquo;optimum&rsquo; here as a synonym for that ultimate and often conflicting cocktail of relevance, satisfaction, success, retention, progression, cost, flexibility, online/offline, solitary/collaborative, etc, etc.&nbsp; Now Martin Weller, as an OU staff member and professor of ed tech, may be a tad biased but he&rsquo;s just completed his OU MA in Art History and so <a href="http://blog.edtechie.net/higher-ed/what-i-learnt-from-being-a-student" rel="nofollow">his blog post on his student experience</a> is worth a read.&nbsp; His advice is not to design for the &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; student, because most OU students are imperfect studiers for a host of family, personal and employment-related reasons.&nbsp; Nor should we aim for wholesale replacement of what we already offer but instead focus on elements that can be steadily improved.&nbsp; But above all, don&rsquo;t forget the small stuff, because:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small stuff is big &ndash; for all the talk of revolutionary pedagogy, personalised learning, disrupted education, what really matters most of the time is the straightforward, everyday matters: do I know what I should be doing at any given time? Can I access the material? Is it clearly written? Can I get support within a reasonable timeframe? Is it set out so I can plan my time effectively?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Increases in Student Workload can Increase Retention</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>Perhaps counterintuitively, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01587919.2015.1055059" rel="nofollow">contrary to recent evidence from the Open University</a>, a report from Civitas Learning claims that <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/10/11/new-data-course-loads-and-persistence" rel="nofollow">increases in course loads can increase the odds of students &ndash; particularly part-timers &ndash; persisting with their studies</a>.&nbsp; Civitas analysed data from roughly 1.4m students at 60 institutions and found, for example, that students who took two courses per term had a median persistence rate that was roughly 15 percentage points higher than their peers who took one course, and this rose by another six percentage points for those taking three courses.&nbsp; The authors also confirmed that full-time students were more likely than part-timers (by an average of 12 percentage points) to persist.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding Part-Time College Students in America</strong></p>
<p><em>[Avril Jameson]</em></p>
<p>A report by <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education/reports/2017/09/06/438341/hidden-plain-sight/" rel="nofollow">the Centre for American Progress</a> highlights the differences in degree completion between FT and PT students in the US, noting that only 4 in 10 PT students return for a second year of study and only a quarter obtain a degree within 8 years, compared with 80% in the FT sector. &nbsp;And, just like the UK, &ldquo;many of today&rsquo;s students ... are older and balancing college with considerable family and work demands. In many cases, that means they can only pursue their studies part-time.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is reported that 37% of US UGs seeking a degree are attending PT and (in stark contrast to the UK) &ldquo;the part-time student population is expected to grow by 18 percent between 2012 and 2023, compared to 14 percent for full-time students&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Enrolment of Online Students at US Non-profits Continues to Grow</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>A small survey of <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2017/09/06/nonprofit-online-enrollment-growing-slowly" rel="nofollow">student enrolment</a> at a dozen US universities offering online or blended offerings has revealed &ldquo;a steady but unspectacular growth [of 3-4% over the past year]&rdquo; according to Babson Survey Research Group&rsquo;s Jeff Seaman.&nbsp; However, the picture is more negative in the for-profit sector, led by the University of Phoenix with a decline of nearly 40%.&nbsp; A Penn State spokesman attributed declines to increasing competition from high quality providers.&nbsp; Enhancing student services and support (such as 24/7 helpdesk) can also pay dividends, with one director of policy noting that, &ldquo;An online student who experiences a malfunction on Friday night doesn&rsquo;t want to wait until Monday morning for a technician on campus to fix it&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Online Courses Consume More Academic Time Than F2F </strong></p>
<p><em>[Avril Jameson]</em></p>
<p>An Australian survey looking at the workload of just over 2,000 academics provides evidence that <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1360080X.2017.1354773" rel="nofollow">online teaching is more time consuming than traditional face to face equivalents</a>. &nbsp;Findings showed the median time taken to plan a 1 hour lecture was 10 hours for online courses compared with 8 hours for a traditional lecture. &nbsp;Other activities such as tutorial planning, review and updating of teaching materials and student consultation were also longer for online compared with face to face teaching. &nbsp;Additionally, the study found no evidence that younger, and supposedly more tech-savvy, academics were quicker than their older counterparts in undertaking tasks relating to online teaching.</p>

<p><strong>Welcome Aboard for Online Students</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Mark Lieberman reports how US HEIs have adopted a wide <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2017/09/13/orientation-programs-set-online-learners-success" rel="nofollow">range of approaches to welcoming online students</a> and setting them up for academic success. &nbsp;Some begin with a short online course that covers the key technical aspects, study skills, support mechanisms, etc, whereas others favour a face-to-face orientation experience. &nbsp;Others use webinars, such as Excelsior College who discovered these were more effective a few days into the course rather than at the start because, by then, many students had started to realise what they didn&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; In addition to delivery methods, there are also numerous permutations of total duration, session duration and session spacing &ndash; and these vary not just between institutions but also between subjects and programmes at the same institution.</p>
<p>In a recent survey of nearly 25,000 US college students, those who had <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2017/09/14/study-positive-first-year-orientation-impacts-overall-student-experience.aspx" rel="nofollow">a positive experience with their first-year orientation</a> were 17% more likely to report a positive student life experience. &nbsp;The study also found that 25% of PT students did not participate in orientation, compared to 9.5% of full-timers, and across all age groups and institution types, students reported that time management was their biggest challenge, with coursework in second place.</p>

<p><strong>And Finally&hellip;</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://everynoise.com/engenremap.html" rel="nofollow">Every Noise at Once</a> presents an algorithmically-generated scatter-plot of the musical genre-space, based on data tracked and analysed for 1536 genres by Spotify. &nbsp;Compiler Glenn McDonald explains, &ldquo;The calibration is fuzzy, but in general down is more organic, up is more mechanical and electric; left is denser and more atmospheric, right is spikier and bouncier.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure what problem it solves or how often I&rsquo;d return to the site, but it was fun exploring for a while.</p>
<p>Slightly less taxing is this clip from the BBC archive: in 1976, Blue Peter showed <a href="https://t.co/PRFxeYlAIf" rel="nofollow">a phone with no cable that you could even take outside</a> (although I couldn&rsquo;t get it to play in IE11).</p>
