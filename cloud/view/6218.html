<p>Three-scene <a title="sbL4L" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">storyboarding</a> is a narrative method for enabling learning for living.&nbsp; It is true that a good many people see learning as a route to looking good in competition, but storyboarding gives more time to the exploratory journey that brings deeper meaning and wider purpose to narrow competitiveness.&nbsp; It is designed to be useful to schools, colleges and community-based agencies eager to grasp opportunities for expanding their learning programmes.</p>
<p>It calls on people&rsquo;s memories of the experiences which might influence their plans - including career plans.&nbsp; It invites them into a process of reflection on those experiences, and sets up a framework for working on useful and sustainable action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a distinctive set of assumptions: experience is at least as persuasive as expertise, a biography is more than a chronicle, a case study is not a narrative, meaning is different from facts and factors.&nbsp; With these ideas three-scene storyboarding sets out to enlarge helping repertoires - and the range of helpers in a position&nbsp; to engage with them.</p>
<p>________________________</p>
<p>It is based on a scene-by-scene filmic <a title="sbformat" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbformat.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">format</a>.</p>
<p>That means that people can work...</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using a combination of words and images<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seeing one&rsquo;s self both as individual and with others<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interweaving thoughts and feelings<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inviting a person to be a witness to his or her own life<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; planning what to do</p>
<p>All of this is attributing meaning to experience, and drawing on that meaning to find purpose in action.&nbsp; It is not dealing with same-for-everybody truths, it is a way-of-seeing personal meaning.&nbsp; It cannot replace fact-and-factor diagnosis and information, but it can usefully supplement them.&nbsp; A starting-point conversation might open up along the lines...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;</em><em>I doubt that I need tests or data-bases...<br />show me what will help me sort things out in my own terms?</em><em>&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>The free-to-download <a title="sbformat" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbformat.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">format</a> is one-page, simple and portable.&nbsp; It sets out an episode in three scenes:</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;opening scene&rsquo;: </strong>the way things were<br /><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;big scene&rsquo;: </strong>when things might be changed<br /><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;following scene&rsquo;:</strong> whether and how things became different</p>
<p>The episode is a turning-point - a time which is especially on a person&rsquo;s mind, causing some thinking again...&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;</em><em>something's nagging me...</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>...should do something about it?</em><em>&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>The big scene shows that &lsquo;something&rsquo;.&nbsp; The opening and following scenes are the&nbsp; before-and-after comparisons - setting out contrasts in how the person went into this episode and how that person came out it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That three-scene format can open up possibilities for a change-of-direction in life.&nbsp; The opening scene need not predict the following scene.&nbsp; That realisation is a requirement for the kind of ready-for-anything flexibility that contemporary life now entails.&nbsp; It is also an educator&rsquo;s best hope of enabling social mobility.&nbsp; If storyboarding can support developments like these it will prove to be a significant expansion of life-relevant learning.</p>
<p>________________________</p>
<p>A turning-point experience can be something that happens around the person, or something the person makes happen - expressed by passive or active verbs.&nbsp; It might entail luck, surprise, loss, gain, or encounter.&nbsp; Only narrative can tell of such things.&nbsp; The telling of them could cover remembered seconds, minutes or hours.</p>
<p>The setting might be at home, on the street, or in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; It can be while watching tv, on-line, reading or in conversation.&nbsp; It can also be away somewhere - maybe on a course or an experience-of-work visit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It carries the possibility of a change in how a person sees things - a newly found point-of-view, perhaps widening horizons.&nbsp; It may well conjure feelings of hope or anxiety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this is set down in three scenes&nbsp; it&nbsp; can provoke curiosity - a&nbsp; wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&nbsp;</em><em>&lsquo;</em><em>why did I...?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>why didn</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em>t I...?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>suppose I were to...?</em><em>&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Trialing suggest it works well when people physically draw the scenes and write in the thought and speech bubbles.&nbsp; Le Corbusier makes the point...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;</em><em>I prefer drawing to talking - drawing is faster - and allows less room for lies</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>But cutting-and-pasting images, with speech and thought bubbles overlaid, also works.</p>
<p>If people will let a helper see what they set down they are inviting that helper into a conversation that they have set up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if a person has not changed course, that conversation is still about a turning-point - though, now, for a direction not taken.&nbsp; That may be fine, yet it is still worth talking about.&nbsp; When it comes to attributing meaning to experience nothing is certain...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;</em><em>are things not working out as I thought they might?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>do I have to leave them the way they were?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><br />'<em>what about taking another look?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em> </em></p>
<p>Storyboarding brings that possibility of change-of-mind to the centre of the story.&nbsp; Such reflectiveness is necessary to any idea of flexibility - in work or in any other area of life.</p>
<p>________________________</p>
<p>The process is developed from the format.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>Each of the three scenes is created in a three-phase process of 'remembering', 'showing' and 'futuring'...</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>remembering: </strong>gathers memories and sorts them into what makes this a turning-point, and - then - what belongs to the opening and following scenes<br /><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; showing:</strong> focuses what is significant in the story and graphically designs how each of these features belongs to the three scenes<br /><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; futuring: </strong>sets out what a person can do about it - where that will be, who will be there, and what task is to be taken on</p>
<p>It can be a take-away process - maybe something to check out with others, and bring back for more to-and-fro questioning, reflection and re-drafting.</p>
<p>A helper&rsquo;s open questions enable the process.&nbsp; The conversation works well when there is more than one way of seeing things...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;</em><em>so what else could be going on here?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>should I take another look?</em><em>&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Storyboarding is an invitation to look around and ask what that &lsquo;what else?&rsquo; might be.&nbsp; And a useful story has a lot of places to look...</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>people:</strong> protagonist, antagonists, groups, relationships, encounters<br /><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; places: </strong>familiar, unfamiliar, feeling &lsquo;at home&rsquo;, feeling &lsquo;at odds&rsquo;<br /><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talk:</strong> soliloquy, conversation, thoughts-and-feelings, agreement, conflict<br /><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; events: </strong>routine, continuation, luck, loss, gain, surprise, 'eye-openers'<br /><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meanings:&nbsp;</strong> worth doing, worth having, worth listening to</p>
<p>Looking around like this means not settling for what first occurs...&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;</em><em>wait a bit...</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>why did I ask that in the first place?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>did I expect a different answer?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>is that what</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em>s getting me stuck?</em></p>
<p>Daniel Dennett (2003) argues for the kind of complexity that can find other ways-of-seeing.&nbsp; His modelling shows that we increase our repertoire by evolving more ways of dealing with what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; The more ways we have of visualising experience, then the more ways we have of making sense of it - and figuring out what to do about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So complexity is not necessarily a problem, it can be the beginning of a solution.&nbsp; It crops up in what&nbsp; Porter Abbott (2002) calls a rounded story.&nbsp; While a flat story just carries people along, a rounded story draws them in.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s enough in the story to wonder what is really going on, and what else might be done about it.&nbsp; And that means that there is more than one way of sorting things out.&nbsp; It offers more levels of engagement with the narrative - always taking one thing with another.</p>
<p>________________________</p>
<p>It also sets up a different dynamics.&nbsp; In storyboarding the format is the structure, but the dynamic is an &lsquo;arc&rsquo; - the movement from where things got started to where they wind up.&nbsp; In storyboarding the arc is in the sequence of opening scene, big scene, following scene.&nbsp; Dynamics show how the features of the story bump into each other.&nbsp; The more bumping, the more complexity, the more possibilities, the more dynamics...</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>sequencing:</strong> one thing leading to another, explaining things, anticipating things<br /><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; points-of-view: </strong>other people having their say, forming habits-of-mind, disagreeing, favouring certain directions<br /><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turning-points:</strong> re-patterning how things are seen, letting go of habits, suggesting new possibilities, finding new purposes<br /><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change-of-mind: </strong>holding on to some things, letting go of others, feeling some anxiety, maybe mixed with hope</p>
<p>A dynamic story invites you to look under the surface of things.&nbsp; It has its own kind of &lsquo;what-happens-now&rsquo; edginess, and &lsquo;why did she do that&rsquo; puzzlement, and &lsquo;anything-could-happen&rsquo; meaning.&nbsp; But flat stories whizz along at such a rate that people cannot see, or care, about...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;</em><em>why did he...?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>yet didn</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em>t she say...?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>and if that happened surely he...?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>but shouldn</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em>t she have told him that...?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>and wouldn</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em>t that mean he can</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em>t...?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>or else...?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>so what if....?</em><em>&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>You can find more answers to such questions in a rounded story.&nbsp; Nothing is inevitable - Daniel Dennett calls it 'evitability'.&nbsp; This is not fact-and-factor. knowing, it&rsquo;s why-bother meaning.</p>
<p>________________________</p>
<p>Perhaps the most useful feature of a cinematic format is that a movie can be re-screened.&nbsp; And some movies are well worth seeing more than once.&nbsp; It often feels quite different the second time round.&nbsp; And different again the third.&nbsp; A storyboard allows a person to do that - because the person is not just a protagonist in the story, he or she can be an audience.&nbsp; Maybe again and again.&nbsp; This is becoming a witness to one&rsquo;s own life.</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;</em><em>okay, that</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em>s how I saw it then...</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>but now I look again...</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>it</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em>s like the first time I</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em>ve really seen it...</em><em>&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>It seems that constructive motivation is more likely to be stoked where people can take that &lsquo;onlooker&rsquo; perspective&nbsp; (Noelia Vasquez and Rolf Buehler, 2007).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The filmic format expands the prevalent concept of &lsquo;self&rsquo; - there is an &lsquo;I&rsquo; and there is also a &rsquo;me&rsquo;.&nbsp; And three-scene storyboarding engages a person as both the subjective 'I am', and as the predicated 'is that really me?'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engaging these complex, dynamic and predicated features of narrative supports what Jen Lexmond and Richard Reeves (2009) see as <a title="Lexmond&Reeves" href="http://www.demos.co.uk/files/Building_Character_Web.pdf?1257752612" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mindfulness</a>.&nbsp; It is stop-and-look attention which resists distraction, focusses concentration and sees things to completion.&nbsp; This is as much a personal attitude as an intellectual skill - engaging both thought and feeling.&nbsp; Such application of self is increasingly understood to be a condition for effective planning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>________________________</p>
<p>Storyboarding is not the only use of narrative in careers work.&nbsp; Constructivism calls on narrated experience.&nbsp; Alongside constructivism, storyboarding is less about expertise-based diagnosis, and more about experience-based conversation.&nbsp; It&nbsp; adds to the repertoire by modelling a process of questioning...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;</em><em>am I taking on board other points-of-view?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>am I taking one thing with another?</em><em>&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;</em><em>am I taking nothing for granted?</em><em>&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>The professional aim is to enable people to get into the habit of asking their own questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works with expert diagnostics - the helpers who engage can usefully be trained in psychology which understands personality. &nbsp; But this work also needs help from sociology which understands alliances, history which understands sequence, geography which understands location, literature which understands conversation, drama which understands narrative, design-technology which understands creativity, and mentoring which understands the locality.</p>
<p>None of this means that storyboarding cannot help a person make a competitive pitch for selection.&nbsp; This kind of help may well be among a person&rsquo;s best hope of surprising selectors with something distinctive and compelling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, most of all, it works with students and clients by handing to them a format and process to take away for their own use - not just today and tomorrow, but life-long and life-wide.</p>
