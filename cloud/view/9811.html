        <p><strong>Title</strong><em>:&nbsp;</em>A Neighbourhood Watch Meeting</p>
<p><strong>Narrator&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I was the teacher of a multilingual adult class who were learning English as a second language.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>This lesson occured a few weeks ago in a classroom where I teach English as a second language. The class was an intermediate level of multilingual students from various countries around the world and who all wanted to improve their English.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>I first taught some vocabulary in relation to crime and punishment. I then set up a Neighbourhood Watch meeting in which each student was given a role to play such as 'a resident', 'a local MP', 'local chief of police' etc. The students had to role-play the meeting and try to come up with 5 solutions to stop the increase of crime in their neighbourhood. The measure of success was that they could all agree on 5 solutions and thus improve their fluency.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>I frst elicited the meaning of some vocabulary to do with crime such as 'mugging', 'pickpocketing' etc. I then set up the debate giving each student a character to play. While the students were doing the role-play I sat aside and made notes of any problems in relation to pronunciation, vaocabulary and grammar. At the end of the task I gave the students feedback based on my notes.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>An unexpected outcome was that at first the studetns didn't initiate the meeting by asking each other questions and communicating. I had to then dictate when it was each student's turn to talk.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>On reflection, I now understand that I should have got each student to introduce themseleves just like what would happen in a real life meeting. I feel this would have opened up the role-play and got them talking from the outset and furthermore would have represented a more authentic real life meeting scenario.</p>

                   <p>Hi Alain,</p>
<p>I definitely appreciate your experience of expecting the students to start speaking in an activity spontaneously but then needing extra prompting! &nbsp;I really enjoyed reading about your experience teaching this topic too!</p>
<p>This made me reflect a little on the aims of your activity too that I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on - in terms of more functional language (agreeing / disagreeing, giving an opinion, making a suggestion, etc), was that also something you planned to faciliate use of / teach here, or was that something explored previously? &nbsp;</p>
<p>And most importantly,,,did they all reach agreement? :)</p>
<p>Nathan.</p>

                   <p>Hi Alain</p>
<p>Role play is definitely a great design narrative that can be used again and again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know too, as an English teacher that ideally there is quite a lot of thought and preparation needed in facilitating this, such as handing out role play cards etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching the topic of crime and punishment set up the perfect scenario for such a role play and as you say you realised afterwards you could have done something &lsquo;better&rsquo; or differently.&nbsp; However, having written about it and having posted your reflections helps other teachers to realise its complexities and so plan beforehand exactly how they can achieve their objectives. Thank you!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Alain</p>
<p>Role play is very difficult to implement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students don't always engage</li>
<li>There is always one person who takes over</li>
<li>Preparation is key</li>
<li>Trying to think of a topic that will interest everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my lecturers came up with a fantastic example of role play.&nbsp; One student made a jam sandwhich, one gave a commentary to the other students, whilst other students had to critique the final outcome!&nbsp; Very funny and interesting, almost Master Chef.</p>
<p>Did all of your students understand the concept of neighbourhood watch?&nbsp; I should imagine it was a little stilted prompting students to communicate, but great fun.</p>

                   <p>I like your design narrative Alain.&nbsp; Role play is something that my teacher of French used to do often. It was a creative way of learning and practising a language.&nbsp; However, most of the times the teacher herself had to get involved in order for the discussion to start.&nbsp; Some students participated a lot, when some others didn&rsquo;t take part at all as they found the whole things not interesting or they were shy.&nbsp; I agree with Susan and Elizabeth that it is a way of teaching that needs to be planned in advance and needs careful preparation.</p>        </div>
