        <p>Increasing ownership and use rate of mobile devices have started to challenge schools to introduce these devices in to their teaching activities. Therefore, lately, education institutions have started to embrace tablets to increase the effectiveness and the quality of education provided while reducing the costs. However, while technology re-creates itself every day, the slow acceptance rate in schools prevents educators from reaching the desired level of success. In order to understand the reasons behind the slow acceptance rates or resistance to technological change in schools, it is important to understand end users&rsquo; (teachers and students) behavioural intentions towards accepting and finally adopting technology as the success is determined by their acceptance behaviour (Straub, 2009). As Fichman (1992, p.203) emphasizes;</p>
<p>The relative lack of attention to individual adoption of technologies is unfortunate because, while the organization as a whole makes the initial adoption decision for such technologies, the actions of individual adopters (e.g., how enthusiastically they embrace the innovation) can be expected to have a large impact on the implementation process.</p>
<p>Because the literature is very limited in understanding the students and teachers behavioural intentions towards technology and specifically to tablets, I believe my research will contribute by providing understanding in to this matter. Moreover, the limited research on tablets have mainly been conducted in more technologically advanced countries (Gogus, Nistor &amp; Lerche, 2012), where the infrastructure is ready, and these findings are not necessarily applicable to so-called less developed regions of the world. Therefore, in my research, I aim to understand students&rsquo; and teachers&rsquo; behavioral intentions towards tablets in Turkish secondary schools while identifying and understanding the core factors underlying acceptance. An ongoing project, which aims to provide a tablet for each student, carried out by the Turkish Ministry of National Education, named Movement to Increase Opportunities and Technology or the Fatih Project is the selected site for this study. The research adopts a model-based approach where the model serves as a guide in exploring students&rsquo; and teachers&rsquo; behavioral intentions towards tablets, while qualitative research also conducted to gain insight in to the use of tablets. The UTAUT2 model is adopted from consumer context and modified to suit the needs of educational contexts. This research is a work in progress and data analysis is still ongoing.</p>
<p>The theme of the workshop is especially relevant to my interests and area of research. As the workshop will take place in Kazakhstan-another developing nation, it will help me to ascertain, develop and compare the conceptions and strategies while exploring possible challenges another so-called less developed country may face in implementing mobile learning.</p>
<p>Also, as this workshop will bring together early career researchers from different institutions with similar interests, it is an exceptional opportunity for me to meet other researchers at different stages of their careers while having an opportunity to discuss and develop new ideas on my research. I believe this workshop will help me to look at my research from different aspects. I also believe the workshop will provide new insights into the approaches, issues, challenges, policies and possibilities on mobile learning. Therefore, it will be an invaluable experience for my personal and professional development.</p>
