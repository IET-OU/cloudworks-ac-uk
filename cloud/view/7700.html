        <p>I didn't really get this but spent a lot of time trying to understand. I found some of the instructions/ advice contradictory and couldn't figure out what a concern was and how it differed from a force until I had spent really 2 or 3 hours reconfiguring things. The thinking through was useful in that it helped me think about additional personas or actors in this project and therefore additonal challenges. But as with "rich pictures" in soft systems I just don't find this useful or natural to do. Anyway, I have uploaded a Force Map to google docs. Don't know how to embed here so see link.</p>
<p>Hoping for more success with this week's challenge and lots of help from my team mate.</p>    </div>

                   <p>Jane</p>
<p>I really like all the work that you have put into this. I can't pretend that I understand the Force map, but the personas and the breakdown that you offer for each of the "person" is excellent.&nbsp; I think the areas that a situated learning/ecology of resources [EoR] design perspective adds to this is concerning the social, intentional and beliefs/assumptions section. And importantly, that the EoR approach is a participatory model, it's not just the designer's input.</p>
<p>I've included the link here http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7754</p>
<p>Also, I'm interested in your comment relating to who is responsible for "study skills". I'm going to have to think about this because the skills that we've been talking about are embedded in practice and again if they're taught as discrete skills a lot of people fail to make the link. Again this is linked to identity and practices in a community of practice. In relation to developing "functional skills" ( i think that's the new name for basic skills &amp; keyskills, it's called essential skills in NI) there are 3 models that can be adopted by an organisation: discrete - where a literacy or numeracy specialist is responsible for teaching the skills, fully embedded - where a vocational tutor is responsible for teaching the skills as they are embedded in their course/context and then there is a combined model - where a specialist works alongside the vocational tutor, thus complimenting each other and helping the learner to make the connections between the functional bits embedded in the vocational practice whilst at the same time making the identity links to practice and gradually makinhg the transition from peripheral participation to a fully fledged member of the community of practice in question. This third model is dynamite, in my opinion.</p>
<p>oh, just going back to the figure of 260,000 for #edcmooc, if you got that from me, I don't think it's right. Apparently, the Edinburgh Uni sent out an email to survey their Coursera Mooc participants. They've got abround 5 courses, so possibly 260,000 is the total for all 5.</p>        </div>

                   <p>That's a great map, Jane. You've got a clear and thorough context for your learners there. But not easy to understand without the context of the other documents - personas, concerns, factors etc. It's a function of what seems to me a long winded process. &nbsp; I don't think I find it particularly helpful to spend such a long time on this one aspect.&nbsp; But perhaps that's because I know my learners very well, as most of my course are aimed at the same people. I do like to talk to and interview the learners to help get the personas clear in my head with all these factors and concerns.</p>
<p>I too think that Coursera were quoting signups for all of their MOOCs not just edcMOOC.</p>

                   <p>Hi Helen(s)</p>
<p>Thank you both for the kind feedback and the encouragement. I think I did really waste too much time on this and consequently am now catching up on the important reading I would have been better doing. I also agree that the force map means nothing without the attached keys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relieved that the 260K refers to all MOOCs - I was beginning to get agoraphobia just thinking about it....</p>
<p>Just going back to Helen C's point about study skills and who is responsible etc. It was a decision on our course going back many years to have a distinct module to support transition to University through teaching of a variety of professional/research/study skills but I am not convinced this is the right way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am definitley moving more towards the third way, and I hop this is what the design process will help me develop.</p>
<p>Thanks again mates!</p>
