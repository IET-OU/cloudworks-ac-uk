        <p>I am interested in exploring how best to support workbased learners&nbsp;in developing and&nbsp;keeping apace with&nbsp;ICT skills. I have extensive experience of designing skills activities&nbsp;across a degree ( the OU Social Work degree). One of the challenges has been how to meet the requirements for the 3 different care&nbsp;councils&nbsp; Wales, Scotland and England. It isn't surprising that the goal posts have already shifted in one nation. So one of the challenges I am engaged in is:</p>
<p>1. How can we design approaches which are as far as possible future-proof or, at the very least , flexible?</p>
<p><em>Post-qualifying / Masters level skills - what should they be?<br /></em>Secondly, I am engaged in developing skills activities for CPD courses (Continuing Professional Development), in particular for post-qualifying social work students, leading potentially to a Masters degree.</p>
<ul>
<li>What skills are appropriate at this level? </li>
<li>What kinds of activities are going to be most effective at motivating work-based learners to develop these?&nbsp;Can generic activities be effective, decontextualised from a work-setting?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Possible solution?<br /></em>On the Social work degree Information literacy skills were closely integrated with ICT skills because many aspects were interrelated and interdependent ( for instance, working online, locating and saving and organising information, using the right tool for the job, shared software functionality, etc.). I am considering designing activities which ask&nbsp;the learner to research (using their information literacy skills):</p>
<ul>
<li>examples of technologies in use in work settings </li>
<li>examples of how these technologies are being used, including benefits/shortcomings&nbsp;for service users</li>
</ul>
<p>The learners will then be able to discuss these in communicative activities eg. forums and share ideas or experiences in practice, with a view to identifying skills to develop further themselves.</p>
<p>2. Do&nbsp;CPD level&nbsp;students need directed skills development activities or do they just need to be given clear rationales and guidance, to follow up&nbsp;independently if they&nbsp;wish?</p>
<p>I've undertaken research with colleagues into how workbased students have found ICT and IL skills development when it was integrated within&nbsp;a degree (see the <em><a title="Prepared for practice research project" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/pbpl/activities/details/detail.php?itemId=499c305d56f6d" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prepared for practice</a></em> PBPL CETL funded&nbsp;project). I wanted to identify if graduates felt adequately prepared for the skills they would use in work practice. Interestingly some graduates felt so confident in practice that they in fact were&nbsp;engaged in&nbsp;challenging ICT practices and wanting to help shape or change them.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;am curious to compare their experiences with other students', including those who instead were directed to separate skills activities, disassociated from the work /discipline context, perhaps treated as a separate module altogether. Did their confidence levels manifest themselves&nbsp;in the same ways?</p>
<p>To this end I am working on&nbsp;the<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/eaddlsproject/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> EADDLS&nbsp;project</a>&nbsp;- Evaluating Approaches to Developing Digital&nbsp;Literacy Skills. We've put in place reflective quiz activities on three modules to capture responses which include free text, and have interviewed 18 students to explore what factors motivate them to engage in skills development, what their views are about context-giving as opposed to generic information within activities, and will be analysing our data to identify how this impacts on learning design considerations. Although our funding runs from May 2011 to Dec 2012 we expect our analysis will run beyond this time scale, especially as have designed it so that we can gather longitudinal data from the selected modules on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;How have others made skills development meaningful and motivating?</p>
<p>It would be interesting to hear your stories.</p>    </div>
