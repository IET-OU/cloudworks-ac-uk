    <div class="user-entry">

        <p>Well I&rsquo;m still hanging in to the OLDS MOOC (sort of!). I&rsquo;m continuing to adopt a &ldquo;Make Your Own MOOC&rdquo; approach by being very selective about the learning activities and by picking &amp; remixing which perhaps suits the theme of the week. I wasn&rsquo;t able to keep pace with the day-to-day scheduled activities (which makes me feel I&rsquo;m lagging behind the conversation) but I guess it&rsquo;s a question of better late than never.</p>
<p>This week it&rsquo;s been all about OERs, something I already know a little about from <a href="http://elearningtoolkit.pbworks.com/w/page/51946988/Open Educational Resources (OERs)" rel="nofollow">gathering OERs</a> quite recently. However, I&rsquo;m keen to learn more about them as their potential for enriching learning and reducing course development time is certainly appealing. To give some focus to this week&rsquo;s activities, I pestered/asked our IT Online course developers for some topics which I then ran through various OER engines. (My cunning plan here was to try to whittle down some of the many OER repositories now available to get a clearer idea of which ones seemed to hold most promise for potential use by our group.)</p>
<p>So bearing in mind that I&rsquo;m looking for software development-related OERs (for modules in Object-Oriented Development &amp; Distributed Systems), the following is my unscientific &ldquo;first impression&rdquo; of those that seem to offer the most worthwhile investment of time:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a>: As you&rsquo;d expect, there&rsquo;s no problem yielding multiple videos on software related topics. Of course, there will be a range of quality presented but for technology-related video tutorials that could be linked out to from a course, it&rsquo;s about as current as you will get. I&rsquo;d recommend cross checking against this custom <a href="http://www.google.com/cse/home?cx=009190243792682903990:e40rcqv1bbo" rel="nofollow">OCW+OER Google search engin</a>e, which seems to generate good quality YouTube results.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://cnx.org/" rel="nofollow">Connexions</a>: I knew of this repository but explored it further in response to Itana Gimenes comments, as she spoke well of it based on proper research. I found there seemed to be a good range of technology related OERs available but on the downside, it seems to offer primarily text-based content (although I&rsquo;ve seen some nice, simple animations within that). What I&rsquo;ve seen so far looks promising, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cnx.org/content/m17309/latest/" rel="nofollow">Design Patterns for Sorting</a></li>
<li><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cnx.org/content/col10213/latest/" rel="nofollow">Principles of Object-Oriented Programming</a></li>
<li><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cnx.org/lenses/swong" rel="nofollow">Design Patterns</a></li>
</ul>
<p>3. <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" rel="nofollow">MIT Open CourseWare</a>: This highly-navigable site (love the straightforward Course Finder navigation) is certainly trustworthy for IT/software related subjects, which is major plus for us. Creative Commons (CC) course materials available there include lecture notes, simple lecture-based video, and activities/assignments such as labs, projects and exams. Here's one example of a <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-824-distributed-computer-systems-engineering-spring-2006/" rel="nofollow">Distributed Computer Systems Engineering Course</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>4.<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/download/" rel="nofollow"> iTunes U</a>: Very current range of content from leading universities, not all CC but certainly worth investigating.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm" rel="nofollow">MERLOT</a>: Nice clear rating system, which could be helpful for evaluating materials and this site makes it easy to select particular media types. Perhaps not as much choice for IT subjects or as up to date as would be ideal.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.temoa.info/" rel="nofollow">Temoa</a>: Appealing interface and it&rsquo;s good to see another respository that makes it particularly easy to search based on a particular media type.</p>
<p>As you can tell from the above, currency of content is particularly important in this fast-moving discipline, which is probably one of the reasons why YouTube often turns out to be particularly helpful. In my experience, it&rsquo;s probably the first place that many techies (and teachers of techies) will use to share tutorials on up-and-coming technologies.</p>
<p>I did look at a number of other repositories that were suggested this week, such as Jorum &amp; Leeds Met. I found that even using the (limited) filter &amp; advanced search options that were available with these repositories, I got some pretty random results and/or ended up with really too many search results for viable exploration. This is a pity as there may well be good material there but I couldn&rsquo;t take the risk of wading through lists of pages without knowing what I&rsquo;ll end up with at the end. Maybe I got them on a bad day&hellip;</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;m not for a second claiming that I&rsquo;ve done an exhaustive evaluation of repositories and I would love to hear from anyone who has any suggestions on further sites that are particularly good for software engineering/computer science type subjects. To my mind, being able to find relevant content relatively quickly is essential for effective and regular use of OER repositories. It could be the difference between finding exactly what you need or abandoning a search and putting a lot of (perhaps unnecessary) time &amp; effort into creating something from scratch.</p>    </div>
