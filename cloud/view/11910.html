        <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Digitalisation transforms our society in manifold ways and a profession such as Social Work needs to respond to these transformations. Likewise, social work education needs to revisit its curricula and teaching methods. However, the speed at which transformations are happening is often overstraining the capabilities of innovation, adoption and implementation of educational institutions and their stakeholders (Davis et al., 2018). This is especially the case for a discipline like Social Work with a rather uneasy relationship with technology (Taylor, 2017).</p>
<p>My project addresses this complex challenge by implementing a playground learning environment into social work bachelor and master curricula. This playground learning environment is directed towards a twofold purpose: it (a) equips students with skills and competences for their professional practice in the digital world and (b) allows teachers to gain experiences with education technology as well as rethinking their roles as guides and facilitators. Both learning experiences are as crucial as they are challenging (Adams Becker et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Setting a playground learning environment apart from the core topics and related skills and competences of the discipline of Social Work is expected to act as a threshold concept for the second purpose (Meyer and Land, 2003). Rather than comprehensive documentation, such an environment can showcase &lsquo;good practice&rsquo;, enable direct experience with online learning opportunities, and serve as a transparent reference for discussing difficulties among teachers. Thus, it can help overcome preconceptions regarding the digitally mediated interrelatedness of people and content and foster the implementation of education technology in a shifting environment.</p>
<p>At the H818 Online Conference 2019, I will present the project and context in more detail. I am involved in revising both the bachelor and master curriculum in Social Work at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences and will explain strategy, approach and major challenges for implementing education technology at this institution. I will focus on <a href="https://app.webjets.io/p/WYZtFK0GbPVCwBC2yO94kzT3On72/-LWIJn3TkbYZJYx3rlDc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">design and purpose of the planned playground learning environment</a>. In order to explore this approach in more detail, a prototype course will be available for conference attendees with a specific interest in this topic before, during and after the conference Based on the experiences running this prototype course, we will discuss opportunities, strengths and weaknesses of such an approach in a workshop. In my presentation I will provide an overiview on the prototype course and findings from running the prototype so far.</p>

                   <p>Implementing new ideas and especially technological based ones into schools and universities seem to still be a complicated process with quite a bit of resistance. It would be interesting to see your project David. The playground idea is very clever.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi David,&nbsp;</p>
<p>If i am interpreting properly, the playground would be a learning environment/playground where everyone had an easy access, open area to explore and share experiences? I like the idea if it is.I work in a college and we use Moodle - it should be like a playground. However, each department has a door to their play area - and the doors are all locked to staff and students alike. I fell that the open innovation of playground is an excellent idea for increasing engagement and development for social work education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Phil and Annette,&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your feedback. Sceptisism, hesistancy, unease, resistance, etc. seem to be common reactions when it comes to using technology for education, also because it implies changes to role and traditional self-perception of teachers (the <a href="https://library.educause.edu/resources/2018/8/2018-nmc-horizon-report" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2018 NMC Horizon Report</a> describes this as &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; challenge and &ldquo;complex to define, much less to address&rdquo;).</p>
<p>My goal is to set the playground learning environment apart from the core curricula so it does not interfere too much, but still adds value by connecting different topics. I hope to make the prototype available tomorrow and would be very interested to get your feedback.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>yes, it should be sort of a miniMOOC where learnes would exchange ideas accross the modules of the curriculum or even with professionals and practitioners from the field of Social Work. We use Moodle too and quite in the same way you describe. I hope that such an open learning environment could demonstrate opportunities and benefits for Social Work education.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi David, your project is very innovative and interesting.&nbsp; &nbsp;I look forward to trying the playground when I can get access :-).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like previous comments the problems that you state with implementing and using technology in other fields of education.&nbsp; In my health librarianship area, the idea of a sandpit which is similar to your playground area was introduced to encourage learning and using emerging technologies for health librarians.&nbsp; I think it will definately encourage engagement, a really clever idea.</p>
<p>In terms of the networking to develop the project , which networks in particular helped to inform the development of your project?</p>
<p>I look forward to your presentation and all the best with your preparations :-).</p>        </div>

                   <p>OpenStudio, tutor group forums, our Whatsapp group and Cloudworks here have all been helpful for feedback. Colleagues from my professional environment have also provided very useful feedback, but I have not been able to tap into new networks such as Twitter as much as I would have liked. I am still trying to find out how to best engage there.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi David sounds like you had a lot of success with the networks you tapped into.</p>
<p>Well done with the prototype miniMOOC.&nbsp; I have sent feedback via your feedback form.&nbsp; The structure and navigation are great.&nbsp; I especially liked the forums and the clear instructions especially dates to note etc.&nbsp; This is key especially for a self-paced course otherwise time can run away with you.&nbsp; I think having a space like this will be so beneficial to share ideas and exchange views.&nbsp; &nbsp;Very user intuitive. Well done again.&nbsp; I look forward to hearing your presentation.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <ul>
<li>What aspects of play are included in the miniMOOC?</li>
</ul>
<p>The main idea of the 'playground learning environment' is to create an environment where students and teaching staff can experiment with education technology.&nbsp; Therefore it is important for me to keep the miniMOOC separate from the mandatory modules and students are free to choose what topics they wish to research. Teachers can also interact as moderators, but they do not assess contributions. So aspects of play are not really included in the miniMOOC and I would find it difficult to do so.</p>        </div>

<p>Motivation might be an issue. Therefore it is important that there is a link to the curricula: the discussions and peer-reviewed contributions of the students will be picked up in the start-up sessions of the regular modules and again in the final session.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

<p>Some form of open badges to recognise contributions which are especially valuable would certainly help to motivate students. This has been in scope of the original project which was planned to run on Moodle, but I have not yet found a suitable technical solution for it. The idea was to show a usecase of badges which could be used on a larger scale for all modules of the bachelor and master curricula as they all run on Moodle.</p>        </div>

<p>Students have not been involved yet, but this is a good point and I will try to add an addtional testing cycle where students can feedback on the prototype. I will also include opportunities for feedback at the end of the miniMOOC.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

<p>Initially, I will support the miniMOOC, but it is a main goal of this project to involve teaching staff so they can learn how to act as virtual tutors. I am confident that they are intrested in participating as they will have to contribute content from their area of expertiese and they will also refer to discussions and contributions at the beginning of the term.</p>        </div>
