Development of a sense of community within the course, through collaborative work or  discussion

How to bring about the change:
Use constructivist approach, build activities that require teamwork???    </div>

                   <p>Hi Sue.</p>
<p>What language proficiencies do you assume for your target group? Are they native speakers, English language learners, second language students?</p>
<p>What do you mean by "communications" - is this primarily text or voice?</p>

                   Hi Mark,

Most students in a typical cohort for this course are English speaking, some as a second language, but not the majority. 

I would see the course covering all manner of communications, written from formal reports, emails to social media, as well as oral. The context is a business degree, so applicable to organisational communications.

Cheers

Sue        </div>

                   <p>Sue, this sounds great. I've been doing some of that kind of work with a workforce development agency in my area (Ohio, USA) and am doing something similar with one of my research clients for its staff members. For that project, I've started a wiki to hold some sources and references (it's at&nbsp;http://www.editorialpartnersllc.com/Professional_Writing/doku.php) that is definitely a work in progress, but I'd be interested in your feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "trouble" with writing courses, as I have taught them, is that most of the time I feel that my best opportunity to support students is one on one, with their writing in front of us, brainstorming possibilities for revision. I've thought about teaching writing online, but that aspect to me is a barrier.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Tiffany,</p>
<p>I have been debating whether or not to join a team, as I am finding my workload demanding at the moment (why is it never quiet when I have other things I want to do). I'll try to post what I can and am happy to share ideas with you (and others), but would hate to let down a team by bailing mid course.</p>
<p>Re teaching this kind of course online, this is something we struggle with constantly. There is the view that students should be interacting, constructing knowledge and so on, but sooo many seem to want to just read the text book and sit the exam independently, despite surveys that suggest otherwise:&nbsp; <a href="http://onlinelearninginsights.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/what-do-students-really-want-in-an-online-course/" rel="nofollow">http://onlinelearninginsights.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/what-do-students-really-want-in-an-online-course/</a></p>

                   <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>That would be super - I manage design and development of all units in the Business School, so we cover a range of topics. Your course sounds like it could fit in nicely.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

                   <p>Hi Leah,</p>
<p>I have just got around to looking at the site you sent to me. It looks fantastic! I would love to be able to point students to some of these resources. I think it would also be handy for an academic skills resource.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
