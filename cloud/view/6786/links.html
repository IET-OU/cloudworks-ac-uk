			<p><strong>Introducing me</strong>:</p>
<p>I'm one of several ppl scattered across RMIT UNIVERSITY who have signed up for this MOOC, most of who have ED TECH and/or LEARNING DESIGN related roles. RMIT is in the magnificent MELBOURNE, Australia. &nbsp;We in Australia are unfortunately having a pretty nasty bushfire season, and are seriously hoping not to experience another 'Black Saturday' event.</p>
<p>I am an EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPER, in the College of Science, Engineering and Health -&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>most cool and interesting collection of faculty in the Uni :-). We have students across the 3 tertiary sectors of undergraduate, postgraduate, and TAFE (aka: vocational/college/polytechnic). My main role is learning design, evolved from instructional design, and supporting (and generating) learning options using educational technology and all that goes with that such as workshops, seminars, etc, etc.</p>
<p>This is MY FIRST MOOC, but I have studied online before and had positive experiences and outcomes. I have also taught online in disant and hybrid / blended models (and I'm currently in a 'missing my students' phase, so it must be time to think about a little bit of teaching again...)</p>
<p><strong>Location Tags?</strong></p>
<p>Travel to present at ed tech conferences, etc, has led me to meet some amazing ppl in various locations doing great things in ed tech and learning design, and I propose (or I might even 'do' as I see I can...) add tags of location. For eg, as a start, a 'Melbourne' tag so I can easily find my local connections, but then I want to reach out to a wide global representation of ppl (I learn more that way... provides another slice of 'context'...). I'll start - then see if it takes off...</p>
<p>Happy to be here with you all! Meg :-)</p>			<div class="posted-by">

<p>OK, this is simply:&nbsp;<br /><strong>Engage with the MOOC activities as much as possible</strong>, <br />recognising that:<br />&nbsp;- it will be easy to be distracted by other required work and life activities, and <br />&nbsp;- if I loose momentum I will be at risk of 'tailing off' and dissapearing from the MOOC (which would be an opportunity lost...)</p>
<p>then I go and add one more to complicate it:<br /><strong>Scan over James Dalziel's ref I noticed in the BibSonomy</strong></p>
<p>There: 2 objectives only; can't be that hard to keep to them....</p>			<div class="posted-by">

<p>Just a formative idea at present - likely to evolve "with a little help from my friends".</p>

<p>Our team members are so far all from the College of Science, Engineering and Health, in a university in Melbourne. Therefore, the project could be focused within the context of the disciplines, or select one discipline within the college. Examples could include: engineering, such as undergraduate 1st year 'Communication Engineering'; health sciences, such as vocational diploma such as myotherapy; etc.</p>
<p>Our college learning programs often have a heavily on-campus component due to hands-on professional/vocational requirements, with many physical resources to support this, such as specifically resourced laboratories. However, our university is putting focus on moving away from traditional lectures that still form a significant part of the learning experience. Resources to support this shift include some new built facilities, with new generation learning spaces and lecture rooms that allow for chairs to be rotated to row behind, that allow for more interactive group work and discussions. Additionally, models of online or blended learning are being promoted, This might include online learning for underpinning knowledge areas, or may even offer some practice at practical application via online simulations, or iLabs (experiments that can be operated remotely over the net, requiring booking a lab time not already taken by other students but with a wide time frame (often 24/7). The LMS we use in Blackboard, and to streamline things for students it is expected that all online learning be have a focal or access point from Bb, even if the students are actually directed beyond Bb. We are new to providing the Google suit of goodies officially to staff (altho a few things are not enabled), and there is some experiemntal work occuring of using Google Sites for content and inter-activities (linked from Bb...). We have web-conferencing (was Elluminate, now Bb Collaborate), plus a number of other tools such as lecture or desktop capture (Echo360), a media annotation tool (MAT), existing content resources (Flexible Learning Toolboxes; Equella learning depository; Lynda.com; Kanopy; etc.), and (one) fabulous graphic designer/web developer for L&amp;T in the college.</p>

<p>I would like to delve into the design options for delivering content (in either an online or blended model) to a large cohort, where the learning outcomes for the subjet are the same for all learning, but the sub-discipline is varied across the cohort; they will go on into different professional/vocational streams in their learning programs and eventual employment.</p>
<p>What range of options could see that all students in the class can personalise their learning to be relevant for their stream, even tho they are in a class of 'common' content learning? What options of LD (learning design) can be considered to ensure they each end up with relevant, meaningful and employment-ready learning for their discipline?&nbsp;</p>

<td style="border: 1px solid #000000; vertical-align: top; padding: 7px;">
<p>Aha! See, this is the crux of my challenge. I can easily provide one neat anser to this, but I want to explore what options in LD are avialable for consideration, not just one answer. I want to get in there and muck around in the mess to see what can emerge!</p>
<p>I hope my study buddies are motivated by this idea, or help me to evolve it to a more meaningful project to help meet the learning needs of each of the members of our study team &nbsp;:-)</p>
