        <p>Importance for teaching:</p>
<p>Actually we could see importance and relevance of mobile learning in social work disciplines teaching. Current practice in social work and sociology teaching needs to be developed and improving with latest educational achievement.</p>
<p>Actually, in my home university there is no distance form of learning, there is only day classes form of learning.</p>
<p>Approach:</p>
<p>But for my closer participator approach in learning process, especially with my students. My philosophy of teaching for my master students that delivering lectures is not a process only in class room. They must be and could be independently from personality of professor, who only could and must be a advisor or mentor, not govern but helping create and help to become a strong sustainable in own sphere person. This point is very important in social work disciplines teaching, because very important to develop leadership ability and skills. Join to Bolon system of education and going ahead in this direction give up huge challenges for creatively competitive model of student that directly related to create a modern professionals of academic social work teaching, to establish develop skills and technologies of distant teaching, for example for disable peoples and deviant children to have a chance recruit a old peoples, and current medical workers receive a degree in social work. All this needs further development and strength high school system of education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The sociologies of mobility, future directions, possibilities</p>
<p>Nowadays for us there are lot of challenges instead a great scientific results in social science. The great and famous only ahead. Its directly mean that each staff must create own challenges or way of challenges. And student could follow them and create also own original way. The story of the best international, most western universities tells us that, Such as Stanford or Harvard etc. Examination of our work is sustainability and competitiveness of our product making product &ndash; student. Open &ndash;minded teachers must produce also open-minded and also going person, limitations of being of staff of huge national universities is that by one hand there are possibilities for academic mobility on international level, possibilities for taking part in various academic programs and changes and suitable number of quality high level students,( For example, in my home university all number of students is 16000 thousand and approximately 1500 staff) , crucial majority of students are those, who won the educational grant from government on all stage of educational programs, but on other hand there are limitations with forms and ways of education, such as distance, abbreviated training.</p>
<p>Its mean that potential is great, but what kind of way will be direct and lucky to achieve educational goals and same time to do our best and be on the wave on modern educational technologies.</p>    </div>

                   <p>Thanks for sharing. I was working as the head of charity in HK, and UG students were attached to my charity for "service learning" and as the representative of the charity mentoring this group of 5-8 students. I chosed WhatsApp as community of learning tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It allows me as a supervisor and students to have the ability to clarify contradictions / tensions (as in Activitiy Theory) and if I have to offer advice / specific knowlege - it also allows me to impart synchronously to all group members - supported by video, images, and context.</p>
<p>It worked well and I see a lot of social sector users / practictioners using it and I agree that social service students can basically get advice from their host NGO / charity rep while lecturer continue to monitor (via Chat archive) etc ... and to monitor for participation / discussion / attendance (may be arranged some form of formative assessment)...</p>
<p>Please come speak to me, we can discuss more; in a way this is related to my research area. Experiential Learning / Service Learning in the Mobile Age in Higher Education</p>
<p>Rgds, Daniel</p>        </div>
