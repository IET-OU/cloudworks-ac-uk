    <div class="user-entry">

        <p>In this review, I have selected the&nbsp;'4 Ts' &amp; 'CADMOS' models as my 2 &nbsp;representations of the 'Healthy Eating' lesson.</p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;4 T's model</strong></p>
<p>This model is expressed graphically in a 4 swim-lanes picture of the lesson. Each 'lane' represents as aspect of the lesson: Task, Teams, Technology and Time. Apart from the tidy graphical expression, this is readable partly because it is very like a traditional lesson plan with each of the 4 different aspects (Ts) of the 'teaching and learning' represented so that each aspect can be read sequentially down the lanes and horizontally across the lanes to show the ways that the 4 Ts interact in any one time space during the lesson.</p>
<p>I did not think the term 'Team' wasthe best signpost to the information that that T-lane contained. In it sub-lanes are created for each type of role contained in the lesson. Here there was just the 'Teacher' and Student'. I thought the small circles were useful to represent the number of groups and possible group size in which the students experienced the task (in this example it was either as a 'whole group' of 20 or&nbsp;7 groups of 4 people (although the maths seems off a bit there!)).</p>
<p>It is highly expressive and could be understood and referred to, on the spot (whilst teaching) to guide the process of delivery. The Technology sub'lanes would help you to ensure that you had all the&nbsp;correct materials present together at the right time.</p>
<p>I suppose the missing element is what to do if one of the Technology aspects fails you or a chosen group size is for some reason found not to work. I would like a line for 'What If ...' alternatives.</p>
<p>Lesson planning could be easily shared.</p>
<p><strong>CADMOS</strong></p>
<p>The advantage here is the link between the conceptual model (Fig. 1) and the Flow Model (Fig.2).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1 expresses the tasks, their function and their content. I liked the way you could see the balance of functions within the lesson, especially how assessment was integrated into it. This would be useful to 'sell' the value of the lesson to inspectors or share the planning with students.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows sequentially what each role-carrier (student, teacher, group) in the lesson is doing and when, as well as how and when&nbsp;the roles would interact. I like that very much. Again, though it is not as intuitively useful to the teacher in the class at the time of teaching but very much so in getting the balance right, as learners might like it, between group and individual learning and simple listening. It would help you to play with these categories.</p>
<p><strong>MY DESIGN</strong></p>
<p>I've lost faith in my design. I wonder if the exercise came too early in H800. When asked to design an activity, I took it to mean one individual activity within the lesson, which is what I concentrated on&nbsp; - its duration being no greater than 10 minutes at the outside (although in the face-to-face group) I was able to spin off other activities from it.</p>
<p>I now see I should have been planning a 'lesson' or project. If I took the whole lesson (on the writing up of experimental reports in psychology on a particular experiment) I could have used both of these models at different phases of planning, review, learner involvement and evaluation. The 4Ts is an attractive representation for use in the class (if What If ... moments were added), since it was technological failures that stymied the OU Live session and because my design was inflexible to that eventuality.</p>
<p>However, I think both would allow a preview of the whole picture and, especially in avoiding teacher-centred control and in helping to prepare transitions in the lesson. i felt I could do that on the hoof in the face to face event but not in the online one. i needed thiese graphic representations of what should be happening in the teacher space more - in part to help me visualise it from other perspectives (a group or an individual student).</p>
