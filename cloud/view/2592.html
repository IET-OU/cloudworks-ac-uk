			<p>There are two types of marriages, one is a marriage that based on passion and romance or so called love marriage, which is very famous among couples these days and one is a type of marriage that has received numerous criticisms, an arranged marriage. As all of you already knew marriage that is based on passion and romance or love marriage is usually associated with romance, love at the first sight and personal freedom. In details, marriage that based on passion and romance or love marriage is a legal right for two individuals who care and love for each other and intends to live together as husband and wife and go ahead with their life. Other than that, in this type of marriage, both individuals know each other very well before they get married. This is because they started dating first and after they both already know about each other personalities, hobbies and they think that they are compatible with each, they get married. As for arranged marriage, it is a type of marriage that against all of the characteristics of marriage that based on passion and romance. According to Gagoomal (2009), in his article, A &ldquo;Margin of Appreciation&rdquo; for &ldquo;Marriages of Appreciation&rdquo;: Reconciling South Asian Adult Arranged Marriages with the Matrimonial Consent Requirement in International Human Rights Law, &ldquo;Arranged marriages is broadly defined as unions which people other than the bride and groom, typically parents or other family members, important or decisive roles in determining who marries whom&rdquo;. Although some people think that love marriage or marriage that is based on passion and romance is ideal and will lead to a happy ending, arranged marriages are more likely to lead to lasting relationships because the feelings of love between the couple will grow stronger and stronger, the idea of divorce is unthinkable and both of their families will provide infinite and full support to the couple.</p>
<p>Some people feel that marriage that is based on passion and romance will last longer and will lead a happy ending than arranged marriage because in love marriage, which involves passion and love, there is a chemistry between both couple and also it is said that they have an infinite feelings of love. Dr Robert Epstein, a Havard academic and a psychologist stated that, at first the connection of love between the couple in arranged marriage are extremely in a low state because both of the couple did not do their homework about each other profiles and backgrounds and because of this, they barely know each other and the affection and feelings of both couples in an arranged marriage will mutiply by two, meaning their bond will become two times stronger than usual, surpassing the love felt by marriage that is based on passion and romance and their love will be developed and their marriage will be a success. Besides that, Dr Robert Epstein also stated that,the feelings of love gained in marriage that based on passion and romance is no match for the feelings of love gained in an arranged marriage because at first, the passion and romance felt for those who are in love marriage is incredibly strong and high but in time, as much as a half in eighteen months, the feelings in both partners will gradually fade away.</p>
<p>Besides that, divorce can happen anytime regardless which type of marriage,be it love marriage or arranged marriage. Many think that marriage that based on passion and romance, the idea of divorce is unthinkable than those who are in arranged marriage. For those who based on passion and romance, it is easier to lead to divorce because once their situation gets tougher and tougher, there will be a serious fight between them. In addition, when there is no other solution to solve their problem, the couple will use their problem to end their relationship,which is a divorce; the only way to escape from their long lasting problems. As for those in arranged marriage,the idea of divorce is unthinkable in both couple because when the couple face problems, the family members of both sides will try their best to find a solution in order to keep their relationship alive. Moreover, keeping the couple&rsquo;s relationship well and alive is the responsibility of both families. In India, a country that is popular and common with arranged marriages, has a divorce rate which is 1.1 percent. The divorce rate in India is considered the lowest in the world because the type of marriage that have been practiced there are arranged marriages. The divorce rate of other countries such as Italy, Israel and Spain are higher than the rate in India. For example, the divorce rate in Spain is 15.2 percent. It is a quite a big gap between the divorce rate of India and the rate in Spain.</p>
<p>The other reason why arranged marriages are more likely to lead to lasting relationships than those based on passion and romance is both of their families will provide infinite and full support to the couple. The couple who live with their parents whether living in the same house or in a same compound mostly are from traditional societies. They could have easily acquired any kind of help from their parents if they stay together with their parents because their parents will always be on their side. Not only their parents will give them infinite support, but their in-laws as well. The types of support that will be given to them are physical support, financial support and also emotional support. Plus , their grandparents can take care of their grandchildren if both of the couple are working instead of hiring a babysitter who is a stranger to the children, thus will make the children feel more comfortable because they are under the care of their grandparents. In addition,the elders can provide advice for the couple whenever they quarrel between each other or they have to make a crucial decision. Also, in arranged marriage, the parents of both families will cooperate and provide each other necessary assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it undeniable that in any type of marriage whether it is a love marriage or an arranged marriage, both of them have their own pros and cons especially arranged marriages, a marriage that is popular for having so many cons instead of pros. Many people think that arranged marriage is an outdated and a defective type of practice and widely known and famous for its disadvantages. Some of the people also think that arranged marriage is violating the human right; the parents do not give their children permission or blessing when their children wanted to marry the person they loved. The parents will only let their children get married if they already found a suitable and compatible partner for their children. However, according to Aimi Aqilah Mohd Zulkifli, in The Real Benefits of Arranged Marriage Compared to Love Marriage, she stated that culture is one of the human rights and in certain countries; one of the cultures that has been practiced for a long period of time is arranged marriages. So, preventing someone from practicing one&rsquo;s culture means violating one&rsquo;s human rights. Violating one&rsquo;s human rights is wrong from the view of the law. Legal action will be taken against someone who violates human rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, the difference between these two types of marriages, marriage that is based on passion and romance and arranged marriage are arranged marriages are more likely to lead to long lasting relationships than marriage that is based on passion and romance. In arranged marriage, there is nothing that the couple should be afraid of because both of their families will support them endlessly. Also, arranged marriage guarantees us a partner to spend our life with,lead us to endless happiness, and this type marriage is more secure and stable. From now on, people should change their antagonistic judgement about arranged marriage and they have to consider that it is a good type of marriage.</p>
