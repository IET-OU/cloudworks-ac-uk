<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com" rel="nofollow">The Career-learning Caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Is public-service careers work running out of road? &nbsp;New paths for politics, beliefs and technologies are re-routing the way people live.&nbsp; There is a time to leave but careers work has no certain place to go.&nbsp; The temptation is, then, to signpost and replicate past achievements.&nbsp; And that's a blind alley.</p>
<p>If there's hope it rests on careers work's ability to adjust and re-align its position.&nbsp; The record is of a decade-by-decade importation of new thinking and practice.&nbsp; Each stage has carried options for presenting careers-work as an institution to be defended or a movement to be galvanised.&nbsp; My vote is for the latter, and that means...</p>
<ul>
<li>... realities to face</li>
<li>... changes to manage</li>
<li>... thinking to expand</li>
<li>... action to align</li>
<li>... a deal to negotiate</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a journey, finding strengthened relationships between students and educators.&nbsp; Their positions are of mutually-respecting partnership, each acknowledging the authority of the other.&nbsp; Students become sources based on their appreciation of the distinctive locations they inhabit.&nbsp; Partnerships draw on students' direct-and-personal experience of how people manage their lives in those enclaves.&nbsp; Students and educators work together on what helps and hinders those families' and neighbourhoods' chances in life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of that work probes what is happening to small businesses and what is coming out of global conglomerates.&nbsp; All re-focuses on stakeholder experience of the opportunities on offer - and not on offer.&nbsp; Students are among the authorities who understand what needs to be done.&nbsp; This is a new deal for careers work and a movement where students are sources on learning for living.</p>
<p>Change is a major factor in understanding why it is necessary.&nbsp; Contemporary learning must take account of technologies and economies, and also of the beliefs and values which grow around them.&nbsp; And the resulting array of starting points for action is dizzying.&nbsp; Students might... &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>lean towards...&nbsp;</strong><em>college - apprenticeship - university - enterprise</em></p>
<p align="center"><strong>engage with...&nbsp;</strong><em>science - engineering - arts - culture - services</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>be driven by...&nbsp;</strong><em>ambition - well-being - fulfilment - helpfulness</em></p>
<p align="center"><strong>based on...&nbsp;</strong><em>qualification - advice - media - independence - chance</em></p>
<p align="center"><strong>considering...&nbsp;</strong><em>relatives - friends - neighbourhood</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>influenced by...&nbsp;</strong><em>wealth - connections - poverty - marginalisation</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>concerned for...&nbsp;</strong><em>the poor - the rich - the species - the planet</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>with expectations about...&nbsp;</strong><em>identity - race - sexuality - class</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most careers work can help on all of this.&nbsp; And it will do so by appreciating how dizzying this experience can be.&nbsp; Which is why the call is for student-educator partnerships.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>facing realities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>But ideas for partnership are surrounded by more than enough talk about what should be done.&nbsp; Some of it comes from bureaucrats claiming to know what the world needs now... &nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>'right choices?' - 'impartiality?' - 'high quality?'</em></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually what careers work needs now is fewer vague and abstract generalities and more pushy questions.&nbsp; Reformer students and their educators do better by interrogating...&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>right choices...&nbsp;</em><strong><em>according to who?</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>impartiality...&nbsp;</em><strong><em>show me how?</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><em>&nbsp;</em><em>high quality...&nbsp;</em><strong><em>meaning what?</em></strong></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The search is for recognisable realities, and bureaucratic abstractions don't find them. &nbsp;The most telling question in the 'what-who-when-how-where' spectrum is 'why'.&nbsp; It looks for causes and effects - causes that drive...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'why can I be sure of this?'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and the effects that beckon...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'why will I bother with it?'</em></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questioning the bureaucratic abstractions is hard enough but what's harder is probing favoured answers. </strong>&nbsp;The danger is treat the preference as if it were the fact.&nbsp; But 'I like' can't be simply transposed into 'I believe'.&nbsp; We all need a waving flag on any sentence beginning with 'the fact is...'.&nbsp; Too many so-called facts turn out be a convenient fictions.&nbsp; So what have we got?</p>
<p>We've got facts that are observable and verifiable.&nbsp; It is guaranteed that observers can verifying a claim when people talk along the lines...... &nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>'I saw...' - 'she said...' - 'it describes..'.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But beliefs and opinions are not observed they are attributed.&nbsp; The study of 'phenomenology' builds a theory around the way people attribute meaning to observations. &nbsp;People are not talking about what is real, but about...&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>'which just shows...' - 'so that means...' - 'and the point is...'</em></p>
<p>Attributions are deniable, but they are important - because, right or wrong, they speak of the sense people make of experience.&nbsp; And that sense-making informs action...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'so we should'... - 'and I will...' - 'because she could'...'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are facts, there are attributions and there are purposes.&nbsp; I don't know a sequence of thinking-and-feeling that could be more relevant to careers-work.&nbsp; It is the stuff of career-partnership talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There are the makings of a step-by-step narrative here but every narrative needs scrutiny.</strong>&nbsp; People come across realities, to which they attribute meaning, so that they can find purpose in action - it's a three-scene story.&nbsp; And any narrative can be punctuated by stop-and-think interrogation.&nbsp; But narratives are malleable and can be turned up-side down.&nbsp; A reverse narrative starts with the purpose, looks for the meaning and points to the best-fitting evidence - finding precedes enquiry.&nbsp; It sets up 'do-this' pressure - from peers, colleagues, funders or bureaucrats.&nbsp; The drive to make conclusions fit assumptions is written up as 'conformation bias'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Working with narrative calls for vigilance, and from nobody as much as students and their educators. The questions students ask shape their futures as citizens and workers. &nbsp;And they have a lot of future in their hands - as friends, lovers, parents, grandparents and great-grandparents.&nbsp; If they don't find the answers to the awkward questions, somebody else will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The expert's term 'career development' is a poor fit to all this because there's more going on in reality than in careers-work thinking.</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Bureaucrats, careers workers and human-resource people use the term 'career development' to refer to what their expertise can deliver.&nbsp; The problem with that is that experts are not centre-stage in career narratives.&nbsp; The narratives are not about the experts they are about the students.&nbsp; The experts are, at best, bit players.&nbsp; So we need another term - not 'career development' but 'career management'.</p>
<p>Career management is not what experts do it's what their clients do about uncovering beliefs, developing meanings and planning action.&nbsp; It does not erode the usefulness of careers work expertise.&nbsp; Far from it - because among the career-management goings-on students are not necessarily above inverting and faking their stories.&nbsp; It needs able experts to see through that.&nbsp; But career-development expertise must learn to live with career-management experience. &nbsp;Because student-educator partnerships are not just for making a living, they are for making a life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dealing with change</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Not so long ago expert careers workers would invite applicants to consider where they want to be in their careers - in, say, five year's time. &nbsp;It was an invitation for a clients and candidates to say what it is that drives and beckons them in their careers.&nbsp; It gave helpers and recruiters clues to the directions those energies might carry a person.&nbsp; All very exciting, but - these days - the question would deserve a snort of derision.&nbsp; Neither careers experts nor their students can know what the world will be like in one year's time - let alone five. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Big employers interests are in the changes which they bring about favouring a few and penalising the many.</strong>&nbsp; A big-deal issue for employers is productivity. &nbsp;It's a measure of what a firm gains from the investment it makes. &nbsp;Contemporary recruitment looks for a candidate's productive potential.&nbsp; The formula shows how much training activates how much potential to realise how much profit.&nbsp; There are risks - neither the recruiters nor their formulas are particularly reliable. &nbsp;Nonetheless global players have increasingly heavy-duty leverage on what's going on in working lives.&nbsp; And that trend is strengthened by the conglomeration of companies - fewer headquarters presiding over bigger outfits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These outfits are centrally staffed by highly-qualified and tech-savvy recruits.&nbsp; Indeed, its wizzes are the inventors of global productivity - inventing formulas which squeeze tons of profit out of ounces of investment.&nbsp; Their salaries are spectacular - their drive and beckoning is signposted by big money.&nbsp; But the total is a microscopic sector in the global work-force.&nbsp; And their cybernetic inventiveness is capable of wiping out what remains of career-management - word-wide . &nbsp;Transactions are increasingly digitised beyond human control.&nbsp; It's already in most-people's global work-force picture.&nbsp; Worker productivity is weakening and it's employment contracts are increasingly precarious - more so in poorer nations and increasingly so in rich nations.&nbsp; All of this is the backdrop for how students and educators negotiate partnership.&nbsp; It should count as what careers work calls 'labour-market information'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Small businesses and educators share experiences of global change each needing somehow to deal with it.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;Small businesses are hard-hit.&nbsp; Viable outfits may well be offering valued goods and services to local shoppers.&nbsp; But, nonetheless, they may be refused investment by global banks where they fail to show growth.&nbsp; Shop fronts are taken over by global brands.&nbsp; Until the change overtook them small businesses were where school-leavers had their first part-time jobs, some of them finding sustained employment.&nbsp; Local firms were then in a good position to find and engage likely lads and lassies.&nbsp; The trend against those localities has little to do with productivity, it is the consequence of a theoretical commitment to the economics of growth. &nbsp;However its economics was first mooted not for growth but as a socialist means of selectively strengthening useful local businesses.&nbsp; It made room by letting some businesses go and the process was called 'creative destruction'.&nbsp; But the term has been hijacked by a narrower political theory. &nbsp;It undermines what had been part of a partnership between students, their educators and local employers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some twists and turns: technologies are being updated not year-by-year but day-by-day. &nbsp;And those technologies are equipping citizens in targeting what they see as destructive.&nbsp; There is on-line vigilance and awareness, and sometimes hostility, bringing commerce itself under fire.&nbsp; So it makes economic sense for commerce to offload that risk, and not just onto small businesses but also onto education. &nbsp;Education is also portrayed as at fault - the institutions of global commerce hold educators accountable for making students ready for productive employment. &nbsp;It's a loose-loose deal for educators - like small businesses, whatever they do, they get the blame.&nbsp; That attempted capture would crush any hope for student-educator-business partnerships.&nbsp; Education and local businesses need a road out. &nbsp;And there is one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There's plenty of confusion, ambiguity and self-contradiction in talk of education and it offers opportunities to local partnerships.&nbsp; </strong>A word that crops up a lot in that talk is 'employability'.&nbsp; It appears to mean what employers are looking for.&nbsp; But what employers look for today may not necessarily be on the list tomorrow.&nbsp; What employers want is also a narrative, and malleable.&nbsp; Today it bounces with economic indices, but tomorrow is may well segue with the stock-markets. &nbsp;Now we want you now we don't - another of those guess-what-we-mean abstractions. &nbsp;Careers work does better to ask whether the learning might be for work or can be about work. &nbsp;Learning for work makes work a benign necessity, but learning about work doesn't.&nbsp; Then there is that other frequent phrase, 'self-awareness' - which is also bendable.&nbsp; It can mean listing what recruiters need to know; but it can also leave them gasping for breath.&nbsp; Most self-awareness is a feature in a narrative, speaking of thoughts-and feelings which ebb-and-flow, are at times self-contradictory. &nbsp;And they are none-the-worse for that - because they are natural reflections on an unfolding narrative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there be no short answers about what learning is for.&nbsp; But there can be questions about what learning is ready for a changing world.&nbsp; And there are educators who enable students critically to engage with it. &nbsp;It's muddled, and that gives some cred to what is called the 'chaos theory' of careers.&nbsp; But in a changing world honest reflection on changing facts, myriad meanings and conflicted purposes are bound to be muddled - and are all the better for that.&nbsp; So chaos theory misses what is integral to making sense of experience.&nbsp; The best of employers may have no time for it but the best of educators have. &nbsp;To be fair chaos theory is right about this: there will be surprises.&nbsp; But it's more impressive to surprise than to be surprised.&nbsp; So, wherever your students may be in their application-presentation-selection processes, consider how - in a changing world - the point of learning is being good enough at surprising...</p>

<p align="center"><em>recruiters and selectors are easy to bore</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>much of what they hear is based on expert advice</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>which means they've heard it all before</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>and they know what's faked</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>which is all very tiresome</em></p>

<p align="center"><em>If for good you've demonstrated ready-for-anything productivity</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>and that's what they'll decide on</em></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change brings surprises and what they mean for possible change of mind.&nbsp; &nbsp;Careers work has been stronger on one-off decision than on think-again change of mind.&nbsp; But, these days, educators were never more needed for helping with surprises and seeing things another way.&nbsp; And that requires learning to be less about ready-for-work fitting-in and more about ready-for-anything finding-out.&nbsp; And it opens doors to student-educator-employer partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>expanding thought</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Attributing meaning to change and surprise is neither quick nor easy - it needs time and space for newly-discovered thoughts-and-feelings.&nbsp; And figuring out what to do about it needs yet deeper and wider room. &nbsp;Any resistance would come from narrow thinking voicing accusations of over-complicating things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unfettered support for any innovation is unlikely and partnership reformers need to know how to deal with resistance, dismissal and subversion.&nbsp; </strong>When it comes to resistance the most subtle ploy, and the hardest to outflank, appears in two stages: (1) establish a boundary around what, at first site, seems like a sensible agenda, and then (2) invite free debate within that agenda.&nbsp; A UK example rests on a government position: (a) the business world provides a complete and credible source of labour-market information, and (b) it needs educators to work on how that help can be delivered to students. &nbsp;It's&nbsp;control posturing as liberation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And it feels good.&nbsp; Global companies bring compelling shows to schools and localities. &nbsp;Part of the pitch is to welcome educators as partners in making students ready for work. &nbsp;It positions education as an arm of economy.&nbsp; And it's plausible enough for careers-work leaders to believe they can have both the status and influence. &nbsp;But the reality is that careers work lacks the leverage to demonstrate measurable economic effects. &nbsp;And, in any event, any neo-liberal government invitation would go to private-sector career coaching.&nbsp; So public-sector careers work is looking at a comfortable myth not a political reality &nbsp;&nbsp;And careers work is left needing a road that by-passes the ambush and re-captures the partnership-reforming space.&nbsp; There is such a road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There's plenty of room for doubt concerning business-world claims for commerce and students need educators and employers to face them. </strong>&nbsp;There are controls that can deceive, but no control deceives everybody - and certainly not all of the time.&nbsp; So alert educators are among those who notice that commercial claims overlook the damage that labour markets can do.&nbsp; Much of that damage is done by employers who, in the name of austerity, decline adequately to train and equip employees.&nbsp; It means that workers are underemployed, are in no position to be productive and therefore have seriously weakened claims on decent wages.&nbsp; It's ruthless exploitation relying on the support of discredited economics. &nbsp;&nbsp;Credible sources show how debt-funded investment strengthens an economy.&nbsp; But business 'externalises' those costs by off-loading risk onto suppliers.&nbsp; And that level of thinking sees educators as suppliers of work-life recruits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is business manoeuvring for advantage.&nbsp; It is what its managers think they are there to do.&nbsp; But it damages education, penalises students, exploits workers, endangers suppliers and undermines productivity. &nbsp;For an educator to buy in would be a case of compensating commerce for its failures. &nbsp;It's certainly not such a feel-good story for commerce.&nbsp; But none of it must be allowed to rule out possibilities for education-employer partnerships.&nbsp; Indeed it raises labour-market issues that students, educators and employers need to work on together. &nbsp;And there needs to be room for all three voices to have their say...&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Different programmes working in different localities will come up with different issues.&nbsp; This list does no more than illustrate possibilities.&nbsp; However that may be, the possibilities need to expand the conversation between students, educators and employers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where career-related thought-and-feeling is expanding guidance and curriculum need rebalancing. </strong>&nbsp;Advice in small-group and individual face-to-face work is different from group-learning exchanges&nbsp;in curriculum. &nbsp;It would be unreasonable to expect careers workers to take on a full-scale partnership-learning programmes.&nbsp; They are trained, experienced and located for a special ways of working. &nbsp;But reform needs the interactions that mainstream curriculum, at its best, accommodates. &nbsp;That curriculum depends on the research and development of its own specialists.&nbsp; These are the historians, geographers, mathematicians, sociologists, psychologists, dramatists and economists that students work with on a daily basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A careers-work partnership needs educators to apply their disciplines to the comings-and-goings of contemporary living.&nbsp; But it also needs them to be big enough to learn from careers workers, who know about listening conversations.&nbsp; Every school or college can find a few educators big enough to take this on.&nbsp; And that few is enough, where it is credible and trusted. &nbsp;But, most of all, partnership reform needs educators big enough to recognise that their students know more than they do about what's going on in local lives.&nbsp; So, by the time the business-world's road-show hits town, these students and educators have worked together and are ready for them - ready to listen and ready to question.&nbsp; And, if the road-show visitors are any good at what they do, they will also listen and answer.&nbsp; This engagement of expands the careers-work partnership into a three-way deal...</p>
<p align="center"><em>...students talking and listening with...</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>...employers talking and listening with...</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>....educators talking and listening with students...</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dynamics of careers-work partnerships are expanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>aligning for action</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Students know about what is going on in their own localities. &nbsp;They learn it from experience.&nbsp; And it's true of present and former students.&nbsp; The learning experiences are variously based - what's noticed...</p>
<p align="center"><em>hanging with the folks</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>patrolling the neighbourhood</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>to-and-froing in and around school or college</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>within ear-shot of a shout for a home goal</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>much of the time on-line</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>maybe with some awareness of a nation out there</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>and there are also cosmopolitans</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of these locations is distinctive.&nbsp; It carries a special range of habits.&nbsp; It nurtures a range of beliefs and values.&nbsp; It celebrates particular priorities.&nbsp; Location collectively aligns people for action - framing what they think possible and marking whether they feel it worth the bother. &nbsp;Learning and location are aligned and entwined.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Locally-situated career influences are beyond the reach of centrally-located policy. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;National governments are disposed to believe that it is regional difference that explain learning outcomes.&nbsp; In the UK governments make much of the 'north-south divide'.&nbsp; But the prevailing reality shows local alignments to explain most about the outcomes of education.&nbsp; It is in distinctive locations that people learn who they are becoming and what they will do about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there's nothing inevitable about any of this - learning in location is an influence not a causation.&nbsp; However, in any understanding of what people do about working life, it would be foolish to ignore those social and local anchorages. &nbsp;Any starting point for enabling a change of direction is to understand the dynamics that first align people for a work-life - with, for and in response to people who matter to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Youngsters are already entwined in the different dynamics of localities when they first come to school. </strong>&nbsp;The families coming to drop-off their youngsters approach the school gates from different directions.&nbsp; The directions are printed on the map and imprinted in the minds.&nbsp; So coming from one direction brings puzzlement and confusion about what coming from another takes for granted.&nbsp; Some families see it as natural and necessary to send children at school in nappies.&nbsp; Why would they have seen things differently?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There once were community-based child-care centres scattered across the UK and within reach of most neighbourhoods.&nbsp; Each in one place, they helped families coming from all directions.&nbsp; Few have survived government reforms.&nbsp; So there is little opportunity for either the posh or the poor to get to know and understand each other's postures and habits.&nbsp; It leaves plenty of room for dislike, disgust, disdain, distrust and dismissal.&nbsp; And it's two-way traffic.&nbsp; Each morning schools are greeting families who are strangers to each other.&nbsp; There are hostilities.&nbsp; There are also career-development effects. &nbsp;Reforming partnerships would find more than enough to work on.&nbsp; And, in interests ranging from folks' to cosmopolitans', the matter is urgent.&nbsp; We really don't want finally to find out that 'there's no such thing as society only individual men and women and&nbsp;<strong>t</strong>heir&nbsp;families'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Individual self-awareness is a lot more than what much of government and some careers workers think it is. </strong>&nbsp;To dismiss social and cultural influences on what people do is to be left with one explanation of behaviour - the individual.&nbsp; A concomitant is that individual failure is individually blameworthy.&nbsp; Pushed to its limits it locates you and me in each our own social vacuums.&nbsp; Neo-liberal governments get close to that limit.&nbsp; Selfies may be a feature.&nbsp; The careers-work version directs a lot of attention to 'self awareness'.&nbsp; It appears as categories of aptitude, preference and achievement. &nbsp;Much of UK government and too much of careers-work thinking believes that linking that list to a corresponding list of work-life possibilities carries the greater part of what careers advice should do.&nbsp; The match affirms the self - and the good news can be found in a matter of hours.&nbsp; Indeed is can be expected to lift a 'failing' student into 'employability'.&nbsp; The simplicity of the thinking allows it to be recorded on tick-and-flick worksheets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Away from those worksheets all but the seriously-in-denial are still finding out about themselves - all the time and lifelong.&nbsp; And, far from uplifting, it can be a troublesome experience.&nbsp; It needs a deeper and wider concept of self awareness - usually inconsistent, probably puzzling, often self-contradictory and sometimes painful. &nbsp;It learns less from the expected than from the surprising.&nbsp; It is beyond the reach of pre-cooked categories.&nbsp; And it has more for educators to learn from students than for students to learn from educators.&nbsp; It belongs to deeper and wider student-educator partnership - mutually learned over years. &nbsp;In that thinking encouraging students narrowly to see their lives as check-listed self-affirmation would be child abuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Influences concerned with career development are institutionalised in state and commercial outfits but there is also civil society. </strong>&nbsp;Becoming self-aware is socially rooted - informed by the feedback, modelling and support of other people.&nbsp; There is an issue for where these encounters are best understood and served.&nbsp; All institutions are instituted in some interest or other.&nbsp; The institutions of civil society are set up to represent other than political or commercial interests.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are big on child-care, religion and &nbsp;education. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Between them institutions are variously set up in order to rescue, help, serve or control some interest or other.&nbsp; As things change they come and go - each is eventually thought of as redundant, or unfashionable, or inconvenient.&nbsp; Some, like many child-care outfits and some religious institutions, are stealthily undermined.&nbsp; Some that are whistle-blowing dangerous just disappear.&nbsp; As change accelerates so does that coming-and-going turnover. &nbsp;All of this opens a big question for education-based work.&nbsp; How far can reforming partnership relate to any of this?... or survive it?... or escape it?&nbsp; Any reforming partnership movement which is unwelcome to commercial or political interests may need an escape route.&nbsp; And there is is one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reforming education in an hierarchically bureaucratised institution needs a special kind of negotiating.</strong> &nbsp;Institutions are said to be part of 'the system'.&nbsp; Such talk refers to the way an establishment, a parliament or a school can act arbitrarily.&nbsp; It becomes visible when rescuing, helping, serving and controlling moves are allocated inconsistently.&nbsp; Where educators comply they are said to be high on 'system orientation'.&nbsp; A determination to survive or resist institutional control is said to be low on 'system-orientation'. &nbsp;High system orientation behaves itself. &nbsp;Orientations are measured by degrees, as positions on a spectrum.&nbsp; Positions at the lower end correlate with various indications of independence-of-mind.&nbsp; Bureaucratic education determine how welcome independently low orientation shall be.&nbsp; That determining process may quietly rotate wheels-within-wheels. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A low system-oriented programme manager might well think it a mistake to take a reform proposal to the biggest boss.&nbsp; Before any student expectations are fired up a reformer needs to know who, among colleages, to hand-pick for work on the reform.&nbsp; There are colleagues with 'senior', 'middle' and 'functionary' status.&nbsp; But status does not necessarily speak of influence...</p>
<p align="center"><em>who wins student trust?</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>who would best be aware of the effects of the reform?</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>how is designated careers work positioned about it?</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>how best to engaged co-operation with that trust, awareness and position?</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Anyone who has spent any time in a staff room knows that influence is not as easily recognised as is commonly supposed.&nbsp; The idea of all-knowing 'super-head' owes more to romanticism than evidence.&nbsp; But all bosses need to know what's going on, conflicting with what, and getting ready to besiege. &nbsp;These are devils and deep-blue seas.&nbsp; Reform for innovation stays afloat by approaching bosses on piloted and proven proposals.&nbsp; That's why trying ideas out - with hand-picked colleagues and, at some stage, hand-picked students - is constructive.&nbsp; Bosses have heard more than enough about problems, they are more likely to align with solutions.&nbsp; Student-educator partnerships qualify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>negotiating the deal</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Getting that alignment loads big-time pressures on the partnership's educators and its students.&nbsp; Educators are asked to signpost the learning-for-living relevance of their disciplines. &nbsp;They are asked to re-position their authority in relation to student authority.&nbsp; And they are asked to work for students' own independence of mind, critical-thinking and creativity. &nbsp;Educators are now more than interesting actors, they are interested audiences. &nbsp;This is talking-the-talk that comes ahead of walking-the-walk. &nbsp;It positions students in back-and-forth conversations about what is worth knowing, what is believable, and - only then - what needs to be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In the midst of so much back-and-forth negotiation a lot hangs on what educators mean by 'communication'.</strong> &nbsp;Partnership talking-the-talk faces factual realities, prioritises shared meanings, and takes on ensuing action.&nbsp; Hand-picked participants are dealing with educators who see the point, and some who feel they've enough to do.&nbsp; They are dealing students who see the point, and some who won't take their eyes off the competitive ball. &nbsp;Careers-work partherships are not all-round winners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And prospects are further damaged when conversation is re-labelled 'communication skills'.&nbsp; Those skills are urged on students for promoting, persuading and performing.&nbsp; They're look-good skills. and they hide as much as they disclose.&nbsp; Communication is not conversation.&nbsp; Conversation asks and answers, hesitates and interrupts, whispers and shouts, weeps and curses.&nbsp; It's how we get to know each other. &nbsp;Officialdom may lament a lack of communication skills.&nbsp; Partnership laments a loss of trust in people whose fancy talk is found not to be worth bothering with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Change-to-meet-change needs learning that students can progressively engage with educators.</strong>&nbsp; Walking-the-walk partnerships engage growing students with caring educators.&nbsp; It is a continuously unfolding experience. &nbsp;That is a day-by-day change needing a year-on-year programme for dealing with change upon change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Few know better than educators how bumpy that ride can be.&nbsp; Some stretches look like failure.&nbsp; But learning from failure is part of homo-sapiens' finger-hold on survival.&nbsp; We learn more from what troubles us than from what pleases us. &nbsp;And all students have genetically inherited some version of those smarts.&nbsp; It presents us all with a repertoire, including working with...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;social support...&nbsp;</strong><em>asking who-what-when-where-how-why questions</em></p>
<p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;step-by-step reflection...&nbsp;</strong><em>finding-sorting-checking-figuring what's going on</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><strong>turning-point experience...&nbsp;</strong><em>imagining this-way-or-that dealing with fear and realising hope</em></p>
<p align="center"><strong>calling on special memories...&nbsp;</strong><em>from recovering the forgotten to facing the unforgettable</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>recounting achievements...&nbsp;</strong><em>ranging from faking through inventing to creating</em></p>
<p align="center"><strong>slow-burning intuition...&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;asleep and awake thought-and-feeling that won't stop</em></p>
<p align="center"><strong>quick-firing instinct...&nbsp;</strong><em>experienced as a do-it-now-or-lose-the-chance impulse</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's more here than any career development textbook has fully contained. &nbsp;It needs handling with care: not to be confused with learning styles or emotional intelligence - neither of which has much of an evidence base.&nbsp; It's a repertoire, any part of which can help with facing confusion, dealing with obstruction and turning loss into gain.&nbsp; And it's the range that makes it a resource for student-educator partnerships ready for a changing world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where more-of-the-same won't work there must be a place for new thinking calling on new knowledge.</strong> &nbsp;For a long time careers-work thinking has been largely based on aspects of psychology and economics - with a bit of sociology and cultural theory.&nbsp; Thinking for partnership reform brings neurology and evolution-theory into that mix.&nbsp; Their importance is illustrated by the way the support-to-instinct repertoire stacks up. &nbsp;Those smarts include segments where your brain is telling you that it knows more than you knew it knows. &nbsp;That neurology looks after you because it needs you to survive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But the resulting mix has bequeathed humanity with a resonance all its own.&nbsp; it speaks not so much of calculative decisions as human longings.&nbsp; There are places which the repertoire&nbsp;more closely resemble falling in love than maximising solutions.&nbsp; And that allows you to sense the glancing, hesitating, breathing, touching and tasting experience of a life-changing encounter. &nbsp;You owe it to your brain - not to emoticons. &nbsp;It is a thought-and-feeling repertoire that can turn obstruction into advance, capture into release, loss into gain - and confusion into clarity. &nbsp;It's also quite a bequest to student-educator careers-work partnerships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There are shareholders and there are stakeholders and they don't necessarily agree about what's worth learning. </strong>&nbsp;Shareholders are attached to commerce and the interests it serves.&nbsp; They expect their human-resources people to recruit staff who will pump-up productivity. &nbsp;At the same time stakeholders are attached to families in their locations and with their cultures.&nbsp; And it is they who are affected by the impact of whatever shareholders want done.&nbsp; There are consequences for well-being. &nbsp;It's an open question what shareholders and stakeholders will actually support - productivity or well-being.&nbsp; Actually productivity need not exclude well-being.&nbsp; But labour-market experience shows that neither need they be congruent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any partnership agreement must negotiate with these influences.&nbsp; So educators need to know where they come in.&nbsp; The possibilities stretch from mindfulness to critical thinking.&nbsp; The one cools students down, the other fires them up<strong>.</strong> &nbsp;So what of the open question?<strong>&nbsp; </strong>Partnership agreements are negotiated by students and their educators - and they are stakeholders. &nbsp;And we know this: change is surprising, but surprise is useful; self awareness is uncomfortable, but it's trouble from which we learn; commerce must try to capture education, but it can't afford to over-ride it; systems control behaviour, but nothing is inevitable. &nbsp;All of that looks to me like apple-carts for upsetting - by critical thinking, the independence of mind it sustains, and the creativity it releases.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________________</p>

<p>So is public-service careers work running out of road?&nbsp; And is it in yet another blind alley?&nbsp; Not if you can find partners for reform here......</p>
<p align="center"><em>...students talking and listening with...</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>...employers talking and listening with...</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>....educators talking and listening with students..</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It lifts road-shows to where shareholders, stakeholders and educators work with, not on, students.&nbsp; Talking-that-talk points them all to walking-a-new-walk. &nbsp;And that move is as important as any that any of them will ever make.</p>
