        •    What do you think we as olnet should try to do to move this agenda forward (how can we use designs and patterns as an collective/combined approach to get more out of OERs)?<br />
•    The problem we are trying to address is that we have lots of good OERs but they aren’t being used and/or reused?<br />
•    Work in pairs – each person talks for 3 minutes, then reflect back thoughts to the wider group?<br />
Ideas<br />
•    A set of connected face-to-face workshops that might get the knowledge about patterns and learning designs and then try to use this in practice to improve practice<br />
•    Its important to have an expert research base for sharing practices and enable us to move beyond the workshops (cloudworks?)<br />
•    How can we structure the interface of mediating artefacts (tools, designs, patterns, etc) to support the open design process and how do we put these together so that they make sense<br />
•    Have all three things as inter-related <br />
•    Do a survey of real practitioners in the domain we are interested in to find out what is the maximum time they would be prepared today to look at sharing and use that as a constraint for the first set of interventions we develop<br />
•    Look at the way that patterns and the resources and the relationships between them can be summarised and how the visual representations can provide a more efficient way of applying/using the patterns or resources<br />
•    DO a deep analysis of all the learning design patterns that all the groups have produced. 1. Develop a taxonomy of learning patterns – what is used when by whom in what situation. 2. Identify the common bits and the possible relationships between different learning patterns – vision of what I would like to have as a design – I would like to be able to enter a need or a question, I would like to design a 3 week course on x and want to do collaboratively. Then decide step by step which tools, methods and patterns I want to use. Design patterns need to be fragmented as well so it can also be reused. <br />
•    An analysis of existing OERs and also same for patterns. Which patterns are suitable to be applied to which OERs and how does that happen? Also who is the audience – teachers and designers and individual learners. Issue of scalability. How much can we do online rather than in labour intensive workshops.  How do we virtualise a lot of what we do in face to face settings? <br />
•    Rather than solutions looking for problems – OERs (as very expensive “free” hammers)<br />
•    Current situation is separate communities not inter-connected – theorists, researchers, practitioners – need to find ways of making connections more explicit – constant conversation across these different communities<br />
•    Think of some scenarios of some potential new reuse scenarios and then test out some of these<br />

                   <p>
1. We have produced several scenarios that we may use as a starting point for some of the activities for the workshops with teachers or researchers
</p>
<p>
2. One important aspect is to find ways to fund the activities after summer. Will it be an Olnet-based funding? Can we find some kind of new funding (shared or not)? Can it involve LKL in a national level? Is there any option for international collaboration (even for traveling)?
</p>
<p>
3. I was thinking also of having a space for new pattern elicitation in specific domains that emerge after the workshops e.g. need for Project-based learning patterns. Then we could interleave Planet-type wrkshops
</p>
<p>
4. We should think of providing a platform that &quot;glues together&quot; the different pieces that are available now, as a means for self-reflection, for use in workshops and probably as instruments that might survive ... This platform may include artefacts (designs, patterns, resources), tools to manipulate them (CompendiumLD, WebCollage, Pattern tool from LKL), environment for dialog and social sharing in a persistent way (Cloudworks, etc.)
</p>
<p>
5. We need to collect and analyze data of what we are trying to &quot;test&quot; ...
</p>
<p>
6. Can we think of a tangible output in a short-medium term, i.e. a paper, a chapter or a conference workshop?
</p>
<p>
7. How can we support the virtual workshops? Which platform? How do we combine them with f2f workshops? (global plan...)
</p>
<p>
8. Can we provide &quot;tools&quot; so that new OERs or new activities - courses are generated based on the &quot;open design process&quot;? How can people feel and see that they can complete the whole cycle and have something useful in practice?
</p>
<p>
9. How can we study the entry points and the different paths of the &quot;OpenDesign process&quot; in the new scenario?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
These are some ideas!

                   In addition to the thread of the workshops, I think a short-term interesting task could be thinking about how our existing tools could support the proposed scenarios (I think this is a Gráinne's idea<span class="submitted">) so that we can identify missing &quot;links&quot; (or &quot;glue&quot;)<br />
