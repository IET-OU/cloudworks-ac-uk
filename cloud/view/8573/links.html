        <p>Making it Happen&rsquo;, Supporting or Engendering Open Academic Practice using Jorum Open Educational Resources (OERs) within a manufacturing environment (using a manufacturing environment as a case study). <br /><br />Abstract<br />The content within this presentation is aimed at anyone interested in engendering open academic practice outside of academia . The title of this presentation is &lsquo;Making it Happen&rsquo;, Supporting or Engendering Open Academic Practice using Jorum Open Educational Resources (OERs) within a manufacturing environment (using a manufacturing environment as a case study). The theme of the presentation is implementation. What the theme of implementation means in terms of the conference theme is that audience members will receive a pilot. The intention of the pilot is to demonstrate to audience members a combination of practical and theoretical ways by which to Support or Engender Open Academic Practice. Paraphrasing Mackness (2013), Open Academic Practice Is achieved by sharing, being social, connecting, networking , working in communities of practice, communicating, building relationships , using technology , publishing, and having a belief in social learning theories. <br />What audience members can expect to learn is the following.<br />&bull; Some key definitions for example, Open Educational Resource (OER), Open Academic Practice and Jorum. <br />&bull; Ways in which Jorum has engendered my open academic practice. <br />&bull; The impact on practice of using Jorum (from practical User Stories within Jorum). <br />&bull; Theoretical definitions of socio-technical theory, including principles, concepts and factors . <br />&bull; How to engender open academic practice outside of academia (a model or a framework) for engendering open academic practice. <br />&bull; A casestudy of organisational change as a result of open knowledge management approaches to engendering open academic practice outside of academia.<br />&bull; A Framework/Model for organisational change &ndash;socio-technical model.<br />&bull; That there is a gap in research around engendering open academic practice outside of academia.<br />One of the reasons that the presenter chose the topic was that she observed in some of the tutor group forums within Module H818 that some students (including the presenter herself) were not familiar with Jorum. This situation set the seed in the presenters mind to proceed to find out the features and affordances of Jorum and how it could engender open academic practice and in what context . Why the presenter chose to research Jorum was for the reason that the presenter works in a manufacturing environment. The presenter was interested to find out for herself if Jorum could engender open academic in a manufacturing environment.<br />To start with, the research approach that the presenter took to the topic was to begin with finding out how to log on to Jorum to get an understanding of how it could engender open academic practice. The next practical step in the research process that the presenter took was to go through the tabs within Jorum to search for positive User stories related to Engendering Open Academic practice http://www.jorum.ac.uk/about-us/user-stories. <br />After that, the presenter took a practical approach, developing and depositing an open educational resource within Jorum. The next step that the presenter took was to share the links to her Open Educational Resource http://find.jorum.ac.uk/find/?utf8=✓&amp;q=avril. The presenter deposited her open educational resource Following on from this the presenter shared statistics downloaded from Jorum, based on the OER deposit. Then the presenter shared the statistics in the H818 tutor group forums. In this presentation the presenter has shared evidence of her own primary data collection using Jorum . <br />While literature review was undertaken to source primary and secondary sources of information (data, research , surveys, case studies) of how Jorum supports or engenders open academic practice in manufacturing organisations, surprisingly , the presenter was unable to locate existing literature /evidence specifically related to how Jorum could engender open academic practice in manufacturing organisations. For this reason the presenter reverted to presenting her own evidence using herself as a case study. The presenter used Jorum discovering that personally for her Jorum had engendered a change in her in terms of open academic practice . This presentation provides evidence from personal perspective on how to engender open academic practice using jorum, and from a User stories perspective http://www.jorum.ac.uk/about-us/user-stories. <br />This presentation looks at what theoretical perspectives and what a case study examples tell us about the topic of engendering open academic practice. This presentation takes into consideration different perspectives on engendering open academic practice.<br />The types of findings that are presented in this presentation are a combination of personal findings (using Jorum and doing personal research around the topic title) along with theoretical findings based on literature review. The key message within the presentation is that engendering open academic practice outside of academia requires a belief in socio-technical systems theory. <br />Within my presentation I have inserted my contact details. The aim of this approach is to continue to network on line with anyone interested in engendering open academic practice outside of academia (in particular in manufacturing organisations). Audience members can connect with me during and after the conference on face book, twitter, slide share, YouTube and linked in. <br />The potential value of my research for anyone interested in engendering open academic practice might be that it could be used as trigger for anyone interested in engendering open academic practice using Jorum to connect with or partner with academia in order to gain expert insights into theoretical ways/partnerships that can be built upon to engender open academic practice. <br />Keywords essential to this topic: OER, Open Educational Resources, Jorum, Supporting, Engendering, Open Academic Practice.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Potential resources for the presentation (not all inclusive full references list to be confirmed in the presentation).<br />Atkins, D., Brown, J. and Hammond, A.
