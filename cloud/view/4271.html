        <p>We aim by the end of September 2010 to produce a short list of priorities for those involved in teaching classical reception in universities. This will include theoretical/pedagogical issues for debate and also practical aspects such as: sharing of resources; support for non-specialists and those teaching classical reception for the first time; teaching priorities in career development for graduate students and post-doctoral academics.</p>    </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>Here is my opening contribution to our discussion. I suggest 2 priorities for us to work on during September:</p>
<p>1) identify up to&nbsp;6 key issues in teaching classical reception and use those as the basis for our annual e seminar (October - February). Each topic to have a 'lead' person who will introduce it and invite comments (the e seminar will be advertised on clasicists' e mail lists and crsn website etc. The job of this working group will be to set the agenda by identifying the priority topics and appointing a leader for each.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here is my short list:</p>
<p>what kinds of classical reception are we concerned with? (eg as part of conventional classics study? as study of the 'afterlife' of Greek and Roman material? as a link with other subjects?)</p>
<p>how can we best use classical reception topics as an entree to undergraduate study (for classics students and for other arts students). how can we make that rigorous?</p>
<p>can classical receptions be studied as an integral part of a classics degree? if so how (and what would be displaced in order to make room?). If not, what provision is needed at Masters' level?</p>
<p>how can we best support those who teach classical receptions but do not have a research specialism or training in this field?</p>
<p>what is the role of the ancient languages in teaching and learning inclassical reception? how can we develop this?</p>
<p>what national differences are there (eg in scholarship/pedagogy/degree structures/studentconstituencies?)</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;as part of this working group discussion (ie before the end of September)&nbsp;we can&nbsp; also start to exchange ideas on how we can share materials/course outlines etc (eg via the CRSN website? via the Cloudworks site? or a mixture of both.</p>
<p>I now invite further comments!</p>
<p>Best wishes,Lorna.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks to Lorna for initiating the discussion!&nbsp;</p>
<p>These 6 points are a good starting point, and I'd also like to invite you all to comment around them, but also to suggest any additional priorities that you think should be discussed in the coming e-seminars. The aim should be to compile, collaboratively, up to 6 clearly articulated and distinct issues relating to classical reception and pedagogy, over the next couple of weeks, which can then be opened up for wider consideration in the e-seminars; the working group should, in the first instance, concentrate on compiling that list rather than delving too deeply into the underlying issues - though of course, any discussion that begins to arise here will be welcomed as a useful pre-emptive for the e-seminars.</p>
<p>To aid discussion, I'll distil Lorna's points into a numbered list. Might I suggest that we use this cloud (ie this discussion thread) to talk about these points (referring to the numbers will help)_, and to suggest new ones; and as I monitor discussion, I'll consider starting new 'clouds' for individual issues if they appear to be attracting a lot of comment. I have also started a new cloud for Lorna's point 2), on how we might support classical reception teaching in practical terms - please do contribute to that too.</p>
<p>So, our initial 6 points might be summarised as (and please do step in if you think I'm interpreting any of them wrongly):</p>
<p><strong>1. What kinds of classical reception are we concerned with? </strong>Or perhaps, can we (should we) pin down what we mean by classical receptions? Receptions within antiquity? in the modern world? etc etc</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Can we - <em>should we</em>&nbsp;- use&nbsp;classical reception topics as an entree (or inducement) to undergraduate study of the ancient world?</strong>&nbsp;If so, how do we ensure that it's rigorous?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>To add a little context here, I personally am very aware of how attractive 'film and the ancient world' undergraduate modules, such as those I regularly teach, are to students, because of the currency (and glamour) of the material, but also the perception that it'll be easy, because it's just sitting on the sofa and watching <em>Gladiator</em>, right? So how should I capitalise on the obvious 'marketing' potential of such teaching, whilst still ensuring academic rigour? I know how I try to do this and am happy to expand on this further, but would be interested to know how you all tackle similar issues!</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Can classical receptions be studied as an integral part of a classics degree? Where do receptions <em>belong</em>? </strong>Can reception be taught to first year undergrads? Should it be a compulsory part of a Classical Studies course? Or should it be for advanced undergrads only?</p>
<p><strong>4. How can we best support those who teach classical receptions but do not have a research specialism or training in this field? </strong>And indeed, how do we support those who <em>are </em>'trained'?</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>And what do we mean by such 'training' anyway? If my own postgraduate work concerned, primarily, cinematic receptions of antiquity, am I remotely qualified to teach undergraduates about classical receptions in English literature?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>5. What is the role of the ancient languages in teaching and learning in classical reception?</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. What national differences are there?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>

                   <p>I am especially interested in integrating the study of Latin and Greek, from the elementary level up, with classical reception, which means modifying and perhaps reconceptualizing &nbsp;how students are taught both languages. Since I favor reading method approaches, which do prepare at least our students admirably for tackling advanced classes focused on canonical authors, it is not hard to envision various possibilities for including &nbsp;more reception materials, and at an earlier point in study (in fact, some of the Catullus/Horace and Ovid readers produced by the same group that rewrote Ecce Romani for US audiences, contain excellent exercises involving translation and some cultural context).</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>Thanks to Lorna, Joanna, and Judith for the different threads of the discussion.</p>
<p>I welcome the 6-point approach in terms of focusing our agenda as a Working Group, but I am concerned that we might try to put too much out there. Would we circulate these discussion topics simultaneously, or would be release a discussion document (via the e-seminar), which features all six points? I imagine that some of our colleagues might not separate the questions in the way in which we have here and that this might end up fragmenting discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd recommend highlighting the challenges of teaching classical receptions and different approaches to integrating classical reception studies into the Classics curriculum. But we might not want to restrict it to Classics degrees. In response to Point 6 (national differences), the locus for classical receptions in many US Universities is in the core curricula (great books courses, general humanities courses, etc). In some universities Classics departments are heavily involved in these courses, but in many these courses function independently of, if not in opposition to, Classics depts. It would be great to address the question of how better resources for Classical Receptions might help to improve the dialogue with such courses and might better equip Classics departments in running courses that would appeal to Humanities students while at the same time taking the study of Classical receptions seriously.&nbsp;This also speaks to point 3: 'Where do Classical Receptions belong?'</p>
<p>Does this make any sense? Judith will have be much better informed about this than I am.</p>
<p>If we do focus on teaching, then Joanna's idea for a website would help to focus discussion by providing a body of materials that illustrate what kinds of Classical Receptions courses can be offered in Classics departments. Point 5 (the role of ancient languages in teaching classical receptions) would dovetail very neatly.</p>
<p>best wishes,</p>

                   <p>Yes, I agree that those look like excellent points for beginning a discussion. I do think we also need to think about graduate attributes in classical reception. I can see a real use for a clear series of statements about what skills/attributes we think teaching classical reception fosters in our students. Perhaps this can be included in point 1?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Emily points out in her post, one of the issues we will need to face is the sheer variety of ways in which reception is currently being taught or could be potentially taught. I wonder whether point 6 shouldn't be broadened out? Adding perhaps institutional contexts to the national contexts as well.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>A few things to add to this already interesting discussion (then I&rsquo;m going to expand on some of them in the thread on supporting teaching).</p>
<p>[1] &nbsp;I&rsquo;d like us to try and work in something about the challenges that studying classical receptions pose for students &ndash; this might well be a part of the support offered for tutors. As Jo notes, students often opt to study a reception course, thinking it&rsquo;ll be an &lsquo;easy option&rsquo; &ndash; it isn&rsquo;t (or certainly shouldn&rsquo;t be), and they do deserve to be properly prepared and have appropriate expectations.</p>
<p>[2] Alastair has made an important point about establishing baselines on graduate attributes &ndash; this is exactly the kind of thing that depts considering putting on reception courses will be looking for (perhaps an &lsquo;inducement&rsquo; to tutors to access the network!). I think this notion of establishing principles rather than particulars also applies more widely, and that should be the first task: to establish &lsquo;mission statements&rsquo; about what reception teaching is, its place in Classics as a taught academic discipline, the attributes it develops in students and how they transfer to other topics of study. (Although it does occur that I am coming a little late to the party and this may already have been done &ndash; apologies if this is the case and I&rsquo;ve missed it!)</p>
<p>[3] Jo asks if she is qualified to teach undergraduates about receptions in other media than film. My answer would be yes, and that this is precisely the point we need to make to students and tutors &ndash; that studying receptions develops your ability to recognise and learn to use new and appropriate critical practices, and that this is its great value to students in a multi-disciplinary subject like Classics.</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>Thanks for the comments so far.</p>
<p>Emily, you're right to raise the question of how we will proceed into the e-seminar in practical terms; I'll let Lorna take the lead on this, but perhaps we could all give the matter some thought, and let me know if you have any strong feelings about how best to canvass views from colleagues at that stage (particularly the question of whether we invite discussion on a series of points - it doesn't have to be 6, and it doesn't have to be these ones! - simultaneously or successively.)</p>
<p>For now, I'm already getting a sense of how some of the key issues might become crystallised, so do keep chucking ideas out there; I can provide a digest of them if that would be helpful.</p>
<p>From the comments made so far, a couple of points emerge.</p>
<p><strong>1:&nbsp;</strong>Emily's comment about the different loci of reception teaching in the US is really useful and reminds us what a diverse picture we're dealing with here; we need to try to stay on top of these different national contexts and, as Alastair says, institutional ones too. Related to this, I have another suggestion for an 'issue' - whether it's a whole new one or perhaps just related to<strong> point 3, where do reception studies belong </strong>- and that is to address the (for me) fundamentally important - and tricky - question of whether we really want to be calling this 'classical reception studies' in the first place.... My concerns with this label usually accompany my research, but they're clearly important to teaching too; Emily reminds us that we're wrong to think about reception pedagogy only within 'classics' courses; and even within the UK, where we're not typically dealing with the 'Great Books' approach, we probably all recognise that 'Classics' only has limited applicability to what we teach. Many of my Film and the Ancient World students come from our Ancient History courses; and as I belong to a dept which also houses archaeologists and Egyptologists, I'm acutely aware of how much these related areas can - <em>must</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;offer us as reception specialists. What do we think? Is it OK to keep using 'classical reception studies' as a convenient shorthand? If so, how do we emphasise that we're not only talking about Classic/al Studies students here? Or should we bite the bullet now and think about moving toward different labels...?</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Second point relates to Kim and Alastair raising the question of 'mission statements' &nbsp;- I think this is really important; the question, though, is whether we want to try to compile something like this now, or to use this discussion and the ensuing e-seminars to help focus the issues, and put it together afterwards. I might favour the latter - if e-seminars can be used so that those not in the Working Group who want a say can have one, then any mission statement will better reflect the collective view. Already we're seeing how the assumptions that we may have about what reception 'is', where it belongs etc, may differ among us - not in an antagonistic sense but simply through lack of knowledge of our different experiences - and so perhaps a little more conversation would be helpful before we lay down the law...? ;-)</p>        </div>

                   <p>Oh, and if you'll all indulge me a little longer, I just want to throw this out there as provocation, really: in the most recent <em>Arion</em>, I'd recommend Charles Martindale's review article (based on Page duBois' recent book, which I've not yet read), because it confronts many of the issues we're already discussing, and some more which we perhaps ought to be, and is likely to provoke some quite strong feelings from this constituency.... There's a number of choice cuts in there - I'll just offer this one for now (where Charles is pinpointing the danger of the 'triumph of reception'): <em>'The openness is commendable; the danger is amateurishness, de-skilling in some traditional areas (e.g. language and textual criticism), a lack of focus and communality, particularly if reception is not figured as a two-way process of understanding which illuminates antiquity as much as modernity.' </em>(143-4)</p>

                   <p>Many thanks to all who are contributing. I've meditated on what you say and I think we need to proceed in quite careful steps. the first essential is to identify a small and manageable number of key areas/questions that we could use as the basis of a wider and open discussion later in the autumn (via the e seminar). So we should focus on identifying those really crucial issues (so far, I've noted: 1) How best to integrate language learning ; 2) (subliminal but important )What kinds of 'texts' does reception teaching need to deal with - modern and well as ancient, and what kinds of analytic skills do students need (and at which level) and 3) what difference are/should there be in different instituional situations</p>
<p>I'd like to suggest that as we go on we try to pick a topic/theme leader for each of the crucial areas. that person could then be the leaderand introduce the topic when we open out into the e seminar later this autumn.</p>
<p>All best wishes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>and as a follow up, i think we should hold back on anything 'prescriptive' - that kind of thing would be more likely to be counter-productive. There are important and contentious questions about how reception teaching converges with and diverges from the rest of the classics/AH curriculum. Maybe for teaching purposes we need to think more closely about 'what's classical about classical reception'?</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>Some belated comments on Jo&rsquo;s distillation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;The reception students I first taught were first years, and all admitted they felt they didn&rsquo;t know enough about the Classical world to write their coursework. It&rsquo;s clearly an issue. The best work I marked was on computer games, because it arose from topics students had a pre-existing interest in, rather than something they had to scrabble around for in order to write the assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I agree with Emily that we need to be careful not to become too diffuse. Perhaps a prioritisation is needed. In the immediate future, I can see that the very practical issues of who is taught, how, by whom and when is very important in order to secure a future for the people, posts and resources involved. This would require a longer-term analysis of what the discipline is all about,&nbsp; obviously, but we have people coming through the institutional system who need looking after now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I echo Jo&rsquo;s point about employability on the other thread. I was aware that by doing a reception PhD I was reducing my employability since Classics departments needed junior academics to teach the traditional courses, particularly languages, and had to make huge efforts to ensure that my PG teaching demonstrated I could do this, and I&rsquo;m not sure whether it was enough. In increasingly difficult economic times, people need to demonstrate versatility. This is often a reception student&rsquo;s greatest strength, but it can look like fragmented superficiality and an inability to teach the basics. One major issue to think about has to be what reception studies is doing for Classics and Classicists in terms of those who stay within the field and those who move beyond it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So I think my focus is on practicalities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;One further point would be on evaluation, linked to teaching and research. How do we evaluate students' or scholars'work and how might this differ from other parts of Classics?</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I'd like to pick up and develop something which I think was reflected in various ways in various contributions, especially Emily's and Cressida's. &nbsp;It is about where teaching and learning in classical reception studies belongs. &nbsp; I'd like to propose a focus on where it is taking our students.</p>
<p>Although not all our undergraduates &nbsp;- or even our MA students - go on to research careers, it is of course important that whatever undergraduate education we offer our students should be such as to enable them to do this, if they want to and have interesting ideas worth pursuing. &nbsp;This is something UK classicists have of course been wondering about since language learning requirements were relaxed for undergraduate entry some decades ago - something from which I certainly profited as there was no Latin or Greek on offer at my school.</p>
<p>Now, undergraduate students who do some work in classical reception studies may not be doing it in the context of a degree in classics (broadly construed); or they may be doing it in that context but their project may focus on, say, ancient Rome and fascism, or the ancient and modern chorus. &nbsp;These different constituencies will have rather different needs even in the course of their undergraduate degrees: a theatre studies student who wants to do a project on modern performances of ancient drama will have very different gaps in her knowledge and background competences from a classics student attempting the same topic, although both will have gaps! But then, if and when either of them proceeds to more advanced work, it is very important for her to have a clear idea about where she will eventually aim to make a contribution, both in terms of teaching (Cressida's point) and in terms of research. &nbsp;I think it's our duty to make sure that we develop classical reception studies teaching in such a way that those students who take up our encouragement to pursue work in this area are still able to follow the usual career progression routes into academia, should they so wish.</p>
<p>Now when I think of the way in which classical reception studies offered me an opportunity to forge a career in classics, I think my path is rather different from many of my immediate contemporaries' (e.g. Jo's), as I did graduate work in modern history and political philosophy on topics completely unrelated to the ancient world, and then developed a research project designed explicitly to speak to classicists as a way back in to that discipline. &nbsp;For many others it's the other way around: a classics undergraduate degree leads to doctoral work that speaks to musicologists, to theatre studies or film studies, to English literature or to modern history, and the anxiety is not 'how do I get classicists interested in my work' but 'how do I ensure that it meets the standards historians/theatre/film people set'? &nbsp;Call me case A, the other way around case B. &nbsp;As a case A person I'm constantly amazed at my luck in having been welcomed back into the UK classics community so warmly, and at having found employment as a postdoc and then a researcher in not just one, but three UK Classics Departments &nbsp;(this would NEVER have happened the other way around - if I had done a Ph.D. in Classics and then tried to get a job in an analytic philosophy department I'd have been laughed out of court). &nbsp;Luck of timing played a part here, and I'm sure that my ability to teach both ancient languages, and the firm grounding in reading of canonical texts provided for me by my Oxford undergraduate education, were also important in making me look employable. &nbsp;For case B people, whom I think may be in the majority, I may be being naive but I think that they need to make the case that they can bring a perspective to the study of the (often indirectly) classical aspects modern films, or fascism, or whatever it is which is distinctive <em>precisely in virtue </em>of coming at it from a background in classics, rather than Italian studies or film or whatever. &nbsp;And they should design their research projects in such a way that they make the best use of their distinctive knowledge and skills - in other words, think not in terms of 'I need to do this exactly as a modern historian would' but 'what can I bring to the table in virtue of my classics training, which will be recognized by others (historians too) as useful and innovative?'</p>
<p>In both cases it seems that the aspiring researcher/lecturer's demonstration that they have the skills necessary to make a contribution rests in part on their AOS in classical reception, but also on their general competence as someone with a good knowledge of classics. &nbsp;So we need to make sure that however we locate classical reception studies in undergraduate and Masters courses, it is done in such a way as to enable students to develop these general competences as well as their exciting areas of specialization. Work in CRS may form a pathway to an academic career in different disciplines, but we need to make sure that it always forms part of an education that will equip our students for an academic career in at least one recognized discipline, should they wish to pursue this and should they be sufficiently able. &nbsp;As I said, I think this is simply our duty to our students - we should not encourage them to go down paths that look very likely to lead to a dead-end. &nbsp;I suppose it partly boils down to the old chestnut of what is the appropriate role of 'disciplinarity' in 'inter-disciplinarity'?</p>
<p>A final thought: it would be very interesting to conduct a survey of Ph.D.s produced in classical reception studies over the past ten years, and where those students are now working. &nbsp;Some that I can think of have gained academic posts in departments with an ancient world-y focus (me, Jo, Miriam, to name but three), some are currently working in the university sector but not as primarily as researchers or teachers (Kim, Cressida), others are working as lecturers but not in Classics Departments (Katie Fleming, Isobel Hurst).</p>

                   <p>Lots to think about there, Katherine - thanks; while I go away and digest it, a quick thought occurs: I like your idea of a survey, and I wonder whether this might form a useful part of the working group's activities? Not necessarily to be done instantly but maybe over the next couple of months, so that any resources/mission statements that we do build up can be based on more than just anecdotal experiences/impressions... might just be worth finding out not only about destinations of reception PGs, but also getting a picture of what reception teaching *does* go on. Of course, a good deal of this information may already have been garnered by the Classics Mapping Project, for the UK at least; I will happily look into that, but what do others think about the benefits of doing a survey more generally?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Cressida and Katherine both raise the issue of employability for reception graduates, and (rightly) say that we should be building in the opportunity to acquire more general competencies to equip students for future teaching careers. But the excerpt from Martindale's recent article, quoted by Jo, highlights the issue at the other end:&nbsp;the continuing difficulty of being taken seriously as&nbsp;a scholar if your specialism is reception. Martindale's accusations of "amateurism" rang especially hollowly - it seems to me that reception is still too rarely accepted as a topic of academic expertise on its own, but must be a (necessarily amateur) sideline tacked onto a more 'serious' topic of research before you can be taken seriously as an academic. The problem&nbsp;is, of course, circular - to increase the employability of graduates, attitudes need to change towards reception as a scholarly topic; to persuade the Classics community that reception is a scholarly topic, it must be researched and taught rigorously by dedicated scholars - who cannot get jobs because the topic is not considered sufficiently scholarly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, I agree that a survey of destinations among reception post-docs would be very&nbsp;interesting - though I do wonder whether our first focus should be here or on more practical aspects of undergrad teaching and learning.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks for all of these thoughtful responses. &nbsp;Emily's point on the distinctive nature and organization of US university study merits reiteration. The reason I raised the issue of integrating reception into Latin and Greek courses from the elementary level onward is that I devote an entire "general education course", an honors seminar that fulfills the literature requirement of our core curriculum (soon to be dropped, by the way), to classical reception---but none of the students are classics concentrators, and indeed most are in engineering and computer sciences. By way of contrast, &nbsp;reception plays virtually no role in what the students in my lower-level classical language classes are learning (though once they reach the intermediate level I am more easily able to integrate it)...&nbsp;</p>        </div>
