<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I was the teacher of a Year 11 GCSE English Literature class.&nbsp; The class was nominally &lsquo;top set,&rsquo; yet many of the class, particularly the boys, had difficulty in thinking and working independently.&nbsp; Essays they produced on poetry showed understanding of the texts, but little in the way of inference and developed interpretation.&nbsp; Several of the class, however, displayed exceptional insight in their responses. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>The class had six hours of lessons per fortnight, made up of four single hours and one &lsquo;double.&rsquo;&nbsp; The default location was the classroom &ndash; this had a whiteboard and projector by my desk.&nbsp; Pupils had a place at a desk, allocated through a seating plan.&nbsp; To encourage collaboration, pupils were seated around desks in mixed-ability groups of 5 or 6.&nbsp; Desires of the pupils ranged from wanting to work hard to get an A* in their exam, to simply wanting to get through an hour&rsquo;s lesson without having to write too much.&nbsp; In this situation, group work was imbalanced &ndash; even when specific roles were allocated, the more able ended up doing more work.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>I was aiming to improve the quality of students&rsquo; written responses to poetry exam past-papers &ndash; success measured by an improvement in marks awarded for inference, insight, and independent interpretation.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>&nbsp;I looked through the pupils&rsquo; practice-exam responses, attempting to isolate a key difference between those who had scored highly, and those who had not.</li>
</ol><ol start="2">
<li>There were a few factors, such as less sophisticated vocabulary, sentence structures, and punctuation &ndash; but the one which stood out was that those who scored poorly had very short explanations of quotations they had used.</li>
</ol><ol start="3">
<li>I thought about possible actions to address this, ranging from teacher-talk to group-work; but I wanted to come up with a way that would combine the benefits of collaboration with the necessity of pupils thinking and writing for themselves.&nbsp; I decided that I would have students working collectively to produce an exam-style response to poetry; one team would produce one essay, made up of contributions of individuals.&nbsp; As a Star Trek fan, this reminded me of the Borg &lsquo;collective,&rsquo; which led to this lesson being called &lsquo;We are Borg!&rsquo;</li>
</ol><ol start="4">
<li>I decided that one of the reasons group-work had not always been successful was that some of the boys were relying on the girls to do the work.&nbsp; To combat this, I split the class into two teams, boys vs girls, a near-even split.</li>
</ol><ol start="5">
<li>I allocated a poem/exam question to each team.&nbsp; I then sub-divided the teams into smaller groups, each responsible for analysing and explaining one aspect of the poem.&nbsp; Some members of the teams were given the task of overseeing the work of the sub-groups, co-ordinating responses.</li>
</ol><ol start="6">
<li>Pupils responded well to the element of competition, and there was a buzz of enthusiasm in the room.&nbsp; However, it was difficult to co-ordinate everything, as it required pupils to move around a lot to share ideas.</li>
</ol><ol start="7">
<li>After the lesson, I decided to combat this using Google Docs, which would allow real-time collaboration without movement.&nbsp; I set up and shared a document for each team, showing their essay question and an outline.</li>
</ol><ol start="8">
<li>The next lesson was in an ICT suite, with girls on one side and boys on the other.&nbsp; I went through the shared document carefully, reminded pupils of the aspect of the poem they were analysing, and set them off.</li>
</ol><ol start="9">
<li>Two of the girls&rsquo; &lsquo;overseers&rsquo; were absent.&nbsp; This meant that I had to spend more time helping the girls co-ordinate everything at the beginning.&nbsp; This meant that I didn&rsquo;t immediately realise a problem the boys were having: even working in smaller groups on one paragraph, it could be confusing having so many writers working at once.&nbsp; I had to narrow down roles further and reduce the number writing at once.</li>
</ol><ol start="10">
<li>Occasionally, Google Docs would disconnect on a computer, not allowing further editing until it reconnected.&nbsp; This slowed the process down.</li>
</ol><ol start="11">
<li>At the end of the lesson, each team printed out a copy of their collaborative response.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The two finished responses were very good &ndash; each paragraph showed evidence of detailed and developed inferences, and the pupils were proud to have an example of a high-grade essay to which they had contributed.&nbsp; However, although the next set of individual responses was much improved, many pupils had failed to produce a complete answer.&nbsp; They had some very detailed individual paragraphs, at the expense of a complete essay.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>I was most pleased by how much pupils enjoyed the experience &ndash; the most significant result was perhaps not the improvement of inference, but in that everybody in the class had seemed motivated and engaged, working hard.&nbsp; However, I think the scale was too ambitious &ndash; having 15 people working simultaneously on a document was difficult to co-ordinate, and either Google Docs or our network struggled.&nbsp; Moreover, as the task was so different from the &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; activity of writing an individual exam response, the outcome was not as successful as I had anticipated.</p>

			<p>I've embedded my plan for an imagined H800 Block 1 Revision activity (link to Google Photos).</p>
<p>Reading the Dimitriadis interview yesterday made me question how useful such software could be in helping to plan the creative process (rather than representing already planned lessons).</p>
<p>I found the tool more useful than I expected, allowing me to move activities around or add in additional ones as they came to me.&nbsp; The process was very slow, however - this took a while to prepare, and the fictional resources mentioned would also take a long time to create.&nbsp; I'm not sure that using this tool would result in a different lesson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to have a way to represent timings of parts of the lesson - and perhaps a grid so that I could align the icons!</p>			<div class="posted-by">
