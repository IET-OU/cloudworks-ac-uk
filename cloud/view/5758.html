                   <p>I am increasingly interested in mental health in young people.&nbsp; At my schoool we teach 'Emotions for Learning' (E4L) to 4-6 year olds, followed by 'Philosophy' for the next two years.&nbsp; We are now looking to teach Mindfulness to the older (11-13 year olds).&nbsp; This is a project that is working very well in schools at present.&nbsp; Have a look at <a href="http://mindfulnessinschools.org/" rel="nofollow">http://mindfulnessinschools.org/</a>&nbsp;to find out a bit more.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks for this link, David - very interesting. Good to see that novelist Tim Parks (whose new book looks fascinating - I was just reading a review of it) will be speaking at the Mindfulness in Schools conference.</p>
<p>I think the mental health and wellbeing of young people is finally getting the attention it deserves. For many years, the lack of trained child and adolescent mental health professionals, especially psychotherapists, was a scandal, but the last government put some resources into training - I do hope this doesn't get cut.</p>
<p>I find the Young Minds website a great place to keep up to date with developments in the field. In the past, i had some contact with the Child Psychotherapy Trust - but I don't think they are still going....?</p>        </div>

                   <p>I attended the Mindfulness conference at Tonbridge School last week and Tim Parkes was a speaker, i bought his book ('Teach us to sit still')&nbsp;as he was&nbsp; fascinating with a great story to tell.&nbsp; I have also bought a book called 'Mindfulness-finding peace in a frantic world' by Mark Williams and Danny Penman, the former also spoke at the conference and if his practical guide is anywhere near as good as his speaking, it will be worth the money.</p>
<p>At the conference several youngsters&nbsp;, mostly from State schools, spoke to delegates about their experiences of using Mindfulness in their lives, they were hugely impressive young people who were not afraid to talk about the emotional sides of their lives, something us British often would rather not do, hence i suspect our pretty awful&nbsp;standing in the world&nbsp;happiness rankings!</p>        </div>

                   <p>as&nbsp;a safeguarding social worker I regularly come across young people who are struggling with their emotional and mental health, and of course I also see the effect this has on them as well as their families and more extended networks. Sadly by the time they come to our attention because of their 'issues' the need for service imput is great, and that service is not (in my experience) there for them. If children are receiving support and imput in schools to encourage them to be more emotionally open with others as well as themselves, then I am sure this will have a positive influence on them as they move into adolescence and adulthood. this can only be a good thing - keep up the good work david. I will look at the books you mentioned and see if I can use any of the information in my practice, given other specialist services appear to fail so many of our young children when they are in crisis.</p>        </div>
