<li>Goals: looking to improve their interpersonal sills and enhance their business acumen so that they can get a promotion or grow their business</li>
<li>Setting: ultimate flexibility required. The course has to fit around their business hours and any home commitments.

<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>
<p>David feels stymied in his career. He's been in the same positon for five years. He has monitored open positions for some time and noticed that they require more business training then he currently has. He's looking for a way to acquire the additional knowledge but is concerned about his ability to work a class into his schedule. As he is scanning a weekly digest from one of his LinkedIn groups, he notices an advertisement for a Business Psychology open online course and is intrigued. He decides to click on the link just to check it out. After reading the description, David decides that this course is exactly what he has been looking for. David registers for the class. The registration process is so easy and the course platform looks very user friendly. Plus, the course included a pre-programmed calendar that he was able to just add to his existing calendar. Now all his activities and due dates are programmed. He's excited. This just might work.</p>
<p>The completed registration process takes him to a profile screen where profile information is gathered. But it's not your typical profile. This survey asks him things like what time he prefers to study, how many hours a day and week will he be able to invest, when's the best meeting times for group work and the like. After the survey is complete, David is provided with a listing of study groups that best matches his profile. Now he's really excited, he gets to work with people with similar schedules. David selects a study group and is immediately connected into the group through Google+. The study group leader welcomes David to the group. A positive connection is made.</p>
<p>At the end of the first week, David receives an electronic survey asking him about his experience. He's asked about the study group, the workload, and other matters. Wow, they really care about how I experience this class. This is really cool. David really feels connected and accountable.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback??</strong></p>    </div>

    
<h2 id="extra-content">Extra content</h2>
    		<div class="extra-content">
			<a name="content-1878"></a>
			<p>Based on review of the comments and completion of the ecology of resources,&nbsp;I would add to the initial design scenario, the following:</p>
<p>In evaluating the Open Online Course, David notes that it brings together many resources that he would struggle to access on its own. It is integrated with many of the leading business journals and blogs and he's even able to receive feeds from the ones the he selects as most useful to him. The course also filters and organizes websites through its integration of thinks like pearltrees and SoMe. It becomes pretty clear that the benefits of the course will continue long after completion of the coursework.</p>
<p>He also likes the notion of having to&nbsp;interact with his peers, supervisor, and mentors, periodically throughout the course. He believes that this interaction will allow him to practice what he's learning and will also improve his relationships.&nbsp;As David progresses in the course, he&nbsp;begins to notice a shift in how his comments are received amongst his peers. He notices that his opinion is being queried more. Midway through the course, David is asked to chair a project initiative that he&nbsp;knows&nbsp;has high visibility in his organization. He's&nbsp;excited about the possibility but he's also terrified.&nbsp;Career success or failure rides on how he handles this project. He feels fortunate that he has developed a network that he can tap into for advice as he moves&nbsp;along in the project.</p>
<p>By the&nbsp;end of the course, David's confidence has grown. His leadership skills have started to surface. He has recognized the importance of contiunal learning and is anxious to&nbsp;enroll in another course that will continue to advance his capabilities. He&nbsp;has begun to see possibilities&nbsp;as he networks with more executives through the project he was assigned.&nbsp;</p>			<div class="posted-by">

                   <p>I like your scenario, because it identifies both the logistics and the motivation/attitude of the learner. I can see how this could be the basis for understanding how what David studies on the course could be linked with what he does at work. Maybe the learning activities could involve trying things out in 'real life' at work and his colleagues could also become mentors on occassions. The course might help him to realise what he does, what skills he needs to work towards, and also what learning opportunities exist for him at work.</p>        </div>

                   <p>A great example scenario, thanks. One thing I guess you would want to do now is expose it critique, particulary by people who are the target users or even try it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how close I am to the kind of learner you are targeting but I am guessing that one of the things I would want if I was David is some kind of feeling of how this course eventually meets what my motives appear to be, i.e getting past stymied in my career. I wonder whether it would be worth exploring beyond the end of your current story to a satisfactory resolution of the stymiedness and trying to be explicit about the role the course plays in that (a particular kind of certificate? a portfolio? a change in David... just wondering...</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>I really love this scenario. I think it's a great idea to match students' availability and preferences and present study group options. I also like that there are still options with this ... it doesn't automatically put someone in a study group but provides good suggestions. It actually reminds me of a survey I had to do when moving into my university residence for my first year of my undergrad where they matched us with a roommate - although it is a different context I remember feeling the positive feelings that you describe in David about the institution really caring and about getting a personalized experience.</p>
<p>I also like the idea of the survey about student experience while the course is still live in addition to when it is over. I'm wondering if after the first week it may be too early though considering how different the first week can be compared to the rest of a course? Or would there be a survey every week or at other points? If there were a limited number due to resources involved with collecting/analyzing data, maybe a third and two-thirds of the way through the course could work? (When I was the "limited resource" this schedule worked well for me.) You also may want to consider sharing with the students some analyzed data from the feedback surveys.</p>        </div>
