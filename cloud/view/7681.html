        <p class="Body1">Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p class="Body1">This is about a day-long workshop, on three-scene storyboarding, for teachers and other careers workers, for their programme managers and for interested academics.&nbsp; In advance of the workshop participants can access two sources...&nbsp;</p>
<p class="body1" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" rel="nofollow">an illustrated account of underpinning thinking<br /></a><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbstrybrd.ppt" rel="nofollow">an animated workshop presentation</a></p>
<p class="Body1">The process starts with a question:</p>
<ul>
<li>what do you hope for from this?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">That opening-up question becomes a continuing conversation.&nbsp; But, to start with, participants are introduced to the process of creating a storyboard.&nbsp; They are asked to recall a turning-point episode in their own life, or of some other person with whom they can empathise.&nbsp; In work-table groups of 4-5, they compare that storyboarding experience.&nbsp; They can then revise their storyboard, or abandon it and start again.&nbsp; In forming and re-forming groups for this work they are encouraged to work with people they have not met before today.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">Throughout the day they are asked variants of four questions...</p>
<ul>
<li>what do you now hope for from this workshop?</li>
<li>what question do you have on how to work with storyboarding?</li>
<li>what reservations do you have about it?</li>
<li>what potential can you find, or not find, in it?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">Their ideas engage cross-flowing interaction in the whole group - the questions become...</p>
<p align="center"><em>...who has similar ideas?</em><br /><em> ...who has different? </em><br /><em> ...who has contrary? &nbsp;</em><br /><em> ...who has something not yet mentioned?</em></p>
<p class="Body1">At some point during the day everybody has said who they are, and have shown what they have to contribute.&nbsp; Sources of peer help are identified and professional links are made.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">All ideas are flip-charted for continuing review. &nbsp;And, here&rsquo;s the point, that on-going conversation makes it clear that some parts of the presentation need close examination, some can be skipped over, some can be ignored. &nbsp;There is a lot to storyboarding; we were never going to cover it all - but we don&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p align="center">____________________________</p>
<p class="Body1">Whatever learning up-the-front experts might anticipate, it is never identical to the learning that out-there experienced participants actually get.&nbsp; The back-and-forth learning between everybody in the place makes the workshop an innovative research-and-development event for us all.</p>
<p class="Body1">I&rsquo;ve set out five headings for what that exchange gave us.</p>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>1. hopes for how storyboarding might help people</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">helping them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>express a sense of identity</li>
<li>say what they need to say, that is what lies underneath what they do say</li>
<li>take charge of their own expression, and be calm where there is stress</li>
<li>enable people for whom language is not a tool but a hurdle</li>
<li>find and engage active learning-to-learn</li>
<li>find a focus in the complexity of contemporary life</li>
<li>help to visualise and recognise possible ways forward</li>
<li>be able to say it all out loud, meaning it becomes their commitment</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>2. ideas for how it might develop education professionalism</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">helping professionals to:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn a new tool for improved effectiveness</li>
<li>find new perspective for professional expansion</li>
<li>see how to recognise when storyboarding will, and will not, be useful</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>3. how-to-do questions</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">practitioners need to know more about...</p>
<ul>
<li>whether the turning-point has to be positive</li>
<li>whether it is for other peoples&rsquo; stories or only for the person&rsquo;s own</li>
<li>whether &lsquo;futuring&rsquo; (storyboarding&rsquo;s narrative form of action planning) runs from where the person was in the episode or from where that person is now</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>4. professional reservations </strong></p>
<p class="Body1">professionals need...</p>
<ul>
<li>a framework that gives a reason for doing this</li>
<li>to be convinced that storyboarding actually makes a useful difference</li>
<li>a feel for what can be safely shown in a storyboard - not risking too much disclosure</li>
<li>an idea of the policy focus for storyboarding - say for employability or well-being</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>5. ideas for storyboarding potential</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">working in this way can open-up possibilities...</p>
<ul>
<li>we use storyboarding according to whether or not there is a recognisable turning-point to look at</li>
<li>conversations are originated by the storyboard, so there is an ethical equality where both we and they learn from each other</li>
<li>storyboarded episodes must not be ignored - they require action</li>
<li>the &lsquo;futuring&rsquo; process needs to be un-resolved - and therefore open-ended</li>
<li>it means thinking about consequences of the facts, what they mean, this person&rsquo;s purpose</li>
<li>different turning-points, over a period, can reveal helpful patterns in a life</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">_______________________</p>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>issues</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">I should be clear that I'm the tutor here.&nbsp; But I don't claim I do it well - that&rsquo;s for others to say.&nbsp; I do claim, though, that something like this is required if education professionalism is to be respected, strengthened and voiced.</p>
<p class="Body1">The implication is that there can be no known-in-advance assumptions about outcomes and how they are to be reached.&nbsp; The workshop is a conversation between participants-and-tutor as a whole.&nbsp; And, in the cross-flow of ideas, that conversation is often between the authority of expertise and the authority of experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">It&rsquo;s true that there are unavoidable features of storyboarding format and process that need to be learned.&nbsp; But it's also true that participants need to say where they are, where they need to be, where they are going with it, and what is helping them - and hindering them.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">One of the most telling signs of what is learned is in the way they first design and then revise the storyboards they create.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">On-line exchange means that the thinking can be widely and continuously extended and made the basis for innovative action...</p>
<ul>
<li>finding what is critical to the value of storyboarding</li>
<li>realising what needs more thought, more discussion, or more enquiry</li>
<li>signposting needed changes in storyboarding format and process</li>
<li>prioritising future action</li>
<li>saying what I got wrong and whether I got anything right</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is why I'm putting it where there is a space - below - for such comments, ideas and purposes.</p>
<p align="center">_______________________</p>

<p align="center">some of the workshop storyboards will be made available at the career-learning caf&eacute; in due course - there will be an alert at...</p>
