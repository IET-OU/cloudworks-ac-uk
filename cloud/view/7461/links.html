    <div class="user-entry">

        <p>Why choosing this title? It's because I didn't keep up at all with the week 1 agenda of OLD MOOCS. I don't have a team yet! I didn't mind-map my dream design! I don't even have a dream design! Just a project, which is part of the long list of things I would really like to do as part of my day job. The project has its roots in my daily attempt to achieve something different in the midst of plodding on with serving others. The 'something different' was the dream of creating engaging triggers for learning resources in health care. In reality, my job is mostly about: being in the 'support staff' section, which entails responding to all sorts of weird and wonderful (and tedious) requests regarding technologies (or rather 'not coping with digital technologies') you could think of. Or better 'not think of'.</p>
<p>Hence I'm rather lost in these clouds. I do not request a badge. I didn't even manage to figure out what this badge thing is about. But I'm sure I read somewhere that I should write down my reflections on week 1 - here they are :-). And then, there was something about badges in this context, I think.</p>
<p>I'd be more interested in figuring out why on earth it seems so difficult for me to find my way in cloudworks. Lots of contributions from fellow cloudworkers in different spaces, but it seems a bit of pot luck to find out if there's anyone else wanting to work on 'engaging triggers' in healthcare, or even just on 'creating digital triggers', because there isn't a search function? Or did I miss it?</p>
<p>I did try another mooc before, and I didn't get anywhere with it at all. This time at least I did make a start. While writing this (at 20.52pm UK time) I see emails from my 2 email systems popping up, my husband comes in to ask me about different lighting systems, I do want to shorten a pair of trousers which would be incredibly useful to brace the sub zero temperatures we currently have in the UK, there's loads of dry washing behind me waiting to be sorted (my study doubles up as drying room, because it's in the attic ...), I promised someone to do 'just a little cover design' for a DVD which is supposed to be done by the end of this week, I'm thinking of my the new years message to my German friends I still haven't written nor sent, the photos from summer holidays in Italy are waiting to be posted to Flickr (oh, bliss: 2 weeks holidays without internet connection!!!). Probably it's just the same for everyone else trying to work in this mooc, and I'm wondering if I should hit the 'Create Cloud' button at all, because this whole ranting is a bit counterproductive, and ridiculous.&nbsp; I could have spent the 5 minutes it took me to write this rant to work on one the tasks. I should have, really. But I haven't, because I needed to get this off my chest, and I'm going to hit the 'create cloud' button. I do!!!</p>
