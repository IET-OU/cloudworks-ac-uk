			<h2>A Comprehensive Embedded Systems Lab for Teaching Web-based Remote Software Development</h2>
<p>Janusz Zalewski, Florida Gulf Coast University, USA</p>
<p>Real-time systems are embedded in very demanding applications and are taught mainly from the perspective of specification and design, rather than implementation and testing of such systems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Reasons for this includes: &nbsp;Hardware/Software maintenance issues, need local expertise in low-level programming to support the system, etc.</p>
<p>This work shows how it is possible to use web-based development and testing of real-time embedded systems. &nbsp;Lots of different hardware platforms are available for students to use.</p>
<p>Projects focus on remote access to data acquisition, instrumentation and control. &nbsp;Develop software at home, cross compile and upload to an actual device in the lab.</p>
<p>Paper presents a number of demonstration projects - including FPGA programming, wireless sensor networks and others.</p>
<p>FGCU has built and tested an extensive infrastructure for this type of project. &nbsp;The infrastructure supports over 36 students undertaking project courses.</p>
<p>The FGCU team are interested in finding international collaborators for developing and applying this technology.  At present it is only a proof of concept, and needs more infrastructure to allow it to be scaled to larger student numbers.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<h2>Using LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT and LeJOS in an Advanced Software Engineering Course</h2>
<p>Michael W. Lew, Thomas B. Horton, Mark S. Sherriff, University of Virginia, USA</p>
<p>Mindstorms NXT - programmable 'brick' (microcontroller, sensor a/d converter), bluetooth and USB communications. &nbsp;Education kit includes, brick, three motors, sensors for distance measurement (sonar), etc. &nbsp;Relatively cheap - approx. US$300 for a educational kit.</p>
<p>Mindstorms NXT are used widely in entry level computing courses, and at UVa are also used in 1st year Engineering courses. &nbsp;Also sometimes used for AI, Embedded Systems, Computer Architectures and OS courses.</p>
<p>Early courses use these for simple applications, aimed at learning problem solving skills, algorithms, learning to use an IDEs.</p>
<p>LeJOS: Allows programming of the 'brick' using Java (replaces standard firmware with a JAva VM.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">UVa project course emphasises using software engineering process, team working etc. to build a single large systems using the Lego Mindstorms NXT kit. &nbsp;Not using robots for the sake of learning about robotics, AI, etc., but to teach software engineering.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Robotics platform present a number of real-world challenges - equipment doesn't work as expected, communications delays need to be handled, use of 3rd party libraries.</p>
<p>Project course has a lecture component, hands on labs and studio labs (students prepare some prototype demo, or other software engineering artefact, such as a test plan, requirements document, etc, and present it to the class for critical feedback).</p>
<p>Minor project: Control robot on a course, simple sensing and data transmission. Quite well specified, giving students a chance to become comfortable with the development platform.</p>
<p>Major project: Autonomous robot, searching a maze and communicating with other robots. &nbsp;Goals include producing all requirements and design artefacts, presentation and reviews, working in small groups on overall project goal.</p>
<p>Assessment based on: Grading of all the deliverables,&nbsp;End of term 'Robot games' - lots of fun and gives students a lot of satisfaction. &nbsp;Does take a lot of time though!</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Findings:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">
<ul>
<li>students liked the platform for software engineering project and really do engage with these project. &nbsp;However, some didn't feel that all course learning objectives were met. Bluetooth communications don't always work as expected and led to a lot of frustration.</li>
<li>instructors didn't find the project hugely useful for teaching concepts such as threading, protocols or communications. &nbsp;It was better at teaching software engineering techniques. &nbsp;However, it was a very useful experience for teaching students the overall software development process.</li>
</ul>

			<h2>Information Systems Application Development &nbsp;Courses: Experiences in Global Pedagogy</h2>
<p>Randy Weinberg, Raja Sooriamurthi, Jeria Quesenberry</p>
<p>CMU has made a significant commitment to global education. Information Systems have been leading the way in this area - and have developed a curriculum that can support students in both the US and Qatar.</p>
<p>Requirement is that CMU curriculum, degree and awards are all the same wherever the student is studying from.</p>
<p>Information Systems curriculum focusses on using <strong>technology</strong> to help improve the <strong>processes</strong> people use.</p>
<p>CMU in Qatar: Full degree programmes in Pittsburgh and Qatar. Common curriculum, common assessments, common student services, distant student collaboration. &nbsp;Students should be able to change locations without noticing!</p>
<p>Differences between the programmes in Pittsburgh and Qatar are necessary due to cultural differences. &nbsp;Qatar Foundation has established a University City which has invited different universities to offer programmes in particular areas of expertise. &nbsp;For example CMU does CS, Business and IS, but Georgetown does International Relations and Foreign Policy education. &nbsp;Courses in the CMU IS programme are:</p>
<ul>
<li>IS Millieux</li>
<li>Fundamentals of Systems Development: includes business process re-engineering, computer architectures, creative design.</li>
<li>IS Application (capstone project course with real client)</li>
<li>IS Concepts (taught by CMU CS Dept)</li>
<li>App D&amp;D</li>
<li>SD Project (realistic junior project, but no real client)</li>
<li>Global Systems Delivery Models (elective): half-semester (2 credit) course that covers different systems delivery models for software around the world. &nbsp;Initially based around case studies but later revised to use more learning by doing.</li>
<li>Global Project Management&nbsp;(elective)</li>
<li>Special Topics&nbsp;(elective)</li>
</ul>
<p>Course development process needs to blend backgrounds of each member of the course team. &nbsp;Course materials need to be sensitive to the differences in local context - e.g., paying for parking is different in the US and in Qatar.</p>
<p>Challenges posed by needing different study calendars due to local customs and holidays.</p>
<p>VLE used is Blackboard - although the Qatar system cannot share information with Pittsburgh system.</p>
