        <h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>As an International Baccalaureate Chemistry teacher, I had to look at ways of incorporating the functions of our VLE into virtual lessons in case of school closure.</em></p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>In Jakarta, the school has had to close on a number of occasions, usually because of rain, but in the past, terrorist threats have also had an impact. Some of these events can last a number of days and so can significantly affect the number of teaching hours. The school adopted the VLE Moodle in order to be able to contact students virtually and lessen the effect of such closures.</em></p>
<p><em>One such closure took place in January due to flooding. Students, parents and teachers were informed on the school website and by text at 4:00 am on the day of closure. The expectation was that students would take the same classes online as they would have taken had they been in school. The normal class time would be 1&frac12; hour. The unit that was being studied, Kinetics, was being taught through a series of labs that were performed in order and structured activities on Moodle that could be done at the student&rsquo;s own pace.</em></p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>The lesson was about looking at the effect of catalyst on the rate of reaction. Students were required to relate the action of catalysts to their previous knowledge of collision theory and the distribution of molecular energies</em></p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>I reorganised the lesson order, as I couldn&rsquo;t find a simulation that could have replaced the lab that they should have been doing that day. </em></p>
<p><em>All students were sent on email telling them to look on the Moodle page for the Chat and to make sure that they had signed on to the chat at the start of the lesson.</em></p>
<p><em>In the introduction to the chat, I placed a link to a simulation to enable the students to determine the effect of a catalyst on rate in an attempt to mirror the experiment that they would have performed in class. There was also a worksheet provided with the simulation with steps to follow as to what to do with the activity and some follow up questions to the task.</em></p>
<p><em>Students also had access to other resources on Moodle, including a presentation on the action of catalysts that they could use to explain their results.</em></p>
<p><em>Any remaining time was to be used to complete the self-study part of the unit.</em></p>
<p><em>The chat room was open throughout the lesson time so that the students could seek clarifications and carry out the discussions that would normally take place while doing practical work.</em></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>Only 50 % of students were online at the start of the lesson, overall 75% of students accessed the activity in the allocated lesson time.</em></p>
<p><em>Interactions in the chat room mirrored the interactions in the classroom; those that normally asked a lot of questions and lead the discussion in class were the same students who dominated in the chat room.</em></p>
<p><em>All students completed the activity in good time. Learning this topic virtually had no noticeable impact on their understanding of the material as was shown by the results of the topic test given two weeks later (I had another class studying the same material but on a different day that I could use to compare results)</em></p>
<p><em>A complaint about the virtual day was that students ended up with far more homework than they would normally have had. Whether this was because they didn&rsquo;t use their allotted lesson time productively or that there was too much work set was not analysed.</em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>There was confusion amongst the students about the expectation that they attend their lessons virtually. This was exacerbated by the message that the school sent out which started with the school being closed and, at the end of a very long message, ended with the continuation of school virtually. Future messages, in the event of another closure, will now start with the announcement that it is a Virtual Day.</em></p>
<p><em>The chat room was a great way of keeping the lesson going virtually and better mirrored the classroom situation than a discussion forum would have done, due to the fact that students could ask short questions and know, because of the synchronous nature, they would be quickly seen and promptly answered.</em></p>
<p><em>I was very lucky that the current topic was pretty much a self-study unit so all I really needed to do was find a replacement for a lab. One of the problems I would foresee with trying to design a virtual lesson is getting the timing right. Most uses involve students tackling the work at their own pace and it would be rare to design online activities to be completed in a specific time slot. Given the same situation again, I would design a number of activities that cover more than one lesson, but ensure that I allocated class time when students were back in school for the completion of the activity.</em></p>    </div>
