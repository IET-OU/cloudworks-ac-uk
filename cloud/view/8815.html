        <p>I aim to use this cloud to add details of the Open Partnership Model (currently a work in progress). As our ideas develop, I will post working documents here.</p>
<p>I am interested to hear what other professionals think of these ideas so, if you would like to add to the discussions, please post below... join in the conversation.</p>
<p>Many thanks,&nbsp;</p>

			<p align="left"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Transcript of article published in Careers Matters, July 2014:</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Career Development and Systems Theory (STF): a further model: Open Partnership Model (OPM)</strong></p>
<p align="left"><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">Having begun a constructivist analysis of careers work (featured in the October 2013 edition of Careers Matters) Chris Targett and his colleagues are conducting ongoing research which, has resulted in developing an interpretive model of careers guidance; presented to delegates at this year&rsquo;s National &nbsp;Career Guidance Show in London and Leicester as &nbsp;work in progress.</em></p>
<p align="left"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Is this a new model?</strong></p>
<p align="left">We are reluctant to call this a &lsquo;new&rsquo; model, as it is a re-interpretation of different theories including those by Wendy Patton and Mary McMahon who, &nbsp;in their book <em>Career Development and Systems Theory, challenge us</em> to develop approaches which, respond to our changing understanding of careers.</p>
<p align="left"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Why is a further model important?</strong></p>
<p align="left">Our ideas are based on &lsquo;constructivism&rsquo; &ndash; that clients create meaning from experience. How we, as advisers affect this meaning is based on the questions we ask which are driven by our agendas.</p>
<p align="left">Bill Law, who wrote a follow up article to the initial analysis (see references), identified the need for a clear independence of agenda (from influences which did not place the client first). He felt that this was more important for clients and that, impartiality was almost impossible to achieve.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">We wanted to find a way to include these crucial insights into our work and find ways to discuss our various agendas with our clients so, they owned the context in which they make decisions ,in the same way counsellors declare their methods before working with clients. &nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Finally, we are under pressure as a profession to deliver to more students in less time; we wondered if there was a way to make our practice more flexible to achieve this, without compromising our professionalism and code of ethics.</p>
<p align="left"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">What did we come up with?</strong></p>
<p align="left">Our initial model grew to be eight stages long which, from feedback from advisers , (trialling the model in different settings) was too unwieldy .We reduced it to a basic three stage (elastic) model, with each stage being flexible based on the needs of our client (or group of clients) and time constraints.The differences between a ten minute and forty five minute session, with one or five students is significant!.</p>
<p align="left"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">ACTION 1</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Client expectations and adviser agenda(s) declared and agreed</strong></p>
<p>Before we work, we need to check that our client(s) are happy to work within our agenda(s) and check &nbsp;their expectations of the session . Are these realistic? Are assumptions being made? Are our clients happy to work this way?</p>
<p>If at this point we are stuck on our agendas, we should reflect and ask ourselves where we base our practice.</p>
<p>Our agendas form the basis of any challenge or question so, we need to identify those which are client-centred (e.g. raising aspirations) and those which are non-client centred (e.g. filling up a course quota). If at any point we stray into the latter, we know that we are no longer placing our clients first.</p>
<p align="left">Tony Watts has identified some of the agendas that different advisers take &lsquo;Radical, Liberal, Conservative and Progressive&rsquo; in <em style="line-height: 1.5em;">Rethinking Career Education and Guidance</em>; in contrast Bill Law has identified &lsquo;Philosophies for Careers Work&rsquo; which, is another way to consider our agendas.(See references).</p>
<p align="left">Depending upon which you subscribe to, these inform our questions which, affect the outcome of a client&rsquo;s decision; they define our &lsquo;transparent partiality&rsquo; (Tristram Hooley).</p>
<p align="left">Yet, we pride ourselves on being impartial, so how to resolve this dilemma? Our CDI Code of Ethics helps with this, as we are asked to &lsquo;declare anything which affects our impartiality&rsquo; which, as an approach informs the first stage of our model.</p>
<p align="left">We can declare our agenda(s) in a client-friendly way, for example: &ldquo;Part of my work is to explore with you what else is possible&hellip; is this ok?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am here to help you look at local opportunities... is this ok?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">It is how we phrase our agendas to clients which, our research is now considering.</p>
<p align="left">Through this first stage in our model, we enable clients to own the context they are making decisions within, by exploring this and their own expectations of the session.</p>
<p align="left"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">ACTION 2</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Explore and prioritise needs for both (or all) parties; agree approach within context</strong></p>
<p align="left">Once we have agreed how we are working together, we can explore other contextual influences further, to see what may be possible and what our constraints maybe (e.g. if limited by time at a parents&rsquo; evening).</p>
<p align="left">Our exploration of these influences is contextualised by our agendas; clients will know why we are asking questions (having agreed to this) with the work being done with, not to the clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">From this, needs are identified and prioritised (being mindful of oppressive practice or leading).</p>
<p align="left">Once this is done, methods can be discussed and agreed, with the approach fitting the problem; whether narrative or trait and factor or a combination. Throughout, we remain mindful that needs change so, it is important to &lsquo;check in&rsquo; with the client throughout the session.</p>
<p align="left"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">ACTION 3</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Review and reflect</strong></p>
<p align="left">Finally we need to check whether we have been successful; have we achieved what we set out to do? If we haven&rsquo;t, we need to explore what needs to happen next, whether a further meeting or finding support elsewhere.</p>
<p align="left">For example, if you only had ten minutes at a parents&rsquo; evening with a client and would not be seeing them again (due to contract arrangements), your client may not be aware of the wider implications of their choices unless you signposted to these issues.</p>
<p align="left">No longer do we have the luxury of &lsquo;picking them up later&rsquo; in some settings, as professionals we need to take responsibility and use the wider systems around us to support our clients.</p>
<p align="left"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">What are we doing next?</strong></p>
<p align="left">Our model is adaptable, suitable for one-to-one interviews, parents&rsquo; evenings or small group sessions. It is driven by the principle of open and transparent practice, ensuring the agendas which drive us are independent of political or organisational influence, placing the client first without deception or coercion through ulterior motives.</p>
<p align="left">As an organisation we are taking the model on wider trials and plan to develop our ideas further, if you would like to be involved in these trials please contact <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="mailto:christargett@cxk.org" rel="nofollow">christargett@cxk.org</a>.</p>
