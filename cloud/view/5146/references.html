<p><strong>The US e-Market </strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Paul Hollins; Keren Mills]</em></p>
<p>Ambient Insight has just released its forecast of <a href="http://www.ambientinsight.com/News/Ambient-Insight-2010-2015-US-eLearning-Market.aspx" rel="nofollow">The US Market for Self-paced eLearning Products and Services: 2010-2015</a>, predicting a compound annual growth rate of 5.9%, to $24.2bn by 2015.&nbsp; Chief Research Officer, Sam Adkins, notes that, &ldquo;One interesting new trend is the strong demand for industry-centric Web-based learning management portals preloaded with vertical content, particularly certification and licensure content.&nbsp; Best-of-breed suppliers that specialize in specific verticals also offer managed services with these portals and they are now generating significant revenues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Comscore has just released its annual <a href="http://blog.comscore.com/2011/02/top_10_digital_media_trends.html" rel="nofollow">US Digital Year in Review</a> report, highlights of which are: e-commerce continues to grow, as does couponing (e.g. Groupon); three of every 10 internet sessions now includes a Facebook visit; web mail dropped by 9% but web searching grew by 12%, online advertising by 23% and the online video audience by 32%; more mobile phones are smart phones and the Android v iPhone battle is hotting up.</p>
<p>Comscore has also published separately its inaugural <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Presentations_Whitepapers/2011/2010_Mobile_Year_in_Review" rel="nofollow">Mobile Year in Review</a><em> </em>report, looking at devices, user activities/preferences, plus geographic differences &ndash; having examined the US, Japan and EU5 (UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy) marketplace.</p>

<p><strong>Who Has Pearson Bought This Month?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Giles Clark; Wired Campus; Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>Pearson is acquiring <a href="http://www.stockmarketwire.com/display/?id=4097888§ionId=standardNews" rel="nofollow">Education Development International</a> (EDI plc), a provider of educational and training qualifications and online assessment services.&nbsp; The move will &ldquo;complement Pearson's existing work-based learning business and will create an enlarged qualifications group offering a comprehensive range of vocational and academic services to the UK and international markets&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Moving across to <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/02/22/blackboard_evolves_its_business_strategy_in_light_of_market_saturation_in_higher_ed" rel="nofollow">Blackboard</a>, Inside Higher Ed&rsquo;s Steve Kolowich wonders what an LMS/VLE company should do once it realises that most institutions now have an LMS/VLE.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the company appears to have a cunning plan.</p>
<p>In this 6 min podcast, Felice Nudelman, executive director of education for the New York Times, explains how <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/podcast-the-new-york-times-joins-colleges-to-create-online-courses/30018" rel="nofollow">NYT has developed its own digital-learning platform</a> and is beginning to collaborate with colleges.&nbsp; Students get a long-term collaborative experience, she says, involving faculty members and reporters from the New York Times newsroom.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Are VLEs Still Relevant?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>JISC&rsquo;s Transformation Curriculum Delivery through Technology programme has now concluded, having looked at 15 projects (7 using Moodle) involving over 60 different technologies.&nbsp; Christina Smart looks at how <a href="http://www.elearning.ac.uk/features/vlesindelivery" rel="nofollow">VLEs are being used to support curriculum innovation</a> in four of those projects, and discusses why, despite all their shortcomings, VLEs are still are the heart of curriculum development.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Working Smarter Daily</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jay Cross; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Imagine a band containing all your favourite musicians, or a team with all your favourite players.&nbsp; Jay Cross has done the same for news.&nbsp; Now I know we can all use aggregators to do this for ourselves, but Jay and his colleagues at the Internet Time Alliance have come up with a nicely designed solution to save us the bother.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.workingsmarterdaily.com/" rel="nofollow">Working Smarter Daily</a> brings topical stories relating to learning, teaching, performance and technology from a selection of key figures in these fields, and it comes in three attractive colours &ndash; web, email or RSS.</p>
<p>However, if you prefer RSS feeds but hate the fact that stories are often truncated, forcing you to click-through to read them, <a href="http://fulltextrssfeed.com/" rel="nofollow">Full Text RSS Feed Builder</a> allows you to enter the URL of a feed and receive a full-text feed URL you can use anywhere.</p>

<p><strong>What Makes a Good e-Learning Game?</strong></p>
<p><em>[eLearn Magazine; Jeff Cobb; Pete Mitton]</em></p>
<p>Educational games still seem to generate quite mixed reactions, particularly from some managers in the adult learning arena.&nbsp; Perhaps the secret is to call them &lsquo;simulations&rsquo;?&nbsp; Assuming you do choose to press ahead, <a href="http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&article=153-1" rel="nofollow">Simon Egenfeldt-Nielsen</a>, writing in eLearn Magazine, considers firstly what educational games are all about, and secondly what makes the good ones good.</p>
<p>A good current example of a serious game is <a href="http://www.missiontolearn.com/2011/02/spent-urban-ministries/" rel="nofollow">Spent</a>, developed for US charity Urban Ministries.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve just lost your job, you&rsquo;re down to your last $1,000 and you have to make it through the month, coping with problems and balancing income/outgoing decisions.&nbsp; Jeff Cobb describes it as &ldquo;not a terribly complex game, but it is very effective&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Tina Barseghian reports in the Huffington Post on a recent presentation by Arizona State&rsquo;s Prof James Gee on whether <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tina-barseghian/education-technology-video-games_b_829460.html" rel="nofollow">video gaming is good for kids&rsquo; brains</a>.&nbsp; He cites ten research-validated reasons why video games are good for learning, mostly relating to motivators such as challenge, risk-taking and problem-solving.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Free Learning Materials</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran; Chris Hough; Wired Campus; Tony Bates; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>I have a confession to make.&nbsp; Once I went to the BBC Academy&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/collegeofproduction/" rel="nofollow">College of Production</a> website, I couldn&rsquo;t get away.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s full of advice and guidance from professionals in the art of media production &ndash; and being BBC, it&rsquo;s engaging and well produced.&nbsp; So, if you want tips on filming, interviewing, editing, devising a game show, producing Chris Evans on radio or Graham Norton on TV, dive on in.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.o2learn.co.uk/index.php" rel="nofollow">O<sub>2</sub> Learn</a> is a free collection of video lessons from teachers that can help students of all levels from kids tussling with the Key Stages to GCSE and A-Level students.&nbsp; Examples include analysing text, big bang theory, musical cadence, the Romeo and Juliet weather forecast and that all-time classic: a snake eating a mouse.</p>
<p>Struggling to understand the concept of transverse wave motion?&nbsp; This video of Alom Shaha&rsquo;s sticky tape, BBQ skewer and <a href="http://www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/elibrary/resource/2096/wave-machine" rel="nofollow">jelly baby wave machine</a> should sort you out.</p>
<p>Does the world need another free university lecture site listing material from the usual suspects such as Berkeley, MIT, Oxford and Yale?&nbsp; The folks at <a href="http://lecturefox.com/" rel="nofollow">Lecturefox</a> obviously think so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TED also thinks it may be missing a trick, hence the soon-to-be-launched <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/ted-known-for-big-idea-conferences-pushes-into-education/30094" rel="nofollow">TED-Ed</a>, featuring some re-edited and recategorised existing TED talks, plus some new (and probably shorter) material aimed specifically at education.</p>
<p>The Open Educational Quality Initiative (OPAL) &ndash; an international network of 7 organisations (including the OU) to promote innovation and better quality in education and training through the use of OERs &ndash; has published <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2011/03/06/european-report-on-barriers-to-the-use-of-open-educational-resources/" rel="nofollow">Beyond OER</a>.&nbsp; This latest report notes that, &ldquo;the current focus in OER is mainly put on building more access to digital content.&nbsp; There is little consideration of whether this will support educational practices, promote quality and innovation in teaching and learning&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_for_Assessment_and_Credit_for_Students" rel="nofollow">OER for Assessment and Credit Project</a> will provide opportunities for OER learners who are interested in earning formal academic credit for their learning.&nbsp; The project will also contribute to the design and development of the recently announced OER university.</p>

<p><strong>Can Self-Study Be Social?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Clive Shepherd]</em></p>
<p>Clive wonders, <a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2011/03/can-self-study-be-social.html" rel="nofollow">can self-study be social?</a>&nbsp; He refers not to group interaction but to the learner&rsquo;s relationship with the author.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you read a book, one that has an author with a name written on the cover, the book acts as a useful mediator between the author and you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He believes the same could be true for e-learning, so you would know who wrote/designed it and it would be written using a conversational tone, with the author's personality shining through.&nbsp; &ldquo;Web 2.0 content - blog and forum postings, YouTube videos, etc - is consumed with gusto because it has personality.&nbsp; Policy manuals, corporate brochures and self-study compliance courses are not, because they don't.&nbsp; With most e-learning, you feel like you're interacting with a corporation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>CoursePark</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.coursepark.com/" rel="nofollow">CoursePark</a> is a social learning environment that supports an online course marketplace offering packages for employee training and client training.&nbsp; Course selection is a lot like iTunes, with genres, new arrivals and popular courses highlighted.&nbsp; However, the courses themselves are mostly page-turning with animations and quizzes built in.&nbsp; The company claims to have 25,000 registered users.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>The Amaze Generation</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran; T3; Beccy Dresden; CNET]</em></p>
<p>This looked promising.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.amaze.com/amazegeneration/" rel="nofollow">Amaze Generation</a> is a five-year longitudinal study into the habits and preferences of young technology users, and the initial report is certainly thorough.&nbsp; Then you get to the sample details and discover they&rsquo;re tracking just 20 kids, currently spanning a relatively enormous age range of 10-15.&nbsp; Never mind, the quotes are good: Google is &ldquo;a piece of software you can find everything on&rdquo; and Twitter is &ldquo;for old people&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If only the Amaze generation can talk mum into parting with around &pound;500 (or a &pound;40 monthly contract), they can soon get their hands on the new Sony Ericsson Xperia Play, dubbed the <a href="http://www.t3.com/news/xperia-play-gets-march-31st-uk-release-date?=54351" rel="nofollow">Playstation Phone</a>.&nbsp; Six games come pre-installed, including The Sims and FIFA 10, with the UK launch on 31 Mar.</p>
<p>Or perhaps they&rsquo;d prefer an <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/tag/ipad-2/" rel="nofollow">iPad2</a>.&nbsp; Netted even suggests some <a href="http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=ea7544b086a8473bd90e4c1e3&id=aff3864681&e=3f9e94039d" rel="nofollow">educational apps</a>.&nbsp; J P Morgan Research estimates that a total of <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19736_7-20041557-251.html" rel="nofollow">81m tablets will be built this year</a>, but that only 48m will actually ship.&nbsp; This will leave a sizeable glut on warehouse shelves, although JPM predict these will mostly be in the non-Apple warehouses.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Content Is Twice as Difficult</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jakob Nielsen]</em></p>
<p>Nielsen reports on research from the University of Alberta, showing that learners using an iPhone-sized screen <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/mobile-content-comprehension.html" rel="nofollow">scored less than half in comprehension tests</a> than an equivalent PC-based group.&nbsp; He attributes this not just to screen/text size, but to a host of compounding factors including slower download speeds, no keyboard and no mouse rollover or right-click.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>I'm a Celebrity, Let Me Fix Your Education System</strong></p>
<p><em>[Donald Clark]</em></p>
<p>Hell hath no fury like a ranting Donald Clark.&nbsp; This month he offers a critical appraisal of that well known head teacher, <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2011/03/im-celebrity-let-me-fix-your-education.html" rel="nofollow">Jamie Oliver</a> and his motivational chums, including David &ldquo;you are all here because you failed&rdquo; Starkey.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>eBooks</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Matthew Moran; Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Cengage Learning has announced a new e-textbook publishing platform, <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/textbook-publisher-announces-‘app’-approach-to-learning-materials/30090" rel="nofollow">MindTap</a>, which allows professors to customise material by adding their own slides, video lectures, articles, or plug in apps and free online content from elsewhere.&nbsp; The offering comes bundled with Cengage&rsquo;s Aplia electronic test-bank system, videos and other materials that the company owns the rights to, including the archives of Newsweek.&nbsp; Students read material via a standard Web browser displaying two side-by-side windows: one containing a page of a textbook and the other allowing users to open another app within the system, such as a notebook page to type and share notes, or any of the other apps that a professor enabled for his or her course.</p>
<p>Many libraries are scratching their collective heads about how to deal with e-Books.&nbsp; Now, 150 public and academic US libraries are responding through a new collaborative venture which will allow users to access e-books owned and stored at libraries other than their home libraries.&nbsp; The initiative will use <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/collaboration-seeks-to-provide-easier-access-to-e-books/30054" rel="nofollow">Open Library</a>, an existing e-book lending service, as a means to curate the more than 80,000 e-books that partner institutions have offered up as part of the initial push.&nbsp; Open Library allows users to check out an e-book that can be read through a Web browser or downloaded as a PDF or ePub file.&nbsp; After an allotted checkout period, the e-book self-destructs.</p>
<p>However, despite their fondness for social networking and cell phones, <a href="http://www.bisg.org/news-5-603-press-releasecollege-students-want-their-textbooks-the-old-fashioned-way-in-print.php" rel="nofollow">most students prefer physical books to e-Books</a>.&nbsp; Nearly 75% of students to recently respond to a major new research survey from the Book Industry Study Group said they prefer printed texts, citing a fondness for print's look and feel, as well as its permanence and ability to be resold.&nbsp; Only around 12% of students - mostly males, and often MBA-seeking or distance learners - prefer e-Books because of their lower cost, convenience and portability; these students also like online supplemental materials such as quizzes.</p>
<p>Tony Bates reports on a presentation by 11 University of Cincinnati psychology seniors at a recent Educause event.&nbsp; They had compared the content of <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2011/02/17/online-search-versus-168-textbook/" rel="nofollow">traditional college texts</a>, one of which costs $168, to content they found for free on the Web, finding the online material to be as good as the material in the textbook.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Web O&rsquo; Wonder</strong></p>

<p>Mozilla&rsquo;s <a href="https://demos.mozilla.org/" rel="nofollow">Web O&rsquo; Wonder</a> exhibits creative ways to interact with the Web using modern Web technologies.&nbsp; This includes, for example, a preview of the features and effects that are available in HTML5 and CSS3.&nbsp; In addition to the interactive demos, with Web O&rsquo; Wonder you can learn more about how each demo works, what technologies have been used and watch behind the scenes video interviews with the creators.&nbsp; However, the standard health warning applies: to view any demos tagged with WebGL, you&rsquo;ll need a suitable browser such as newer versions of Firefox or Chrome.</p>
<p>Talking of Browsers, Mozilla has updated the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-20041864-92.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20" rel="nofollow">Firefox 4 beta</a> to release candidate status, offering a series of stability, compatibility and performance tweaks over earlier versions.&nbsp; Google has just released <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20040627-264.html" rel="nofollow">Chrome 10</a>, with faster JavaScript, password synchronisation, and a revamped preferences system, but no support for H264 video.&nbsp; Finally, Microsoft should be launching <a href="http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20031279-12.html" rel="nofollow">IE9</a> today (14<sup>th</sup>), allowing sites to be pinned to the Windows task bar, with pages able to act more like desktop applications with things like notifications; there is also improved security and performance, faster start times a new JavaScript engine.</p>

<p><strong>One Day on Earth</strong></p>
<p><em>[Mashable]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/01/18/one-day-on-earth-archive/" rel="nofollow">One Day on Earth</a> initiative last year invited participants to contribute video clips to build a collective worldwide picture of our lives on 10.10.10.&nbsp; The project will culminate in the release of a feature-length documentary but, for now, the results are available via a geotagged video map, featuring all content&nbsp; and searchable by topic, popularity and location.</p>

<p><strong>Storify</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://storify.com/" rel="nofollow">Storify</a> offers the functionality to &ldquo;turn what people post on social media into compelling stories.&nbsp; Collect the best photos, video, tweets and more to publish them as simple, beautiful stories that can be embedded anywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d looked at this on a slow news day I might have been underwhelmed, but I first visited the site last Friday and was able to track news from the Japan earthquake from a variety of sources (YouTube clips, tweets, ABC, CNN, the UN, etc) as they had unfolded that morning.</p>

<p><strong>And Finally&hellip;</strong></p>
<p><em>[JE; Lara Mynors; Roger Moore]</em></p>
<p>It must be respectable, it&rsquo;s peer-reviewed.&nbsp; Susan Landay writes in eLearn Magazine about <a href="http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=opinion&article=161-1" rel="nofollow">learning for chocolate</a>.</p>
