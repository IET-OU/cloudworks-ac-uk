			<h2>Title Social Media as a Medium of Paradigm Shift in Education in Uganda </h2>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I am a Ugandan university lecturer, born, grown and educated in Uganda. Am not only a victim but also a propagator of an education paradigm (banking system) which I consider obsolete and wish to change. </p>
<h2>Situation </h2>
<p>The traditional education was informal and context based and aimed at solving problems in the environment using the available community skills, knowledge and resources. It was never private, it was open though had rules and regulations. All community members were winner not losers; competition was not significant. The introduction of formal education with colonial government altered that system and introduced confined, ivory tower, and exclusive and competitive education. Moreover, the pedagogical approach was that of banking where during assessment, we must reproduce what we acquired. Competencies and skills are not considered in national examinations. Finally, our graduates often lack the required skills that can help them become innovative to start jobs, just because they lacked the authentic education that would allow them practice and they are also ignorant of their environment because they were closed in boarding schools out of community environment at a young age to the end of their studies. </p>
<p>Providentially, as we embrace the digital space, we learn that through social media, there are no limits in terms of age, transports costs, structural impediments like classes. Information which is rich in knowledge, skills and approaches (education) is shared freely on social media. Yet in attractive modes especially to the youth such as music, pictures and short texts. For being eager to follow up what their children are sharing, the parent of the time has no choice rather than subscribing to the social media and in the process, she/he too is educated on many issues and innovations as well as markets. </p>
<p>I foresee, the education sector now availing demand driven information and skills that will be innovative and problem solving because the social media is unstoppable. The learners now have to inform on what they need to be taught, otherwise schools will run out of business if they do not comply. We already see this where majority are moving towards apprenticeship and hands on education rather than the banking system alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Based on the fact that our education system is predominantly traditional in approach, I will not commit that I have officially or formally carried out the exercise. It is still a quest for paradigm shift. But I can say that observing their enthusiasm on social media, by subscribing to Facebook and WhatsApp I had the following objectives</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To acquire class management skills by learning my students physically and socially. This is because they love posting their pictures and those of social events on the social media</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To coordinate the class because several students dodge classes often, besides the classes in humanities and social sciences where I teach are so big. Therefore, an announcement through social media spreads like bush fire and is acted on with good responsiveness as compared to verbal and noticeboard announcements</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To disseminate information like links, notes and marks. Here they also disseminate it easily to their colleagues. They feel it is easier, quicker and cheaper.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avail myself for consultation, because when online though I often get overwhelmed and irritated at times, I can confess that some students consult on academics and beyond. They youth of the time need mentors than before moreover it seems adults are busy negotiating livelihoods. </p>
<p>What I would consider the measure of success is that since I registered myself WhatsApp and Facebook, majority of people that send friend request are my students and former students and those in their circles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The other measure of success is that for the former students, some have established their own jobs in NGOs, farms and they proudly share with me pictures of their successes. This is my success too when they attribute that to my courses and ways of teaching. They also consult on what and how to improve and get information which I also quickly do through sending links.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The actual success now accrues from the title of this cloud, paradigm shift! Based on the above, I see with social media, we are learning or going back to traditional open education for the good of society.</p>
<h2>Actions </h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Grounded in traditional pedagogy, I discouraged use of phones in class</li>
<li>Seeing nearly all students preoccupied by phones on compound, paths and class, I got eager to learn what the attraction is.</li>
<li>I learn it is Facebooks and WhatsApp, I started with getting an account with Facebook on computer and accepted many friend requests. Later bought smartphone and also opened up WhatsApp.</li>
<li>I saw myself sink in social issues of the youth, but since many followed my advice attentively, I decided to post important information. For instance, in 2013 when the Westgate mall in Nairobi was attacked by terrorist in, while in Uganda, I posted to all my former students in Nairobi to go and donate blood and save life. Based on the concept of humanism that nobody is too poor to give and nobody is too rich not to receive. Great, they donated blood and were happy sharing what they felt and contexualising other concepts we had learnt in class.</li>
<li>Since then, I use social media to learn, coordinate, disseminate information to my students. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;The impact has been great. It enables me to assess the competences of my students. Even when their exams marks are low at times, I love it that they acknowledge the knowledge is helping them. This means national exams can be impending to intellectual growth. Am also an example, I did introduction to philosophy, the course seemed too hard for me to understand 13 years ago. 10 years later, I started appreciating knowledge and using it. Thanks God I did not discard the related notes and books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The expected impact is that I would reach many people through contacts in social media. This indeed has happened. Social media has made me an open educator without boundaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The unexpected impact was that, this to me was to be limited to current students and for academic purpose only, but now it goes to current, former students and beyond. Am overwhelmed, it at times impends my academic career where am slow at writing and publishing. It is also impoverishing because nearly all consultations are voluntary, free, and time consuming. They are not enumerated by the employing institution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t say, I have overcome them, because the struggle has just started. I still need to sell the idea out for other educators and policy makers to embrace the approach. But I only regulate and manage my time. So, I have two lines, one that is public and the other is private. </p>
<h2>Results </h2>
<p>For this, please refer to the responses in the above question.</p>
<h2>Reflections<em> <br /></em></h2>
<p>Society being dynamic and different, we in Uganda or developing countries need to embrace the education revolution as propagated by technology enhanced learning. This education will open way to authentic education that is empowering and make learners not only innovative but also international. Besides, this approach is user-friendly, even the communities and individuals that never felt education as appealing, they have embraced digital spaced and activities. Thus, with lifelong learning, the world will be a better place to live in. &nbsp;</p>			<div class="posted-by">
