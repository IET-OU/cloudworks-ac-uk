        <p>The need for effective Continuing Professional Development (CPD) in teaching is bigger now than ever before in Northern Ireland. This case study is born out of a desire to reflect and develop as a teacher in a contextual environment which is currently not facilitating that demand. Budget cuts and area-based planning mean that schools are shrinking, teachers are being cut and the duties that teachers are being asked to take on are becoming more diverse.</p>
<p>Current CPD in Northern Ireland (NI) involves a once a year lesson observation from a senior teacher and the filling in of paperwork to show the inspectors. This is uninspiring and unhelpful in a challenging and competitive profession which needs good quality training, with investment from leaders and realistic ideas for how to remain fresh and innovative. Bill Gates (2013) is a strong proponent of teachers receiving ‘real feedback’ in America and there is no doubt that this is very much required for professionals who want to retain their jobs in the current educational climate in NI.</p>
<p>So how can openness and a fifty pound video camera enhance professional development at this crucial time for a teacher in NI: by innovating conventional CPD and opening up a classroom to peers across the world. It is time to put CPD back in the hands of the people who are at the centre of the process; the teachers. The innovation is that of sharing short clips and asking specific questions about them. The hope is that it could offer more effective feedback than an annual lesson observation. The openness element involves sharing lesson footage openly with peers online who would never normally be privy to classroom practice.</p>
<p>The conference presentation will focus on presenting a case study of a trial version of this within the H818 community. The case study being the artefact, the presentation will be a multi-media tour of the key elements of the case study including clips from the classroom in Northern Ireland, screen shots of peer feedback from within H818 and an evaluation of the efficacy of the process in comparison to current CPD arrangements in Northern Ireland. There is a degree of de-formalising the process of CPD within this case study. And this, essentially, is the point. Holmes (2013, p. 97) calls this concept of sharing and learning with peers, ‘informal learning’. The hope is that this peer review process, which has been a significant design feature of the H818 module, can be applied to a teacher in Northern Ireland who is hoping to glean as much as possible to improve specific aspects of teaching and learning within the classroom.</p>
<p>Attendees will leave the presentation with an increased awareness of how making CPD more open might engender better quality feedback. They may also come away with ideas for how to refresh their own CPD in an informal, discreet yet effective way.</p>

			<p><em><strong>DRAFT CASE STUDY</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>A case study in understanding the impact of openness on CPD: how does sharing lesson footage across an open platform enhance professional development?</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Key Points of Good Practice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Understanding how openness can enhance learning and development in a professional context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovating traditional Continual Professional Development to achieve a better quality outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking risks in open education to make gains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping variables the same in order to isolate the impact of one key change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using unconventional video footage to improve self-awareness and self-reflection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description of Implementation</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This small pilot programme was undertaken by one teacher in a post-primary school in Northern Ireland.&nbsp; The programme involved firstly recording lessons of the individual teacher using a standard video camera and tripod.&nbsp; Then there was a stage of self-reflection where the teacher watched the footage back and made notes on areas for improvement. However, there were some moments within lessons that the teacher wished to gain more ideas for improvement.&nbsp; Therefore, with a simple editing programme, small snippets of lessons were selected and captions added to help with audio recognition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three clips were shared on a free online platform called Padlet, with a little background context to the lesson shown.&nbsp; Most importantly, each clip had a specific question shown clearly at the beginning in order to focus the appraisers on the issue the teacher needed help with.&nbsp; Padlet allows users to add comments with a simple double click to appraisers were able to view the clip (under 2 minutes) and leave a short comment on how to fix a specific problem clearly outlined by the teacher.&nbsp; In this pilot, users comprised the participants on an Open University module entitled, &lsquo;The Networked Practitioner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time scale for the project encompassed 3 weeks of lesson recording, a week of playback and choice of clips and culminated in the editing, creating and sharing of three short clips on Padlet.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Perceived Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Perceived benefits for teaching staff begin with ensuring that CPD is back in the hands of teachers.&nbsp; It allows teachers to pinpoint areas for improvement that they know need addressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;It ignores the lack or misdirection of CPD within the professional context and maintains a very simple method throughout the academic year of receiving feedback that can be instantly helpful.</p>
<p>For pupils, the benefits are clear too.&nbsp; Pupils will enjoy lessons which have been tailored as a result of feedback from this system.&nbsp; The teacher themselves chooses the lesson, or moments from multiple lessons to share and receive feedback on. Real-life lessons rather than &lsquo;inspection-standard&rsquo; lessons gain the deserved attention and this translates to the quality teaching and learning received by pupils.</p>
<p>The lessons learnt from this case study can be extended to any professional context, any schoo; any workplace.&nbsp; Any profession can learn more when opening up their practice to a different network; a more objective one.&nbsp; Whilst it is fair to say that whilst not always an informed network regarding the norms and conventions of the workplace in question, this openness is what ensures a fresh approach and consequently a better one.</p>
<p>The teacher involved was overwhelmed by the valuable comments left on the Padlet.&nbsp; The fresh ideas, the resourcefulness of individuals not connected with the teaching profession offered a wealth of inspiration to refresh the practices that were at work within this teacher&rsquo;s classroom.&nbsp; Those who left the comments were happy to be involved as it had only taken 5 minutes of their time to view and leave a quick comment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Issues/Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Challenges mainly centred on the poor recording quality.&nbsp; Without someone to man the video camera, sometime the individual teacher went out of shot or pupils who were engaged were not visible.&nbsp; Additionally, the regional dialect and Northern Irish accent made the poor quality audio even harder to decipher.&nbsp; This was addressed by adding text captions to the short edited clips for sharing on Padlet.&nbsp; This enabled users to fully appreciate the dialogue of the teacher during the clip. <br /> What problems/issues have arisen and how have you addressed them. How might any difficulties</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enablers that helped the project to work</strong></p>
<p>The pilot was initiated as part of an Open University module where the teacher in question was tasked to presenting an artefact about openness. The innovation of CPD using an open platform such as Padlet suited the needs of the teacher regarding CPD and fulfilled the requirements of the module.</p>
<p>Lesson recordings were facilitated by the kind permission of the principal and pupils who grant permission to be recorded in their educational setting on arrival to the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the appraisers, a positive online relationship had been developed throughout the module.&nbsp; The teacher had been proactive in assisting the projects of others and this was kindly reciprocated by others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Details of project evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Evaluation comprised of a straightforward comparison between conventional and current CPD and this innovative approach.&nbsp; Success was evidenced by the resources and ideas derived from the comments left on Padlet.&nbsp; Personal gain was the mainstay of the success as the teacher felt motivated, reinvigorated and valued by the peer review network that had been formed as part of the module.</p>
<p>The teacher implemented the new ideas in the classroom, created new resources and allowed the self-reflective practitioner to be at the forefront of every lesson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Possible improvements/enhancements</strong></p>
<p>What can be learnt from this is that CPD belongs in the hands of teachers.&nbsp; Teachers know what they need more than their SLT, more than the Department of Education.&nbsp; If teachers are to develop effectively, they must receive tailored feedback.&nbsp; There is nothing more tailored than what occurred during this pilot.</p>
<p>In the future, the said teacher aims to continue to record portions of lessons and play them back in order to maintain a healthy self-awareness and be as reflective as practitioner as possible.&nbsp; It avoids becoming entrenched in routine practice. The teacher hopes to invite other members of staff to share lesson footage.&nbsp; If this proves unsuccessful, the teacher is happy to maintain the open network of participants from the module.&nbsp; There is a problem with sharing too publicly as the teacher would like to maintain the privacy of the practice and the privacy of the pupils in the footage. Therefore, the teacher will continue to explore other online platforms with similar sharing of lesson footage and utilise these connections to form a network of like-minded individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Points of advice for others who may wish to replicate the techniques used</strong></p>
<p>For those who wish to enhance their own CPD, a video camera is essential.&nbsp; The self-awareness that came about as a result of watching classroom footage was incredibly helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a subsequent step, the sharing of footage should be attempted in order to gain fresh insights into a highly contextualised environment.</p>
<p>Key advice would be to ignore comments that are found to be unhelpful and stick to the comments which invigorate and assist.&nbsp; Additionally, short clips with specific, attached questions avoid ambiguity on the part of the person submitting clips and the reviewer.</p>

                   <p>Hi Marese I like your topic of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and the way you addressed some of the issues in your poster with openess that invited comments for your personal improvement.</p>
<p>Impressive given your &pound;50 video camera budget.</p>
<p>I hope to catch your slot at conference.</p>
<p>Best of luck I see you are presenting early on in the conference.</p>

                   <p>Thanks Sheila!</p>
<p>You have been so helpful throughout this whole review process.&nbsp; Needless to say, quite of few of your comments regarding my poster made their way into my TMA02.&nbsp; You are famous!</p>
<p>Also, the &pound;50 budget ensured that I added captions to my videos.&nbsp; My Northern Irish accent plus poor quality audio simply made captions essential! Thankfully my presentation won't have any video, just screenshots!</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to seeing this. For me, CPD often focuses on keeping up-to-date on my subject, and I like the idea of it focussing on classroom practice.&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Thanks for the ego boost Marese, this course is definitely a test for me.</p>
<p>How will you be presenting your aretefact at conference without any audio/video will you be doing some kind of voiceover anywhere? Will you be reading out a paper then perhaps?</p>

                   <p>Well because&nbsp;my artefact is&nbsp;a case study in the <em>use </em>of video, I need&nbsp;a PowerPoint to show <em>the impact </em>of it now as that is what my project was supposed to be about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I don't think i will read out a paper, instead&nbsp;it will be a PowerPoint containing the key elements of my case study with me talking through them.&nbsp; I hope to have some stills of the short video clips and then some photos of new resources&nbsp;or&nbsp;activities&nbsp;to evidence the impact (my own; so no copyright headaches!)</p>
<p>Does this make more sense? I suppose the before, during and after (in my head anyway!)</p>

                   <p>Hi Marese</p>
<p>Will you be recording your voice digitally between the powerpoint and stills or will you be doing this in real time at conference. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still a bit unsure about format myself as to what is expected in a multimedia presentation.</p>
<p>Should it be all contained within the presentation including voiceover and intro from myself or are we expected to talk it through live.</p>
<p>What is your idea on this? &nbsp;Could do with more guidance right now AND feedback from the TMA, BEFORE I get too far into the presentation.</p>        </div>

                   On the Conference forum Simon has put a pretty good guide to what is expected. My interpretation is that I will talk through the slides in real-time.  So mine is definitely still a case study but it said we were not limited to simply reading aloud from a paper copy so that's where the slides, pictures and some text come in.

And yes to the best of my knowledge we talk it through live unless we cannot be there on the day and then that is where the recorded version would be useful.  

Ps can I quote comments of yours from the padlet and my video clips  for inclusion in my presentation? So always say such sensible and helpful things so we need quite explicit permission for these quotes at conference (so says the Guide mentioned above!)         </div>

                   <p>Hi Marese,</p>
<p>This sounds really interesting, and I think the principle of CPD through informal learning/peer feedback is a very good one. I'm not really familiar with this, and I was wondering if you knew of/had considered other ways of sharing classroom experiences with peers? I've never been filmed - I have been observed - but sometimes I think that when I would benefit from peer feedback the most is when I walk out of a classroom thinking 'I do not know how the class went in that direction'...that is, feedback after the unexpected rather than feedback on a predetermined class.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the conference!</p>

                   I have never experienced anything apart from the once per year observation which is so contrived that is really needed something fresh. The video camera does actually let you work out 'how the class went in that direction' when you reply the tape never mind sharing it!        </div>

                   <p>Hi Marese. What a fantastic abstract. You managed to be academic yet punchy at the same time. I could see your personality coming through.I think the premise of being more open in order to improve practice is a great one, and I love how your case study is about creation. &nbsp;It has the potential to be recreate in different ways and formats for different people. I also think that but reaching out to a cohort of students from outside your immediate professional domain, you have reached outside your potential 'echo bubble' and probably got a wide variety of constructive feedback to help in CPD.The one thing I wonder about though is the difficulties others may have in the research ethics. It would seem that you have been incredibly lucky that your school and students allowed for filming and dissemination. I know when I undertook a research study last year for the OU many people found it incredibly difficult to get permission in the schools they were working in. This could have some impact on a wider project/work within a school environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to your presentation and learning what you have discovered along the way.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   Thanks for such a lovely generous comment Samantha! I certainly did get outside of my 'echo bubble' and through other teachers and other professionals I got such a wide range of feedback that I immediately set to work making changes to resources and lessons. Ethics yes, I thought it might have been trickier but I checked twice and was given the go-ahead.  Additionally, i had reservations about sharing the interactive poster on Cloudworks here (unfortunately) but only due to my desire to ensure the clips were not public. I am happy to share with my esoteric H818 team though! !!!
Thanks again for the boost! Really nice comment!        </div>

                   <p>Marese, you're describing an atelier!</p>
<p>Your question, "So how can openness and a fifty pound video camera enhance professional development..." really caught me. It's rare that we get such an intimate glimpse into others' classrooms, even within our own institutions. I can attest that I've learned more from observing colleagues teach than from any formal feedback. I'm very curious to see how you did it.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Marese, Your abstract is very interesting as a huge leap away from current practice. The whole debate about online feedback itself can come into play here.&nbsp;Longer term ,in your review network it would be great to sign up some students and also students with disabilties.&nbsp; looking forward to hearing more...</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Marese,&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is really interesting, it is very effective and a great use of Padlet, I thought the short videos were great they offered snippets to feedback on, could you imagine recording longer videos of teaching sessions or do think having the&nbsp;snippets&nbsp;allows more&nbsp;targeted&nbsp;specific feedback. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hugo! This made me smile! You and your atelier's!</p>
<p>Honestly, I learned so much from this and even the editing of the video made me work more as a 'reflective practitioner.' I will definitely be carrying this forward in some shape or form.</p>
<p>Catherine; good point about inclusion there. Will think about this as I begin to ponder the 'moving forward with this' aspect.</p>
<p>Matthew, I have the longer recordings but I was very conscious of not asking too much of people who are studying a module and don't have time to spend 30 mins watching an grainy video with dodgy audio! However, if there was a group of people who wanted to do this as part of an intentional online community then I would love to extend them.&nbsp; Not too long though; I would still pinpoint the aspects I need help with but I could run them together to produce a 'This week I need help with...' 5 minute clip?&nbsp; Also, Padlet has an upload limit so would have to find another way, and Youtube is too public.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>        </div>

                   Hi Marese,

I too am looking forward to your presentation as it works on similar themes to mine, but is completely different if you see what I mean. Interesting that you are filming the teachers. How did they react to that or was the process voluntarily? 

I agree with you about the videoing process and reflection. You have to take so much into account, lighting, sound, accessibility etc. No wonder films take so long to make.

Best Wishes

Steve        </div>

                   <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>The teacher i was filming was ME as I wanted to address the lack of CPD in my own professionl context.&nbsp; It was definitely a personal wish and as things were so lacking in that respect, I thought I had nothing to lose!</p>
<p>Looking forward to contrasting our different ideas!</p>

                   <p>Here are the comments and questions from your live presentation at the conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very nice - illuistrates the value of 'crowd-sourced' ideas and reflection... very powerful - thank you!</li>
<li>I really like this approach. Teachers are often alone in a classroom behind a closed door, but this opens practice and the classroom up to peer support and critique.</li>
<li>Do you think your colleagues would be open to sharing in order to learn from others and share what does not work as well as what does?</li>
<li>Would be interesting to see whether this inspired your colleagues</li>
<li>How did you find your peers in Padlet?</li>
<li>have you shared this with anyone else in your school?</li>
<li>What a transformation. What's the next step for CPD in your school?</li>
<li>Have you thought about how you can continue this beyond H818?</li>
<li>Would be interesting to set up peer observation and regular feedback perhaps? ;-)</li>
<li>Why do you think the vidoe approach elicits better feedback?</li>
<li>I think that your approach should be attractive to any potential new employers also as they will benefit from the knowledge of your extended network too</li>
<li>Perhaps it's too personal and too 'close' so might be better to share with colleagues in other schools?</li>
<li>Have seen some very expensive systems that work like this. But this has the advantage of giving control to the person seeking feedback</li>
</ul>

                   <ul>
<li>Very nice - illuistrates the value of 'crowd-sourced' ideas and reflection... very powerful - thank you!</li>
</ul>
<p>I had not even made this connection to Amanda Palmer's TED talk; I suppose so! :)</p>
<ul>
<li>I really like this approach. Teachers are often alone in a classroom behind a closed door, but this opens practice and the classroom up to peer support and critique.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes; I had wanted this to come across and really got that support from my H8181 network of peers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you think your colleagues would be open to sharing in order to learn from others and share what does not work as well as what does?</li>
</ul>
<p>Possibly; perhaps a small network of individuals but it would be entirely dependent on personal preference.</p>
<ul>
<li>How did you find your peers in Padlet?</li>
</ul>
<p>Wonderfully supportive, positive and very inspirational regarding their fresh ideas and innovative approaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>What a transformation. What's the next step for CPD in your school?</li>
</ul>
<p>Next step for CPD in the school remains the once per year lesson observation and there is the possibility of a course for middle manager facilitated by an outside agency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you thought about how you can continue this beyond H818?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, probably just as an individual, reflecting on my own practice and perhaps maintaining links with H818 colleagues to share short clips in the very same way this pilot project worked.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you think the video approach elicits better feedback?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is unequivocal evidence and the teacher themselves gets to review it; a classroom observation feels like an inspection rather than a developmental aid. Therefore, it focuses on the learning that can be extracted from the lesson itself using firm evidence (video footage)&nbsp;rather the opinion of someone who watched your lesson (often a non-specialist in the subject you teach). Allows teacher to review first, make some observations and hopefully bring down the defence mechanism which is so innate to us all when being constructively critiqued.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps it's too personal and too 'close' so might be better to share with colleagues in other schools?</li>
</ul>
<p>Agreed; this is why it may remain an individual quest and perhaps opened up to H818 colleagues who are happy to offer feedback sporadically!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Marese,</p>
<p>Just watched&nbsp; a recording of your fantastic presentation and congrats on winning presentation of the day.</p>
<p>Beyond all the obstacles you face in your institution,&nbsp;I'm interested by the idea of whether something like this could be made obligatory&nbsp;-&nbsp; we had a (valuable)&nbsp;peer observation scheme which was based on the trust of management that it would actually take place but&nbsp; I know it has more or less died out, because of a lack of supervision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a real condundrum, though,&nbsp; because the minute you make it mandatory,&nbsp; then doesn't the ownership/empowerment disappear?</p>
<p>My other point is that you have boundless energy and a willingness to make your self vulnerable;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you were to introduce this 'formally',&nbsp; I would imagine you need&nbsp;to have some trust-building exercises beforehand - there's a lot of pride out there!&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks so much for your kind and generous comments. (esp the one about winning the presentation of the day; i think you mean the participation badge??????&nbsp; Don't think presentation stars are announced until after voting closes and I wouldnt stand a chance with&nbsp;my ugly mug in&nbsp; most of the slides!!)</p>
<p>I agree, the 'if you insist, they will resist' springs to mind regarding imposing this upon anyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree; nobody wants to lose face and I appreciate that totally; but I feel we have lots to learn from humbling ourselves and acknowledging that we need help!</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help; you know I couldn't have done it without you guys!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Marese</p>
<p>I'm going to compare with your case study because its definitely &nbsp;very work related - mine was driven by personal interests in SN - &nbsp;and because a &nbsp;case study rather than paper and because its from somebody very grounded in the school/education profession - while mine is more in business. &nbsp;I shall no doubt have questions!!</p>
<p>Thanks so much for a great case study and presentation, Louise</p>

                   <p>Hi Marese - I loved your presentation - and I know I have said this before but I marvel at the brave way you opened your teaching practice up to the group. A truly good example of what this course stands for and how we are perhaps expected to learn through peer feedback. &nbsp;I would very much like to review your project in part two of the EMA and seek your permission to use &nbsp;any references attributed to you.</p>

Thank you or your comments again; really heartening to hear. I am so much more aware of jargon now, I find myself filling people in on your presentation when they use jargon in our conversations!!! So...well done!        </div>

<p>Is it possible to have a link to your actual presentation slides. &nbsp;It would be most helpful as your presentation is one I have chosen to review.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

                   Hi Marese,

As I had technical difficulties on the day, I'm just catching up with the presentations. I was especially interested in yours and it lived up to expectations :) I am surprised (shocked?) about the amount of CPD you receive. I give CPD to my teachers once a week in two sessions, so nobody misses out (before I started I think they had one CPD In a year. Like you, there's only me doing this, so flipping the classroom via teacher development seems a good idea. I used Padlet a few years ago and wasn't that impressed, I revisited it based on your enthusiasm and now think it's quite good.

Best Wishes

Steve        </div>
