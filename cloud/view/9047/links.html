        <p>In your review, compare the two representations you selected. Note:</p>
<p>their &lsquo;readability&rsquo; (i.e. the ease with which you understood the content)</p>
<p>their expressiveness</p>
<p>their utility (i.e. their usefulness in communicating important aspects of the design).</p>
<p>I think that both the representations were fairly easy to read and interpret but I feel that they were aimed at different audiences and had different purposes in terms of teaching and learning.&nbsp; The 4Ts model is very linear in its construction and very detailed and would be an ideal model for a task based learning sessions where there is a time constraint, the objectives are very clear and can be assessed through outputs of some sort and&nbsp;possibly where the intention is the transfer of 'knowledge' (however, you may wish to&nbsp;define that).&nbsp;The e-design template however, although lacking in detail is really a tool for designing a series of lessons or lessons which last for a long period (3+ hours), where&nbsp;the aim is expressed rather than the specific objectives,&nbsp;where learners are called upon to construct learning based on input rather than just concentrating on&nbsp;the input itself, and where there is a lconsiderable degree&nbsp;of flexibility in&nbsp;both the learning strategies and the assessment format as the learning is likely to be individual and&nbsp;unique.&nbsp;This method is also&nbsp;pretty well ideal for designing a scheme of work as well!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider these representations from the perspective of the learning design you documented in Activity 1b.</p>
<ol>
<li>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they adequate for expressing your design?</li>
</ol>
<p>The 4Ts is very useful for expressing the design of the learning experience&nbsp;I recounted in 2a in that there was&nbsp; very linear progression to the learning which was&nbsp;cognitive in its&nbsp;intention and designed to develop skills in a progressive manner in a very short time span using some highly directed learning methods.&nbsp; The e-design template would not have been so useful in this situation as it relies on the&nbsp;learner understanding and interpreting the 'knowledge' in their own terms rather than simply&nbsp;accepting and enacting&nbsp;it and the time constraints and context did not lend themselves to this type of approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What would be the benefits of using these representations for your design? Please explain your views</li>
</ol>
<p>Possibly giving the learner a visual indicator of how the learning was going to be carried out and the connections between the sequences would have been useful in helping to connect the tasks to the technology but the team element would have needed some amendment to include the home context in which she was working for part of the learning and also the support that she was receiving from her peers in addition to that which was given by the teacher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second design, the e-design template would probably have frightened her to death had she been presented with this at the beginning of the leaning process, however, from a summary point of view and to show her how far she had progressed in terms of becoming a more independent practitioner this sort of diagram, together&nbsp;with an explanation of how she had achieved all of the steps might have been useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general the 4Ts model is a useful one for learners as it shows progression and content but the e-design model is a more useful tool for teachers in planning the development of&nbsp;learning and the learners.</p>    </div>
