                   <p>One of the authors of this paper emailed me directly because he is having difficulty with this Cloudworks site.&nbsp; We are attempting to resolve the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, I thought I would post this reference on behalf of the authors because it really does merit wider reading.</p>
<p>It could have been posted in response to several of the questions, (and there are interesting parallels with the Hannon ref. posted in Q7) but to give you a taster, I include several quotes from the article below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>' ... direct participation in the learning community is essential for learning technologists and that common codes of practice for learning technologists are required, both as a benchmark and as a framework by which professional practice can be measured and developed'</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>'This article set out to explore the ways in which learning technologists affect the learning environment in which they work and the implications this may have for the development of professional guidelines for learning technologists'</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">and finally (following both theoretical underpinning and a suite of interviews):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>'An essential component of the role and working context of learning technologists has been shown to be their practical and ethical alignment with the learning environments they support and serve.'</em></p>

                   <p>I think the Peacock et al article in latest issue of Alt-J is also relevant to this and several questions, even tho it deals mainly with the role in relation to research. It concludes that we need a 'more inclusive model of the learning technologist's role' if we are to avoid polarising the field into theorists and practitioners. But in practice, given the distinction between academic/non-academic/academic-related contracts, the inclusivity they are asking for would require major rethinking of roles across the board, IMO.</p>        </div>

                   <p>This is also something that came up when scoping the CMALT qualification. The project's website is still accessible at:</p>
<p>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/calt/alt-accreditation/</p>
<p>I still wish Rhona and I had forced ourselves to get some sensible publications out of that... still, the reports are up there.</p>
<p>The obvious tension was between people working primarily on technology, and those working primarily with people, but the award deliberately required both if people were going to get through it. (Not to a massively high level, it must be said, but both had to be visible in the evidence submitted.)</p>
<p>However, there were other tensions in there too, such as in relation to setting (industry and academia were pitted against each other).</p>        </div>

                   <p>I can't help but adding some links to the communities of practice prespectives (CoP) (Lave and Wenger, 1991). Very recent workshops and events have featured Ettiene Wegner among others - principly educational technologists and academics in education -&nbsp; revaluating notions of&nbsp; participation and the positionality of the educational technologist in communities of practice around learning. Participating or observing some of such debates made me think how, perhaps, the role of the educational technologist has become - or can become - more integral or legitimate (rather than peripheral) in both knowledge management within instutions, and in the facilitating the conduct of learning. This, I think, relates to Helen Beetham's comment above. It also relates to the ways in which the educational technologist can mobalise integral participation by both academic faculty and students (cf. clouds on students' experience).</p>
<p>Links to the events&nbsp; 'Mirandamod: CoP: do they have a role in Education' (http://mirandamod.wikispaces.com/Communities+of+Practice+of) and 'E Wenger&nbsp; broadcast: the learning theory behind communities of practice' (http://www.l4l.co.uk/?p=854).

                   <p>Stimulated by the URL posted by Giota above, it got me wondering how much overlap there is between&nbsp; CoP and what is increasingly being called the Teaching Research Nexus (TRN).&nbsp; There is now a lot of literature on the TRN, but I like the material at <a href="/cloud/view/" rel="nofollow">http://trnexus.edu.au/index.php?page=what-is-the-trn</a>&nbsp; Currently, they are pursued as different strands of literature.&nbsp; But in neither have I found the role of the educational technologist particularly prominent.&nbsp; I'd be pleased to stand back and be contradicted.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I think that one of the links here is that Learning Technologists usually work across different contexts - they have to support practice in a range of departmental settings, and liaise with technical/library specialists, as well as (sometimes) having a culture of 'generic' educational concerns within their own base. In this respect, I think they operate as what Wenger calls boundary-crossing agents. I think this 'cross pollinating' aspect of their work would be lost if learning technologists 'go native' and locate themselves purely as a support function within one teaching context. (I won't say department or faculty or whatever, because I think the important issue here is homogeneity or the lack of it, rather than size.)</p>
<p>I would suspect that their need to engage with researchers, educators and so on may be one way - albeit a modest one - in which they actually constitute part of the "research teaching nexus".</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Tom</p>
<p>I haven't come across anything like this either (as yet!!). But Ettiene Wenger's talk last Tuesday touched upon some overlap - I think. This is definately something that we can perhaps explore further in our OpenExeter study.</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>I'd strongly encourage participants to have a look at Laura Czerniewicz's blog at: <a href="http://blogs.uct.ac.za/blog/laura-cet/2009/11/05/recruiting-academic-amalgams" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.uct.ac.za/blog/laura-cet/2009/11/05/recruiting-academic-amalgams</a>.&nbsp; Laura has contributed elsewhere within this Cloudscape.&nbsp; But in her blog she makes the inciteful comment:</p>
<p><em>We run the danger of framing the position around the conditions of service rather than the needs of the job itself.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>This observation was made in the context of what to include in a job description for an educational technologist.<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Despite the incredibly wide ranging nature of the role, we invariably have to choose between an academic or a 'non-academic' conditions of service.<em>&nbsp;</em> Laura then proposes the term<em> 'blended professionals'.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, the Registrar at Exeter used the same term in an article in a recent edition of the THE (see: <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=408783&c=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=408783&amp;c=1</a></p>
<p><em>As higher education becomes less exclusive, its workforce has become more inclusive, recognising that nothing can be achieved without teamwork. Thankfully, ....&nbsp; professional staff defined by what they are not, in the term "non-academic". I refer always to the professional staff and the professional services because the words "professional" and "service" seem to me to epitomise the identity of those who devote their working lives, alongside their academic colleagues, to advancing knowledge and overcoming ignorance and prejudice. </em></p>

                   <p>Very interesting Tom. I wonder what sort of measures should educational technologists alongside other learning professionals will have to take&nbsp; in the future to exclusionary or divisive definitions. One such thing that comes to mind is to promote a culture of 'collaboration', rather than a culture of 'service'.</p>        </div>
