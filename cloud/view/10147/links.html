<p>Right-wing politics is ascendant - or so it appears.&nbsp; Whether that appearance is fact or myth the political landscape is changing.&nbsp; And left-wing politics is claiming to constructively to catch up with that change.&nbsp; New ways forward are set out in...</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>The Alternative - Towards a New Progressive Politics</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll see how new and progressive the alternative is, but it's definitely politics. And figuring who is leading and who is trailing in politics is open to question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The landscape 'she is a changing' alright - but not in the way either Bob Dillon or progressive policy have in mind. &nbsp;Educators can't afford to ignore any of this.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">_______________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three basic questions prove useful...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what's going on in politics?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;how did things get this way?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;why would educators get involved?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Progressive politics has some of the answers - there are others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>questions and answers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>firstly</strong> - what's going on?&nbsp; The progressive movement points to an international longing for something different in politics - where all members of all societies have a say in the decisions that affect them.</p>
<p><strong>secondly</strong> - how did things get this way? &nbsp;Progressive reform is expanding into the agencies of civil society in ways that stand for all branches of left-wing politics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>thirdly</strong> - why get involved? &nbsp;Progressive politics has a long to-do list...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Political radicals are re-imagining the way society and economy can work from the bottom up, shifting the balance of forces away from the already powerful.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The relies on ideas for a unifying social solidarity, discarding the separation of so-called 'skivers' and 'hard-working families', and replacing that culture of suspicion with a culture of human rights.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The movement therefore supports the EU, for its support of the environment, and also for the development of infrastructure based on investment rather than on cuts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It means bringing electoral reform into politics and a basic universal income for constituents.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It also means learning from previous failures, and&nbsp; particularly persuading white liberals better to integrate with all races.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The complexity needs unravelling in a clear story that faces up to the unpromising electoral maths which reflect a lack of interest in progressive claims and a deep attachment to familiar faces.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The complexity also needs an on-line platform where progressive politicos can find each other.</p>
<p>It's a feel-good agenda. &nbsp;And educators clearly have roles in its realisation.&nbsp; But, before you're bowled over...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>complexity and politics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The what-how-why questions are getting feel-good answers.&nbsp; But they also let loose the complexity of politics.&nbsp; And in any complex position it's dangerous to make a move with one set of signposts and a small-scale map.&nbsp; As a reviewer of <em>The Alternative</em> concludes...</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>'the yawning hole in this book is that it barely addresses <br />the awkward gap between what voters are thinking <br />and what progressives would like them to be thinking...&nbsp; <br />Progressive ideas took a pasting over Brexit <br />and the book doesn&rsquo;t seem very interested in asking why'</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right-wing answers to the 'why?' question are straight-forward.&nbsp; They argue for the stabilisation of society.&nbsp; And that conservative positioning leans heavily on the importance of loyalty, patriotism and tradition. &nbsp;It's not too hard to get this uncomplicated message across - immediate, recognisable and feel-good.</p>
<p>Left-wing answers are harder to get across.&nbsp; It's not thinking for stabilisation but for change - a new and disturbing 'struggle'.&nbsp; Action in a changing world needs that complexity - more ideas deepens and widens the bases for action.&nbsp; The repertoire is a requirement for survival.&nbsp; But the complexity needs explanations for the entire 'what-how-and-why?' spectrum. &nbsp;And there is no guarantee of agreement - Labour-party meetings are forever counter-poising one point-of-view with another...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;trade-union militancy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; respectable non-conformity</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;popular opinion &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intellectual rigour</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;calls for revolution &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calls for reform</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;constituency claims &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; parliamentary claims</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;left-wing audacity &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; centre-ground caution</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;risky principal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electable success</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never a dull moment.&nbsp; And every moment feeding into family and community issues.&nbsp; They range from migration, through housing and into local schools. It can feel less like an agenda for reform and more like a hit-and-run shambles.&nbsp; Not necessarily coherent, nor feel-good or progressive - but a changing world needs the vibrancy.</p>
<p>If there is a way of focussing this vibrancy it will be in a grassroots progressive politics, where people work out&nbsp; for themselves what they can do about what ....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;brings in useful earnings</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;means I can pay my way</p>

<p style="padding-left: 150px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;my own and my family's</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;helps us find out what's going on</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and know how to deal with conflicts</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;so we can feel safe</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;even when things change as much as they do</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;we trust and look after each other</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and I can know what my life has been worth</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's going on here?&nbsp; People are taking charge of their own lives. &nbsp;How did it get this way?&nbsp; They got tired of misplaced advice from uncomprehending experts.&nbsp; Why then should educators get involved? &nbsp;We need students and educators learning from each other what we all need to know - so we can deal with what is going on in each other's lives. &nbsp;It's the politics of what we-the-people, experience, recognise and can own.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>citizens and alliances</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Those politics - of experience, recognition and ownership - are variable.&nbsp; Some citizens find more meaning here than others.&nbsp; Some are in a better position to deal with change - they don't need help.&nbsp; A shrinking minority are well enough positioned to pick and choose what suits.&nbsp; A growing majority are not - they need all the help they can get, and then some.&nbsp; Some see progressive politics as wasting their own time and other peoples' money.&nbsp; Yet others are bored stiff by all such talk - there's more fun to be had in other ways. &nbsp;The progressive agenda is not bound to click.</p>
<p>These are the variable pulls of the progressives agenda; there are also variable pushes.&nbsp; They are revealed in the use of language.&nbsp; And the uses of language are divisive - they point to insiders and outsiders.&nbsp; Take the progressive advocates' urging the replacement of the term 'welfare' with 'social security'.&nbsp; It is important to professional positioners.&nbsp; To everybody else it's another bit of jargon, saying nothing about what will improve anybody's life.&nbsp; And raising questions about who anybody can count on.</p>
<p>It gets worse.&nbsp; The alliance's on-line platform has turned out to be a self-serving and rambling collection of incoherent opinions. &nbsp;Some are hostile to the left-wing - one is toying with a new political party to displace it.&nbsp; It's a listen-to-us &eacute;litism. &nbsp;And that's a gift for a movement with a better grasp of what works in the here and now.&nbsp; It's how it attracts working-class attention - sounding like it understands their experience, and feeling like what those people can recognise as their own.&nbsp; The alliance may have heard of UKIP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The progressive alliance needs to be strong on the causes and consequences of what is going on in people's everyday lives.&nbsp; Alliance talk of cherished appeals which foster hope passes some people's feel-good test, but it fails most people's will-it-work test.&nbsp; It fails to take account of varied and often conflicting interests in its own membership.&nbsp; It seems to be unaware of the damage caused by the invading, corrupting, manoeuvring and posturing alliances which are endemic to politics.&nbsp; It is naive.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>learning and narrative</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Trade unions get more than their fair share of dismissive rejection.&nbsp; The perpetrators have their reasons.&nbsp; But none can credibly accuse TUs of being naively unable to get organised.&nbsp; And I can't help wondering how many in the progressive alliance would see TUs as offering the makings of a political move.&nbsp; I've nothing against getting angry with injustice, but I can see greater gains in getting organised.&nbsp; And it occurs to me that the scrutiny of 'what's going on?', 'how did it get this way?' and 'why get involved?' will find a non-naive basis for the politics of progressive alliance.</p>
<p>This a conversation about causes and consequences and that sequence readily moves into narrative. &nbsp;Some of the alliance voices, mentioned earlier, argue for a clear narrative.&nbsp; A narrative recounts one thing leading to another - moving through anticipation, departure and arrival.&nbsp; And that sequence intersects accounts of shared individual and group experience.&nbsp; It's not surprising, then, to find that most people can make more more sense of an unfolding narrative than they can of a categorised analysis.</p>
<p>A narrative enables citizens to locate and recognise left-wing failures to connect with working-class experience.&nbsp; It can also enable citizens to visualise how the alliance can establish new and trustworthy relationships.&nbsp; And that invites citizen action: like trade-unions not waiting for rescue but acting to get a result.&nbsp; This is citizen voice on citizen's experience - visualising what's going on, how it got this way and what to do about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are critical and demanding answers lurking around questions like that.&nbsp; Learning to deal with them stands where a decent education should stand - where citizens become students. &nbsp;Whatever it has not done there is some critical thing that progressive politics has done.&nbsp; And that is to expose how badly positioned schooling is for enabling students fully to get to grips with the what-how-and-why questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That loss is because curriculum is shaped and framed to reflect the priorities of political and commercial interests - from right and left. &nbsp;Most careers-work lessons are limited and banal.&nbsp; Their texts are at least as much about learning to fit in as to make a difference.&nbsp; Making a difference means probing, interrogating and questioning dominant interests.&nbsp; Our citizen-students' education needs to be less for compliance and more for reform.&nbsp; This is learning-for-living in a changing world - enabling an informed, reflective &nbsp;and ready-for-anything citizenship.</p>
<p>It is a fulfilment for what the progressive alliance has called...</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>'a longing for something different'</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But It is a now-and-future client-led fulfilment of that longing.&nbsp; And that is not what the alliance has been envisaging - so-far.</p>
