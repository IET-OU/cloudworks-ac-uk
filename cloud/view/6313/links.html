        <p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>The Career-learning Caf&eacute;</em></a></p>
<p>The opening paragraph in an article on change, like this one, is where you can expect to read about unfulfilled predictions of change.&nbsp; They are blind alleys, such as these...</p>
<ol>
<li>an anticipation that came to nothing;</li>
<li>an innovation that turned out not to be new;</li>
<li>a social change that petered out;</li>
<li>a warning dismissed as fraudulent;</li>
<li>some engineering that wobbled or collapsed;</li>
<li>some science that was never replicated.</li>
</ol>
<p>They make popular stories because they are reassuring.&nbsp; The doom-mongers were wrong.&nbsp; So were the romantic optimists.&nbsp; Life goes on.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re still struggling, but we&rsquo;re still here...</p>
<p align="center"><em>plus &ccedil;a change, plus c&rsquo;est la m&eacute;me chose</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a comfort.&nbsp; And - in case you need it - this article makes six attempts to get you out of that comfort zone.</p>
<p><strong><em>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an anticipation that is dangerously right</em></strong></p>
<p>Social ethnographer Gillian Tett is among the few commentators to predict the credit crunch.&nbsp; The few documented risk-avoidance in financial services.&nbsp; But the many took no notice, because the anticipation didn&rsquo;t fit with neo-liberal assumptions - about commercial expansion making everything possible.&nbsp; So the few were set aside.&nbsp; But they were right.</p>
<p>The consequences for work-life are out-of-control.&nbsp; And the damage to government budgeting is making public-service careers work close-to-impossible to maintain.&nbsp; Indeed, private careers-coaching is taking over - it&rsquo;s already a big-dollar global industry.&nbsp; Would you say that any of this is worth our professional careers-work attention?</p>
<p><strong><em>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an innovation that changes how people learn</em></strong></p>
<p>Practically everything is getting digitised - from friendship to fine art.&nbsp; We can digitise relationships, games, and subversion.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s wrong with that?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s how people find out what&rsquo;s going on, and figure out what to do about it.&nbsp; They can update by the hour - and often need to. &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s easy to think of all this as no more than a useful tool - nothing to worry about, more of an opportunity than a challenge.</p>
<p>And, for a time careers work colonised it, exporting what it does into its new handy formats - word-processors, data-bases, spreadsheets.&nbsp; But people may well feel now that they&rsquo;re getting as much information and advice as they need - and in interactive formats.&nbsp; And that digital territory is not only occupied by inhabitants, it is invaded by predators.&nbsp; Professional careers workers can best help by enabling them critically to interrogate the information and influences they find.&nbsp; Time, do you think, to nail the myth that the digitised can replace the direct-and-personal professional?</p>
<p><strong><em>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a social change that brings cultural turbulence</em></strong></p>
<p>In a stagnant economy opportunity becomes a zero-sum game - one person&rsquo;s gain is another&rsquo;s loss.&nbsp; Life gets more competitive.&nbsp; People pull back into a protected spaces.&nbsp; We become strangers to each other.&nbsp; Experience is documented as turbulent - unconnected, uncivil, unpredictable, and unsafe.&nbsp; &Eacute;lites become suspect:&nbsp; politicos, attorneys, academics, and even medicos are second-guessed.&nbsp; But we like to remember that we are social animals.&nbsp; So, no worries, it&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re good at adapting to necessity.</p>
<p>But surely work-life is nothing if not social.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it done with, for and in response to other people?&nbsp; Yes, but with a tighter and more immediate focus - &lsquo;me&rsquo;, &lsquo;my family&rsquo; and &lsquo;our kin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Conventional career-planning doesn&rsquo;t fit to that. &nbsp;And the background turbulence - some say &lsquo;chaos&rsquo; - seems to undermine the possibility of a plan.&nbsp; Well, maybe not entirely; but, if not, isn&rsquo;t it time to re-think what we can offer?</p>
<p><strong><em>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warnings that we dare not ignore </em></strong></p>
<p>The most persistent warnings we hear concern well-being and risk - for communities, species and the biosphere.&nbsp; But such warnings are easily neutralised - by well-placed outfits whose interests are threatened.&nbsp; Anything can be rubbished by drawing on sponsored research, yielding large-sample &lsquo;significance&rsquo;, promoted by client-compliant consultants.&nbsp; The issues get ducked.</p>
<p>Is it possible that careers work colludes with some of this?&nbsp; The diagnostic apparatus of employability plays to the interests of competitive marketing.&nbsp; And labour-market information doesn&rsquo;t include ratings of work-life&rsquo;s carbon footprints.&nbsp; And this is not just about emissions.&nbsp; Damage is done to African villages, developing-world sweatshops, and home neighbourhoods - where lives are blighted and people are discarded.&nbsp; Careers work deals in such consequences - from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; Any need, might we wonder, to re-think what we mean by independent assessment and impartial information?</p>
<p><strong><em>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; engineering that changes more than we think</em></strong></p>
<p>Alan Turing invented what we now call the computer.&nbsp; He also designed a test for knowing whether computers are intelligent - a test that no computer has ever passed.&nbsp; But global corporations use the technology to transfer gazillions of dollars from one side of the globe to the other - in micro-seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, as you may have noticed, the same technology can quickly off-load any risk.&nbsp; But global corporations smile the same smiles, and make the same promises.</p>
<p>Corporate wealth can exceed government wealth several times over.&nbsp; And the processing speed and power of computers explains much of that policy weakness and corporate strength.&nbsp; The rebalancing of power is transforming the working world - access to markets, cheap labour, polarised incomes, economic migration and global shifts in dominance.&nbsp; Would that kind of information be of any use or interest to your students and clients?&nbsp; Would it still be careers work?</p>
<p><strong><em>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; science that changes everything</em></strong></p>
<p>For the big scientific news we need to go back to Charles Darwin.&nbsp; His ideas never supported crude doctrines for the survival of the fittest.&nbsp; But genetics and neurology has transformed psychological, sociological and economic thinking.&nbsp; Nonetheless, at first his book <em>The Origin of Species</em> was thought to be useful to pigeon fanciers but ecclesiastically unacceptable.&nbsp; A kindly man, he had a bad time with it.</p>
<p>But he changed how we know ourselves - and knowing ourselves is a central careers-work concern.&nbsp; The behaviour sciences that Charles Darwin has most influenced are the three that careers work most persistently calls on.&nbsp; Genetics is transforming the way we can talk about consciousness, freedom and autonomy.&nbsp; None can any longer mean what we used to mean by decision-making.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re catching-up - but slowly.</p>
<p><strong><em>where do we go from here?</em></strong></p>
<p>Those times, they were a-changing - more than Bob Dylan, and a lot of other people, ever knew.&nbsp; The most dangerous negations of change rely on habits-of-mind - which are as dangerous for the future of careers work as for any.&nbsp; We need to re-shape our expertise and re-state our credibility.&nbsp; Might that mean....&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;re-positioning ourselves in relation to government and corporate interests?</li>
<li>&nbsp;shifting focus from an authoritative content to a questioning process?</li>
<li>establishing the social enterprises needed following world-wide privatisation?</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be a start on a radically changing story.&nbsp; And we need that story to be distinctive - separating us from predation and constraint, and pursuing ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;career&rsquo; offers such a narrative.&nbsp; It means both &lsquo;race&rsquo; and &lsquo;journey&rsquo;.&nbsp; Two stories, but one has the bigger and more distinctive idea.&nbsp; The clue is this: we can interrupt a journey with a race, but we can&rsquo;t interrupt a race with a journey.&nbsp; The smaller idea can be carried by the bigger one.</p>
<p>And the only possible format for setting out a journey is a narrative.&nbsp; So, are you sitting uncomfortably?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve guessed that I doubt that we&rsquo;ve done enough on extending the careers-work story.&nbsp; There have been, it&rsquo;s true, one or two attempts to characterise careers-work development as a paradigm shift.&nbsp; But they are exaggerated: more-of-the-same, but decorated with flattering bells and enticing whistles.&nbsp; A paradigm shift is a lot more troublesome than that.&nbsp; Charles Darwin finally faced it.&nbsp; <em>The Descent of Man</em> doesn&rsquo;t do much for pigeon fanciers - but it changes everything else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll find out soon enough whether or not we are facing a paradigm shift.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re bound to notice.&nbsp; My bet is that, at the very least, we&rsquo;re on a paradigm shuffle.</p>
