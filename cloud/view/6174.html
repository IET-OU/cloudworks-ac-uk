<p>Being a Scientist (2012)</p>
<p>Workshop led by Dr Pavam Rezale.</p>
<p>Dr Pavam Rezale distributing hand notes about &ldquo;so what does it mean to be original?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Introducing himself, first of I am a scientist, I am a reader and going to be a professor soon, I am here for 10 years, before that I was in Kings college. Actually I am doing two jobs.</p>
<p>Much more relax and friendly environment here in OU.</p>
<p>So what is a PhD?</p>
<p>Question how many PhDs ? Room is full of PhDs, no MPhils? &nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you understand a PhD is?</p>
<p>Student&rsquo;s responses: a line on the CV, &nbsp;being famous?</p>
<p>Serious please?</p>
<p>Student&rsquo;s responses:</p>
<p>Making contribution, career improvement, original work,</p>
<p>Is the work you producing original? What you understand by &ldquo;Original&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Students have got a sheet. A list with 18 definitions is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Group work 1( 5 min discussion among the students)</strong></p>
<p>Get together, discuss and think about the points and evaluate for five minutes. He is going around the table and asking what do you think is not a good definition?</p>
<p>A student pointing to the point 5. She disagrees with point 5, taking about her topics, and discussing about the context. They think it depends on the context.</p>
<p>What about point 16!! What&rsquo;s the point of that? Again what about point 11? a student taking about his topic which is new and has not been written before but is it mean it is new? Again it depends on the context. Require context and others are obvious.</p>
<p>Going back to slide: quite clear definition of OU&nbsp; Phd and Mphil. Mphil vs phD</p>
<p><strong>Group activity 2(group discussion for 5 min):</strong></p>
<p>How can you ensure that after three years your work will be doctoral standard?</p>
<p>Asking students around the tables what they think about it?</p>
<p>Student&rsquo;s responses:</p>
<p>Be critical in a productive way</p>
<p>Think about what you are doing and don&rsquo;t follow the instructions.</p>
<p>Keep up to date with literature.</p>
<p>Worthy of publication, Sharing ideas and peer reviews, essential to have network.</p>
<p>Getting feed back and reflect on that</p>
<p>You are the one who has done the work and you should be the first author. Of course your supervisor has supported you and he is the GRRU in the field. It is also student&rsquo;s responsibility to generate ideas, and further thinking. It should be both way discussion, interaction and communication.</p>
<p>So what are the messages?</p>
<p>I will suggest you to publish. Why it is important to publish in high impact journal?</p>
<p>Student&rsquo;s response:</p>
<p>Expert environment and wider environment.</p>
<p>Showing up a slide with coming us OU programmes. Encouraging students to join the programmes.</p>
<p>Try to apply for funding for bursaries, smaller funding for conference travel, placement elsewhere if helps and supervisors agrees then apply. It shows up your independence.</p>
<p>What make a successful PhD student?</p>
<p>Students responses:</p>
<p>Work hard, confidence, independence</p>
<p>What about fear of failure? Thinks can go wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Independence, clear goal, planning is essential, you have to the probation. Later on Robert and Peter will talk about your probations.</p>
<p>Going to slides</p>
<p>Own experience about working hard, working over the weekends, but don&rsquo;t forget to talk break, because it burns. If you are planned you don&rsquo;t have to take work home.</p>
<p>Lab book maintenance is essential, should be recorded carefully and reflected on what have you done last week, why should not do again.</p>
<p>The more you publish, the more you write the better you get. Good thesis.</p>
<p>You must enjoy what you doing.</p>
<p>Q; what does it take to be a good scientists?</p>
<p>Student responses:</p>
<p>Fair claims, acceptance of mistakes?</p>
<p>Discuss the inconsistencies. Again about peer reviewing. Response to the comments. Look back and think about the reviews if your consistent making the same mistakes again again then looses the reputation.</p>
<p>Ok another question for you? What does it mean to be a scientist in today&rsquo;s society?</p>
<p>Students response:</p>
<p>Make people believe your work bring benefits.</p>
<p>Things are more immediate in today&rsquo;s society, recall about MMR</p>
<p>A student ask a question what is MMR?</p>
<p>A student explains: a vaccine for children. &nbsp;A discussion about Andrew Jeremy Wakefiel&rsquo;s andhis fraudulent 1998 research paper in support of that claim.</p>
<p>This reflect that you should be aware of the situation, examples of frozen planet and coast, OU is links with medias and there is great trust you do have a big responsibility because people expect more from OU.</p>
<p>We are in global, what you are saying is not just in the corridor it is around the world.</p>
<p>Media awareness.</p>
<p>Video presentation was prepared but wasn&rsquo;t shown.</p>
<p>Conduct becoming of scientists</p>
<p>Why should we do this?</p>
<p>Maintain trust, accountability</p>
<p>What happen if you don&rsquo;t do it?</p>
<p>Legislation implies disciplinary action. This has actions. University has an ethics committee.</p>
<p>If you have this protocol in you mind you can&rsquo;t go wrong.</p>
<p>Intellectual freedom</p>
<p>Giving credit is so important, acknowledge them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Making sure have another 30 mins and going through the slides again..</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget your supervisors have also the responsibilities, informing you about the environment.</p>
<p>I am sure as a PhD you understand what is peer review, if you don&rsquo;t I do have a whole presentation on peer review. Should be anonymous should not be biased.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are lots of models one side blind, double side blinds but more of the journals have reviewer&rsquo;s side blind. Reviewers shouldn&rsquo;t know the authors.</p>
<p>Negotiate and discuss about the authorship in the group.</p>
<p>Examples of falsification but peer review are essential but the evaluation based on the data on the paper. It is scientist&rsquo;s responsibility to maintain the ethics and conduct.</p>
<p>Examples of plagiarisms in the slide.</p>
<p>Software of identifying plagiarisms in the slide.</p>
<p>Record keeping is the evidence for future.</p>
<p><strong>Group work 3 (5 min discussion among the group):</strong></p>
<p>The tables are choosing the cases and handouts are distributed. Students are reading the cases and discussing. The source of the case studies is National Academy of Press 1995 (ww.nap.edu/html/obas)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Discussion and evolutions about case studies</p>
<p>Case study 1: Plagiarism</p>
<p>Why she did plagiarism?</p>
<p>Because she wasn&rsquo;t told all the information, but the student is 2<sup>nd</sup> year graduate student and she should be familiarised with the rules and conducts.</p>
<p>Case study 2: Publications</p>
<p>Issues:</p>
<p>Young professor, 2 students, both has contribution to their work. Whether published one paper or separate papers? Supervisor things one paper, students think 2 paper? If one paper who would be the first author?</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>1 big paper.</p>
<p>But then who to put 1<sup>st</sup> author or&nbsp; who to 2nd author?</p>
<p>Put <strong>asterisk</strong> (*) on the authors name and give a note that they had equal contributions.</p>
<p>Case study 3: credit giving:</p>
<p>Issues:</p>
<p>Graduate student finds a professor published a paper with the idea he/she published in as abstract 6 months ago and had discussion with the professor.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>Is it possible to do the same work in 6 months? Or professor had the idea before the student submitted the abstract? &nbsp;There are the dates?</p>
<p>Identify and think and discuss about the issues before taking any action.</p>
<p>End up the session and thinking all the students.&nbsp;</p>			<div class="posted-by">
