    <div class="user-entry">

        <p>I am an Access to HE Coordinator and tutor, working for a large FE College within Yorkshire and Humber region. The aim of Access to HE is to prepare 19+ adult learners University level study I coordinate two pathways at one of the smaller campuses - Humanities and Social Sciences and Health Science Professions. I also teach Psychology, Sociology, Social Policy and Study Skills. My role as a coordinator involves curriculum design and setting up and moderating VLEs such as Moodle and Google Classrooms. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>The College has recently adopted a new VLE platform - Google Classrooms. The College has also loaned out Chromebooks to students, so&nbsp; I set up Google Classrooms in order to support students in and outside of the classroom.&nbsp; The Chromebooks have been useful in that I have been able to set up online interactive tasks, such as quizzes, that students can do in the classroom or at home. Students are also able to open up shared documents within the Google Classroom and collaborate on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Technology Enhanced Learning Team (TEL) were the key actors in setting up and facilitating training on the Google platform, as where the teachers who used Google Classrooms. The TEL team adopted Google Classrooms in the belief that...</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>It is easier to use than Moodle (which it is. However, it is worth noting that there are some things that Moodle can do that Google Classrooms can't do - see 'Actions below').</li>
<li>It is easier to communicate with students.</li>
<li>It is easy to upload and use&nbsp; a variety of learning materials including Word Docs, presentations, YouTube videos etc.</li>
<li>It is easier for students and tutor's to collaborate online -&nbsp; tutors can post shared docs and presentations for the students to collaborate on.</li>
<li>It will cut down on the cost of printed materials.</li>
<li>It will promote independent learning.</li>
<li>It is available across different platforms (google and android apps), so students and tutors can access Google classrooms on their mobile devices as well as desktop computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Task</strong></p>
<p>I set up Google classrooms in order to achieve the points highlighted above, in the 'Situation' section. However, I was particular interested in developing&nbsp; real world I.T. Skills, which will stand students in good stead in both the work place and at University.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also wanted to ensure that all learners have access to the learning materials used in each lesson at all times. This is particularly important for adult learners, many of whom have&nbsp; work and family commitments outside of college. If a student can't make it to lesson for childcare or work reasons, then they can catch up on lessons missed on Google Classrooms. I also wanted to encourage more collaboration and discussion in and outside of the classroom, particularly among the quieter groups. The measure of success for this was how many students contributed to a discussion in and outside of class (see actions and results for more details on this.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition to this, I also hoped that the use of Google Classrooms would improve retention, attendance and achievement. Compared to last year, retention is better for both of the pathways I teach on. Though attendance is low for one group.&nbsp; It is difficult to comment on achievement rates at this time whilst students are still on the course, though I have noticed that more low attenders&nbsp; are still passing their assignments at merit level compared to previous years. Could this be a sign that these students are making full use of Google Classrooms. Whilst this is anecdotal evidence, research by L&oacute;pez-P&eacute;rez et al (2011) suggests that blended and online learning can improve retention and achievement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Action and results&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Last year, using the credentials provided to me by the College, I set up Google Classroom account for teachers.</li>
<li>Once I had set up classrooms for each Access to HE unit, I invited students to join each classroom using a unique code. However, not all students joined the classroom. At the start of this academic year, I made sure that students had joined all classes during the induction week. Tutors can give students access to Google classrooms themselves, though this may be time consuming for large Cohorts.</li>
</ol><ol type="1">
<li value="3">I then used Google Classrooms to share documents with the students and upload lesson materials. I tend to make announcements in the stream, but upload lesson material to the &lsquo;About&rsquo; section as I can organise the materials week by week. As mentioned above, this seems to have been beneficial for low attenders as they are still achieving despite their low attendance. This may indicate that they are engaging with Google Classrooms outside of the classrooms.</li>
<li>I have also created quizzes using Socrates, Google forms and Moodle Cloud and posted links to these on Google Classrooms. For quizzes, I settled on Moodle Cloud. Whilst Socrates is good, students have to input a separate password to access the quiz. Whereas with the quizzes on Moodle Cloud, students just log in using the same credentials to log into Google Classrooms. This has help to engage all students in the classroom as they tell me they enjoy taking part in the quizzes. It is also useful for me, as I can check their understanding of the topic.</li>
<li>In addition to this, I have posted links to Padlet on google classrooms, so that students can share ideas from discussion activities. For example, when discussing the strengths and limitations of a particular theory. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Within the classroom environment, all students contribute well to the Padlet activities. However, they do not seem to engage as well with this activity outside of the classroom. To overcome this problem, I plan to set an activity linked to one of the unit criteria. So, in order to pass the unit, they will have to complete the activity online.</li>
<li>This year, I started&nbsp; sharing documents such as google slides or docs on Google Classrooms, which students can work on together. This has also helped to engage all students. For example, each student within a group can work on a particular slide. Furthermore, once the students have completed their presentation, it will always be available on Google Classrooms. This is particularly useful for students who have missed lessons. However, some students might complain that these students have not contributed to the presentation. To overcome this problem, students who have missed a lesson, could create a presentation and post it to the classroom. To encourage this, I could mark the student as attending a lesson (e.g. A virtual attendance mark, which contributes to their overall attendance rate).</li>
<li>One of the limitations of Google Classrooms, is that I can&rsquo;t create a Turnitin assignment, unlike moodle. So I post links on Google classrooms to Turnitin assignments on the Moodle Cloud. Students can sign into Moodle Cloud using their student account for Google, so they don&rsquo;t have to use a separate password. Turnitin is a plagiarism checker, which students will also have to use a university. I also do all of my marking on Turnitin, so students always have access to feedback online.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;R<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">eflections</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy using Google Classrooms, and students have told me they find it useful, particularly when they have missed lessons. However, Google Classrooms is a cloud based platform which assumes that all students will have access to a computer and the internet at home. However, I do have some students who do not have access to the internet. So, even though the have been loaned a Chromebook, they may not be able to use it at home without internet access (as Chromebooks are a cloud based device). To overcome this problem, perhaps the College could loan out dongles to those who need it, though I appreciate that this will cost money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have already mentioned, students are engaging well with the Chromebooks and Google Classrooms within the Classroom environment. Low attenders seem to be engaging with this platform outside of the classroom as the are still passing their assignments. Furthermore, one of my groups is quiet and can be difficult to engage in group discussions, but I have used Google Classrooms to overcome this problem. I now get students to discuss their ideas in small groups and then post something to the Padlet or Google Docs. Once they have done this activity, I will then get each group to share their ideas with the rest of the class. The act of getting them to write down their ideas first seems to have helped the students engage more with discussion activities. However, this is only one cohort, so it is not possible to generalise the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst Google Classrooms seems to work well within a classroom context, I need to use it more effectively to encourage collaboration outside of the classroom. Even when I have set up tasks outside of the classroom, not all students have engaged with these tasks. In order to overcome this problem, for the next academic year, I plan to link one or more of the unit criteria to the online tasks, which they will have to complete in order to pass the unit. For example, contributing to a online discussion, just as Open University students do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Google Classrooms was met with some resistance when it was first set up. As I a result of this, I found that I was the only tutor using it.&nbsp; Students ended up having to look for lessons materials on both Google Classrooms and Moodle, which caused some confusion. &nbsp;Perhaps this was the result of the&nbsp; work that needed to be done to either transfer existing materials from Moodle to Google Classrooms or to develop new materials.&nbsp; There are also some things that Moodle can do that&nbsp; Google Classrooms cannot do. For example, you cannot upload Turnitin assignments to Google classrooms. In order to overcome this problem, I have started using Moodle Cloud. This enables me to&nbsp; post links to Moodle Cloud from Google Classrooms; for example, a link to a Turntin assignment and students will not need a separate password or username to access this. In addition to this, materials for 'old' Moodle, can be transferred to the new online Moodle Cloud if necessary. As a result of this, and more training offered by the College, more tutors are engaging with the Google Platform.</p>

			<p>I have tried out Compendium LD and have designed activities loosely based on my design narrative&nbsp; from Activity 1 (click on link below if you want to view this).&nbsp; The design narrative was about how I integrated google classrooms into the Access course. My CompendiumLD design just focuses on one lesson though as it would take far to long create a whole course using this software. To save time the LD design is based on a previous 5 minute lesson plan I have used. I have included links to both of these if you wish to compare them at the end of this message.</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts on CompendiumLD</p>
<ol type="1">
<li lang="en-US" value="1"><strong>What do you think are its main strengths and weaknesses?</strong></li>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Strengths include:</strong></li>
<ul type="circle">
<li>It is fairly easy to use and navigate</li>
<li>It is fairly quick to design an activity or lesson using this.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Also useful for designing a course or module.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Weaknesses include:</strong></li>
<ul type="circle">
<li>You have to download the software to work offline. I think that it would work much better within the 'cloud' as an online tool like Google Docs and other google applications. A lot has changed in FE and HE over the years. Many institutions are spread over geographical areas, so it would be easier for colleagues to share, access and work on the same learning design.</li>
<li>Whilst you can add more detail of the activity to each 'node', you have to double click on each node to access that detail (e.g. To access what each group within the lesson is expected to do). This may be a bit cumbersome and time consuming. With a five minute lesson plan, you get an overview of the lesson and what students are expected to do in each activity - so unlike LD, you can see what students are expected to do at a glance (click on link below to see example). Of course, this 5 minute lesson plan does have it's limitations&nbsp; - it takes longer than five minutes to put together (usually it takes my about 20-30 minutes to do a plan). Compared to LD I think it is a little quicker to produce, though (It took me about 45 minutes to produce the LD design).</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li lang="en-US"><strong>Can you see yourself using this in the future?</strong></li>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Possibly, but not in the near future. As mentioned above, I feel that it would more effective as a cloud based tool, as it would be easier to not only share learning designs, but to work on them collaboratively as a team, online in real time.</li>
</ul>
<li lang="en-US"><strong>If so, how?</strong></li>
<ul type="disc">
<li>I think I would use it for course design, rather than individual activity or lesson planning. LD seems more suitable for course teams to work on course designs as it will give them to visualise the course structure. However, as Pettit warns, 'But there&rsquo;s a danger, is there not, that if one then thinks about the patterning and the structure, that the good idea becomes submerged in a process and a structure' (Pettit, 2010, p3).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li lang="en-US"><strong>If you choose to use an alternative tool or to simply represent the design using pen and paper, explain your reasons.</strong></li>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Although I decided to try out CompendiumLD, I thought that I would share the 5 minute lesson plan on the forum. I feel that it more useful for busy teachers in FE (not sure about HE), as it is fairly quick to create and gives a more detailed 'at a glance' overview compared to LD. Feel free to at look at both the my LD design and 5 minute lesson plan by clicking on the links below, and critically comment on them if you wish.</li>
