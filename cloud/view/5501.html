                   <h1>Executive summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This synthesis provides a review of evidence-based practice to learning and teaching with technology in higher education. The evidence was considered in relation to the three levels of purpose of identified in the HEFCE e-Learning Strategy namely: <em>efficiency</em>, <em>enhancement</em> and <em>transformation</em> gains in student learning.&nbsp; A further framework was devised in this synthesis to determine where evidence might be of use and the extent of its impact.&nbsp; This was to support a range of stakeholders (practitioners, educational developers and policy makers) in making the best use of evidence in their particular roles.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The synthesis is limited to scrutinising the application of technology in learning and teaching.&nbsp; It focused on a demonstration of the use of evidence in the practices of professional teachers in higher education, and how this evidence might change practice.</p>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>The synthesis was largely a desk-based study but included some engagement with practitioners. It incorporated reviews of journals articles, case studies, and learning and teaching artefacts.&nbsp; Engagement with practitioners was through seminar attendance and interviews (available via vodcasts).</p>
<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>This synthesis has shown that that a range of technologies could be used to support a range of educational purposes.&nbsp; These include:</p>

<p>The defining feature was how the technology was used to achieve learning goals, how it was integrated with the needs of the student, and how the learning and teaching context was accommodated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conducting this synthesis we uncovered some issues in relation to the nature of the evidence reported and in finding evidence of changes in practice.&nbsp; Our findings showed that, in general, a weak theory/practice nexus exists.&nbsp; Fundamental issues are related to beliefs about and approaches to teaching.&nbsp; These are linked to how departmental or institutional contexts may constrain practice.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Technology has the potential effectively to support learning and teaching in a number of situations.&nbsp; However, the manner in which the technology was used and aligned with the goals and aspirations of the learner was an important consideration.&nbsp; Practitioners do not appear to be capitalising on existing evidence.&nbsp; More emphasis appears to be placed on generating new evidence rather than evidence driving new practices.&nbsp; Teachers&rsquo; beliefs and practices are influential in determining how they engage with technology. The context of both the student and the teacher is also influential in determining the successfulness of learning and teaching practices with technology.&nbsp; Academic developers have key roles in supporting practitioners in engaging with relevant evidence while also supporting the development of their beliefs and practices concerning learning and teaching with technology.&nbsp; Policy makers have key roles in determining the integration of technology, as they influence the culture within which practitioners operate and hence their actions.</p>        </div>
