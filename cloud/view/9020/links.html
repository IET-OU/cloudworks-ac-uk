        <p><strong>Title</strong>&nbsp;Using Wikis as a teaching tool in a CAE exam training class<em><br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p><em>Teacher of 18 adult learners in a 2-hour evening class</em></p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>Within the University where I work, we offer CAE training courses to adult learners. &nbsp;The learners range in age from 18 to 65+. &nbsp;Some are also following a degree course at the university, others are generally working professionals who wish to improve their English for personal or private reasons. &nbsp;For this latter group, they may not have followed any formal training or education program for 20 years or more. &nbsp;As the class is in the late evening, the students are sometimes tired having been at work all day. &nbsp;In addition, they may not have established learning routines. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>It was noticed that a lot of the students were not making any or only a few effective (or sometimes correct) notes. &nbsp;As the text book is quite busy and difficult to navigate, extra information is often given via other media in the class from which the students need to take notes. &nbsp;In addition, it was observed that students sometimes 'switched off' &nbsp;in class, if they didn't have an active role to play.</em></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>The students were given the responsibility for their own collective notes. &nbsp;Two students are named each week to take the notes for the whole class. &nbsp;They then had to post their notes within a group wiki on Blackboard. &nbsp;Two students were chosen in order that their combined notes covered everything discussed in the class. &nbsp;Rather than relying on one student to minute the classroom. &nbsp;Other students were allowed to edit the wiki if they spotted anything missing or wrong. &nbsp;The teacher informed the group she would not be correcting the wiki as if it were a writing assignment, unless there was something glaringly wrong or that might mislead other students.</em></p>
<p><em>The students were allowed to add external material to the notes. &nbsp; E.g. websites with useful explanations, exercises or articles; images and diagrams; or videos they found amusing or that illustrated a topic.</em></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Results</strong></p>
<p><em>This is still in progress so final results cannot be seen, however, overall the students are performing the basic task of creating a wiki of class notes for each week fairly effectively. &nbsp;By having two students work together, the 'responsibility' to produce the notes was shared, but it also encouraged them to do the task to avoid letting down the other.</em></p>
<p><em>However the students do not seem to have read the notes - probably planning on coming back to them before the final test at the end of the course. &nbsp;In addition, whilst there have been a few small but simple to correct errors showing up on the wiki - none of the students have stepped up to do so. &nbsp;As stated previously, the teacher's role was not as a corrector of English, but as a form of 'caretaker' only if and when necessary.</em></p>
<p><em><em>The quality of the wiki was not always high - sometimes the students had just typed out the few notes they had made in class, without adding any extra supporting material that would make the wiki more interesting.</em></em></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>The use of the wiki was interesting as it allowed the teacher to see what students had considered note-worthy from the class. &nbsp;For example, little cultural discussions that came up in the lesson were sometimes described in great deal on the wiki. &nbsp;As stated in the results, sometimes the quality of the wikis varied.</em></p>
<p><em>When doing this again, I would be more specific in what is expected in terms of effort, quality and content. &nbsp;Possibly by showing a sample wiki page done well.</em></p>
<p><em>It might also be a good idea to have a little quiz each week based on the notes of the wiki. &nbsp;The students who write the wiki entry could also write a little 5-question test.</em></p>
<p><em>The wiki could also potentially be 'flipped'. &nbsp;By giving two students 2 or 3 areas we are going to cover in the next class and allow them to research it and provide an explanation, exercises and links in a wiki that can then be corrected/added to after the class.</em></p>
<p><em>On a personal reflection, it was also interesting to see where my own diviation from the lesson plan (often in response to a question or comment) may have caused confusion or a lack of continuity in the classroom.</em></p>
