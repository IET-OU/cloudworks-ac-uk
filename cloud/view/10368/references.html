        <p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>I was asked to prepare a simple IT security module to inform users about their role and responsibilities with regard to IT security. This module would be used for existing members of staff to update them with new information and also with new members of staff as part of their induction to the organisation. I used Articulate Storyline to design and produce the module.</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>The organisation I was working for needed to update it's employees on current IT data and security policies to ensure compliance with relevant regulations. The IT Compliance and Security Manager gave me the brief to complete the task. There were few other stakeholders with a direct influence. The IT service desk were keen to have something in place to ensure that users were better informed about security issues which would prevent calls to the service desk. The target users were distributed across the UK and often working off site or at home.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>I had to design something which could be used by a variety of people spread across the UK, some working full time and part time and some on zero hours contracts. The organisation had a legal responsibility to keep it's data safe and secure and was therefore obliged to keep it's employees trained on data and IT security. The budget for delivery was limited. I had access to a learning management system which allowed me to host the module.</p>
<p>I used a fairly simple model for delivery which involved presentation of information using different graphics and then a set of short self assessment questions for users to validate their own understanding.</p>
<p>My measure of success were simple in that I was looking for all members of staff to complete the module and I would be able to assess this via the learning management system. The module would be tested with stakeholders initially followed by a pilot with a small group of users followed by a nationwide launch.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>Key actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review and sign off learning outcomes.</li>
<li>Identify key objectives linked to this e.g. at the end of this module learners will be able to..</li>
<li>Break down into learning blocks or activities.</li>
<li>Design visual content and animation using a storyboard approach in Storyline.</li>
<li>Identify validation questions to be completed and model.</li>
<li>Assemble and test.</li>
<li>Load into LMA and test.</li>
<li>Present to stakeholders for feedback and adjust as appropriate</li>
<li>Launch</li>
<li>Monitor usage and feedback to stakeholders and managers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited budget to produce the module so had limited time and available resources. This was a given so had to make the best use of the resources I had.</li>
<li>To reach the maximum number of people I needed team managers to recognise the requirement to complete the training and support completion amongst their teams. The IT Compliance and Security Manager addressed all team managers highlighting the importance of the project and expectation that they would take responsibility for their teams participation.</li>
<li>Absence of a significant steering group to champion the project. Kept my own senior manager up to date with progress and outcomes and used him as a surrogate sponsor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>Results in terms of take up were patchy and depended upon the degree of interest from managers. Overall feedback about the content and style were positive and validation questions were answered correctly.</p>
<p>One of the key outcomes were a marked increase in password reset requests to service desk. This appeared to be in response to users changing their passwords as a result of watching the module and then forgetting them. The increase was not statistically significant though.</p>
<p>Use of the software and hosting facilities generally robust subject to users availability of internet connection.</p>
<p>All new starters were asked to complete the module within 14 days of start</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>Outcomes to this initiative were positive although the project as a whole lacked a senior level sponsor who was willing to champion the issue at a steering group and senior management team level. This meant that there was little enforcement opportunity for users and managers who didn&rsquo;t engage.</p>
<p>The content and style was initially too wordy so the key stakeholders asked for this to be paired down. On reflection I would have introduced audio to support the presentation but at the time I was not confident enough to do this with either my own voice or the software itself.</p>    </div>
