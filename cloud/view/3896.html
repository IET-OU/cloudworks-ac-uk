        <p><strong>The spiritual dimension of counselling and psychotherapy: An exploratory study of the experience and perception of Maltese clinical and counselling psychologists and psychotherapists</strong></p>
<p>Given that many in the caring professions consider spirituality a fundamental dimension of human experience and identity, one may assume that psychotherapy and spirituality are inevitably linked since psychotherapy deals with the human being and with human experience. Moreover, the increase in secularization and the emphasis on the subjective and the personal in people&rsquo;s experience of spirituality and religion have led to an increased interest in psychotherapy, counselling and other forms of activities and professions that deal more closely with the personal and subjective (Heelas, Woodhead, Seel, Szerszynski and Tusting: 2005; Moore and Purton: 2006; Sperry and Shafranske: 2005; West: 2004). A qualitative exploratory study was carried out with two groups of Maltese counsellors, psychotherapists and clinical and counselling psychologists. Each group attended a series of 4 FOST (focus/study group) sessions. Key areas explored include the participants&rsquo; conception of spirituality and religion and their understanding and experience of the spiritual dimension in counselling and psychotherapy. Broadly, the study focused on the ways in which spirituality may become manifest and express itself in the counselling and/or psychotherapeutic process, the roles and experiences of the therapist and the client regarding spirituality in counselling and psy
[removed][removed]
chotherapy and the identification of the factors that may contribute to the spiritual dimension of counsel [removed][removed] ling and psychotherapy. The study and initial findings will be presented together with a brief description of the Maltese context.</p>    </div>

			<p>From sex to spirituality (referring to the previous presentation). She is Maltese &ndash; would tell a bit about Maltese culture. She is in her 4<sup>th</sup> year of her PhD &ndash; she is an external student.</p>
<p>She collected her data and se is in the process of coding it.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy deals closely with the personal and subjective.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy is linked to spirituality.</p>
<p>How is the spiritual dimension of counselling and psychotherapy understood by Maltese psychologists and counsellors (??)</p>
<p>Her methodology is a qualitative exploratory study (focus group.</p>
<p>She has adopted a FOST group (a blend between focus and a study group). She looked at a series of 4 sessions of 2 hrs each. Each of the four sessions have a topic and aim &ndash; for example the first session was on spirituality and how it was different from religion.</p>
<p>The research participants are clinical and counselling psychologists who are working with adults. The participants mainly happened to be from humanistic-existential background. She didn&rsquo;t ask for this &ndash; but these who volunteered and it is interested that these chose to go there &ndash; and the views have been tinged by this.</p>
<p>She is using thematic analysis (she has both audio and video data for the sessions). She had to do this, because Maltese people tend to interrupt each other &ndash; they&rsquo;re not polite as the British. Also, the videos help her to relive the session. She&rsquo;ll do a bit of group analysis but not so much because she has a lot of data.</p>
<p>Maltese Context</p>
<p>The Maltese archipelago is made up of 3 small islands &ndash; the language is Maltese &ndash; but also speaks English &ndash; most people are bilingual. The extractions today are not translation but verbatim. The population is less than &frac12; million people. Joined the EU in 2004. They have no legislation for divorce back home &ndash; because of the strong religious influence (Roman Catholic). Their identities are strongly linked to the Catholic religion. Because of the EU influence, people want to entrench themselves on who they are &ndash; they want to be true to their roots. 95% of Maltese are Roman Catholics &ndash; the religion is in their constitution. Sunday Mass is obligatory in Catholicism and attendance is in decline.</p>
<p>25% of the Maltese students said they don&rsquo;t believe in the RC church but they maintain their beliefs in God particularly with the factors such as abortion, divorce, contraception etc (?).</p>
<p>Initial Observations</p>
<ul>
<li>Spirituality is seen as being fuzzy not easily defined. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain ... the thought would be more mature than the language&rdquo; (participant quote).</li>
<li>Spirituality has to do with mean- making, purpose and direction &ldquo;a reference point as I go through life&rdquo; (participant quote).</li>
<li>Spirituality as depth or going deeper &ldquo;gaining inner peace&rdquo; (?) </li>
<li>Spirituality is being bigger than/ beyond &ldquo;finding a meaning in life, which is beyond ..... not necessarily attributing to a particular deity&rdquo; (participant quote)</li>
<li>Spirituality and Religion: &ldquo;Religion is something more which is confined to a geographic or culture&rdquo; &ldquo;Spirituality belongs to you personally &ndash; it does not have to be specifically linked to the religion you belong to&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Spirituality has to with&nbsp; &ldquo;a relationship with God&rdquo;</li>
<li>Spirituality has to do with containment, serenity, surrender and peacefulness. &ldquo; ... the surrendering and letting go of my control&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spirituality and Psychotherapy</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping clients make meaning (?) (missed it!)</li>
<li>Spirituality is pervasive</li>
<li>Therapeutic experience</li>
<li>Mutuality: &ldquo;This is healing for me as well&rdquo; between the psychotherapist and the client.</li>
<li>A &ldquo;felt moment&rdquo; in therapy</li>
<li>Psychotherapy is a &ldquo;spiritual journey made up of spiritual moments&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Since there is a decline in attendance of mass, the psychotherapist becomes a replacement for the priest?</em></p>
<p>Some of them have mentioned this in the discussion. It has to do with the person and the subjective. There has been a shift. It is where people make meaning. They also talk the priest as a person for referral.</p>
<p><em>Wonder whether people wanted two parts from a psychotherapist i.e. a spiritual side as well as professionals as well?</em></p>
<p>This did not come out clearly &ndash; what came out clearly is about how they spoke about religion. Religion was sometimes referred to as derogatory.</p>
<p>Religion is sometimes seen as being less when speaking about spirituality. Spirituality is seen as more.</p>
<p>Discovering spirituality within religion &ndash; and there is also the problem with shame. As a politician, I would not say anything against what the church stands for.</p>
<p><em>She is wondering if 2 cameras in the room etc would hamper the session i.e. close down the discussion?</em></p>
<p>I was in the moderator and I had an assistant moderator (taking notes, and pictures). She also had a technical person who was dealing with the cameras on the tripods. One camera faced her and the other was on the group. He was only there in case something went wrong. I obviously explained to the group before hand and got consent. These were small cameras and they forgot about this. Also this was four sessions, and once they gelled together, they really forgot about it. These were also adults and didn&rsquo;t have identity issues as young adults do &ndash; and a camera won&rsquo;t imbalance them as young persons.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
