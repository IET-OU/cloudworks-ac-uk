<h2>Project continued as solo effort</h2>
<h3>Your situation (context)</h3>
<p>I want to produce a straightforward introduction to the collaborative use of virtual worlds aimed at&nbsp; postgraduate students (science in my case). The environment should be simple, modular and amenable to modification at a basic level by the students working individually and as groups. There should be a generic activity that students undertake to highlight the benefits and current limitations of the environment. A separate area will speculate on the future of such technology. Development has started: see http://tidalblog.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/oldsmooc</p>
<h3>The change you would like to see (challenge)</h3>
<p><em>What do you hope to achieve?</em></p>
<p>Produce an environment that will facilitate collaborative projects both globally and locally and students who are more open to new approaches to working.</p>
<p><em>What would be different if you succeed? </em></p>
<p>Informed decisions might lead to use of virtual worlds for some types of project, insight into the nature of collaborative working and a reduction in unnecessary travel and hence cost and carbon footprint.</p>
<h3>How you might go about bringing that change?</h3>
<p><em>What is your pedagogical approach?</em></p>
<p>Under consideration.</p>
<p><em>Which technologies will you use to implement it...</em></p>
<p>OpenSim. This is an actively developed open source environment&nbsp; for which there are multiple hosting solutions and the ability to backup the environment, run it locally from a USB stick in offline mode and network in a secure fashion both locally in the form of grids and globally via a technology known as the Hypergrid.</p>
<p><em>and how?</em></p>
<p>Project development is being undertaken by myself on a best-endeavours basis using a solution hosted on the commercial Kitely cloud-based grid. If the final version is deemed of sufficient interest or value, it may be released as an OER.</p>    </div>

                   <p>Hello Peter. I like the idea of OpenSIM, it sounds very stable and open. I live in Twinity which somehow moved from Berlin to San Francisco. Not that it made much difference to my flat in Morcombe. But I still have not found out much about Exit Reality. Mergers and instability are a bit of a worry.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Linda. I think technology churn is always going to be an issue and Learning Design might mitigate that to a degree. There are new products coming online, e.g. Cloud Party, but OpenSim-based worlds are not just open source but a completely blank canvas. There's a nice <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uElp-o9dagg&feature=player_embedded" rel="nofollow">video</a> of an Australian class deeply engrossed in their builds and exploration.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi. This idea looks very interesting. For me the key issues would be how to ensure there is genuine collaboration between the learners and that mobility is easy enough not to be a hurdle (which i find in second life). I've not used OpenSim (yet) but being open source is a benefit from the start, I would hope.</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas for how to foster collaboration? Any suggestions for collaborative tasks, for instance?</p>        </div>

                   I'm still pondering the nature of the collaborative task. It has to be in some sense generic and capable of being broken down into sub-tasks. One possibility would be to model something approximating a Sherlock Holmes story involving multiple crime scenes, have pairs of students investigate each scene and then compile the evidence and collectively see if they can identify the miscreant.

I should add that the mystery element here is completely secondary to illustrating use of the environment. It doesn't matter if the story is familiar or the students read it online as they go. The aim is to give them a focus.        </div>

                   <p>Can Open SIM work on any device? Mobility is an issue. Twinity only works on a desktop as far as I know. Same for Second Life I guess.</p>        </div>

                   <p>It turns out that Sherlock Holmes is not in the public domain in the US where the servers are based so I think this will have to be "inspired by" rather than "based on". Some future-based scenario is also required. It's tempting to look at the work of SF writers like Stephenson, Stross and Vinge but it's probably better to complete Phase 1, the Victorian detective novella, so we can see if there are opportunities missed that we can address in Phase 2.</p>        </div>

                   <p>It's becoming increasingly clear to me that I am going to be hard-pressed to complete this if I adhere to the standard project format. I am happy to have people come onboard for the ride and to critique, ask questions, suggest plot lines, research and test but I am sadly in no position to train them in OpenSim development (if you are a semi-competent developer, say "hello"!). There's also the distinct possibility that time constraints might cause the project to implode so, if that's a concern, please look to another project. If you are OK with that unhappy state of affairs, sign below and I will add you to the project <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2687" rel="nofollow">Cloudscape</a>.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Well, Peter, your project is much more ambitious than mine.&nbsp; But I think there is crossover, and maybe we can bounce ideas off each other. Anyway, have a look in the Dreambazaar:</p>

                   I'm declaring this project closed. Personally I'm quite pleased with the roads it has led me down and I hope to examine it further in the light of whatever emerges later in the course.        </div>

                   <p>Hi Peter, Sharon,&nbsp;</p>
<p>nice to see some familiar names.. I've yet to post my dream/vision, but for I do have a class that will be using virtual worlds (and other collaborative technologies) this semester. I'm still reading through the projects and trying to write up my own ideas though - I started late. So still looking for a group.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi again Peter, all... erm Im dropping the MOOC due to lack of time to work on it.</p>
<p>Im already a full week behind and looking at my schedule going forward it is very unlikely I'll even begin to catch up...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope it goes well though and catch up with folk another time</p>        </div>
