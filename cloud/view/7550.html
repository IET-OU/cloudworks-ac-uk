                    <br />

                   <p>A narrative scenario (based on interactions with Alan Clarke)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Margaret notices a poster advertising an online course to help people return to learning. There is a website mentioned for further information so she visits it and it interests her but she has doubts she caould cope. She talks to people in the community centre and her daughters who offer to help witht he computer aspects. Margaret enrols on the website and recieves an e-mail message welcoming her and giving her details of when the course will start.</p>
<p>A week or two later she gets an e-mail telling her that the course is starting and that her tutor is Linda who will contact her. Linda sends a friendly message explaining her role and what she needs to do first - introduce herself. Linda provides examples and encourages her to have a go. Margaret posts her introduction.</p>
<p>Margaret notices that many of the other students are like her - nervous and left school at 16 without any qualifications. The first task is to read a document and write a short piece giving her views which she posts on the forum so that they can all discuss it.</p>
<p>She is then asked to work with some of the others to learn about how government spend&nbsp;the taxes they collect and to jointly produce a list of key points that everyone should know before they vote in the next election. This is quite difficult and not everyone contributes but Linda, the tutor keeps helping with suggestions until they succeed. Each group share their work and Margaret is plaesed to relaise that her work is as good if not better than the others.</p>
<p>Margaret is keen to try the next activity.</p>
<p><em>However, Margaret is not really confident with her IT skills. Happily, the school at the community, is working together in a project with the training provider/institution (*); the school has trained a groop of voluntary teens aged 13-15 that will work as eTutors. These kids will help adults with the virtual learning environment of the eLearning course. They are really motivated: their activity will consist in being available 2 hours a week at school, (or at the adults' training institution) to receive adults doing the course, and to spend some time together browsing the virtual learning environment, and other social media of interest of the adult.</em></p>
<p><em>They are expected to support adults in tackling with the difficulties related to exploring a virtual learning environment. But the space given to this activity will be also part of the teens learnign. In fact, the school is interested in promoting the achievement of civic and social competences as well as improve their own narrative/written skills. The teens will have to elaborate a journal on the experience, and will post on a blog their experiences (protecting the adults' name; works will be filtered by teachers); they will choose between written assignment; a manifesto for better intergenerational relationships; a leaflet with a message to the community on how to improve intergenerational dialogue"; a video explaining how intergenerational relationships can improve the life of adults and young people.</em></p>        </div>

                   <p><strong>The Force Map</strong></p>
<p>Hi! After exchanging some thoughts within the <a title="Scenario" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7512" rel="nofollow">Alan Clarke's Scenario</a>, I followed Alan's work about Adults Education. I must say that his force map was really clear. Here it is:</p>
<p><a title="force map di Alan1276, su Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ictlearn/8389793013/" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8214/8389793013_90eef1f868.jpg" alt="force map" width="500" height="441" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I reworked the map, considering my own suggestions within the Scenario. This is the result:</p>
<p><a title="My force map" href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s206/sh/8051bfba-78c6-4d14-8931-c083de4b3a9e/249a43fc15ac4f3df5b96ca15f29cdac?noteKey=249a43fc15ac4f3df5b96ca15f29cdacÂ¬eGuid=8051bfba-78c6-4d14-8931-c083de4b3a9e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A draft towards a force map by JR</a></p>
<p>The exchange with Alan made me think about the contacts and hibridisation processes between contexts. This is because I &nbsp;draw the map in two colours: the issues that could put the learning context at risk, are also the issues that could allow innovations, in search to solve the tensions. Then I come back to my idea, which a posted to my blog (<a title="from the agorÃ " href="http://jraffaghelli.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/content-and-metaphors-from-the-agora/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">from the agor&agrave;</a>) This is to say that according to me context is more than a physical space. It is a symbolic and dynamic space.</p>        </div>
