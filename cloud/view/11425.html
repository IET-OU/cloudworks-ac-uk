        <h3 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong>Date</strong>: Thursday 18 January 2018</h3>
<h3 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong>Time</strong>: 10:00 &ndash; 12:30</h3>
<h3 style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong>Place</strong>: Library Seminar Rooms 1 and 2</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are warmly invited to the next eLearning Community event on Thursday 18<sup>th</sup> January 2018, 10:00 to 12:30: Switching to Adobe Connect: Early experiences.</p>
<p>The event will take place in the Library Seminar rooms 1 and 2 <strong>and</strong> in <a href="https://learn3.open.ac.uk/mod/connecthosted/view.php?id=137287" rel="nofollow">Adobe Connect&nbsp;</a> for those joining remotely. If you have never used Adobe Connect before, you will need to follow instructions at the link above. You might have to check your audio settings and install an add-in for instance, so allow a bit of time ahead of the meeting.</p>
<p>The session aims to explore the transition to Adobe Connect and gather early experiences and feedback from experts and users, such as the Online Rooms implementation team to tutors and Champions involved in peer support.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10:00 &ndash; 10:45 Adobe Connect: the story so far </strong>Rhodri Thomas (Acting Programme Manager to the Online Rooms Implementation Programme, TEL, LTI), Zoe Gipson (Senior Product Development Manager for online rooms, TEL, LTI) and Dr Anne Campbell (Educational Developer/Senior Manager, AL Support and Professional Development, Academic Services)</li>
</ul>
<p>Abstract: Adobe Connect has replaced our previous synchronous online rooms software, OU Live. This flexible new solution was introduced over a short timescale, starting with pilot modules in May and then all new module presentations from September onwards. In this presentation, we will give a brief summary of what the software looks like for Hosts and Participants, on PC/Macs and mobile, and we will look at how to access rooms as well as attendance and recording stats from the VLE. We will look at some of the challenges we faced in providing training to around 4000 AL staff over a short time period, the design of that training, some survey results and some of the reflections from those who completed the training. We will showcase some of the resources produced, including creative ideas for interactive activities in different disciplines, including one area which presented particular challenges, Maths &amp; Stats.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10:45 &ndash; 11:15 Building confidence with AC, Perspectives from a new user and an &ldquo;Adobe Champion&rdquo; </strong>Sylvia Bevilacqua-Madden (Associate Lecturer in French, LAL, WELS ) and Elke StJohn (Associate Lecturer in German, LAL, WELS, Adobe Connect Champion; Elke also has long been involved in peer support through PALS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Abstract: The first part of the session tells the story of our experience of the transition journey as a new user, the challenges we had to face, the different ways of working with Adobe Connect compared to OU Live.&nbsp; The second part of our presentation will focus on an Adobe champion&rsquo;s experience in relation to the support provided to tutors and what lessons were learnt from them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coffee break 11:15 &ndash; 11:30</strong></li>
<li><strong>11:30 &ndash; 12:00 Adobe Connect &ndash;friend or enemy? Experience from transition period from OU Live to the Adobe Connect application </strong>Olga Andrianova (Associate Lecturer in FBL)</li>
</ul>
<p>Abstract: Adobe Connect could be perceived as both &ndash; as a friend and an enemy. Friend because it helps an&nbsp;AL to deliver online sessions professionally. Some of the ALs could develop a close friendship by introducing interesting e-learning students&rsquo; activities using new technical options available in Adobe Connect. Yet this great friend can be a dangerous enemy if it comes to technical issues or anxiety to run an online session. This section provides insights from a transition period from OU Live to the Adobe Connect application which began in 17E and continued in 17J and 17K presentations. As an Adobe Connect Champion, Olga will share her own experience as an AL but also feedback she received from her students and colleagues during the transition period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>12:00 &ndash; 12:30 Transforming Library online training with Adobe Connect </strong>Fiona Durham (Learning and Teaching Librarian) and Venetia Kontou&nbsp;(Learning &amp; Teaching Librarian)</li>
</ul>
<p>Abstract: Library Services conducted some research with students in 2017 to understand what they wanted from online Library training.&nbsp; This has informed the new suite of generic Library training sessions using Adobe Connect,&nbsp;which began at the end of September 2017.&nbsp; We have trained over 2000 students since then, in these entirely voluntary sessions and feedback has been very good.&nbsp; We would like to share the results of this research and how we are using the functionality of Adobe Connect to improve the Library training. If there is time we may mention the targeted Library sessions we are running for individual modules.</p>
