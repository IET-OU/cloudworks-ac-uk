<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work around the FORMID suite was started for about ten years [1, 2] and led to many experiments with teachers and learners, while active research is still running for improving it.</p>
<p>The FORMID Suite is composed of three tools for designing (FORMID Author), running (FORMID Learner) and observing (FORMID Observer) distant learning situations. The targeted learning situations engage learners to individually solve problems by interacting with learning simulations (<em>independent of the software suite, only assumed to let their variables visible and settable from the outside</em>). Figure 1 explains the FORMID Suite architecture.</p>
<h1>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FORMID Approach: the teacher considered as central</h1>
<p>Our work is clearly inspired by a learning design approach [3] in so far as FORMID learning situations are designed in compliance with a computable model (the FORMID Learning Scenario Model [4]), ensuring their reusability (of the whole or of parts). However, our LD approach place teachers at the centre, while one of the criticisms about the IMS LD specification &ndash; which brought together many researchers and expected a widespread adoption in TEL [5, 6] &ndash; was, that this educational modelling language was difficultly accessible to teachers. In addition, our LD approach leads to operational solutions, while another criticism about the IMS-LD specification is that it was not accompanied by easy-to-use deployment solutions. Furthermore, since its early stages, FORMID Author provides teachers with means for specifying both the future learning tasks and indicators of how learners process these tasks [1, 2, 4]. This way of thinking LD is not so widely spread. Most of the time learning indicators&rsquo; definition is (1) not in charge of teachers and (2) is independent of the learning scenario. Indeed, if in the LD field, some works deal with indicators&rsquo; definition in relation with a chosen scenario [7], teachers need so far assistance from experts for achieving this task.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, several reasons make the FORMID Suite usable by teachers and going further away a classical LD approach:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Authoring approach</em>: Teachers don&rsquo;t need to be assisted by a computer scientist or a pedagogical engineer for designing scenarios. Once they have got a short training on FORMID Author, they become autonomous.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Observables explicitly specified by the teacher into the learning Scenario</em>: The FORMID Learning Scenario Model [4] proposes both elements for describing the learning tasks to be achieved and elements for describing the associated relevant observables. These observables are expressed as conditional rules to be evaluated at runtime by FORMID Learner. Thus, teachers can express their didactical expertise and awareness of which common mistake, difficulty or misconception could arise at runtime and would be interesting to be observed. This approach avoids some misleading interpretations which could arise when sorting and analysing, after runtime, systematically collected learning traces [8, 9, 10].</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Scenario-based FORMID Observer interface</em>: In conjunction with the previous FORMID characteristic, the FORMID Observer interface is dynamically built at runtime in compliance with the scenario steps and their observables. Thus, teachers who designed the learning session also defined their future observation environment</p>
<p class="bulletlist">4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>A single effort is required: designing and validating the learning scenario</em>. Once checked by the FORMID authoring tool, scenarios are &ldquo;ready to use&rdquo; either by learners who have got login rights on FORMID Learner, or by teachers (tutors) who have got login rights on FORMID Observer. Note that teachers can observe asynchronously previous sessions by a replay mechanism under FORMID-Observer. Definitely, no computer scientist pedagogical engineer is required for ensuring the delivery (and the observation) of a FORMID distant learning session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For all these aforementioned reasons, we claim that teachers are really at the centre of our concerns, not only by our will to provide them with serviceable tools, but also by letting them free for expressing their pedagogical expertise at the design stage and for observing learner&rsquo;s work according to their own criteria. We claim too that Teacher-led Inquiry and LD can so be simply articulated. Experiments we led in the last few years with teachers in physics (for designing and observing FORMID sessions) and K-12 learners (for playing them), confirmed these affirmations [11].</p>

<p class="figurecaption">Figure 1. &nbsp; The FORMID Suite Architecture.</p>
<p>In the next section we deal with our actual research around the FORMID authoring process, and paint briefly how we may even more reduce the gap between LD and TISL.</p>
<h1>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On-going research: enriching scenarios with cognitive information</h1>
<p>Observing how teachers<a title="" href="file:///C:/Users/Anne/Documents/Articles en cours/ARV2013/TILD_LejeuneGueraud.docx#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> carried out the scenario design, we noticed that building on the Chevallard&rsquo;s anthropological theory of didactics [12, 13] could benefit for formally modelling cognitive information in relation to the scenario elements. Teachers with whom we worked were teachers in physics for secondary school. They designed several FORMID scenarios for K-12 learners, engaging them to solve problems in electricity by interacting with TPElec<a title="" href="file:///C:/Users/Anne/Documents/Articles en cours/ARV2013/TILD_LejeuneGueraud.docx#_ftn2" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, a microworld in electricity, used here as a simulation tool. Before formally authoring a scenario, they used to very precisely fulfil a narrative table describing for each scenario step, the related problem to be solved, the expected solving method, which laws may be applied, which particular events will have to be traced at runtime (observables) and the relative interpretation that could be drawn out in such a case. Table 1 paints an excerpt of such a table.</p>

<p class="figurecaption">Table 1. Translated excerpt of the narrative table produced by teachers before authoring a FORMID scenario</p>
<p>The analysis we conducted in collaboration with didacticians in our research team, led us to observe that the modelling of the implicit teachers&rsquo; expertise through observables&rsquo; narrative description was very close to representations of physical and didactical organizations. We can indeed set up fine correspondences between the teachers&rsquo; descriptions and the Chevallard theory and its outcomes [14].</p>
<p>Thus, we firstly enriched the FORMID Scenario Model with didactical elements linked to the actual ones in order to embed into each scenario the cognitive information that teachers used to write into their pre-design document. Then we mocked up a new authoring interface in which teachers could (if they want) pick up institutional information on the programs (for a given learning level and a given discipline), the associated problems to be solved by learners, the expected solving methods, associated current erroneous solving methods, etc.</p>
<p>Our objective is threefold: firstly we aim at assisting teachers when designing FORMID scenarios, secondly we hope that formalizing associations between didactical organizations and FORMID Scenarios will benefit to best diagnostics of the learners progress, finally such explicit coupling will favor capitalization and recursively authoring.&nbsp; The first exchanges we had with the teachers are very promising and give hope the future.</p>
