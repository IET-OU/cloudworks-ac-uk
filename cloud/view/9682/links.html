<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[Peter Horrocks; The Independent; THE; Wonkhe; The Telegraph]</em></p>
<p>Government figures published at the end of last month, based on a survey of 90,000 organisations, show so-called <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/employers-facing-talent-poverty-as-skills-shortages-rise-130-in-four-years" rel="nofollow">skills shortage vacancies</a> now make up nearly a quarter of all job openings, having risen by 130% from 91,000 in 2011 to 209,000 in 2015.</p>
<p>The Government's HE spokesperson in the House of Lords, Baroness Evans said last month during a lengthy House of Lords debate that &ldquo;<a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/ouintra/story.aspx?id=29761" rel="nofollow">adult education and lifelong learning have a vital role in strengthening the UK's economy</a>&rdquo; and Baroness Shirley Williams said &ldquo;[the OU] enables people for the first time, all their lives long, to gain more education, understanding and wisdom&rdquo;.&nbsp; Following the distribution of OU briefing materials, cross-party Peers urged the Government to continue to focus on part-time HE in England and to create Individual Learning Accounts, relax ELQ restrictions and promote credit transfer. Digital skills, the OU's work with the BBC and FutureLearn also received mentions.</p>

<p>Perhaps one reason for Person&rsquo;s decline in UK vocational students is explained by last month&rsquo;s damning Ofsted report on its apprenticeship provision which found <a href="http://feweek.co.uk/2016/01/27/pearson-hit-with-inadequate-ofsted-report/" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;no key strengths&rdquo;</a>.&nbsp; The company provides apprenticeships for around 80 members of staff through its subcontractor Pearson TQ but inspectors report that, &ldquo;Too many apprentices drop out of learning or do not make sufficient progress to complete their programmes within the agreed timescale&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Pearson has notified its approx 110 customers of <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/learningstudio-openclass-end-life-pearson-getting-lms-market/" rel="nofollow">LearningStudio</a> that it will be shut down as a standalone LMS over the next 2-3 years.&nbsp; This comes on the back of an announcement last Sep that its OpenClass system will no longer be available as of Jan 18.&nbsp; A notice on the OpenClass front page proclaims, &ldquo;While the LMS will endure as an important piece of academic infrastructure, we believe our learning applications and services are truly &lsquo;where the learning happens&rsquo;. &nbsp;In short, withdrawing from the crowded LMS market allows us to concentrate on areas where we can make the biggest measurable impact on student learning outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was announced last week that the <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/3879416-apollo-education-groups-fire-sale" rel="nofollow">Apollo Education Group has successfully negotiated a $1.1bn sale</a> of itself to the Vistria Group, which is affiliated with Apollo Global Management, and the private investment firm Najafi Companies.&nbsp; The deal is expected to be concluded by Aug 2016.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking Online Education in the United States</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>The 13<sup>th</sup> and last <a href="http://onlinelearningconsortium.org/read/online-report-card-tracking-online-education-united-states-2015/" rel="nofollow">Babson survey of US online education</a> has just been published.&nbsp; Key findings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(Unlike the UK) a yearâtoâyear 3.9% increase in the number of distance education students (2014: +3.7%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28% of students (5.8m) now take at least one distance education course, and 2.9m of these are taking all of their courses at a distance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>71.4% of academic leaders rate the learning outcomes in online education as the&nbsp; same or superior to those in faceâtoâface instruction; however, only 29.1% report that their faculty accept the &ldquo;value and legitimacy&nbsp; of online education&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proportion of senior academic leaders saying that online learning is critical to their longâ term strategy fell from 70.8% last year to 63.3% this year</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the greatest endorsement for online education is the fact that this will be the last such Babson report because the medium is now accepted as business-as-usual.</p>

<p><strong>From Bricks to Clicks</strong></p>
<p><em>[Doug Clow]</em></p>
<p>A new report from the Higher Education Commission, <a href="http://www.policyconnect.org.uk/hec/research/report-bricks-clicks-potential-data-and-analytics-higher-education" rel="nofollow">From Bricks to Clicks - The Potential of Data and Analytics in Higher Education</a>, examines data collection, learning analytics and the current barriers to implementing better data management and data analytics across UK HEIs.&nbsp; The Commission finds that UK institutions are currently not making the most of the opportunities in this area, concluding that the UK needs to do more to catch up with the US and Australia.&nbsp; The OU&rsquo;s Prof John Domingue can not only see huge potential for tracking student progress and providing study advice but he believes that once students paying thousands of pounds in fees realise the possibilities for their learning, they will start demanding it.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin Launches Revision Assistant</strong></p>

<p>Turnitin has launched <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/21/turnitin-expanding-beyond-plagiarism-detection-launches-revision-assistant" rel="nofollow">Revision Assistant</a> &ndash; an online writing tool that uses machine learning to tutor students as they draft their essays, giving them feedback in four areas: language, focus, organization and evidence.&nbsp; The tool marks the start of a &ldquo;realignment&rdquo; of Tunitin&rsquo;s offering and is based on a product from LightSide Labs, which it bought in 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Distractions</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed; Jisc]</em></p>
<p>Last month&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/26/study-use-devices-class-nonclass-purposes-rise" rel="nofollow">Digital Distractions in the Classroom</a> report found that students waste about one-fifth of class time on laptops, smartphones and tablets, even though they admit such behaviour can harm their grades.&nbsp; Students are distracted by texting, emailing and using social media on average 11.43 times in class during a typical day.&nbsp; About 63% of surveyed students said they did this to stay connected, but an equally large share of students said they are attempting to fight boredom. &nbsp;Students also overwhelmingly support using devices in the classroom, with about 90% of respondents saying devices should not be banned.</p>
<p>However, data from digital marketing agency Greenlight suggests that 24% of Brits now think that too much time on social media or digital devices negatively impacted their performance at work.&nbsp; Some 6% intend to use apps less, 5% will reduce the size of their social media networks and <a href="http://www.information-age.com/technology/mobile-and-networking/123460811/1-4-british-consumers-want-digital-detox-2016?utm_content=bufferffc57&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer" rel="nofollow">3% are considering taking a full &lsquo;digital detox&rsquo; break</a> where the use of technology is banned.</p>

<p><strong>The Future is &lsquo;Detachable&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p><em>[Business Insider]</em></p>
<p>New Year, new hype.&nbsp; Lenovo has a cunning plan to deal with the continuing decline in PC sales.&nbsp; The company is betting on a new technology trend it calls <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/lenovos-executives-are-betting-big-that-detachables-will-be-the-next-giant-tech-trend-2016-1?r=US&IR=T" rel="nofollow">detachables</a>, and is making products it calls &ldquo;2-in-1&rdquo; and &ldquo;4-in-1&rdquo; solutions.&nbsp; Instead of having to buy both a tablet and a computer, for example, their products allow users to convert one product into many.&nbsp; Fun facts: the hinge on the new Yoga 900 Laptop is made from more than 800 parts and allows the device to operate in laptop, tablet, tent or stand mode.</p>

<p><strong>Are Paper Books Really Disappearing?</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>BBC Future plots the fortunes of e-books, widely thought to have started when Peter James published his novel &lsquo;Host&rsquo; on two floppy disks in 1993, and wonders if printed books are, &ldquo;destined to eventually join the ranks of clay tablets, scrolls and typewritten pages, to be displayed in collectors&rsquo; glass cases with other curious items of the distant past?&rdquo;&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the conclusion is that it&rsquo;s not that simple because we see that different people engage with different forms of content in different ways.&nbsp; One suggestion is that a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160124-are-paper-books-really-disappearing" rel="nofollow">bi-literate society</a> will pervade, which values both the digital and printed word according to circumstances.</p>
<p>A separate BBC report notes that the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35441832#?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter" rel="nofollow">use of e-books in UK schools is lower and more sporadic than in the US.</a>&nbsp;However, a recent National Literacy Trust project found that e-book use accelerated reading performance, slightly more so for boys and particularly in the case of &ldquo;reluctant readers&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>GitHub Classroom </strong></p>
<p><em>[Kristoff van Leeuwen]</em></p>
<p>GitHub is essentially a massive repository of code, best known and used by programmers.&nbsp; However, the organisation has now opened an education programme, <a href="https://classroom.github.com/" rel="nofollow">Classroom for GitHub</a>, which &ldquo;automates repository creation and access control, making it easy to distribute starter code and collect assignments on GitHub&rdquo;.&nbsp; This not only streamlines the process of managing users&rsquo; code but also means they are learning within the environment in which they will eventually work.</p>

<p><strong>Computers Widen Testing Gaps in Writing</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>In 2012, the US Dept of Education gave laptops to 10,000 fourth-graders for two 30-minute writing assignments, but a recent report compared those 2012s results with the same tests conducted in 2010 using pencil and paper.&nbsp; Whilst the top 20% of students scored better on the computer, the lowest 20% fared worse because they were less likely to have access to a computer and the Internet at home.&nbsp; There are now concerns about the <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-01-12-federal-study-finds-computers-widen-testing-gaps-in-writing?utm_content=buffer76266&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer" rel="nofollow">impact on America's standardized testing</a> which, in 2015, was conducted on computers in more than half of US states.</p>
