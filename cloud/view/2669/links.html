        <p><em>Individualized participation in public forms of communication and learning: reshaping contexts in a changing world of cultural products - John Cook and&nbsp; Elisabetta Adami.</em><br />The ultimate contribution of this paper consists in investigating &ndash; and addressing researchers with &ndash; the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What relationship is there between user-generated content, user-generated contexts and learning?</li>
<li>How can educational institutions cope with the more informal communicative approaches to digital interactions that new generations of learners possess?</li>
<li>Does the notion of &lsquo;learner-generated cultural resources&rsquo; represent a sustainable paradigm shift for formal education in which learning is viewed in categories of context and not content?</li>
<li>What are the issues in terms of &lsquo;text&rsquo; production in terms of modes of representation, (re)contextualisation and conceptions of &lsquo;literacy&rsquo;?</li>
<li>Who decides/redefines what it means to have coherence in contemporary interaction?</li>

<p><em>A socio-cultural approach to mobile learning in the environment of at-risk social groups by Margit B&ouml;ck. </em></p>
<p>QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>Question 1a and 1b</p>
<p>1.a) Is it important &ndash; and if so, to what extent? &ndash; that those whom we call learners are aware that they are learning? For instance, when they engage in researching something with a mobile device and in the process of doing that produce content, maybe as an answer to a specific question.</p>
<p>1.b) To what extent can knowledge (&lsquo;knowing that&rsquo;) and competences (&lsquo;knowing how&rsquo;) which have been developed embedded in specific situations, be transferred to other situations and applied there, without further work (in the sense of reflecting on what actually went on, what actually happene</p>
<p>A further question for me is this: Is it likely that there will be effects on (results of) learning &ndash; however defined or measured / assessed &ndash; that the materials encountered by those regarded as learners in situations of mobile learning are regarded by them as learning material</p>
<p>Put as my Question 2 it would be</p>
<p>2. What effect is their in terms of the stance of learners (their attitude, their take) to read about, say, a historical event in a traditional History text-book or look at a website prepared by an official institution &ndash; maybe with a mission to offer materials for &lsquo;informal learning&rsquo; such as a museum; or watch a segment of a TV documentary or a fictionalized film version, etc.? In other words, what effect resides in, can be assumed to lie in the &lsquo;status&rsquo; of the materials that &lsquo;learners&rsquo; are engaging wit</p>
<p>The background to this question are the statements of the media psychologist Gavriel Salomon, who, at the beginning of the 1980ties said &ndash; with reference to children, TV and reading: &ldquo;TV is easy, print is tough&rdquo; (suggesting that children need to concentrate more when reading than when watching TV and, as a consequence take away more in terms of &lsquo;content&rsquo;); or similarly, the charge that contemporary text-books are no longer &lsquo;real textbooks&rsquo; but &lsquo;merely entertainmen</p>
<p>So a third question might be:</p>
<p>3. What are the qualities, features, characteristics which learners expect from learning materials and from the media for learning, in order for them to take these and learning itself seriously? And in that context, what can be the meaning of &lsquo;taking something seriously&rsquo;?</p>    </div>

<p>Talking about New Literacy Studies - coming from linguistics, education, sociology and other areas. Literacy not just a cognitive phenomenon - those who write or read or engaged in texts are engaged in social processes with cultural resources - multiliteracies.</p>
<p>New literacies include mobile learning and learning inside and outside school.</p>
<p>Information habitus is habitus around getting and using infromation - literacy within the lifeworld. Information shaped into knowledge.</p>
<p>Literacies - process of ascribing meaning. Includes acting and interacting.</p>
<p>Literacy events - activities where literacy has a role (can be called naive practices). Issue of how used for reflection in learning - leads to - literacy practices - general cultural ways of utilising written langauge which people draw upon in their lives.</p>
<p>Literacy best understood as set of social practices - can be inferred from events mediated by written texts. Historically situated - practices change through informal learning and sense making - leads to identity.</p>
<p>Multimodality as means of representation.</p>
<p>New literacies - more participatory, more collaborative, more distributed, less published, less author centric than conventional literacies.</p>
<p>Change from readers of texts to users of texts.</p>
<p>Being critical and refelctive important - media literacy.</p>
<p>Central question about power as to whether new literacies available for all</p>

			<p>Elizabetta Adami - issues on literacy in contemporary semiotic landscape.</p>
<p>Literacy has extended meaning - but only in English! Literacy as fruit of power relationships. Literacy same meanings as competence in italian.</p>
<p>Confused and diverse semiotic practices used for communciation in different countries. Some practices become institutionalised if approved by elite and then become genres with conventions.</p>
<p>Descriptions are important in a genre as proscribed and prescribed practices - this is what is taught in schools as literacies e.g. CVs, academic articles, newspaper articles but also dance, architecture etc. Vertical power relationships - texts policed by limited number contributors or elite. Standards change but always is a standard. Literacy is to know the established conventions. schools teach the norms of a society.</p>
<p>Power relations in new media more horizontal - developing wide variety of types of text which do not have established conventions - eg podcasts, text.</p>
<p>Shift from competence to given norms to creative ad hoc agency.</p>
<p>If schools to teach new lieteracies what norms can they teach to and what generalisations are possible? If was to be possibel is it desirable to keep cycle of institutionalisation going?</p>

<p>Looking at theoretical dialogue between literacies and TEL.</p>
<p>UK xchildren have on average 6 media devices in bedrooms. Many defintions of new media. But PISA study says in many countries 15 per cent unable to read texts - many unable to understand information find on web. Wen not being used in uncritical way.</p>
<p>Need to extend theories from past. Augmented context for development. Looking at ideas Vygotsky.</p>
<p>Processes of coding and internalisation of intrapersonal and interpersonal relationships through developmental events.</p>

			<p>More form Elizabetta - media have affordances for new shared social practices. Many devices enable us to produce great variety multi modal artefacts and distribute in social spaces - all share copy and past - ability to select, represent and&nbsp; recontextualise. Changes in mechanism for representation have led to changes in mechanisms for communication. Leading to individualised participation in networks / chains of semiosis according to participants wishes. But shared understanding becomes less important than usability. Leads to scattering of coherence patterns. Coperating becomes less imprtant than using according to ones interest. Browsing is not coherent - but related to our interests in links we encounter whilst browsing.</p>
<p>Collecetd (and often incoherent) artefacts define online identity.</p>
<p>Questions - moving from coherence in contents to forms in contexts. Does this lead to a lack of wholeness. What capabilities are developed most and least. Is coherence still useful and where is it needed?</p>
<p>1. What is gained and what is lost?</p>
<p>2. Where are we headed to?</p>
<p>- do we teach the most required abilities</p>
<p>- or do we teach the lost-in-transition abilities</p>
<p>3. Is the description - pre/proscription cycle avoidable</p>			<div class="posted-by">
