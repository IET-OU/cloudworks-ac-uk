        <h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>A few years ago I was part of an elearning training team and we identified a number of training sessions that we wanted to deliver to teaching staff (in a large FE college). As part of the team I was given a couple of topics to cover.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>The training team wanted to address the fact that training sessions were often badly attended or were not suited to the audience who did attend.&nbsp; We decided to create a series of short (1 hour long) training sessions with the intention of teaching staff how to use various learning technologies in classroom situations.</p>
<p>The team were not based in the same building (4 of us travelled between 5 campuses) so we allocated sessions based on interest and expertise.&nbsp; We planned that once complete we would deliver our sessions to each other, to share skills and refine the plans if necessary.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The team wanted to try something new to engage more fully with the teaching staff. Success would be measured through attendance figures (each of us was to approach a specific department to encourage participation). We would also gather feedback from participants.&nbsp; We were also introducing a qualification for teaching staff (EPICT) and we mapped those attending our sessions with those taking up the qualification.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Identify topics based on current themes (assessment for learning, peer assessment etc.)</li>
<li>Allocate topics to team members</li>
<li>Each trainer to identify and create activities for their session</li>
<li>Each trainer to identify and/or create resources required to deliver the activities</li>
<li>Write a session plan based on a template, to aid consistency and reusability</li>
<li>Make sure the session fits into 1 hour by practising on team.&nbsp; The sessions were to be publicised as &ldquo;1hour2&rdquo; sessions as in &ldquo;1hour2 peer assessment&rdquo; etc. so they needed to fit the 1 hour time slot.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obstacles &ndash; the team had very specific experience which meant that some topics were not easily covered.&nbsp; However, the development of the sessions came to be seen as CPD for the team.</p>
<p>Trying to create sessions that involved activities for participants was quite time-consuming.&nbsp; To fit activities into a one-hour slot a lot of preparation was need beforehand.&nbsp; For example, creating sample VLE courses and fake students to illustrate how a &lsquo;self and peer assessment&rsquo; tool could be used.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Trying to keep in mind that someone else may need to deliver &lsquo;your&rsquo; session often resulted in a change in direction.&nbsp; This was useful as it meant we kept on track for training teachers who had little experience in using these technologies.&nbsp; Keeping it simple was key.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The sessions we delivered to ourselves (i.e. the training team) were helpful in expanding our skill base. The small number of 1hour 2 sessions we delivered were well received although we didn&rsquo;t always reach the intended target audience (in terms of our department targets). The number of people signing up to the EPICT qualification went up after these sessions (but in conjunction with much publicity and management strategic decisions).</p>
<p>Due to a restructure at the college, these sessions didn&rsquo;t have a very long life span.&nbsp; However, the experience did help inform the next series of training that came along.&nbsp; It became clear that staff wanted more basic, fundamental training and sessions were built around the idea of scaffolding skills from basic to expert level.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>My experience was a really positive one.&nbsp; I chose to create sessions on tools I&rsquo;d never used so I got to learn new skills and share those with others.&nbsp; In developing this kind of training, I learnt about the complexity of demonstrating technology systems for specific purposes.&nbsp; In an earlier job, I&rsquo;d been an ICT teacher and activities I created were designed to introduce skills over an extended period of practice but this was attempting to provide others with information and inspiration in a very short time-frame.</p>
<p>I also learned about how teachers can find it difficult to transfer what they learn in these types of training session to their own practice.&nbsp; When they come with a specific problem to solve they fare better than coming with no real context on which to hang the learning.</p>    </div>

                   <p>Hi Yvonne</p>
<p>This sounds like a very carefully planned programme. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It can't have been easy because teaching staff probably don't have much spare time for developing their understanding of new technologies and how it can aid their teaching. &nbsp;There's often a sense that it's quicker just to stick with current technologies and practices because learning a new technology takes too much time and effort (even if it will save time in the long run). &nbsp;I'm speaking from personal experience here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you set the participants any homework to encourage them to go away and try out the tools soon after the sessions in order to embed the learning? I know that if I receive training in a new technology, I need to practice using it as soon as possible afterwards otherwise I forget everything.&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Hi Nicola</p>
<p>The aim of 1 hour sessions was to cut down on the training time - but obviously further time is needed to practice and embed.&nbsp; Lack of time is always the main barrier cited by teaching staff - I think this will be the case until time for tech prep is explicitly alloted in job descriptions or work models.</p>
<p>We didn't set homework but encouraged staff to take up the EPICT qualification which provided them with opportunities to put theory into practice.&nbsp; EPICT modules are awarded after planning, delivering and evaluating lessons using learning technology.</p>
<p>As you say we learn tech skills more effectively if we use them - and again this is a consistent problem for training teams.&nbsp; It's very difficult to provide just-in-time training (i.e. at the point where the learner needs the skill) although online training is making this more feasible (e.g. through web services like Lynda.com).</p>
<p>In my current role these issues are still being grappled with!</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments.</p>
<p>Yvonne</p>
