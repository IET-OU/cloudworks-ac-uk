        <p>Anne Hansen and Lindsay Brigham report on successful partnership work between UNISON and the OU focussed on progression into higher education for employees who are low paid, low grade and stuck in dead end occupations.</p>    </div>

			<p><strong>Scroll down for PowerPoint Presentation</strong></p>
<p><em>My notes from the session:</em></p>
<p>Lindsay Brigham and Anne Hanson (The Open University in the North) introduced the partnership which has been running 2.5 years and is well established. Lindsay and Anne staff tutors based in Gateshead (Faculty of HSC). The partnership includes The Open University, Unison and the WEA</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the partnership is to help people in low paid HSC jobs into professional roles and to help organisations 'grow their own' professionals and managers. The crux of the project is about developing progression routes. Funding for the partnership was drawn down by Unison Operations.The project was set a target of 28 learners from IMD quartile 1 and 27  were achieved. Mainly women from poorer communities participating in HE.</p>
<p>5 primary health care and/or mental health trusts involved in the project, and Newcastle City Council were focused on for this presentation<br /><br />Newcastle City Council supported 13 learners (home&nbsp; care and residential care workers. 6 took just K101 (because they already had NVQ3) and 7 took K101 with their NVQ3 <strong>[N.B I was curious about how K101 dovetailed with the NVQ3 Knowledge criteria, and how far the process of drawing out evidence for a NVQ portfolio with a NVQ assessor, supported the K101 learning process and provided additional opportunities for recognition and reward of learning].</strong> 6 students then progressed to KYJ113, all of these are now registered for K270 and it is hoped that they will progress to an optional level 3 module next. Newcastle City Council want every care worker to have access to K101 and eventual aim is that the progression route will be available to everyone  coming into the council. This is likely to be funded through the National Scholarship Scheme  and self-funding but e.g. time off to study will be supported by the employer.<br /><br />**we were then shown the 'student voices' video embedded below**<br /><br />Evaluation was employer driven as the employer wanted to evaluate impact on practice i.e. what has the employer gained by funding this learning activity?&nbsp; Challenge was to tease out personal impact and impact on practice. <br /><br />- In depth interviews with all 13 participants<br />&nbsp;- Participant questionnaires (61 percent response rate<br />&nbsp;- In depth interview with Care Services Manager<br /><br />**a table was handed out showing&nbsp; overall themes and their dimensions**<br /><br />K101 used an 'enhanced model of support' with additional monthly meetings with the tutor. <strong>[I would love to know more about what was covered in these sessions. What kind of 'enhanced support' did students need? I was wondering how these sessions supported/ mediated students in (re-) positioning themselves as HE level learners and professionals]</strong><br /><br /><strong>Personal perspectives</strong></p>
<p>A key output was that students were able to positively re-evaluate their own role and this impacted on confidence and motivation.There was also evidence of increased sensitivity to and awareness of the experience and needs of service users. Lots of the language used by the students could be described as transformational ( i.e. 'it opened my eyes', 'I suddenly realised' etc). Other outputs included the development of core skills such as ICT, communication, time-management and cognitive skills ( i.e. more analytical and reflective)</p>
<p><strong>Management perspectives</strong></p>
<p>Newcastle City Council Care Services Manager became a real advocate for the Open University. She felt that by the end of the module students became different members of staff, able to clearly articulate their role etc<br /><br /><strong>Academic perspectives</strong></p>
<p>Drawing on social theories of situated learning (Lave and Wenger, 1991 Eraut, 2004 codified vs non codified knowledge, Engestrom 2001 and Fuller of Unwin, 2011 notions of ' Expansive learning' and Wenger's Communities of Practice).</p>			<div class="posted-by">
