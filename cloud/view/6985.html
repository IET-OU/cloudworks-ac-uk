<p>Mor, Yishay (2011). <strong>Context is what we take for granted: addressing context in design-centric teacher&nbsp;</strong><strong>training</strong>. In: &rdquo;Context and Technology Enhanced Learning (ConTEL): Theory, methodology and design&rdquo;&nbsp;workshop, EC-TEL 2011, 21/9/2011, Palermo.</p>
<p>and realised I didn't adequately describe the context for which I want to design - therefore the design will be inadequate. &nbsp;"<em>When we set forth to train learning designers, we need to develop their ability to&nbsp;notice, describe, and analyse context, and systematically refer to it in the solutions&nbsp;</em><em>they propose</em>.... else we [rely] on [our] intuitive familiarity with the natural work environment, and&nbsp;substitut[ed] ad-hoc responsive tweaks for pre-meditated design.</p>
<p>The first task of our group should be to refine the context of the problem we're trying to solve!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Force-mapping</strong>: a practitioner would&nbsp;present her design narrative to her group members, and they in turn would interrogate&nbsp;her to identify the forces in play in the situation she describes: the actors, their beliefs,&nbsp;constraints, desires and the environment in which they operate. They would then&nbsp;sketch visual representations for these and note the relationships between them &nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;marking &ldquo;+&rdquo; for supporting relations and &ldquo;-&rdquo; for conflicting ones.&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Hi Tracey,</p>
<p>This does have similarities to the area I am currently working in (and with Helen Walmsley's project topic , too, as you've already commented).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've outlined the context I am working in there but would like to keep in touch/be involved on this, if that's OK?</p>

                   <p>I would say that one of the things that you want to share is exactly what you had to do to create your online class.&nbsp; Just like a face-to-face course, preparation is the key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like using Adobe Connect for live virtual sessions because of how easy it is to set up the session ahead of time and that a room can be used over and over again.&nbsp; In virtual sessions, it is important to use similar rules as in a face-to-face learning, such as making sure the students are active participants and that the activities are delivered in&nbsp; many forms.&nbsp; I have sat through many, many sessions where the built-in polls were overused, and frankly I got bored.&nbsp;But by simply changing it up from a poll to having to type in a response it varied and kept the student involved.&nbsp; Make use of the break-out session feature and allow for some times where the students become the teacher.</p>
<p>If part of the curriculum includes recorded sessions at all, if possible, break those up into several small bits rather than one long recording.&nbsp; It makes it easier to get through the material (and be able to take a break) and easier to reference again as needed.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Tracey,</p>
<p>I just put up my own project proposal (<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7197" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7197</a>). I am looking for others who are interested in developing a curriculum on how to teach lecturers to prepare engaging and interactive webinars. Maybe we can join forces since I assume my proposed subject could be a sub theme of yours.</p>
<p>Cheers, Daniel</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi</p>
<p>I would be interested in collaborating on this. My intention was to creat an examplar module that would engage staff to examine the design principles. In our case it is Turnitin - our particular hot topic</p>        </div>

                   Hi Tracey, as I work with academics and teaching staff I am interested in this area. I'll be working on PD with them this year to enhance their skills in the flipped classroom approach given our new building is all learning spaces. We are, in some cases, having difficulty getting staff to move from traditional teaching to using the learning spaces in a productive way, we'd like to see the classroom time used for student project time while the traditional teaching should be moved to online environments. With this in mind your project sounds appropriate for me to work on as well (and we're in almost the same time zone!)
Cheers Pauline
Ps at the moment I can't use Google groups as RMIT has blocked it for our use, I'm hoping this is fixed soon!        </div>

                   <p>We have run a course called Facilitating online for a number of years - it is totally open and assists participants to explore a range of tools - see: http://wikieducator.org/Facilitating_Online</p>
<p>Feel free to explore the resources. The beauty of the course was that digital information capability developed when participants engaged in the activities, and they could choose the technologies or platforms to facilitate an event specific to their context. People used computer conferencing, discussion forums, virtual worlds and a number of web 2.0 tools. They had a ball. We also encouraged informal (non-enrolled participation) and the conversations were rich and varied with many talented facilitators (e.g., Nancy White, George Siemens) taking part or presenting and modelling good practice and mentoring people new to the idea of online facilitating. It was challenging but lots of fun. I have had a request to run the course again this year and may take up the challenge. Helping partcipants create an online identity and presence is vital. What do you think?</p>

                   <p>Hi Tracey,</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing your interesting project.&nbsp;&nbsp; My project in fact tries to address the similar issue from a slightly different angle.&nbsp; Instead of running a course, my project aims to create an online space where staff can share their successful stories of using learning technologies and help each other.&nbsp; The project details: &nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/“" rel="nofollow"> http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7270</a></p>
<p>Once you team up with others, the next step is to start a study circle.&nbsp;&nbsp; As my project is closely related to yours, would you like starting the study circle together?&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, I have set up a circle here - <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/“http:/cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7321" rel="nofollow"> http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7321</a>. &nbsp;You are welcome to join.</p>

                   <p>Hi Tracey,</p>
<p>I'm new to MOOCs and came to this one without a project in mind. But when I saw your project description in the Dream Bazaar, I thought Bingo! This fits the bill perfectly. A few years ago it was decided that all courses at my tiny college in NE Alberta, Canada, should have at least a companion site, and since then we've put a lot of effort into teaching our instructors how to use the LMS in a functional sense. It's now clear that we need to change our focus and help our instructors learn how to teach using the LMS.</p>
<p>I hope there's still room for me in your cloud!</p>

                   Hi Tracey, yes I'm still interested in being involved. I'm still on holidays though and will be down the beach from this weekend till the 28th so may be a little distracted but will certainly check in from time to time. Starting this in holiday time is somewhat distracting! Cheers pauline         </div>
