			<p>Scott Diener is Associate Director, IT services, Academic Services, The University of Auckland</p>
<p><strong>Presentation on second life &ndash; &lsquo; this will change everything&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>The pattern of teaching around a lecture-based mode has been the same for eons. Didactic presentations with a large percentage of students not engaged in what is been discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Education institutions are based on the notion of scarcity. University were discussed as places that you come to, as protected spaces, only for those who are chosen to come to. I</li>
<li>ts protected knowledge only accessed by the priveledge. What if we had global access to global knowledge. </li>
<li>For example the google books project which has the goal of releasing into the public all books in all languages</li>
<li>What happens to universities if the library no longer the protected space?</li>
</ul>
<p>Antony Mayfield - quote:</p>
<p>Want the invention of the print press per se that caused a revolution it was when everybody was able to read &ndash; the knowledge is what is important</p>
<p>Dana Lee Ling - College of Micronesia - introduction to statistics just one example of a image about normal distribution, standard Bell Curve Distribution. 11 million plus entries on the 'Normal curve' on google.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do we reinvent the wheel? Design courses which inevitably others have already developed and are available free</li>
<li>Open Educational Resource movement is about making educational content free</li>
<li>Why dont we move to sharing teaching expertise and resources? How would that impact on what we do in education?</li>
<li>World population 1950-2050 world population growth 2010 7 Billion and 9 Billion by 2050 (US census Bureau) - how do we educate this phenomenal number of people? Traditional models are just not going to scale - we would need to build 25000 university of Aucklands (40,000 students) EVERY year - this is unsustainable.</li>
<li>Challenge is what do we need to do differently?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A virtual world where you have an avator and can move around the virtual space. Second life</li>
<li>It's not a game, there are no rules. It's entirely generated by users</li>
<li>Avator can have clothes, can be a bunny, can have a house, boat etc. Have to buy these. User to user transactions using real money via Linden Dollar, 400 miillion US dollars in the last year. </li>
<li>Scott knows people we have quit their job and are making more money in Second Life.</li>
<li>There are over 200 virtual worlds - Star in Me, TAATU, including McDonalds happy meal virtual world</li>
<li>Relay for life 270, 000 US dollars for a charity</li>
<li>400 million hours in 2008</li>
<li>Virtual worlds are different because       
<ul>
<li><strong>Sense of self </strong>- your avator is part of yourself, your own identity. When you go to a movies and shed a tear its suspension of belief, you are living the movie, the same happens in SL. We are stories tellers, we immerse ourselves in things. I got into that book and I lived it.</li>
<li><strong>Sense of place -</strong> its like here now, a place, a location. In SL we have the same 'Oh you are here' there is an experience of being together, in the same place at the same time. A sense of place and of time. </li>
<li><strong>Sense of emotion</strong> - loving, crying, having sex, getting marries and divorced. Getting divorced in real life because they are having affairs in SL. Emotions are a critcal part of the experience. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scott set up a&nbsp; SL space for his senior management team and very quickly it was evident that they identified with their avator. People spend millions on their look in SL.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Scott had a 'naked experience' in SL - found himself only wearing boots ;-) </li>
<li>Meetings in SL can be very productive and can save costs. Meeting people for real having known them previously only in SL.</li>
<li>Scott demo'd what they are doing with medical simualations in SL</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The work Scott is doing in Second Life</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scott demo'd his work in SL - Professor Noartunga&nbsp;</li>
<li>Have break out rooms for students - under a waterfall - why have lecture spaces when you can have lovely spaces. Why have chairs in SL when your avator never gets tired? It's because people want to mimic real practice - 'can we go sit down please'</li>
<li>Lecture theatre built inside a hollow mountain, has the presentation that he is giving now available there. Will seat about 50 people. </li>
<li>Shows the emergency room they have built - can be used to teach students thinking processes, its about crisis management, and how teams form etc. Not basic medical procedures</li>
<li>Site is open and available to the public - is under creative commons license. You can take anything that is in the space. Many universities in SL have locked down their resources - plea to open things up! Mutual benefit. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>S</strong><strong>ummary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We continue to use 14 century technoloiges - why are we still doing it?</li>
<li>We need to focus on emerging new spaces, we need to do something new, lets not replicate the same things into new spaces - lets innovate!</li>
<li>Finally how can we realise the emergence of constructivist pedagogies into main stream teaching. Virtaul worlds which immerse the students, enable them to adopt problem based learning approaches</li>
<li>If we do this it will change everything</li>
