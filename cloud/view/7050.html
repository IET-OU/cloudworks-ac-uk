                   <p>Which bit(s) appeal to you most?</p>
<p>I would guess that you would want to concentrate on the training. As I said elsewhere I am happy to go with the flow as everything is potentially useful to me.</p>        </div>

                   <p>The mechanism for collaboration between HE students and industry-based learners is probably of most interest to me as this aspect will certainly have application on some things I'm involved in. &nbsp;So if that or something round it could form a coherent chunk of work that we could carve of and focus on that would be great. &nbsp;But really I'm very open to other ways of tackling this. &nbsp;Maybe also Liz of Tony have some thoughts.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Anne,</p>
<p>though we don&rsquo;t have industry based students the concept of a course on &nbsp;entrepreneurship is something I&rsquo;d be interested in exploring, but not heard of CCD before. Are there some articles you can suggest to read?&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Hi Anne, Tony and Liz,</p>
<p>If I understand Yishay's email ("dreambazaar and team up!") correctly we need to add a cloud for our proposed project to the "Olds Mooc Project teams" cloudscape (http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2470).</p>
<p>I wonder if we should also try to arrange some sort of live chat&nbsp;so we can start to get some sort of handle on what we plan to do.&nbsp; Would that be something for "Google hangouts"?&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Willing to give Google Hangout a go if we can find a mutually acceptable time. Yes, you're right about needing another cloud or can we just assign an existing cloud to another cloudscape? At this point my cloud skills break down!</p>
<p>I'm away all day tomorrow at a one-day conference in Copenhagen which is a 5 hour each way trip.</p>

                   <p>Just for the heck of it I've added this cloud to the "OLDS MOOC project teams" cloudscape. &nbsp;I'm not enitrely sure if we are meant to do that or to create another overview cloud for the project.</p>
<p>Thurs of Fri might be difficult this week for me to find time but I think Tony has some time then when he might be available. &nbsp;Though it would be good if we could all meet. &nbsp;Perhaps we need a Doodle to find a time?</p>
