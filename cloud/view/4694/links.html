<p><strong>Wolverhampton Does CPLD</strong></p>
<p>Wolverhampton has launched <a href="http://www.intelligent-career-development.co.uk/default.aspx?page=6845" rel="nofollow">i-CD</a> (intelligent career development) to provide &ldquo;low-cost, flexibly-delivered, workplace-based, market-driven, fully-accredited, higher education.&rdquo;&nbsp; Each 5-credit unit costs &pound;125 and lasts 10 weeks/50 hours, there are no formal entry requirements, units are roll-on/roll-off and a module of 4 units counts as 20 credits towards a degree or other award.&nbsp; Students have access to a blog and PebblePad e-portfolio; groups of 15-20 students form virtual learning sets.</p>

<p><strong>Global Online Education</strong></p>
<p>Guest article from Vivek Wadhwa (Berkeley, Duke, Harvard) on the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/19/the-global-education-race" rel="nofollow">globalisation of education</a>.&nbsp; More than 3m students travel outside their home country to study and about two thirds of these go to the US.&nbsp; There are also now more than 160 &lsquo;branch campuses&rsquo;, mostly in the Middle East and Asia.</p>
<p>[TechCrunch]</p>
<p>The United Nations is to focus more strongly on <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100918074103941" rel="nofollow">higher education in developing countries</a>, in response to increasing demands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many lower income countries are now coming to grips with just how important higher education is as a motor for economic development and prosperity,&rdquo; said Qian Tang, UNESCO's newly-appointed Assistant Director-General for Education.</p>
<p>[University World News]</p>
<p>The 27 Sep edition of University World News included a special report on Exporting Online Education, featuring articles on <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100925161309371" rel="nofollow">India</a> (can online fill the shortage of physical places?), the <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100925161222181" rel="nofollow">US</a> (the role of for-profit providers), <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100925161136685" rel="nofollow">Africa</a> (high costs are keeping for-profit providers away), <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100925161040904" rel="nofollow">Mexico</a> (increasing online students outside national borders) and a Q&amp;A with <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2010092516094755" rel="nofollow">Sir John Daniel</a> (changing attitudes toward the sector and the good it can offer developing countries).</p>
<p>[University World News]</p>
<p>One serious restriction on eLearning in India is the lack of computers.&nbsp; Devki Infonet aims to overcome this by moving into the franchising business, whereby communities of learners come together in one classroom, sharing one large screen.&nbsp; The Institute of Cost and Works Accountants of India, the Institute of Company Secretaries of India and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India are now offering classes through <a href="http://www.livemint.com/2010/09/17194422/Edyounet--Easy-virtual-learni.html?h=B" rel="nofollow">Edyounet</a> and have established 15 franchisees with an average of 20 students per centre.</p>
<p>[JE]</p>
<p>But, in a role-reversal, tutors in India are supporting UK maths students.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.brightsparkeducation.com/" rel="nofollow">Brightspark</a> provides online one-to-one tuition for students aged 7 to 16, from around <a href="https://www.brightsparkeducation.com/prices-and-packages/" rel="nofollow">&pound;12 per hour</a>, including unlimited online testing and access to past exam papers.</p>

<p><strong>Online Degrees and Online Dropouts</strong></p>
<p>The Times Higher believes <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=413647" rel="nofollow">the face of higher education will change for ever in 15 years</a> and JISC reports that <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/online-degrees-set/to-soar-in-the-UK/prweb4551754.htm" rel="nofollow">online degrees are taking off in the UK</a>, helped by a push from government and increasing tuition (and living) costs.&nbsp; Contributions in this press release include commentary from the OU&rsquo;s Niall Sclater and Leicester&rsquo;s Gilly Salmon.</p>
<p>[THE]</p>
<p>A new study by Kennesaw State University finds that <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/blogPost-content/27108/" rel="nofollow">students drop out of online classes</a> at rates 15-20% higher than traditional ones.&nbsp; Using undergraduates in a business course, professors experimented with: calling students at home; quizzing them on the syllabus; helping to steer them through the virtual classroom; encouraging them to develop personal connections with classmates; and breaking them into small groups for discussions and team projects.&nbsp; Half the students got this extra attention and half didn't &ndash; and it made no difference to dropout rates. Thy repeated the experiment and got the same results.&nbsp; &ldquo;If someone was going to drop out of the class, they were going to drop out of the class,&rdquo; says Stacy M. Campbell, assistant professor of management.</p>
<p>[Wired Campus]</p>
<p>The <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/gates-announces-20-million-for-new-education-technology-program/27564" rel="nofollow">Gates Foundation</a> has announced plans to spend up to $20m on the first phase of a new program aimed at harnessing technology to prepare students for college and get them to graduation.&nbsp; Bill Gates suggested his foundation&rsquo;s investment could swell to as much as $80m over the next four years, making it a major player in speeding up and shaping the already <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/colleges-see-17-percent-increase-in-online-enrollment/20820" rel="nofollow">booming</a> online education business.</p>

<p><strong>How to Put Universities Out of Business</strong></p>
<p>Robert Cosgrave writes on <a href="http://tertiary21.blogspot.com/2010/09/how-to-put-universities-out-of-business.html" rel="nofollow">how to put universities out of business</a>.&nbsp; He looks at what they do (generate graduates), why they do it (to help employers filter potential recruits) and he then considers what would happen instead if universities didn&rsquo;t exist.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a bit simplistic (I always thought universities dabbled in a bit of research as well) but there is some food for thought.</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>Talking of food (I know, these links are priceless&hellip;) SHM consultant Paul Gillooly suggested at the OECD's Institutional Management in Higher Education conference that <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20101008113849939" rel="nofollow">universities should be run more like supermarkets</a>.&nbsp; But David Staley, speaking at this week&rsquo;s Educause conference, thinks <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/what-if-we-ran-universities-like-wikipedia/27612" rel="nofollow">universities should be run like Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>[University World News]</p>
<p>And Jay Matthews thinks the world of education could learn a salutary lesson from the impact Netflix had on <a href="http://d-edreckoning.blogspot.com/2010/10/tale-of-blockbuster-important-lesson.html" rel="nofollow">Blockbuster Video&rsquo;s recent demise</a> in the US.</p>

<p><strong>Clark on Browne</strong></p>
<p>Donald Clark (when he&rsquo;s not dripping cynicism) speaks a lot of sense on adult education matters, and is often a staunch supporter of the OU.&nbsp; His <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2010/10/universities-focus-on-fees-wrong.html" rel="nofollow">seven suggestions for HE funding</a>, offered in light of the Browne report, making interesting reading.</p>
<p>[Donald Clark]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong></p>
<p>Apparently, there&rsquo;s much more to social media than your teenage kids telling all their mates that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;really fed up&rdquo;.&nbsp; Charities and social-good organisations have seen tangible benefits, such as Red Cross which used text messages to raise $5 million in relief funds for Haiti.&nbsp; Mashable has put together five examples of <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/09/15/5-trends-social-good/" rel="nofollow">trends for social good</a>, plus commentary on how things might go in the future.</p>
<p>[Tim Seal]</p>
<p>Sarah Kessler makes the case for (and gives examples of) <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/09/29/social-media-in-school/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">social media in schools</a>, whilst Marcia Conner discusses <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/marcia-conner/learn-all-levels/face-facebook-learning" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Face to Facebook learning</a> and Jane offers two useful tools &ndash; <a href="http://janeknight.typepad.com/pick/2010/10/hotseat-and-mixable-social-learning-in-and-out-of-the-classroom.html" rel="nofollow">Hotseat and Mixable</a> &ndash; that can be used to integrate Facebook, Twitter and learning.</p>
<p>[Jane Hart]</p>
<p>Times Higher Education article on <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=413795&c=2" rel="nofollow">the use of Social media in an academic context</a>, including contributions from Martin Weller.</p>
<p>[Pete Howard]</p>
<p>A <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/social-networking-can-bring-students-stress-as-well-as-connection-survey-finds/27526" rel="nofollow">technology and mental health poll</a> of 2,207 undergraduates at 40 US colleges reveals that social media do not always have positive effects.&nbsp; For instance, 40% say they have at least 500 friends on Facebook but hardly interact with most of them.&nbsp; About 90% said they used Facebook and sent text messages to friends in the previous week and 60% said that if someone failed to respond immediately, they puzzled over why.&nbsp; About a quarter said they would be relieved if they shut off their cellphones and computers, while 57 percent said a social-media blackout would make them more stressed.</p>
<p>[Wired Campus]</p>
<p>And, as part of Project Unite, the OU Business School has launched its <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=3489903" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn Group</a> which is open to current students, staff, alumni and prospective students wishing to connect and network with like minded people.</p>

<p><strong>The Wilderness Downtown</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://thewildernessdowntown.com/" rel="nofollow">The Wilderness Downtown</a> seems to have caught people&rsquo;s attention: enter the name of the town in which you were born and it constructs a video story using a combination of boilerplate material, plus data from Google Maps and Street View, JavaScript and HTML5 (so avoid running in IE).&nbsp; Find out much more about how Ricardo Cabello developed it all on his <a href="http://mrdoob.com/blog/post/705" rel="nofollow">Mr Doob</a> blog page.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual Choir</strong></p>
<p>Conductor Eric Whitacre has assembled, conducted and recorded a virtual choir of 185 voices from 12 countries singing his own composition, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7o7BrlbaDs" rel="nofollow">Lux Aurumque</a>.&nbsp; Engineer Scott Haines mixed a total of 243 separate audio tracks to create this high quality 6-minute piece in a great demonstration of the power and reach of the Web.</p>

<p><strong>University iPad Programs Get Mixed Response</strong></p>
<p>Several universities have recently experimented with providing <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/blogPost-content/27046/" rel="nofollow">free iPads to students</a>, with mixed early results now starting to emerge.&nbsp; At George Fox University, Oregon, only 10% of freshmen opted for iPads, with 90% choosing MacBooks and this has made it hard for lecturers to integrate them more fully into the curriculum; limitations on iPad multi-tasking and printing have also caused problems.&nbsp; Seton Hill University has rolled out iPads plus an e-book app called <a href="http://www.inkling.com/" rel="nofollow">Inkling</a> which allows students to access interactive graphics and add notes as they read along; faculty members can access the students' marginalia to see whether they understand the text and they can also remotely receive and answer questions from students in real time.</p>
<p>[Wired Campus]</p>
<p>If you like everything about the iPad except touch-screen typing, try <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-27076_3-20018158-248.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20" rel="nofollow">TyPad </a>&nbsp;- a $130 wrap-case with an integrated Bluetooth keyboard, good for 90hrs of typing from one charge.</p>

<p><strong>Effective Assessment in a Digital Age</strong></p>
<p>JISC&rsquo;s new guide <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2010/09/digiassess.aspx" rel="nofollow">Effective Assessment in a Digital Age</a> demonstrates how technology can significantly improve the experience of assessment and feedback.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do we still insist that students, who mostly use technologies such as laptops and mobile phones when researching their assignments, sit down with pen and paper and write long essays when they are assessed?&rdquo; asks Ros Smith, the author of the guide.</p>

<p><strong>Jane Austen Manuscripts</strong></p>
<p>A team from Oxford and Kings College has put together an online collection of <a href="http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/edition/intro.html" rel="nofollow">Jane Austen Manuscripts</a>.&nbsp; The aim was to &ldquo;to create a digital resource reuniting all the known holograph surviving manuscripts of Austen's fiction in an unprecedented virtual collection [and] to provide for the first time full descriptions of, transcriptions of, analysis of, and commentary on the manuscripts in the archive, including details of erasures, handwriting, paper quality, watermarks, ink, binding structures, and any ancillary materials held with the holographs as aspects of their physical integrity or provenance.&rdquo;</p>
