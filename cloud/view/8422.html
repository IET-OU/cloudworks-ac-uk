        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This is the Blue Team&rsquo;s group report on the representations reviewed during Week 8/9 Activity 2b. It summarises our overall findings and also links to the individual reviews that were listed on Cloudworks by each member of the team.</p>

<p><strong>CADMOS</strong></p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="128">
<p>Can be integrated with Moodle- but is this also a bit poor as it weakens the benefit of it being to use it with basic technical skills and understanding</p>
<p>Someone with basic technical skills or knowledge of learning design is able to use it</p>
<p>Visual notation - good for visual learners, also makes it easier to recognise and understand</p>
<p>Provides guidance - good for new people or for people who want to change their approach</p>
<p>Creates two modules - conceptual and flow model - 2 different views</p>
<p>Step design approach- which most staff currently adopt</p>
<p>Can add in metadata</p>
<p>Can edit models separately</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="128">
<p>Cannot correspond each activity more than one learning goal or prerequisite, so that link is lost within the tool</p>
<p>Read that once students had problems as it does not contain copy, paste and undo...but this may now be included</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="106">
<p>New staff or current staff with basic technical skills or knowledge of learning design so would be suited to a beginner member of staff. Or if someone wants to change their approach to learning design and planning</p>
<p>Can review in two different perspectives so allows for good evaluation and thus improvements</p>

<p>Cannot correspond each activity more than one learning goal or prerequisite, so cannot use in face to face sessions, wouldn&rsquo;t be effective</p>

</td>
<td valign="top" width="128">
<p>In quite a lot of depth compared to CADMOS, so would it be appropriate for many staff, depends on situation of the task and what it contains</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="128">
<p>Staff, even new staff - ease of use and ability to structure As they can be reused, it will save time for staff and may give them ideas they hadn't thought of before when planning At it allows for the staff to work towards an intention using a strategy, could this mean that there is more awareness of the goal of the lesson and breaking this into the different stages makes it manageable</p>

<p>A simple, visual design, although it also housed the ability to include quite a lot of detail, if one so wished.</p>
<p>Tabs for the four different components allowed for easy access to the detail of each component.</p>
<p>Each factor can be described in detail and therefore provides a broader understanding of each activity.</p>
<p>A web-based model, which allows sharing of ideas and collaborative work on a design.</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="128">
<p>It may not be the model of choice for everyone, as it may not provide the overall view that everybody wants; there is no clear provision for a timeline in the final script design and no obvious area to display aims or skills to be developed.</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="106">
<p>Representation would be useful for projects that are planned collaboratively, maybe by educators at different institutions. e.g. planning a joint learning activity for different institutions at a remote location.</p>
<p>May be useful for projects involving no set timeline for the included activities.</p>
<p>Useful for planning of projects requiring a great deal of detail.</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="81">
<p>The representation would be overkill for the planning of short-term projects or topics or for those where collaborative input was unnecessary.</p>

<p><strong>Report</strong></p>
<p>From the summary table shown above, it is clear that, as a team, we didn&rsquo;t cover all of the representations available in our reviews; it so happened that each of the above representations were reviewed by more than one person.</p>
<p>We did not find that any of the above representations would be ideal for all scenarios, but they could all be useful under particular circumstances, as summarised in the table. Some of the representations allow for more detail than others, whilst some are built for online collaboration, which again, would be a useful feature for some learning design situations.</p>
<p>The full reviews of the representations chosen by the members of the blue team can be viewed below:</p>
