        <p>The 2 representations chosen were:</p>
<p><a class="oucontent-hyperlink" href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/-healthy-eating-in-the-4-ts-model" rel="nofollow">"Healthy Eating" as a 4 Ts model</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a class="oucontent-hyperlink" href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/-healthy-eating-in-an-e-design-template" rel="nofollow">"Healthy Eating" in an e-Design Template</a></p>
<p><strong>Readability</strong></p>
<p>4 Ts model - I had to read the description a couple of times before I fully understood how this learning design was meant to work, partly because the graphic was quite hard to read. However with e-Design I quickly understood the representation and the structure of the design process.</p>
<p><strong>Expressiveness</strong></p>
<p>The 4 Ts model is described as a &lsquo;rather messy&rsquo; design process which concerned me as I would prefer something with a clean flow. As a design process you are expected to &lsquo;juggle with the 4 components&rsquo; (task, teams, technology, time) with no-predetermined or mandatory order - this offers flexibility but also opportunities for confusion. However this looks to be a good design process for an activity that needs to fit within a specific time frame where you want to incorporate group work and collaborative activities.</p>
<p>E-design is very structured and would suit novice users looking to work towards independent learning, being assessed on the way. This is clearly expressed within the design.</p>
<p><strong>Utility</strong></p>
<p>I found the 4 Ts representation quite confusing &ndash; the graphic was not enough on its own to communicate aspects of the design so relied on a lot of text explanation which I found difficult to follow. However once I understood the process I could see how it could be applied to different activities.</p>
<p>The e-design graphic is enough on its own to describe how the process works &ndash; a structured process that moves from active induction to guided exploration, then facilitated investigation and finally self-organised learner. &nbsp;This is easy to read and understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are these representations adequate for expressing your design? (<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8277" rel="nofollow">Frances Pigott's Design Narrative</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Neither of these representations are completely suited to my design narrative. The 4 Ts model focuses on team / group work and collaboration &ndash; which is not in my narrative and the e-design has a strong focus on assessment which was not relevant to my design. However both representations contain aspects that would be both beneficial and useful to my design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What would be the benefits of using these representations for your design?</strong></p>
<p>Using the 4 Ts model for my design would allow me to structure the training session more tightly, resulting in all aspects of the training to be covered within the allotted time frame. Due to cost factors, all aspects of the course must be covered within the day, so this aspect would be of great benefit, however you also need to be flexible to demands of the customer, so this could be factored into the design.</p>
<p>The e-design model is better suited to my design narrative minus the assessment aspect. The induction and guided exploration aspects with closed tasks and activities and trainer / customer interactions that would structure and control the design would be of most benefit. The training course being approx 6 hours in length would not be long enough to move into the areas of facilitated investigation and self-organised learner.</p>
