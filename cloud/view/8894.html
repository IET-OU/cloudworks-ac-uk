<li>how does this relate to the accessability design for all approach</li>

<li>So often you hear the term personalisation in ed tech and its very abstract. Nice reference here to it in context, personal personalisaton :-)</li>
<li>i have seen a number of my friends as adults being told they have specific needs, and haing teh personalised support or understanding how things need to be done differently has revolutionised their approach</li>
<li>Vbookz PDF is great app. My students use it and find it helpful :)</li>
<li>So interesting to see these apps. I had never heard of any of them. Seems a shame that they are not well known. Are these apps free?</li>
<li>What digital developments have had biggest impact on learning for people with dyslexia?</li>
<li>Whis is the best one? Most useful?</li>
<li>Like how you have recognised that personalised approach to find best tools and techniques for each learner - is your eBook for teachers or learners?</li>
<li>Would like the link to your eBook Drew</li>

                   <ul>
<li>how does this relate to the accessability design for all approach</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a saying among dyslexia practitioners What is good for dyslexics is good for everyone. Particularly at HE level the ways of teaching are so 'one size fits all' that is to say sequential learning for people with auditory learning styles and effective good working memory that the approach is really tranferable to many groups, I find dyslexia approaches work well with students with Asperger's ASD andd crebal palsy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dyslexics ofetn become chaotic learners without support</li>
<li>I think this is true for some but less so for others, because they hav e lived with their difficulties some become highly structured and methodical, especially at university as they have had to find a way just to be there. Generallhy I find students with dyspraxia much more chaotic, but the same applies to them re finding a way around difficulties</li>
<li>So often you hear the term personalisation in ed tech and its very abstract. Nice reference here to it in context, personal personalisaton :-)</li>
<li>Because SpLDs produce such varying difficulties for the reasons above in part you end up personaising everything - I am lucky enough to work mostly one to one</li>
<li>i have seen a number of my friends as adults being told they have specific needs, and haing teh personalised support or understanding how things need to be done differently has revolutionised their approach</li>
<li>Vbookz PDF is great app. My students use it and find it helpful :)</li>
<li>Claroread is also very good when I demonstrate tese apps students often download them there and then</li>
<li>So interesting to see these apps. I had never heard of any of them. Seems a shame that they are not well known. Are these apps free?</li>
<li>Most apps are either a pound or two or free, although there are sometimes add ons VBookks is free but you pay for a voice, only about a pound though and you only need one</li>
<li>What digital developments have had biggest impact on learning for people with dyslexia?</li>
</ul>
<p>Computers in education generally have had a massive impact: the ability to review resources, videos recordings as often as is needed, organising writing with cut and paste, the instant availability of information via the internet good quality presentation through word processing, -I think tablets and mobile learning just take this to the next stage&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Whis is the best one? Most useful?</li>
<li>Impossible to say the best one is usually one the students will find for themselves I learn from students in this regard everyday</li>
<li>Like how you have recognised that personalised approach to find best tools and techniques for each learner - is your eBook for teachers or learners?</li>
</ul>
<p>The ebook(s) will be for learner/students - They seem much more receptive to these things anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Would like the link to your eBook Drew</li>
</ul>
<p>I would be happy to make it available to all- when it is finished not sure how I could do this after H818 ends but if you le me have email address outside of OU I will try&nbsp;</p>        </div>
