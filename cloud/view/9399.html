<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; HBR; EdSurge; NBC; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Researchers at Carnegie Mellon investigated student behaviour and outcomes on an &lsquo;Introduction to Psychology as a Science&rsquo; Coursera MOOC, comparing those who took it as a traditional MOOC, spending most of their time watching video lectures, with those who combined the MOOC and interactive materials produced by Carnegie Mellon&rsquo;s Open Learning Initiative.&nbsp; <a href="http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2730000/2724681/p111-koedinger.pdf?ip=137.108.145.25&id=2724681&acc=OA&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35.4D4702B0C3E38B35.4D4702B0C3E38B35.B0DA6BDBC96C38D3&CFID=721783522&CFTOKEN=70750076&__acm__=1444911542_af1dea884e2e2e63cf4e3e83aa419e06" rel="nofollow">Learning Is Not a Spectator Sport: Doing Is Better Than Watching for Learning From a MOOC</a> reports that those in the MOOC-only course scored an average of 57% on the final exam (<em>N=</em>215) whereas those in the combined course averaged 66% (<em>N=</em>939). &nbsp;And when students in the combined course completed an interactive activity, they learned six times as much as those who only read the material or watched a video. &nbsp;&ldquo;When one is watching a lecture or reading material, there&rsquo;s an illusion of learning,&rdquo; says Prof Ken Koedinger.&nbsp; The additional &ldquo;Learn by Doing&rdquo; interactive activities support student outcome achievement by providing feedback targeted to diagnose misconceptions plus robust hints to support students.</p>

<p>A survey by Hefce found that only <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/only-one-in-four-new-degree-courses-attracts-enough-students-study-suggests" rel="nofollow">28% of new university programmes attracted enough students to be sustainable</a>.&nbsp; However, this is a big step forward compared with an older analysis of 2005-08 UCAS data that showed just one in 10 new single-subject degree courses managed to recruit at least 10 to 15 students (researchers at the time suggested that 15 to 30 was probably the minimum viable figure).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A wide variation in pass rates across subject areas.&nbsp; E.g. 90% of medicine and dentistry graduates achieved either a first or upper second but, if only firsts are considered, mathematical science graduates are the most successful, at 35%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An average of 75% of full-time graduates gained a first or upper second compared with just 57% of part timers.&nbsp; The researchers attribute four percentage points of this gap to factors such as entry qualifications, but cannot explain the remaining 14 percentage point difference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>64% of mature graduates gain a first or upper second compared with 75% of young graduates.&nbsp; However, if mitigating factors such as entry qualifications are taken into account, mature graduates outperform youngsters by seven percentage points</p>

<p>A research study report from Prospects College of Advanced Technology (PROCAT), <a href="http://procatdigital.co.uk/resources/PROCAT Student Focus Groups Report.pdf" rel="nofollow">Technology Solutions for Further Education Learning</a>, investigated students&rsquo; access to and use of technology, as well as student expectations of the college in helping them gain skills, experiences and attributes in the use of technology.&nbsp; Top of their wants/expectations were robust wi-fi, availability of devices (laptops were preferred over tablets because of their keyboards) or the ability to use their own, and access to printers.&nbsp; Some 97% owned a smartphone, 82% a laptop and 69% a tablet.</p>

<p>One of the positive features of Robert Talbert&rsquo;s face-to-face calculus course was student presentations of their work followed afterwards by a whole-class discussion. &nbsp;But when the course shifted online, his solution was to <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/how-student-video-presentations-can-build-community-in-an-online-course/57435" rel="nofollow">get students to create videos of themselves</a> and post them to YouTube.&nbsp; Each student was tasked with selecting two problems from a list and preparing a video (max 6 min for both) within a week.&nbsp; It was also a requirement that the student&rsquo;s face, voice and handwriting had to be present in the video all at the same time, at all times (i.e. typically an upper body shot of the student presenting at a whiteboard).&nbsp; The initiative has proved successful and Talbert concludes, &ldquo;Possibly the most important thing is that they added a large dose of humanity to the [distance] student experience. &nbsp;Students got to see and hear each other, and suddenly the idea of &lsquo;classmates&rsquo;, even &lsquo;class&rsquo; itself, was no longer an abstraction.&rdquo;</p>
