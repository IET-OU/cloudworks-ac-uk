        <h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>I am a Computer Science Teacher in a Secondary school </em></p>
<h2><strong>Situation</strong></h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Binary can be a difficult topic to teach to some students, they can find it dull and some students are just simply turned off when they have to do maths! I was teaching this topic to a group of 28 Year 7 (Age 11) students who had no previous experience of Binary. I was teaching in a computer room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Task</p>
<p><em>I wanted students to be engaged in the topic, I wanted their experience to be a positive start to the scheme of learning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to have a James Bond theme as a &lsquo;hook&rsquo;. The success criteria were that by the end of the lesson students were able to convert binary to denary and binary to characters. </em></p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>Activity 1- To begin with I gave students some binary code which they needed to convert to denary to find out the code to open the mystery box. I gave some examples of binary and what it converted to.&nbsp; Students had to work out what the pattern was and apply it to the binary for the mystery box.&nbsp; I then asked the student who had worked it out to explain how they had done this to the rest of the group.</em></p>
<p><em>This worked really well, students engaged it was fun. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Activity 2 - &nbsp;&nbsp;I placed around the room examples of binary code and in pairs students had to use the process that we had discussed to convert the binary to denary on whiteboards. This was a timed activity. Students found it challenging but were supported by working in pairs. I found timing the activity kept up the pace. However some did still find this challenging so further help/support was needed for some.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Activity 3- I modelled how to convert the denary to characters using a shortened version of the ASCII table.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Activity 4 &ndash; I had prepared a video which set the James Bond scene.&nbsp; It started by a phone ringing and then James Bond speaking to me and the students explaining that the Queen had been captured and he needed help to crack the code to help release the Queen.&nbsp; I had prepared a excel worksheet and students needed to convert the Binary to denary and then to characters to crack the code.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;Activity 5- Student returned to the whiteboard and gave the code. The video embedded in the Power point allowed for interactivity. When students gave the code they observed James Bond releasing the Queen from the Palace.&nbsp; I edited this piece of video from the &lsquo;Olympic Games opening ceremony&rsquo; 2012 scene. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>I think the majority of students engaged with the topic and learning outcomes were met. I was particularly pleased with how students had engaged with the scenario and it was fun.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t always anticipate the difficulties that some students have in finding the resources you have prepared. Often the IT system in a school requires you to store things in certain places and finding them can cause difficulties for some students and be a barrier. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice a couple of students were disappointed that the task had been completed by some before they had found and opened the task.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>Even though the resources were quite time consuming to create, it was worth the effort when I saw how engaged the students were. I think that hinging difficult concepts on a topic can help students to learn, it can also make things fun and relevant. &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Accessibility to the resources is quite critical to students being engaged and being able to make progress in the lesson.&nbsp; Students need to be able to access resources from a user friendly interface. </em></p>
<p><em>When creating computer related tasks, it is important to ensure that you create differentiated resources/tasks to cater for the range of needs that you are likely to have in your group. &nbsp;</em></p>
