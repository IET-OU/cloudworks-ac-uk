<p align="center">Mark Brown</p>

<p>Finding the appropriate blend. Sometimes I forget that my world&rsquo;s is not the mainstream (yet). I&rsquo;m living in the future&hellip;</p>
<p>Mark has done a presentation for council on &lsquo;technological trends and the future of education&rsquo; &ndash; more on this is available from his blog. In general many in the Stream project (which is Massey&rsquo;s work on their Virtual Learning Environment and other tools for learning and teaching) also keep regular blogs.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the appropriate blend</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are working in a complex context</li>
<li>There is only so much the brain can do &ndash; there are limits to multi-tasking</li>
<li>This is complex work and we are doing as much as we can as fast as we can!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ultimately the final goal is about improving the student experience</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outline</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Blending with purpose</li>
<li>Cutting edge of blended learning</li>
<li>Bleeding edge of blended learning</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to remember that we are already doing a lot and we need to celebrate that</p>
<p><strong>Video about the value of having a design team</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We can&rsquo;t underestimate the complexity of today&rsquo;s design challenge and the multitude of possibilities and design decisions.</li>
<li>The hidden pedagogy &ndash; how are you going to go about your teaching, your teaching philosophy and the value of the design team to help articulate this</li>
<li>Using a student blog as a reading log &ndash; replacing static, passive reading. Search and share and reflect on their own reading</li>
<li>Getting students to create their own podcasts</li>
<li>We shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the value of creativity and in particular working with others</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blending with purpose</strong></p>
<p>What we know:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Learning is not a spectator sport. Students do not learn much just sitting in classes listening to teachers, memorizing prepackaed assignments, and spitting out answers&hellip;</p>
<p>They must talk about what they are learning, write reflectively about it, relate tit to past&nbsp; experience and apply it to their daily lives</p>
<p><em>Chickering and Gamson, 1987</em></p>
<p>Also Course Experience Survey, Australia</p>
<p><strong>Diffferent theories and perspectives </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Theory of transactional distance</li>
<li>Conversational framework</li>
<li>Communities of inquiry &ndash; teacher presence, social presence and cognitive presence</li>
</ul>
<p>But these models are not very practical</p>
<p>Book &ndash; blended learning in Higher Education (based around community of inquiry model)</p>
<p>Two key lessons</p>
<ol>
<li>Must promote engagement </li>
<li>Learner interaction is crucial</li>
</ol>
<p>The major conclusion from this review is that &hellip; designing courses to increase interaction positively&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Bernard et al 2009 review of educational research</em></p>
<p><strong>Blending with purpose</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Three kinds of interaction &ndash; staff-student interaction, student-content interaction and student-student interaction (Blending with purpose)</li>
<li>We have many, many different ways in which we can present content to our students, which mean the design process is more complex</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Blended: resources (from YouTube videos to traditional paper-based), environments (face to face and virtual) and modes (beyond dual mode of distance and face-to-face)</li>
<li>Blended learning at Massey University is about purposely integrating different resources, environments and delivery modes to provide an exception and distinctive (interactive) experience for all students</li>
</ul>
<p>Garrison and Vaughan (2008) point out &ndash; blended learning is not an addition that simply builds another expensive educational layer (pg. 5). A lot of their work is based around the work of John Dewey.</p>
<p>We mustn&rsquo;t just adopt an additive approach, to adding technology on. We must integrate it, think carefully about what is used and why and how it all integrates. If we add something in, something else needs to come out!</p>
<p>In sum&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Not new</li>
<li>No simple definition</li>
<li>Involved decisions about learning design, i.e. want to design <em>for </em>learning</li>
<li>About finding the most appropriate blend</li>
<li>Magic is in the mix!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cutting edge of blended learning and the Stream Project<br /></strong></p>
<p>Examples of what is going on around Massey University, some examples</p>
<ul>
<li>Our VLE &ndash; based on Moodle (replacement for WebCT), have rebranded that with Stream. Stream isn&rsquo;t just Moodle. Stream is our Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), which has Moodle at its heart. Also includes Turnitin, My Portfolio (Mahara), Adobe Presenter, Adobe Meeting, MediaSite, SBL(Scenario-based learning) interactive + the free tools available externally</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Stream as a word is a metaphor for lifelong learning&hellip; It&rsquo;s a metaphor for knowledge, always flowing and moving, the stream runs at different speeds, directions and strengths.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Community: Resource-based, programme-based, interest-based</li>
<li>The Stream team have developed a template for setting up a community environment, which helps guide you through the decisions you need to make</li>
<li>There is also a paper-view (i.e. what in the UK would be called a module or course). There is a generic &lsquo;skin&rsquo; for this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some examples</strong></p>
<p>For example a sociological imagination course</p>
<ul>
<li>A short simple introduction to a course done simply using a web cam can be very effective, an example of &lsquo;teacher presence&rsquo; &ndash; simple and personal. Alternatively we can have a short 5 minute podcast</li>
<li>Adopt presenter &ndash; integrated powerpoint representation with audio and a link to a pdf. Had a max of 5 slides to introduce each of the course readings, 5 minutes long, 5 slides. This was part of their course team design. All of the course team agreed to adopt this common format, so that the students get a common, consistent experience. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also can use Adobe Connect Meeting a synchronous communication tool where it is possible to have shared resources. Its an example of webcasting. Can also have a backchannel and can record and archive live presentations.</li>
<li>Scenario-based learning Interactive developed by Terry Stewartl. </li>
<li>One example of this is a course in Business. It starts&nbsp; with a video of a problem, students have to solve this. Example given for a third-level business course, promotes creative thinking</li>
<li><a href="http://www.myportfolio.ac.nz/" rel="nofollow">www.myportfolio.ac.nz</a> My Portfolio tool &ndash; available for students and staff. Will be seamless in Moodle 2.0. Enables students to gather and present real evidence against a set of student attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p>e-Portfolios at Solent University video</p>
<p>We have a set of core tools (i.e. Stream) but there is a wider set of tools &ndash; web 2.0 and beyond. We can&rsquo;t support all&nbsp; of these. Stream &ndash; as our place, Web 2.0 &ndash; as their space. Myportfolio can be considered as the interface between these.</p>
<p>Also worth looking at the JISC Effective Practice with e-Portfolios (supporting 21st Century Learning) guide, available online.</p>
<p><strong>Expanded toolset</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic assignment submission</li>
<li>Digitalisation of learning resources</li>
<li>e-Learning categories (Massey is introducing a set of new categories which they will map back to the broader national categories)</li>
<li>Daughter of SECAT online</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bridging the distance project</li>
<li>Lightwork management and marking tool</li>
<li>Stream4staff</li>
<li>Online professional development (have 8 self-paced modules available)</li>
<li>Peer review system</li>
<li>Quality enhancement tools paper self-review checklist, student workload calculator, accessibility guidelines</li>
<li>Fund for Innovative Teaching with Stream (FITS)</li>
<li>Teaching Developments Awards</li>
<li>BLaDE exchange &ndash; need a research programme underpinning our work, will have a monthly symposium programme </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bleeding edge of blended learning</strong></p>
<p>The elephant in the room!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually it&rsquo;s a herd!</p>
<p><em>Questions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What about Internet access?</li>
<li>Do staff have to use Stream?</li>
<li>What about the increased workload?</li>
<li>Where is the evidence it works? (actually this is not the right question to ask, its more <em>how</em> its used)?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>AUSSE &ndash; all about student engagement</li>
<li>Benchmarks</li>
<li>Student Satisfaction Survey</li>
<li>Research on implementation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sociology programme </em></p>
<p>90% say helped me with my study, 80% say it added more flexibility to their study, 55% liked Adobe Presenter most, 83% sat they use it several times a week, 81% say it was positive or very positive</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I don&rsquo;t think my learning experience would have been half as effective&nbsp; and enjoyable being bale to interact with real students &hellip;.. &lsquo;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&lsquo;I think Stream is great&hellip; its how the course coordinators use it that&rsquo;s important&rsquo;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using technology to improve education is not rocket science&hellip;its much much harder than that! (Diana Laurillard, Opening Up Education 2009)</p>
