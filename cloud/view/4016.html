        <p>OLnet (The Open Learning network) is researching the way in which Open Educational Resources are produced and used and the influence that they are having on education and collaboration. It is carrying out research projects, offering fellowships and developing tools. In this presentation Patrick McAndrew, the Director of OLnet at The Open University, refects on the priorities and goals that are coming out after one year of OLnet. The presentation builds on the work of the OLnet research team.</p>    </div>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">(Chris Pegler was due to do SCORE presentation in this slot, but had problems with audio, so Patrick instead does his OLnet talk from this afternoon.)</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Open Learning network - a research project, a sister project to SCORE, funded by the Hewlett Foundation. OLnet is looking at research aspect; SCORE is looking at the roll-out to UK Higher Education.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Has been a huge investment by the Hewlett Foundation in kicking off Open Educational Resource (OER) activity. Much less investment in research behind it. SCORE is looking at the practical side. With OLnet, trying to globally research it with Carnegie Mellon University.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Purpose is to establish how research can be supported, linked together, shared, etc. Through research projects, fellowships. Using and developing tools to apply our collective intelligence to understanding this.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Has been a very interesting period for OER, investment through JISC in the UK, even bigger change in US - OER are driving changes to the school and college systems. Before, OER were a mission in themselves - making things open. But now, it's about what we can achieve now we have good resources available for free. iTunesU is an indication of what can happen - vast number of people can access this. How can this catalyse Deeper Learning?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Six areas where there are key issues.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">First - how do you design for reuse in this new open world. Big change from a lecture.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Second - building and using tools for us and for others (including Cohere)</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Third - accreditaiton vs recognition, changes in the education process. Interesting experiments in OpenLearn. P2PU, DIY U, people coaching themselves through the learning process.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Fourth - Content - has a special role, is an attractors. Huge numbers of people on OpenLearn, iTunesU - can lead through to using that to bring people together to act socially as well as working through the tasks. Reflected directly in to recruitment - OpenLearn has recruited students in a moderately large number - about 13,000.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Fifth - Global initiatives - OER Africa, UK, Netherelands, NZ.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">(And I've missed one, I think, sorry.)</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">This leads in to a series of goals for the project - evidence, design, infrastructure, learning, etc.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Can see a model for how we might move in to other countries, rise of OER stars - OER goes beyond what you might expect in the first place. Culturally-related content is an issue, and a dominance of the cultural 'West'; high-profile name universities - e.g. Oxbridge/Ivy League.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Role as researchers is to provide the evidence, only partly to see what the message is.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Much research activity underway. Looking at an Open Future - McAndrew, Scanlon and Clow paper on Educause.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Questions:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Patrick: Picking up on international range - Interesting in Brazil that changes to copyright are making a difference. Have an investment in open source already. Makes it important to go beyond boundaries and go beyond comfort zone.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Non: Given the level of suggestiona bout sources do you think we still struggle with finding good quality OERs across these repositories and stores?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Patrick: Companion project called OPAL on quality. Mixed take - can overplay the quality label. Quality in the eye of the reader.</div>

                   <p>here below transcript of the chat going on in the elluminate room during Patrick's talk:</p>
<p>Julie Messenger: I was really uncertain about staying on when Patrick stepped in due to his uncertainty. Clearly that was solely centred on the missing uplift of the presentation. I'm glad I did stay. I am finding this presentation really informative. I am not able to be online this afternoon and wanted to hear the one on OpenLearn so this is great for me. Must also say, there are some really creative slides used so far. I am assuming that they will be available post conference on Cloudworks.<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (Elke): Thanks Julie. Yes alikes will be available afterwards<br />---------------------<br />Karen Cropper: Yes all slides will be available<br />---------------------<br />markuos: Brazil is really doing some exciting stuff<br />---------------------<br />Mira Vogel: @markuos go on?<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: Is the Brasil project using edu-comm resources too?<br />---------------------<br />Julie Messenger: Obviously parts of Central America is leading open curricula!<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (Simon Buckingham Shum): an OLnet project research focus is building "OER Collective Intelligence": http://olnet.org/node/102<br />---------------------<br />edevUOD: What is the infra structure in Brazil which allows open access?<br />---------------------<br />Karen Cropper: All credit to Patrick since although he wa on standby we didn't really work out how we were going to implement this Plan B<br />---------------------<br />fred garnett: @Julie, I dont think Brasil is as progressive as you think, some great local pockest but real admin &amp; bureaucratic issues to get past<br />---------------------<br />markuos: @Mira As Patrick has just mentioned about the OER initiatives, but other areas like music mashup and copyright issues<br />---------------------<br />Moderator (Patrick McAndrew): I noticed!<br />---------------------<br />Non: really inspiration Patrick- great presentation and well done in the circumstances<br />---------------------<br />Mira Vogel: @Patrick&nbsp; :D</p>        </div>
