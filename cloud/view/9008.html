        <h2>Title: Risk management for project managers: Reflect &amp; Learn</h2>
<h2>Narrator: Designer and facilitator of learning</h2>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>A team of 20 people working in IT project management for a large South African Insurance company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Constraints defined by the client: Staff not to be taken out of work for more than 3 hours at a time.&nbsp; In total the engagement was not to exceed 30 hours and must be performed within the annual budget cycle of one year.&nbsp; Approach should draw upon professional project management standards and should be linkable to internal group practices for risk management.</p>

<h3><em>&nbsp;</em>Task</h3>
<p>Profiling of project community using assessment centre techniques had identified risk management as an area of weakness.&nbsp; This was recognised as an important area for capability development by Senior Management and the Head of the PMO.&nbsp; Project managers generally felt they were doing it OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Aim: To improve risk management practices</p>
<p>Measure of success:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk workshops run effectively by project managers (stakeholders engaged and report positively in the experience)</li>
<li>Risk logs used appropriately by project managers specifically:</li>
<li>Risks prioritised and measured consistently allowing portfolio views of overall risk exposure</li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>This learning programme was completed over a nine month period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em style="line-height: 1.5em;">Reflection stage 1</em></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Recent risk logs extracted and analysed in terms of their effectiveness.</li>
<li>Workshop 1 (all PMs): Results reviewed and discussed with all PMs in lunchtime forum session</li>
<li>Workshop 2: (all PMs) Best practice reminder &ndash; review of risk management practices &ndash; PMs work in groups to compare what they are doing with best practices.&nbsp; Action plans developed.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">Action stage 2</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop 3 (Senior PMs and PMO) &ndash; Detailed review of best practices in risk management. Standards for quantifying risk debated and agreed.</li>
<li>Coaching on packs provided.</li>
<li>Workshop 4 (all PMs) &ndash; The xxx way for risk management &ndash; briefing session on the new approach to risk management.&nbsp; What should be done, why and how?</li>
<li>Coaching on risk workshops &ndash; Senior PMs</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reflection stage 3</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop 5 (Senior management) Briefed on new process and discuss how they can support process</li>
<li>PMO manager does spot checks on risk logs and provides remedial action coaching support</li>
<li>Internal audit asked to review risk practices and advice on whether improvements are seen</li>
<li>Workshop 6 (Other project groups in other parts of organisation) &ndash; Shared lessons learned with project managers from other groups.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>Expected:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Audit confirmed improvements in risk reporting</li>
<li>Senior managers gained confidence in risk reporting and now demand it as an input to their decision making around projects</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Unexpected:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect and learn process to capability development preferred to simply sending people on training courses.&nbsp; Annual reflect and learn on a selected project process has now been performed for last three years.</li>
<li>18 months after this training the risk management practices were seen to dip down again.&nbsp; We believe this is because of high rates of staff turnover &ndash; new people coming in were not briefed into the process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">Insights:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Holding up the mirror&rsquo; &ndash; showing the team how they were currently performing and why they needed to improve was very important.&nbsp; This must be done with no blame and must show that all members of the team can contribute to the improvement &ndash; use of the word &lsquo;we&rsquo; very important.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes it&rsquo;s better to take more time to really embed the capability change in one area than try to address too many improvement areas at once.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Learning programmes over time are good in that the team could try and reflect and try again but they introduce other problems, most notably &ndash; how to deal with staff turnover during this period.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is something we must build into future programmes &ndash; one approach to this is the use of e-based learning supported by coaching by senior PMs.</li>
</ul>
