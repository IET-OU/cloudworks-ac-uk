        <p>This paper reports the methods and results from an evaluative project at the Open University examining students&rsquo; and Associate Lecturers&rsquo; experience of online materials and services provided for three Level 1 modules.&nbsp; The project used a mixture of written and self-recorded video diaries during 3 one week long interventions and interviews at the beginning and end of 3 first level modules.&nbsp; The modules (AA100, K101 and S104) were chosen for their importance as foundation modules in contrasting subjects and included a combination of electronic and printed material. Students were encouraged to use forums but could also attend face-to-face tutorials or day schools.</p>
<p>In total, seven ALs and twenty-one students were recruited as participants.&nbsp; The main findings of the study were that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology was not a highly salient issue.</li>
<li>Use of the module web site was regular and frequent.</li>
<li>There were no reports of any systematic difficulties with the OU Web presence.</li>
<li>Many students involved in this project used a small range of the features of the VLE.</li>
<li>There was evidence of a minority of students who were either excluded from access, or were late and reluctant adopters of new technology.</li>
<li>Technological change was perceived by the students and Associate Lecturers as continuous and unending.</li>
<li>Students and Associate Lecturers were engaged in an on-going and rapid process of technological change in particular in relation to:<br /> - Mobility - and the integration of various mobile devices including smartphones, tablet computers and e-book readers;<br /> - Reading - related to the recent availability of e-book readers and tablet computers</li>
<li>Mobile devices are now widely available but the way mobile possibilities and forms of access are taken&ndash;up is likely to be uneven. </li>
<li>The relationship between various devices and the availability of different kinds of network access combined to make a rich technological ecology.</li>
<li>Stable and regular practices surrounding the new devices had yet to be established.</li>
<li>The way students interact with technology and the institutional provision of technology, are both likely to become more diverse as mobile technologies and e-readers become embedded.</li>
<li>Online is an unclear term and was understood to mean two different things:<br /> Actively linked to a network and interacting via the network;<br /> Making use of a digital device (whether or not a network connection was in use).</li>
<li>The relationship between online and offline working was complex:<br /> - Students reported a wide variety of study practices which integrated both online and printed resources;</li>
</ul>
<p>--Online resources were integrated with printed materials in note taking practices. Note taking processes were highly individualised student practices.</p>
<p>Our paper will focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the methodological approach adopted to collect this data </li>
<li>a small number of issues from the full findings (including the changing picture in relation to mobility and e-book readers)</li>
<li>the long term issue of a preference for reading printed materials and how this might be affected by the rapid adoption of mobile devices and e-book readers.</li>
</ul>    </div>
