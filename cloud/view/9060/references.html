    <div class="user-entry">

        <p>I was struggling to get some of my post graduate students (healthcare professionals with no post graduate qualification/education) to engage with the virtual learning environment and the e-learning process (their attitude and anxiety related to computers was definitely a contributing factor). &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve used various &lsquo;blended learning&rsquo; techniques in the past, combining face to face teaching/tutorials with online work. However, these students were still struggling, taking part in only the essential e- learning activities e.g. submitting summative assignments. I needed to get these students to engage with the e-learning process in order to make it a more meaningful learning experience.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong> - The objectives were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improve student&rsquo;s attitudes towards the e-learning format</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Develop confidence in the use of e-learning technology</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action</strong></p>
<p>Instead of delivering a chalk and talk lecture on the VLE. I decided to make it a more interactive session, utilizing the computer lab, where I could demonstrate the process (on a computer) of accessing blackboard and could explain all the basic functions including: how to access the module contents, web resources and submitting an assignment for feedback and marking. I then got the students to do this on their computers. &nbsp;According to Salmon et al, (2007) &ldquo;individual access and the induction of participants to online learning is an essential prerequisite&rdquo; (p43). It gave the students a chance to discuss and resolve any problems they encountered while logging on and navigating the VLE site. &nbsp;At the end of the session I wanted to evaluate how beneficial the session had been as well as &nbsp;&nbsp;assessing the students&rsquo; knowledge in relation to the VLE site. I utilised a quiz/test relating to the VLE (this test had been developed by a colleague in another department). The test had to be completed on line and although it would not contribute towards their final mark, it was a compulsory element which they had to successfully complete before any feedback or a mark relating to their module was released.</p>
<p>This is an example of one of the questions used as part of the VLE test.</p>
<p><strong>You are allowed as many attempts as you like and should aim to get 100%. Some questions are more challenging that others and carry more marks. You should aim to complete the test by March the 29<sup>th</sup>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is really important that I regularly check my university email account and regularly log in to the blackboard site because:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The university only corresponds via the university webmail address</li>
<li>
<p>I can submit my coursework through blackboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will be able to retrieve marked work and receive &nbsp;&nbsp;feedback on my course work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can correspond with fellow students through blackboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will enable me to find important aspects of the course such as summative assessment dates and exams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of the above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>.<strong>Result</strong></p>
<p>The students felt that having an interactive session where they could actually carry out the tasks was very beneficial. It gave the students that were not familiar with the on line learning environment a chance to learn with and from their peers as well as be supported and supervised through a structured and developmental process. They all completed the online VLE test and the VLE generally was utilised a lot more by the students, this could be seen through the tracking facility on blackboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Reflection</strong></p>
<p>From a facilitator/teacher point of view, it was quite hard work as I was utilising several different teaching techniques e.g. formal lecture, it was demonstration and e-learning technology. However, it was also very rewarding, the students engaged fully with the session and through trial and error became quite proficient at navigating the VLE site. This was very much a student centered approach which encouraged the student to actively seek out knowledge and solutions relating to the VLE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    </div>
