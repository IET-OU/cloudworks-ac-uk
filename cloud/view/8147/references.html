        <h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>Where are you coming from? What is the context in which you are working and participating in OLDS MOOC?</em></p>
<p>I am a lecturer and course leader in a UK University. I have managed e-learnign programmes in the past but would not describe myself as a Learning Technologist. I currently teach face to face but enjoy incoprporating online platforms as much as possible, both institutional (VLE) and external - such as Google Docs, blogs, wikis, Twitter and Facebook. My current goals within my teaching are to develop greater research &nbsp;and digital skills in my students.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>What did you hope to achieve? What were your goals in joining OLDS MOOC?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;I joined OLDSMOOC because I have an interest in this form of learning and because good learning design is something I feel I could learn more about and do much better! I didn't immediately make the link between the project and my own teaching but in desperation I combined the two with happy results :)</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>What did you do? What were the main events, interactions, practices and activities in which you participated?&nbsp;<em>What were the obstacles - and how did you tackle them?</em></em></p>
<p>I have participated fairly consistently in the MOOC and been very active in completing tasks up until the last week when unfortunately I received notice that I would be moving house in 3 weeks! This has meant abandoning the MOOC, project and learning partner in favour of frantic packing.</p>
<p>The first week was incredibly frustrating as I did not (and still don't ) find Cloudworks to be an intuitive platform. In particular it proved almost impossible to select a project team to join and almost at random I started stalking a woman in Ireland who looked as though she might have similar interests to mine. The fact that we shared a Nottingham connection made the introductions a little easier, added to which she had an interest in the subject area of my course (Health and Social Care).</p>
<p>The lack of a social network integrated into Cloudworks makes connection very difficult - as does the lack of a logical site map. I constantly feel lost in here and this is not aided by the multiplicity of platforms being used, with emphasis shifting from Google to CW to Twitter to Slideshare....</p>
<p>What this has done though is taught me how very confusing it is when I switch platforms with my students and consistency is a principal of learning design that I intend to adhere to more rigorously in future.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>What were the outcomes of your participation? Did you meet your goals? What went well, what didn't? What unexpected outcomes did you notice?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;My biggest disappointment is that I didn't get to complete a basic design for the module I initially envisaged. I guess in such a short time frame this was not going to be possible and had I joined this MOOC with teammates who are actually involved in the teaching of my module alongside me, this could have been more productive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that, the best unexpected outcome was making a friend in Helen Crump and in actually meeting up with her face to face one splendid afternoon. Had I joined this MOOC with a team, such serendipity would not have been possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would have liked to have undertaken the evaluation of a learning design last week. Evaluation and reflection are two things I champion. However, work priorities at the moment include the National Student Survey, Peer Observations, Module Evaluation Questionnaires and a Course Approval and Review process across our whole School , so on top of the packing, &nbsp;I probably felt a bit evaluated-out</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>What did you learn? What advice could you give others?</em></p>
<p>I do feel I have learned something about learning design and in particular I found the course features exercise in week 3 really useful. I think this is something I would take forward to use with my own team - and an opportunity is about to arise as we are planning an overhaul of how we teach research skills across all three years of our course.</p>
<p>Some activites were less useful for me, but that's OK. My advice to anyone undertaking a MOOC is not to stress about it (as my students would say). Do what you can, when you can. And have a partner to share the fun along the way. At times, the only reason I completed activities was because I didn't want to let Helen down. At other times, the only way I managed to do them at all was because she led the way. And sometimes, I got inspired and facilitated her.</p>
<p>Oh - and a final word: don't let badge envy ruin your day :)</p>    </div>
