<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; BBC; Ian Blackham; Peter Horrocks; Wonkhe; Ian Blackham; The Guardian]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36294200" rel="nofollow">HE White Paper</a>, Success as a Knowledge Economy, was published this morning.&nbsp; Its aims include encouraging a wider range of new HEIs by speeding up the process allowing them to award their own degrees.&nbsp; As expected English universities will be able to increase tuition fees above &pound;9,000 from autumn 2017, if they have high-quality teaching.&nbsp; There will be a new watchdog, the Office for Students and there will also be encouragement for universities to admit students from a wider range of social backgrounds.&nbsp; >Wonkhe</a> has live updates and commentary.</p>
<p>HEPI&rsquo;s Nick Hillman is concerned that the Home Office is now &ldquo;a back door regulator of higher education&rdquo; as news emerges that Theresa May has concerns about <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/white-paper-could-kill-hefce-quality-plans" rel="nofollow">HEFCE plans to contract out work currently undertaken by the QAA</a> in separate tenders that would mean the break-up of the UK-wide quality system.&nbsp; She is thought to fear that this could lead to weakening of the oversight of institutions&rsquo; fitness to act as sponsors for overseas students, a process currently undertaken by the QAA.</p>
<p>NUS members have spotted that high TEF scores are likely to lead to higher tuition fees.&nbsp; But some of those <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/20/students-vote-to-sabotage-plans-to-rate-teaching-in-universities" rel="nofollow">TEF scores rely on student feedback</a>, so they&rsquo;ve voted to boycott both the National Student Survey (NSS) and the Destination of Leavers from higher education survey (DLHE) unless the government withdraws its planned reforms.</p>
<p>HESA&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.hesa.ac.uk/pr233" rel="nofollow">Finances of Higher Education Providers 2014/15</a> gives a breakdown of &pound;31bn expenditure of UK HE sector by country and department.&nbsp; The largest category, not surprisingly, was academic departments at &pound;11.8bn (38.0%), followed by admin/central services (&pound;5.2bn, 16.5%) and research grants (&pound;4.5bn, 14.4%).&nbsp; And the most expensive faculties were medicine, dentistry and health (&pound;2.7bn, 8.7%).&nbsp; The largest source of income is tuition fees and education contracts (&pound;15.6bn, 46.9%).</p>
<p>According to HEPI, the &pound;3bn-a-year <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/apprenticeship-levy-could-worsen-part-time-degree-crisis" rel="nofollow">apprenticeship levy</a> on larger firms should be extended to cover employer-sponsored degrees, otherwise universities risk losing students as companies respond to the levy by cutting degree spending.&nbsp; Last month&rsquo;s report claims that sponsored degrees offer &ldquo;excellent value for money to taxpayers, who pay much less of the cost [than for traditional degrees], and students, who can emerge with no debt&rdquo;.&nbsp; It also notes criticisms of some apprenticeship provision, including from Ofsted&rsquo;s Sir Michael Wilshaw, who said that &ldquo;employers and providers involved in poor quality, low-level apprenticeships are wasting public funds&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; MindShift; Ryerson Social Media Lab; Stephen Downes; Audrey Watters; EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>A study by researchers from the University of Washington based on surveys of 1,400 MOOC users and 2,250 non-users aged 18&ndash;35 in Colombia, the Philippines and South Africa, found that learner demographics, MOOC use and <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160414211758202" rel="nofollow">dropout rates are very different to those in the developed world</a>.&nbsp; Some the key findings of the research include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Around 80% of MOOC users come from low- and middle-income populations and have only basic or intermediate level ICT skills; less than half had completed college</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Main motivations were gaining specific job skills (61%), preparing for additional education (39%) and obtaining professional certification (37%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among non-users, lack of time (50%) was by far the largest barrier, although lack of computer access (4%) or skills (2%) were NOT found to be barriers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>49% of MOOC users received certification and a further 30% completed their course</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Women are more likely than men to complete a MOOC or obtain certification.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MindShift wonders if lack of support is a factor in dropout rates, particularly for less experienced or motivated learners, in which case <a href="http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2016/04/25/online-learning-why-libraries-could-be-the-key-to-moocs-success/" rel="nofollow">Learning Circles</a> might offer a solution. A pilot between librarians at Chicago Public Library and Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) saw groups of learners brought together in person to take an online course together over six to eight weeks, with the help of a librarian facilitator.&nbsp; The librarian was <em>not</em> a subject matter expert but had facilitation skills to help the learners help themselves and to guide them through the various resources and tools the library had to offer.&nbsp; Some 65% of learners had never taken an online course before, but retention rates of around 45&ndash;55% were achieved.</p>
<p>North American researchers examined <a href="http://socialmedialab.ca/2016/linking-online-identities-content-connectivist-moocs-across-multiple-social-media-platforms/" rel="nofollow">how multiple social media platforms are being used for formal and informal learning</a> based on data from two connectivist MOOCs (cMOOCs).&nbsp; Their aim was to develop and evaluate methods for analytics to detect and study collaborative learning processes by trying to link multiple online identities and their contributions across several platforms. &nbsp;However, they found that the majority of users posted via just two platforms, with Twitter the most popular (mainly for discussions), followed by blogging (more for notes and reflection) and 74% used the same username on both.</p>
<p>A separate study compared <a href="http://www.educationnews.org/online-schools/facebook-course-pages-groups-can-increase-mooc-engagement/" rel="nofollow">MOOC student use of Facebook groups</a> with use of the MOOCs&rsquo; native course message boards and forums.&nbsp; Researchers found greater levels of engagement on, and preference for, the Facebook groups, and they speculated that students can create fake personas on course message boards and forums whereas they tend to sign up with their real names on Facebook.&nbsp; &ldquo;Real names give other students the idea that they are talking to a real person and that, perhaps, helps build a sense of community and they trust that type of environment more&rdquo;.&nbsp; Facebook also offers several ways to contact the professor; they can reply to a post, like a post, and even send a private message.</p>

<p><strong>We Process Information Differently When Presented Electronically and on Paper</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>We hear anecdotally how students feel about print versus on-screen content, but what does the science tell us?&nbsp; Researchers investigated cognitive construal through experiments with randomised groups who studied using either a tablet/laptop or printed materials.&nbsp; They found the >digital students exhibited a lower level of construal</a>, prioritising immediate, concrete details over abstract, decontextualised interpretations. &nbsp;This pattern emerged both in their greater preference for concrete versus abstract descriptions of behaviours as well as superior performance on detail-focused items (and inferior performance on inference-focused items) on a reading comprehension assessment. &nbsp;Further studies found that the likelihood of correctly solving a problem-solving task requiring higher-level "gist" processing was: (1) higher for participants who processed information for the task in print and (2) heightened for digital participants who had first completed an activity activating an abstract mind set, compared to (equivalent) performance levels exhibited by participants who had either completed no prior activity or completed an activity activating a concrete mind set.</p>

<p>And just to prove that football is a game of three halves, here&rsquo;s news that >Tottenham Hotspur and Highgate School</a> (fees &pound;18,705 per year) are proposing a state sixth form in north London.&nbsp; Spurs will be the main financial sponsor and provide premises for the free school, planned for September 2017, while Highgate School will provide staff and educational expertise.&nbsp; Rumours that Harry Redknapp will be Head of English remain unconfirmed.</p>
