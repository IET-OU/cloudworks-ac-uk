        <h3 id="sites-page-title-header" align="left">"Healthy Eating" in Web Collage</h3>
<p>I was initially interested in reviewing this representation due to the Design Patterns component within CLFPs (Collaborative Learning Flow Patterns). &nbsp;I experienced Design Patterns last year on H817 and could see how CLFPs such as 'Jigsaw', 'Brainstorming' and 'Think Pair Share' could be used to easily describe a pattern of activity. &nbsp;For example, if we said we were taking a 'Jigsaw' approach to learning, to me it would produce a mental image of students working in groups on different tasks, culminating in bringing all of the groups' work together in the style of a jigsaw to reveal the final product. &nbsp;On looking at the graphic representation produced by the Web Collage tool, I found it difficult to understand what was being represented. &nbsp;I couldn't easily spot any visual references to the CLFPs and Design Patterns that had drawn me to this tool in the first place. &nbsp;The icons and arrows looked clumsily drawn and there was a lot of visual noise in the diagram. &nbsp;I can see that there is an element of inclusion of assessment here but it is stated that this is currenlty in the early stages of development and again seems to be limited in its flexibility. &nbsp;One of the benefits of a visual representation is that it can more easily display information as opposed to reading lengthy text. &nbsp;In the case of Web Collage, I found the text explanation more understandable in this example.</p>
<h3 id="sites-page-title-header" align="left">"Healthy Eating" as a 4SPPIces Model and in LdShake</h3>
<h3 id="sites-page-title-header" align="left">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The 4SPPIces Model is based upon producing&nbsp;Computer Supported Collaborative Blended Learning (CSCBL) scripts which are used to collaboratively design blended learning solutions. &nbsp;There are 4 elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pedagogical Method</li>
<li>Participants</li>
<li>Space</li>
<li>History</li>
</ol>
<p>These elements are drawn as quarters of a circular graphic representing the overall design. &nbsp; In contrast to the Web Collage I found that this provided an easy 'at a glance' summary of the different components of the design - almost a 'what, when, who, where' kind of explanation. &nbsp;The History section was used to communicate to other tutors the many variables to look out for and manage at different stages. &nbsp;This didn't feel prescriptive to me but more of a 'heads up' guidance. &nbsp;In part this also reminded me of my lesson planning when working in FE as our template had sections to hold information such as materials, technology required, group details and of course learning activities.</p>
<p>The simple interface appealed as it looked as if it would be intuitive to use. &nbsp;The icons were very similar to many available software applications so there would be minimal time spent in learning how to navigate the tool. &nbsp;The tabs at the bottom of the screen were clearly labelled and easy to access. &nbsp;This wasn't clarified but my current expectation is that additional detail for each of the elements would be available within the tabs.</p>
<p>Base upon this review I can see how the 4SPPIces Model could be integrated more easily than the Web Collage tool.&nbsp;</p>
