        <p>Bill Law<br />www.hihohiho.com</p>
<p>Talking is more than just communication; and that means more than the sort of thing that, done well, recruiters look for in employability.&nbsp; Language is how <em>homo sapiens&rsquo;</em> makes useful sense of things.&nbsp; We need language to sort out our experience of work; and we sometimes do that in terms that employers don&rsquo;t much like - think of whistle-blowers.&nbsp; Words frame what we believe, and what we mean to do about it. Walking-the-walk is more dependent on talking-the-talk than some people realise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big difference here between what powerful interests urge and what reality requires.&nbsp; And so, taking on board how people talk to each other about career raises challenges to conventional careers-work thinking.&nbsp; The most troublesome of these challenges is for understanding the way people are prepared to converse with us - or are not.</p>
<p>Conversations are conducted at any number of different levels - we...</p>
<p align="center">&gt; chat &lt; &gt; organise &lt; &gt; figure-out &lt;...<br />...&gt; disclose &lt; &gt;&nbsp; question &lt; &gt;&nbsp; check &lt;...<br />...&gt; review &lt; &gt;&nbsp; accept &lt; &gt;&nbsp; decline &lt;</p>
<p>A careers conversation may be carried along on any part of that stream.&nbsp; It runs from the day-to-day arrangements that people need to get on with things, to the purposes that make it worth bothering.&nbsp; Such talk moves between &lsquo;what&rsquo;s happening?&rsquo; and &lsquo;what does it mean?&rsquo;.&nbsp; Both states-of-mind have critical practical value - on the savannah, on the street, on the net... and in the interview.&nbsp; The way people talk is part of their chances in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>looking for what&rsquo;s happening</strong></p>
<p>We all talk about what&rsquo;s going on, for example by asking...</p>
<p align="center"><em>where and when?<br />are we okay with this?<br />do we go with it?<br />is it still on?<br />what&rsquo;s next?</em></p>
<p>There&lsquo;s a here-and-now feel about it - concrete and practical.&nbsp; It can also have a now-or-never urgency - do it or lose the chance.&nbsp; But the facts can be easy-enough to check, and the responses not-too-troublesome to agree - or disagree.&nbsp; It can be impulsive.&nbsp; It can also convey a sense that people know each other well enough to readily understand the shorthand.&nbsp; That valuing of no-nonsense immediacy features in contemporary culture: it informs cut-to-the-chase popular narratives; advertisers pretend to it&rsquo;s familiarity; politicos posture its style.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s sentences are short - saying one thing at a time; people take pride in speaking so plainly.&nbsp; And to fail to do likewise may mean losing their interest.&nbsp; Happening-talk can mean that the next thing done corresponds with the last thing said.&nbsp; If that makes things random, impulsive and chaotic, then that&rsquo;s how things are.</p>
<p>Purposeful action can hang on such tangible and immediate pay-offs - for example about wages and social life.&nbsp; It would be overly controlling to assume that no career conversation should be like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>looking for meaning </strong></p>
<p>But careers workers look deeper.&nbsp; And finding meaning in what&rsquo;s happening is more demanding, for example by wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>does this make any sense?<br />why do I need to know?<br />who else has an interest?<br />where would that take me?<br />what makes it such a good idea?</em></p>
<p>Ascribing meaning starts with such puzzlement - even acknowledging that there could be more than one thing going on.&nbsp; It needs to take this one thing with that other thing.&nbsp; If there's to be meaning, then the chaos needs sorting out.&nbsp; Other points-of-view need acknowledging - and that can mean wondering about people we haven&rsquo;t met yet, with their different perspectives.&nbsp; Sentences get longer - loaded with contingent clauses.&nbsp; It may all need qualifying adjectives, and elaborating adverbs - and parentheses.&nbsp; And if any state-of-mind is being described, there could be abstractions - needing the <em>&lsquo;as if...</em>&rsquo; talk of metaphors.&nbsp; So people might need to hesitate..., interrupt themselves..., stand back..., try again - this conversation is a journey, not a race.&nbsp; Talk like this is needed when people need to get to know each other.&nbsp; But not everyone is comfortable with it - some deliberately avoid it.&nbsp; So it may remain an inner conversation - a soliloquy - which is probably how it started anyway. &nbsp;In any event, the meaning we attribute is personally wrought - for each our own.&nbsp; And so, in such talk, we become disclosing and vulnerable - which means that trust and confidence are important.&nbsp; For some people ridicule can be a killer... one way or another.&nbsp; But some people thrive on such talk, and seek it - their dinner parties are at least as much for talk as for food.&nbsp; Some guests may not be used to it - they get tongue-tied, or blurt things out in a way that others find inappropriate.</p>
<p>That can also happen in careers talk.&nbsp; But the bigger problems is that timed-and-targeted provision struggles to accommodate it.&nbsp; So the tongue-tied get lost.&nbsp; This is important: talking about what&rsquo;s going on, and whether and what meaning it has, are the run-up to deciding what to do about it.&nbsp; Talk, meaning and purpose shape a narrative - and a narrative moves on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A selection interview is also where people need to get to know each other.&nbsp; And recruiters are alert to the differing narratives, and how they might seem to move on.&nbsp; Each story comes across differently in different selection settings.&nbsp; A few will seem to the recruiter to offer a better fit to the work.&nbsp; But that short-listing may operate at a half-aware level - more like personal recognition than an explicitly worked-through process of criteria matching.</p>
<p>All of this means that different kinds of talk get recognised as welcome in different selection situations.&nbsp; And there are other talk-related influences on selection: accent, articulation and modulation all make recruiters more comfortable with candidates - or less.&nbsp; The overall effect is stratifying: the kind of talk gets the kind of job.&nbsp; None of this has anything necessarily to do with achievement or potential; it has to do with how applicants have become used to talking.</p>
<p>There was a time when this would have suggested remedial work, which might include elocution lessons.&nbsp; But that attributes the problem to the psychologised individual rather than to her or his socialising experience.&nbsp; Which may be why it doesn&rsquo;t work for our Eliza Doolittles and our Lenny Henrys.&nbsp; Contemporary careers work needs a wider understanding of what happens in the conversations we engage with clients and students.&nbsp; Evidence on credibility shows that people are more willing to turn to us for help with immediate and tangible action.&nbsp; But, when it comes to probing for meaning, they turn to the trust they invest in each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the issue: is there anything in our radically-changing situation which offers opportunities to reposition ourselves as trusted and trusting? - we would be helpers worth investing in.&nbsp; Our responses to the issue would call on how we see careers work - in relation to guidance and education, to markets and social enterprise, to public service and privatisation (Law, 2011).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a challenge to our innovatory re-thinking. &nbsp;And a pretty urgent one.</p>
<p><strong>note:</strong>&nbsp; I owe these thoughts to the widely influential work of Basil Bernstein (1965) and Denis Lawton (1968) - both developing ideas for the usefulness of &lsquo;elaborated&rsquo; and &lsquo;restricted&rsquo; language codes.&nbsp; Their work still attracts attention (Young-Spring, 2002).&nbsp; Here, I&rsquo;ve tried to expand interpretations of the original work by drawing on recent social science, and re-applying it to contemporary conditions.</p>
