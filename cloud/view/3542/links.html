        <p><strong>How is it possible to identify a set of concepts to explain something as complex as classroom practice?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Initial exploration of the UK and international literature on pedagogy and teaching methods was not very successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;huge but disparate collection of &lsquo;big ideas&rsquo; about teaching and learning in classrooms was found. Practitioners were extensively consulted&nbsp;through the GTCE Networks and elsewhere. Various research studies of teacher thinking and discourse were reviewed and ideas were collected, presented and discussed at international academic events. To begin with then, we had a complex mass of words used when talking about pedagogy &ndash; many of which also embraced issues in curriculum and assessment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initial attempts to analyse this collection were not very productive. However, a breakthrough came when we focused on the relatively stable set of concepts which are often used to discuss curriculum design &ndash; for example, breadth, balance, relevance, differentiation, progression. Interestingly, these were all promoted in a 1985 HMI publication, <em>The Curriculum from 5 to 16</em>. How had they stood the test of time so well? Could they be related to contemporary vocabulary on pedagogy and assessment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patterns began to emerge. In particular, there seemed to be a number of enduring educational issues to which these long-lasting concepts relate &ndash; those concerning the <strong>aims, contexts, processes </strong>and<strong> outcomes </strong>of education. We felt this was an important insight, because it began to describe the &lsquo;epistemological work&rsquo; (contribution to knowledge) which such concepts must carry out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Commentary is thus based on the idea that concepts concerning <strong>curriculum, pedagogy </strong>and<strong> assessment</strong> can be organised through the &lsquo;work&rsquo; which they do in enabling discussion and understanding of enduring classroom issues. Perhaps, we reasoned, making this logic explicit could enable progress towards a more robust and sustainable conceptual framework for the professional expertise of teaching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conceptual framework may seem daunting at first because it attempts to represent teacher expertise in a holistic way &ndash; and we know that this is complex and multi-faceted. To simplify, our argument is that, in one way or another, teachers inevitably face issues concerning <strong>educational</strong> <strong>aims, learning contexts, classroom processes </strong>and<strong> learning outcomes </strong>(the rows) and they do so in relation to <strong>curriculum, pedagogy </strong>and<strong> assessment </strong>(the columns).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The questions in each cell demonstrate the high levels of reflective expertise which teachers need and, as we have seen, this calls for evidence-informed professional judgement. However, the educative insight of the concepts which are used to think about and discuss such evidence is also absolutely vital. Without such analytic capacity, neither classroom enquiry nor discussion with colleagues will build sustainable professional understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is one further assumption behind the way this representation of conceptual tools has been developed which I need to make explicit &ndash; that we are concerned with the provision of some form of &lsquo;good education&rsquo;. In other words, the ideas in this Commentary are informed by particular educational values and by available evidence about &lsquo;good education&rsquo;. The specific meaning and usage of the identified concepts can thus certainly be challenged. The framework is tentative and it could, and perhaps should, be compiled and re-presented in different ways. The task is difficult &ndash; and this very fact confirms the contested nature of education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The columns of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment are an important way of reviewing the framework, but it is also worthwhile to think of the rows &ndash; as is done in the remainder of the Commentary &ndash; or to explore interconnections between cells, and across the conceptual framework. <em>The framework is simply a tool for thinking and for discussion, to be used as readers see fit.</em></p>    </div>
