        <p><strong>OU Annual Conference</strong></p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s annual OU annual conference - Learning in the Open World - is being held entirely online on <strong>22 &amp; 23 Jun</strong>.&nbsp; We hope this will make it easier for people to &lsquo;attend&rsquo; specific sessions, particularly those based outside Walton Hall for whom distance may have been an issue in previous years.&nbsp; We also hope to encourage some staff to dip a first toe in the water of online collaboration and communication tools such as Elluminate.&nbsp; To find out more, your first port of call should be the <a href="/cloudscape/view/2012" rel="nofollow">conference Cloudworks page</a>, where you can register your interest by clicking the 'Mark as attending' button.&nbsp; More detailed conference information will follow over the coming month.</p>

<p><strong>eLearning Exemplars</strong></p>
<p>I have a list of eLearning exemplars and demos that I&rsquo;ve tended lovingly over the years and which comes in handy on eLearning design workshops or discussions around new and updated materials.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve smartened it up and offer it here as an Excel spreadsheet, containing links to over 100 <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/lts/production/download/documents/eLearning-Exemplars.xls" rel="nofollow">eLearning exemplars</a> [only accessible to OU staff] which can be sorted by topic, genre and development tool.&nbsp; All are aimed at adult learners and none should require downloading, installing or registration.&nbsp; There is deliberately a mix of quality levels (it&rsquo;s sometimes useful to see an example of what we don&rsquo;t want) but I have not attempted to score them &ndash; because any rating would vary according to the criterion used (e.g. pedagogy, usability, interactivity, etc).&nbsp; Any feedback and suggestions would be welcome.</p>

<p><strong>HTML 5 </strong></p>
<p>Who needs PowerPoint?&nbsp; This good example of a <a href="http://apirocks.com/html5/html5.html#slide1" rel="nofollow">multimedia slideshow about HTML 5</a>, developed using HTML 5 is worth a look, but don&rsquo;t waste your time using Internet Explorer (at least, not until <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/30/microsoft-html5" rel="nofollow">IE9</a> appears) &ndash; Chrome or Firefox are safer bets.&nbsp; Need more convincing?&nbsp; Try Doug McInnes&rsquo; <a href="http://dougmcinnes.com/html-5-asteroids/" rel="nofollow">Asteroids game</a>, written entirely in HTML 5.</p>

<p>Upside Learning's Yogesh Agarwal asks, <a href="http://www.upsidelearning.com/blog/index.php/2010/05/05/is-html5-ready-for-elearning-development/" rel="nofollow">is HTML5 ready for eLearning development?</a> &nbsp;In particular, is it able to deliver the goods on non-Flash mobile devices?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Collaborative document company <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/05/scribd-html5" rel="nofollow">Scribd</a> has taken the plunge and started last week to convert all documents from Flash to HTML5.&nbsp; Scribd&rsquo;s Jared Friedman says, &ldquo;We are scrapping three years of Flash development and betting the company on HTML5 because we believe HTML5 is a dramatically better reading experience than Flash.&nbsp; Now any document can become a Web page.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Open Educational Resources</strong></p>
<p>The OPAL project is an international network to promote innovation and better quality in education and training through the use of open educational resources.&nbsp; Gr&aacute;inne Conole is leading OU activities and she and her team would welcome your input &ndash; via their <a href="/cloudscape/view/2087" rel="nofollow">Cloudworks page</a> &ndash; on the work they&rsquo;ve done so far.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2010-04-28-ihe-online-courses_N.htm" rel="nofollow">USA Today</a> reports that Pres Obama's planned $500m to create free online courses never materialized, but National Repository for Online Courses (NROC) director Gary Lopez says its membership is increasing as many US colleges experience enrolment booms beyond their physical capacity.&nbsp; The article also takes a closer look at the real costs of &lsquo;free&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Interesting 15-min TED<sup>x</sup>NYED talk from Brigham Young&rsquo;s Prof David Wiley about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb0syrgsH6M" rel="nofollow">openness in education</a>, in which he argues that knowledge should be treated as non-competitive, &ldquo;I can give some of my expertise to you without giving it away&rdquo;.&nbsp; He also contends that, in a digital online world, we&rsquo;ve never been in a better position to do this.</p>

<p><strong>Moodle Modules</strong></p>
<p>UK supplier, Epic, presents its list of <a href="http://www.epic.co.uk/blog/5-top-open-source-moodle-modules.html" rel="nofollow">five top Moodle modules</a>, including the Open University Wiki (plus a &lsquo;highly commended&rsquo; for the OU search block).&nbsp; They also link to Moodle partner HRDNZ&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.elearning.school.nz/index.php" rel="nofollow">non-standard Moodle site</a> which includes modules offering a range of functionality from Accessibility (font/colour settings, which I found a bit flaky in IE) through to a Wikipedia block.</p>
<p>[Epic]</p>
<p>A survey by the US eLearning Guild has shown <a href="http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/111/" rel="nofollow">Moodle to be the most popular LMS/VLE</a> for the second year running, followed by Blackboard.&nbsp; Desire2Learn and Sakai, both about to be included in a <a href="https://in-tendhost.co.uk/openuniversity/" rel="nofollow">learning platform study for the OU</a>, don&rsquo;t make the listing.</p>
<p>[JE]</p>
<p>Wrexham Local Authority has rolled out a Moodle-based <a href="http://www.wrexham14to19.net/" rel="nofollow">Wrexham 14-19 eLearning Portal</a>, linking 10 secondary schools and other local organisations.&nbsp; A spokesperson said, &ldquo;Mae&rsquo;r porth yn cynnal nifer o fforymau a chylchoedd trafod i gefnogi rhannu arferion da ac yn rhoi mynediad at ystod o adnoddau dysgu ac addysgu.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>US Students Take Longer to Gain Degrees</strong></p>
<p>A report from the US National Bureau of Economic Research has found that the <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w15892" rel="nofollow">time taken to achieve a BA degree has increased</a> from a mean of 4.69 years in 1972 to 4.97 years in 1992.&nbsp; Looking at non-top-50 universities, the mean time to graduate is 5.08 years, with only 34.7% achieving a BA within four years.&nbsp; The report attributes this not to students&rsquo; abilities or the quality of their schooling, but more to worsening staff:student ratios and the need for students to conduct paid work alongside their studies in order to cover tuition and living costs.</p>
<p>[Tony Bates]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100507211002996" rel="nofollow">Separate research</a> by professors Philip Babcock and Mindy Marks found US students in 1961 spent an average of 40 hours per week on academic work but, by 2003, that had fallen to just 27 hours.&nbsp; Marks believes there may be two factors influencing this: first, professors want more time for research so they set less work; second, students give better course evaluations to easier courses.</p>

<p><strong>iProf</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.expresscomputeronline.com/20100419/news05.shtml" rel="nofollow">iProf</a> is India&rsquo;s first personal education tablet.&nbsp; The &pound;220 Android device has a 7&rdquo; touch screen and comes bundled with content from &lsquo;premier educational institutes&rsquo;.&nbsp; Learners will be supported by a chain of 30 iStudy Zones in cities across India, with a planned increase to 250 cities within 18 months.&nbsp; The company hopes to address three major problems that plague e-learning from spreading namely low computer penetration, content piracy and broadband connectivity. Also, there is an acute shortage of good quality professors. &ldquo;We have created an infrastructural solution which is easily scalable, enabling access to high quality education that solves all the issues,&rdquo; said Sanjay Purohit, Founder and CEO, iProf Learning Solutions India.</p>

<p><strong>Udemy</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.udemy.com/" rel="nofollow">Udemy</a> is &ldquo;a website that enables anyone to create an online course&rdquo; - a claim guaranteed to make my heart sink at the thought of talentless hoards demonstrating their talentlessness to the world.&nbsp; However, the site looks promising, and includes material from Stanford, Berkeley, MIT and Yale.&nbsp; It also provides a live virtual classroom, where instructors can host a live video conference with students using Udemy&rsquo;s proprietary live video technology which includes a whiteboard, presentation viewer, chatroom, and file-sharing component. &nbsp;Over 10 videos can stream on Udemy Live and 1000+ users can watch a session.&nbsp; This could be the crucial differentiator between Udemy and the numerous other educational video sites.</p>

<p><strong>Teens and Mobile Phones</strong></p>
<p>According to this latest <a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Teens-and-Mobile-Phones.aspx?r=1" rel="nofollow">Pew Internet report</a>, 75% of US 12-17 year-olds now own cell phones, up from 45% in 2004, and 88% of teen cell phone users are text-messagers.&nbsp; 54% of teens are daily texters, with a third sending more than 100 messages per day and girls texting much more than boys.&nbsp; Of those who own smartphones:</p>
<ul>
<li>31% exchange instant messages on their phones </li>
<li>27% go online for general purposes </li>
<li>23% access social network sites </li>
<li>21% use email </li>
<li>11% purchase things online</li>
</ul>
<p>[TechCrunch]</p>
<p>And a study by the University of Maryland suggests that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2010/04/23/technology/tech-us-internet-addicts-life.html" rel="nofollow">US students are hooked on cellphones, social media and the Internet</a> and showing symptoms similar to drug and alcohol addictions.&nbsp; 200 students were asked to give up all media for one full day and, after 24 hours, many showed signs of withdrawal, craving and anxiety along with an inability to function well without their media and social links.</p>

<p>Researchers in Ohio looked at 2,000 students enrolling in 14 psychology courses across the state who were given the option of purchasing a print copy of their textbook for $134 or an e-text version for $50.&nbsp; They found 22% purchased the e-text &ndash; some for economic reasons, but 41% of these reported <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2010/04/22/u-cincinnati-and-ohiolink-research-digital-textbook-adoption.aspx" rel="nofollow">preferring a digital textbook to the printed version</a>.&nbsp; Traditional-aged college students were 1.73 times more likely to purchase the electronic text than students 24 years or older.</p>

<p>Google will launch its <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/10098111.stm" rel="nofollow">Editions</a> eBook store later this year.&nbsp; Unlike competitors such as iBooks and Amazon, Editions books will not be tied to a specific platform.&nbsp; Google also has a larger inventory, currently exceeding 12m digital books.</p>
<p>[BBC]</p>
<p>And a report by the <a href="http://www.rin.ac.uk/challenges-for-libraries" rel="nofollow">Research Information Network</a> (RIN) concludes that budget cuts are going to keep squeezing libraries, with eBooks likely to be the only long term winners.</p>

<p><strong>iPad Usability</strong></p>
<p>Jakob Nielsen has reviewed <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/ipad.html" rel="nofollow">iPad usability</a>, concluding that &ldquo;iPad apps are inconsistent and have low feature discoverability, with frequent user errors due to accidental gestures. An overly strong print metaphor and weird interaction styles cause further usability problems&rdquo;.&nbsp; A 93 page report is available for free download.</p>

<p><strong>eLearning Books</strong></p>
<p>Tony Bates reviews a new book, <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2010/04/19/preliminary-book-review-an-introduction-to-distance-education/" rel="nofollow">An Introduction to Distance Education: Understanding Teaching and Learning in a New Era</a>, which he describes as &ldquo;a collection of essays by mainly Canadian authors, although there are also authors from the USA, Australia, New Zealand and Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Tony Bates]</p>
<p>And, from former New York Times journalist Anya Kamenetz, comes a new book called <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100416162300997" rel="nofollow">DIYU: Edupunks, Edupreneurs, and the Coming Transformation of Higher Education</a>, in which she argues that in the age of constant connectedness and social media, it's time for the monolithic, millennium-old, ivy-covered walls of universities to undergo a phase change into something much lighter, more permeable and fluid.</p>
<p>[University World News]</p>
<p>Closer to home is Janet Macdonald and <strong>Linda Creanor</strong>&rsquo;s new book on <a href="http://www.gowerpublishing.com/isbn/9780566089305" rel="nofollow">Learning with online and mobile technologies</a> which is, Janet assures me, exceptional value at under &pound;15.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Design</strong></p>
<p>Did IMS LD fail to transform your life?&nbsp; Guillaume Durand is proposing <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/community/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=60&threadid=358&enterthread=y" rel="nofollow">Simple Learning Design</a> (SLD) as an add-on for the IMS Common Cartridge (CC) specification.&nbsp; <a href="http://zope.cetis.ac.uk/members/scott/blogview?entry=20100422130555" rel="nofollow">Scott Wilson</a> thinks Durand hasn&rsquo;t got it quite right, retaining things from LD that should have been discarded (e.g. conditional branching) and leaving out things that would have been useful (e.g. small groups, as opposed to individual students or the whole cohort).</p>
