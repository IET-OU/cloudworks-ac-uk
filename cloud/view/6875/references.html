<p>Some of the things I'd like to follow-up anyway and find out more about are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design Patterns - I'm familiar with these froma software engineering perspective but will be interested to hear about learning design patterns</li>
<li>Notations for Learning design both for sharing designs and formalizing designs. &nbsp;Again I know quite a bit about notations for documenting and designing software so will be interested in comparing approaches.</li>

			<h2><strong>Reflection on Week 1</strong></h2>
<h3>Progress against my learning objectives for the week</h3>
<p>I have managed to find my way around cloudworks (created clouds and cloudscapes, added clouds to cloudscapes, looked at cloudscaope permissions, contributed to discussion). &nbsp;Spent ages wondering why I couldn't search for a cloud/cloudscape and eventually emailed cloudworks HQ to be told that the search facility had been disabled because it was causing problems.</p>
<p>Have I managed to explore any of the other tools that are new to me? &nbsp;Not very much. &nbsp;Did skip through a video in a Google Hangout so maybe that counts. &nbsp;Tweeted a bit but then I'm already familiar with Twitter.</p>
<p>I did identify a learning design problem that I could work on and added to the Dreambazzar. &nbsp;Nocomments and no offers of help. &nbsp;Maybe I didn't articulate it well enough or it is just not something that is of interest to many other people.</p>
<h3>Progress against the official learning outcomes for the week</h3>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Identify specific topics of interest for further exploration</div>
<p>
<p>1. Explore a variety of definitions of learning design</p>
<p>Watched the Intro video and felt &nbsp;excited about the idea. &nbsp;Thought about learning design and read people's comments in Google Forum mainly. &nbsp;Tried to explain to several colleagues my understanding of learning design but it came out pretty lame and I would struggle to distinguish it from general good practice in designing educational experiences and resources. &nbsp;Maybe coming from a computing background the idea of requirements analysis, prototyping, design, testing, evaluation etc are very familiar in any case and this just feels like applying those teachniques to create educational artefacts.</p>
<p>2. Initiate own learning/curriculum design project</p>
<p>As I mentioned above I did write about a proposed project but got no interest. &nbsp;Have more-or-less decided to abandon my project and work on Anne Fox's "Concurrent Design Framework for eLearning in IT Entrepreneurship" project.</p>
<p>3. Define learning design, as a field of research and a practice</p>
<p>Erg - no I wouldn't say I could do that - at least not distinguish it from other forms of education research and practice.</p>
<p>4. Identify some of the grand challenges of using a learning design approach to the design of learning in the 21st Century</p>
<p>Well as Yishay said in the introduction a big challenge is to develop notations to allow us to describe designs and communicate them both to other people and to automated tools which may be used to realise the designs. &nbsp;This interests me &nbsp;because there has been a huge amount of research and practical experience over the years from my field, software engineering, into notations to communicate and document design. &nbsp;There must be much scope for convergence between the fields.</p>
<p>I would see another challenge as coping with the rate of technology-led change. &nbsp;The technological environment is changing incredibly quickly (social media, mobile devices, increased band-width etc) and we don't want to always be playing catch up. &nbsp;On the other hand we do want to make use of the opportunities that technology bring and to engage (especially young) people. &nbsp;It's a balancing act.</p>
<p>5. Identify specific topics of interest for further exploration</p>
<p>Interested to follow-up more on design patterns and notations for describing learning designs.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Keep going. &nbsp;Time's an issue but plan to try to hand on in there.</p>
<p>Reconnect with my Greenwich colleagues - maybe become part of a local study circle if we can work out how/when to meet.</p>
<p>See if/how we can take the&nbsp;"Concurrent Design Framework for eLearning in IT Entrepreneurship" project forward.</p>

			<h2>Ok - here we go week 2</h2>
<p>I've viewed the 3 min intro and gone through the material about scenarios on slideshare at&nbsp;http://www.slideshare.net/joshuau/scenario-based-contextual-learning-design</p>
<p>Again struck by the similarities (obviously not just coincidental) between the approaches advocated here and those used in IT and software engineering to analyse user requirements. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Plans/Objectives for the week</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop some scenarios for my dream project (i.e. the support for learners working towards industry certifications http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7034). &nbsp;Was thinking of abandoning this but think there is some value in taking it forward for a while at least.</li>
<li>Evaluate above - just myself unless I can lure some others into giving me feedback.</li>
<li>Give feedback to at least one other person.</li>
<li>Try to move forward on the Code-flite project (http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7050) - not sure where we are with this. &nbsp;Very dependent on the proposer as she understands it and maybe she doesn't have enough time available to be able to brief the rest of us and pull it all together. &nbsp;We need a session to discuss and break down into manageable chuncks.</li>
<li>Become part of study circle at Greenwich</li>

			<p>Have started writing scenarios. &nbsp;Useful but starts to get a bit convoluted. &nbsp;Lots to think about. &nbsp;Danger of making assumptions about the finished "system" too early. &nbsp;How to know if the scenarios are realistic (lots of implicit assumptions about people, their goals, motivations etc). &nbsp;Have started reading about Personas (http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/personas.html). &nbsp;Seems like a good idea to define some of these first rather than just as embedded within a scenario. &nbsp;As ever though, what starts off seeming like a simple idea has lots of subtleties and ramifications. &nbsp;Never mind - for now just keep going.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
