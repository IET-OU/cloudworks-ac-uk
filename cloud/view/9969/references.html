<p>There's a lot to disagree about in education.&nbsp; And there are constant re-alignments of who stands for what in that mix.&nbsp; This blog examines a new one.<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ISSUES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Education raises as many issues as any field of social policy.&nbsp; A load of questions each get a gamut of answers...<br /><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>THE LOAD &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THE GAMUT</strong></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>priorities</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...from competitiveness...<em>to</em> well-being</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>teaching</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...from meeting targets...<em>to</em> earning trust</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>methods</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...from damping down...<em>to</em> firing up</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>outcomes</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...from acquired content...<em>to</em> critical thinking</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>interests</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...from shareholders...<em>to</em> stakeholders</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>transfer</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...from up-scalable...<em>to</em> locally relevant</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>institutions</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...from controlling...<em>to</em> enabling</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>strategy</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...from learning to score...<em>to</em> learning to learn</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>serving</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...from individual success...<em>to</em> social needs</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>presentation</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...from success stories...<em>to</em> learning from mistakes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new re-alignment is announced by education's most prominent voice.&nbsp; The Times Education Supplement reports the formation of an 'Institute of School Leadership', to be based in the University of Buckingham. &nbsp;The argument is that there is a shortfall in 'good head-teachers' and a reluctance among deputies for promotion.&nbsp; There's no shortage of evidence about why heads and their deputies are stressed and unwilling to get more-so.&nbsp; But this re-alignment isn't asking about causes and effects, it's case is that we've lost too many and so we must find more.&nbsp; There's a lot to disagree about here.</p>
<p align="center">_______________________________________________<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>careers work needs your say on this<br /></em><em>sign up on the right and blog below</em></p>
<p align="center">_______________________________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>THINKING</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There's also a lot to play for.&nbsp; A central re-aligning belief is that 'nothing matters more than the quality of leadership'.&nbsp; The spokesperson doesn't want deputies, department heads or hands-on educators to miss this claim - the word 'nothing' is repeated.&nbsp; The replacement leaders are to be 'compassionate, wise, accomplished and rounded people'; they are not to be 'league-tabled obsessed'. &nbsp;No comment on that from the University of Buckingham.&nbsp; But there are questions to pose.</p>
<p>The movers and shakers are a trio.&nbsp; Anthony Seldon, principal of an &eacute;lite school, values high academic achievement alongside a passion for learning, independent thinking, moral values, self confidence and interests beyond the classroom.&nbsp; He looks forward to the dissolving of the separations between private and state education. &nbsp;Michael Wilshaw is, by turns, a head teacher and chief inspector.&nbsp; He's a bold one, calling for 'battle-axe' assaults on school sloppiness in the pursuit of uncomplicated calls for effective control in schools.&nbsp; Toby Young is an enabler of free schools.&nbsp; His admiration of Friedrich Nietzsche contributes to his action in severing schools from both local authorities and the welfare state.</p>
<p>Buckingham is a private university holding a royal charter and attracting a cosmopolitan student body - some qualifying as teachers.&nbsp; Following the market the curriculum is strengthening on economics, business studies and enterprise and weakening on the humanities - though they include a masters programs in military history and another on English country houses.&nbsp; The university has an education research unit which reports to government, frequently gathering information from large samples and engaging computer technology in assembling them into what is called 'big data'.</p>
<p>School leaders, their deputies, the department heads and the hands-on educators may reasonably wonder about this.&nbsp; The triad are not entirely in accord, and it's far from clear how Buckingham will take them to where any of them want to go.&nbsp; Something to argue about?</p>
<p align="center"><strong>________________________________</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PURPOSE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The reforming triad sees their initiative as transformational: the great heads of the future will not need ever to have managed a classroom.&nbsp; The underlying belief is that great-leadership will succeed in whatever setting it works.&nbsp; So successful leaders - whether from commerce, or being at war, or active in public life - will be successful head teachers. &nbsp;Buckingham has an education programme, but these heroes need never to have qualified in it.</p>
<p>Versions of that faith-in-greatness crop up in the appointment of mayors, szars, commissioners, guardians and - in the Buckingham scenario - gurus.&nbsp; These great-and-good are thought to be blessed with a rare command of solutions.&nbsp; This is the Seldon-Young-Wilshaw, prospectus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most thorough award of such an attribution of leadership I know is to Kim Jong-un. &nbsp;But the west has its examples in Messrs Churchill, Reagan and Thatcher. &nbsp;In all such cases any follower-feeling of being in safe hands is comforting.&nbsp; But such reverence is rarely unanimous or invariably successful.&nbsp; And what if the Seldon-Young-Wilshaw retrospect fails to have delivered anything impressively great or noticeably good?</p>
<p>And there is also this: some leaders, promoted into schools, have shown the sense, courage and grace to acknowledge that they are out of their depth.&nbsp; So what if there are no safe hands, only the sense, courage and grace that every educator - at every level - brings to the work?&nbsp; We would all be in this together.&nbsp; Though, that doesn't mean that we would necessarily stop arguing.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>________________________________</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CREDIBILITY</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mayors, szars. commissioners, guardians and gurus are inclined to talk about systems, establishments and institutions. &nbsp;They're what movers and shakers know how to change.&nbsp; They are engaged when movements to influence, reform and replace are on the agenda.&nbsp; There is a credibility factor in responding to constituency feelings that something must be done.&nbsp; The action is reshaping schools, universities, research-and-development outfits and the like.&nbsp; Looking &nbsp;good in action can mean rubbishing existing institution - such as the National College for Teaching and Leadership. &nbsp;It is how Buckingham becomes the sole platform for attracting ministerial support and government funding. &nbsp;The whole is a tightly-bound mind-set, defending a narrowly-based credibility.</p>
<p>So there's plenty of room for disagreement.&nbsp; Much of it is in the day-on-day working lives of educators.&nbsp; But that talk is complicated.&nbsp; So movers-and-shakers need followers who can curtail it.&nbsp; They staff and prime media for asking simple questions and highlighting manageable answers.&nbsp; All is contained behind a narrow window.&nbsp; The controllers and the media they capture, present themselves as heroes, speaking for us all.&nbsp; Followers feel free to argue, but they find little to argue about.</p>
<p>A leadership with any credibility depends on a liberated following. &nbsp;And that needs a bigger window.&nbsp; Credibility then depends less on what is claimed and more on the sense that citizenship makes of it. &nbsp;History finds plenty of celebrated leaders with feet of clay, charging up blind alleys, and engineering catastrophic consequences.&nbsp; Who better to push at the limits of their entrapments than educators and their students?&nbsp; They all have plenty to argue about.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>________________________________</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FUTURE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The plenty to argue about includes facts, attributions and purposes. &nbsp;The facts are what people can find, observe and believe.&nbsp; They are truths whether anybody believes them or not, and they belong to everybody.&nbsp; Meanings are the significances that people attribute to facts.&nbsp; They are interpretations, can divide people and usually do. &nbsp;Purposes are what people mean to do about this.&nbsp; They are based on the facts they find and the attributions they attach. &nbsp;Angry exchanges can gather around what is a fact, what is opinion, and how much of that is prejudice, snobbery or racism. &nbsp;People can jump in to talk at any level in those three-story exchanges.&nbsp; But a careful approach would make facts, attributions and purposes the stuff of what philosophers of education call reflection.</p>
<p>Reflection makes room for disagreement.&nbsp; And the outcomes depend less on leadership than on followership. &nbsp;The triad's proposals and Buckingham's claims matter less than what people find, what they attribute, and what they do about it.&nbsp; Some of that reflection looks for monetary returns on mercenary investments.&nbsp; These are the distinct interests of shareholders.&nbsp; Others look for social returns on investment in families, community and well-being.&nbsp; These are the different interests of stakeholders.&nbsp; There's no guarantee here of follower support for what the great and good want to do with their systems, their establishments and their institutions.</p>
<p>This reflection is on facts, attributions and purposes engaged by shareholder and stakeholder interests,&nbsp; There's plenty for some to value and others to dismiss.&nbsp; I had some contact with Buckingham's education research unit. &nbsp;An issue is whether big data, framed by economics, might be missing something.&nbsp; The argument is about whether more is going on in stakeholder experience.&nbsp; If there is it would need a research tool such as ethnography to pick it up.&nbsp; I can't say I got anywhere with that suggestion.&nbsp; It seems that arms-length data speaks for as much as some want to hear.&nbsp; The disagreements were, at times, heated.</p>
<p>It gets more complicated - reflection finds conflicts of interest. &nbsp;What is done for some interests harms the interests of others.&nbsp; So reflection must question whose interests any proposal serves.&nbsp; This means students and their educators interrogating any manoeuvre&nbsp;for who gains and who loses.&nbsp; These are equal-opportunity issues.&nbsp; Dealing with them means recognising who is escaping scrutiny and where that leverage is anchored.&nbsp; There might be a simple valuing of market forces, or the inevitability of competition, or the righteousness of private property, or the nod of some guru - but in a fair society none of that will do.</p>
<p>The maneuvering, evading and muddying of various interests load educators with what might well have reached a tired-and-defeated level.&nbsp; But It hasn't and I see no sign that it will.&nbsp; On the contrary, resistance to arbitrary control is strengthening on a daily basis - among families, local authorities and educators.&nbsp; There's a lot to disagree about in education.&nbsp; And the argument ain't over yet.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>________________________________</strong></p>
<p>There is no shortage of credible sources on what is proving useful and sustainable in all of this.&nbsp; Together they find a focused and self-consistent answer to each of the questions posed above...<br /><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; THE LOAD &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THE FOCUS</strong></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the priorities</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...<em>are for </em>well-being</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the lessons</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...<em>are for</em> finding who &amp; what can be believed</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> the methods</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<em>are for</em> firing up</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the outcomes</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...<em>are for</em> critical thinking</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> the interests</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...<em>are for</em> stakeholders</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> the transfers</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<em>are for</em> local relevance</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> the institutions</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<em>are</em>&nbsp;enablers</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> the strategies</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<em>are for</em> learning to learn</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the services</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...<em>are for</em> shared social needs</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>the presentations</strong></em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...<em>are for</em> learning from mistakes&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />This is thought-and-feeling. &nbsp;Yet it is clear enough and consistent enough to rule out the possibility of seeing education as commodity, or school as marketplace, or student as consumer.</p>
<p>But there's a lot for students, their educators and their stakeholders to learn. &nbsp;And experience is finding that there's more to be learned from acknowledging failure than from vaunting success. &nbsp;That capacity, for making good use of bad news, is undervalued. &nbsp;A changing world requires the great-and-good to both learn and unlearn.&nbsp; Listening to students, their educators and their stakeholders will help.</p>
<p>All of the players mentioned here are facing existential consequence of accelerating rates of change.&nbsp; The faster the acceleration the greater the relevance of coherent and focussed thought-and-feeling.&nbsp; And the faster the acceleration the more urgent is the need to engage citizens in that informed reflection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what the Buckingham-based trio can make of this.&nbsp; Do you?&nbsp; After all, there's a lot to disagree about in education.&nbsp;</p>
