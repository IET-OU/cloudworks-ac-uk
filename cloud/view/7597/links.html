        <p>I will write several scenarios from the perspective of potential learners. &nbsp;Aim is to explore the different needs learners might bring to the proposed support and different contexts from which they may come to it. &nbsp;Should I also develop scenarios from the perspective of other actors (e.g. teachers)? &nbsp; Not sure yet. &nbsp;Model to be used is for each scenario (and I feel it is key to have more than one) identify: setting, actors, goals, actions, events, objects (as per&nbsp;http://www.slideshare.net/joshuau/scenario-based-contextual-learning-design) and then write a narrative scenario based on those elements. &nbsp;That's the plan but let's see how it works out.</p>    </div>

			<h2>Scenario 1</h2>
<p>Alberta is a 2nd (or final) year student in the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Greenwich. &nbsp;She is keen to enhance her CV to help get a sandwich-year placement (or job on graduation). &nbsp;She sees a poster about the various certification exams that can be taken at &nbsp;Greenwich and decides to find out more about them from the website (QR code) on the poster. &nbsp;She is working hard on her courses and has lots of assignments so doesn't want to have to do much extra study in order to achieve them.</p>
<p>She visits the website and looks at the list of certifications. &nbsp;There are links to the syllabuses and details about what the certification exams involve, cost etc. &nbsp; &nbsp;There is also information about how the syllabuses for the exams relate to various undergraduate and postgraduate courses at the Uni. &nbsp;She is thrilled to see that through her undergraduate studies she has already covered much of the material for two of the Microsoft Technology Associate exams. &nbsp;As the exams are quite cheap to take she signs up for them without any further study. &nbsp;&nbsp;She sees on the website that there is an online forum for students at the Uni who are preparing for certification exams and also the possibility of joining a study group for students studying for a particular exam but she decides she doesn't have the time or need to join either.</p>
<p>She takes the exams and although finds them more challenging than she expected she passes both. &nbsp;She thinks about taking some more but decides they would take more study which she doesn&rsquo;t have time for at the moment. &nbsp;She receives an email for the short course team at the Uni inviting her to contribute her experience to the online forum but doesn&rsquo;t reply.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<h3>Quick refelction on Scenario 1</h3>
<p>Even though I'd already for sketched out the goal, actions, events for this scenario as soon as I started writing the actual narrative Alberta started to take on a life of her own (good or bad thing?). &nbsp;Reality check about how much people might want to get involved in online support. &nbsp;Also focusses on practical questions e.g. would there be an open forum as well as study groups? &nbsp;What would these actually be like? &nbsp;How would a study group work if students are working to different timescales? &nbsp;Need to group them into a cohort? &nbsp; Useful idea that students would be very interested in how what they have already studied maps onto the certifications available. &nbsp;Sounds easy but this information would need keeping up to date as both our courses and the exam syllabuses are liable to change.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<h2>Scenario 2</h2>
<p>Bjorn is a final year computing student at the University of Greenwich.&nbsp; His motivation for wanting to take certifications is similar to Alberta&rsquo;s, i.e. he wants to enhance his CV.&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition he is aware that some of his practical skills could do with improvement if he is to get the sort of job which he wants.&nbsp; One of his lecturers mentions the programme of certifications offered at the University and Bjorn follows up by visiting the website.&nbsp; Like Alberta he decides to take two MTA certifications (software development and database) without further preparation but he fails both by quite a long way.&nbsp; One of the people supervising the exams talks to him at the end about the support available and he goes back to the website.&nbsp; He signs up for a tutor-led briefing session for each of the two exams [think about the form and duration of these].&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He attends these.&nbsp; Other students attending one of them decide to set up a study circle and he joins this.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bjorn and the other students in the study circle [again think about form of this &ndash; how much guidance is provided] work through some externally available preparation material.&nbsp; He re-takes the exams and passes both. &nbsp;&nbsp;Like Alberta he doesn&rsquo;t reply to the email inviting him to share his experiences with other students.</p>
<p>[Am I in danger of getting too wordy and repetative? &nbsp;Also getting hung-up on developing scenariois to "test" all possible routes. ]</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<h2>Slight change of tack - personas</h2>
<p>Rather define actors &nbsp;(with goals) etc as part of the scenario try defining the actor (now promoted to being a "persona") first and then think about incorporating them into one or more scenarios.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
