She covers innovation, sustainability and social entrepreneurship as a staff writer for Fast Company magazine. In 2005, when she was 24, the Village Voice nominated her for a Pulitzer Prize for the feature series and column Generation Debt, which led to a book published by Riverhead in 2006. Generation Debt drew national debate with its argument that young people are facing unique and unprecedented economic challenges. As a national figure representing her generation, she has appeared in several documentaries including the "Generation Next" series on PBS, on media outlets including CNN&rsquo;s Larry King Live, ABC&rsquo;s The View and NPR, been featured as a "Yahoo! Finance Expert," and submitted testimony to Congressional committees and state legislatures about student debt and college affordability.<br /><br />Her new book, DIY U: Edupunks, Edupreneurs and the Coming Transformation of Higher Education, (Chelsea Green, April 2010) is about one of our society's central institutions, higher education, undergoing a phase change under massive pressure: from the monolithic ivory tower to learner-centered education that is lightweight, networked, and fluid, addressing the challenges of cost, quality, and access. <br /><br />Her writing has appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post, New York magazine, Slate, Salon, the American Prospect, and the Nation. She speaks regularly on campuses and elsewhere across the country, blogs at Fastcompany.com, the Huffington Post, and <a title="anyakamenetz.blogspot.com" href="/content/edit/anyakamenetz.blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">anyakamenetz.blogspot.com</a>, and Twitters at Anya1anya. <br /><br />"Never before has a college degree been more important, making the need to address the failure of many higher ed institutions to deliver on that promise that much more critical. Kamenetz captures a higher ed system on the brink of dramatic transformation, and paints two provocative futures: revolution from within the system and disruption from the outside. This is valuable reading for higher education leaders, entrepreneurs, and anyone interested in understanding how innovation and market forces can begin to drive real and necessary change."--Josh Jarrett, Senior Program Officer for Postsecondary Success, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</p>
