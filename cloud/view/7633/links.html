        <h3>1) Brainstorm components of my scenario</h3>
<h4>Actors: (who is involved?)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gilles, a 21 year old student living in Lausanne. He is French and has studied his first 3-years at the University of Lyon in France. Gilles is a high-level athlete in mountain bike. He has then decided to do his master in sport management at the University of Lausanne. In order to keep in touch with his friends in France, he likes to communicate with them on Facebook, sharing photos, comments etc. He shares his love of mountain bike on a tumblr site. He cannot see the point of other web 2.0 tools like Twitter and has never heard of LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Course facilitators</li>
</ul>
<h4>Goals: (why?)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gilles plans to finish his master by the end of 2013. He thinks about his future. He wonders whether he will find easily a job. He knows from other fellow students older than him that it&rsquo;s very difficult to find a job after finishing the University. He wants to enhance his chance to find a job.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The University of Lausanne offers him the opportunities to maximize his digital literacy skills through a certificate.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Settings: (where &amp; when?)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Because this course is not integrated into a curriculum, Gilles needs to manage his time to follow the course. He can find free slot (about 30 min to 1 hour) during the day or the evening to engage in activities (listen or watch to some possible audio, or media ressources (video, slides), readings text resources, communicating with other participants on forum, twitter, follow a twitter feed, read and respond to e-mails, write his reflections on his blog and save learning artefacts into his eportfolio). He can work directly from his computer or personal devices when his is at home &nbsp;or present at the university. But he can also go to free computer rooms at the university.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Objects: (what things are involved?)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Devices connected to the internet: computer, personal smart phone, digital tablet</li>
<li>Website (wordpress), VLE (Moodle), eportfolio (Mahara), social, media, email</li>
</ul>
<h4>Actions: &nbsp;(what do actors do?)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gilles receives an email advertising the course, signs up to be notified when it starts and visits the course web page to find course informations, timetable and learning outcomes. Gilles reads carefully the competency framework concerning digital literacy. skills He starts to think which one he would like to develop. But he also realises that he has already acquired some of these skills during his studies or from personal experiences. So he starts to reflect on which artefacts from previous learning or personal experience he will choose to show them in his e-portfolio. He needs to choose the activities he will perform to develop new skills.When the courses starts, Gilles chooses tasks does the task, displays his output, disengages, re-engages, looks at stuff produced by others, comments on other fellow students works.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Events: (what happens to actors?)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gilles received by email instructions to start the courses. He follows the timetable and engage into tasks individually or collaboratively.</li>
<li>Course facilitators follow the students, send emails, aggregate results, send summarized messages with student&rsquo;s work, moderate discussion, answer the questions, etc. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Results: (what is achieved?)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gilles gets a certificate in digital and information literacy. The certificate lists the acquired skills. He can add them on his curriculum and in his Linkedin&rsquo;s profile. &nbsp;He creates a public view of his e-portfolio to be shown to a potential employer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My design: (what role does your design play?)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gilles develops new skills in digital literacy or highlights skills that he couldn&rsquo;t describe or name before. He gains experience in MOOC. He enriches his Personal Learning Environment.Thanks to his success in this MOOC, he has the feeling to be a more self-regulated, motivated, and autonomous learner. He becomes aware that this kind of learning could be useful to develop or maintain his professional skills throughout his life.</li>
<li>Team&rsquo;s project: gains experience in MOOC, assesses MOOC&rsquo;s potential for learning (will consider if this course format could be used in other fields in order to promote them inside the whole institution: promote MOOC as an pedagogical innovation)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scrutinize my scenario &amp; revise as necessary</h4>
<p>I am claiming: <br /><br /><em><strong>for my designs?</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on Report from McAuley, Bonnie Stewart, George Siemens and Dave Cormier citation on MOOC:</li>
<li><em>citation: The ability to work with current digital tools to connect fragmented, diffuse, and distributed knowledge nodes, both human and artifactual, is perhaps the most important literacy that the MOOC environment rewards. Developing one's personal knowledge and presenting it through a coherent reflection or contribution, whether by means of blog posts, concept maps, video or another tool, is a high-level digital literacy.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Mc Auley, A., Stewart, B., Siemens, G. &amp; Cormier, D. (2010). The MOOC Model for Digital Practice. Retrieved from http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/MOOC_Final.pdf. (20th May 2011).</p>
<p><em><strong>about context</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>the institution will acknowledge this course format and will support the project (through funds and human resources:implication of course facilitators / learning engineer / technical team /steering committee with members Librarians and teachers)</li>
<li>the institution will recognise this approach as an pedagogical innovation and promote this learning practice.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>about the students involved?</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>students will recognise the benefits and value of acquiring and developing digital literacy skills for their future professional career</li>
<li>students will interested and motivated to engage into a non mandatory course</li>
<li>students will be self-regulated, motivated, and autonomous learner</li>
