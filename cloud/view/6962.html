                   <p>Hi Kristina</p>
<p>I am interested in knowing who your target audience is for the modules, and the context for the design - is it for blended learning or project-based or a LMS or open distance learning, or some other approach?</p>
<p>Re your idea to write a book that is great. Have you used <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wikibooks</a> at all? It is a great platform for writing a book in collaboration with others.&nbsp; If you do a search for learning design you will see that some people have made tentative starts to write about it.&nbsp; You can self-publish using sites such as <a href="https://www.lulu.com" rel="nofollow">Lulu.com</a> which are great because you can set the price for the print copy - it is surprising how many people pay for that privilege. even when the pdf is free.

                   <p>Thanks for your comment Bronwyn, I appreciate the feedback and questions.</p>
<p>My target audience would be secondary and tertiary educators I believe.&nbsp; I tend to think big picture as well so I would want to create a resource that is all-encompassing and can faciltate professional development in this area to be applied in blended learning, online learning within an LMS or in PBL, maybe even considering games-based learning as well.</p>
<p>I haven't used Wikibooks before but I have explored it and other sites like Lulu before, I just haven't had the chance to really write and have concentrated on writing on my blog.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Geetanjali, I haven't officially joined a team yet no, I would love to work with you if you are interested in this area.&nbsp; I am a learning designer and I am often given courses to put into Moodle but they are in no way designed for the online environment, so what I really want to do is to develop instructional materials that help educators better understand what good learning design is in the offline and online environment, possibly comparing them in the process.&nbsp; What are your thoughts?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Kristina:<br />I propose forming a team similar in concept to Helen Walmsley and maybe working closely with them..but aimed at a slightly different audience...or we could still try and join that team, but it may be too large a team by now.<br />My audience is more K-12 teachers...does that fit with yours? Yes, I am also interested in learning design for the F2F environment and how online may be different....so in that our thoughts are along the same line.</p>
<p>What say you?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Yeh that sounds good. &nbsp;I do not recall Helen's at the moment but will definitely check it out soon. &nbsp;What do you believe would be a good starting point for us? &nbsp;I think we should collect some resources, references and links and I probably already have a ton on my Diigo account. &nbsp;What do you envisage the end product looking like and what format would you think is most suitable? &nbsp;I want to write a resource like a short ebook but I think something interactive is definitely in order too.</p>
<p>What do you think too Cathy? &nbsp;Is this still along the track that you were thinking with your project?</p>
