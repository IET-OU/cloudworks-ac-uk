        <p>Social work is a profession in crisis. (Hussein, 2014) Many social workers feel disillusioned in their work and there are serious problems retaining high-quality social workers. (Bowyer and Roe, 2015) This has multiple negative effects on social workers, those who employ them, those who receive their services, and on the wider society who funds their services. (Collins, 2016) This presentation proposes a response to this crisis, namely providing social workers and others in the &lsquo;caring professions&rsquo; with a practical and easily accessible online toolkit to help those they work with solve their own problems.</p>
<p>Using Self-Determination Theory (Roman, and Davids, 2016) as an organising principle, the presentation will show how a clear problem-solving algorithm, which allows social workers to select from a range of tools to address specific tasks can allow social workers to achieve a sense of competence, perhaps even excellence, and do this in a way that allows the social worker to maintain a sense of autonomy. The model that will be presented also focuses on the importance of the relationship between the social worker and the person or people they are helping.</p>
<p>These three key themes of competence, autonomy, and relatedness are strongly connected to job satisfaction and to wider aims of well-being (Hohman, 2012, pp 24-25).</p>
<p>The presentation itself will be a multi-media &lsquo;walk-through&rsquo; of a website for social workers and others in the &lsquo;caring professions.&rsquo; The website uses the model to help workers monitor their progress and choose the right tools for the job of empowering others to solve their problems. The presentation will focus initially on how the model can be used as a supervision tool, for supporting a supervisor in guiding a social worker to empower a service user to solve their own problems. This reflects the vital role that good supervision and good management play in supporting effective social work practice.</p>
<p>Although the conference presentation will focus on social work, the model itself is not limited to one professional area. The model is for general problem-solving and can be used across a range of settings, from health care to education, in any situation where one person has a role that requires them to help another person.</p>
<p>By the end of the presentation participants will have a clear sense of the key features of the model and the wider project. They will also know how to access further information on the problem-solving algorithm and the associated tools. Therefore, this presentation will be especially useful for anyone who has a role that involves helping others solve their problems.&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>It then focuses on whether the problem is solvable. Many challenging life events cannot change, they can only be managed, this makes them not a problem.

                   <p>Dear Mark,</p>
<p>As a nurse, it will be interesting to hear your presentation. I teach on level 6 (Third year) nursing modules that consider 'problem solving'. I'm sure there will be some transferable ideas here.</p>
<p>Have you had a chance to 'try it out' yet?</p>
<p>Regards, Sarah</p>        </div>

                   <p>As an ex social worker and someone who works in safeguarding supporting those managing case concerns, this looks really interesting and I'm looking forward to the presentation.&nbsp; I was interested in what stage the project was up to - is it still in development or has any user testing taken place? Like Sarah I would be interested in the feedback received.&nbsp; Are there any plans to evaluate the impact of the site? As you point out in your abstract there are considerable concerns about staff retention and quality in social work which this could address and this could lead to an article for publication in one of the social care journals.</p>
<p>I found your poster difficult to access - is it on OpenStudio? I couldn't increase font size sufficiently to read it or access the audio.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>I have tried a few initial trials with students, and sent out a cards based version to a number of willing practice educators (people who supervise student social workers). So far I have only had one response, which was positive.</p>
<p>You can try out the first version of the web design here.&nbsp;http://www.problemsolvingtoolkit.co.uk/ But bear in mind this is a work in progress.</p>
<p>Jude,&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is still in the development phase, although I guess you could call it beta-testing. After Easter I will be testing it more robustly with students, then I will be looking to field test it small scale and evaluate it, before working it into a formal research project to validate its effectiveness.</p>
<p>My primary goal is to support worker's sense of intrinsic motivation in their work by using self-determination theory, focusing on competence, autonomy, and relatedness. The autonomy is slightly paradoxical, by limiting choice to a narrower range we can increase a sense of autonomy and competence by allowing wise selection from a narrower range of tools.</p>
<p>I will have another look at the poster. I must admit, I did 'cheat' slightly by using a larger poster size to give me more room to develop ideas, and that is at the cost of readability. I will try again and see if I can fix that.</p>
<p>Thank you both for your input, and I hope I can deliver something of value for everyone.</p>
<p>Mark</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Mark, I found myself having quite an emotional response to your abstract. I have never worked with social workers but several of my family and friends have closely, in their capacity as teachers. The narrative I always heard was that social workers were incredibly dedicated and had a very difficult job to do within a system that does not always value them. I really hope your idea is a success!</p>
<p>My own impression from the outside was that the crisis in social work was caused by things like goverment/council policy, government/council ideology and society's values. I am not sure whether you feel that is a fair assessment?</p>
<p>If so, I will be interested to see how your model operates in this context and how it interacts with other strategies towards resolution of the crisis.</p>        </div>

                   Hi Mark 
The issue of professional confidence and what fosters it is of great interest to me and my work in education.  I am interested that your approach is about selection of tools and a framework and I will be interested in how this is received by social workers.

                   <p>Hi Mark<br />Please find below the main questions and comments from your live presentation. It's up to you how to answer them, whether you wish to group them, or whether you wish to point to an answer already given above, for example.<br />Best wishes<br />Simon</p>
<ul>
<li>Such an important topic to engage and retain good quality social workers</li>
<li>Is it always about improvement? With teachers I find that they also need to support to recognise the effective parts of their current practice - I guess it may be the same for SW's? Are they hyper self-critical?</li>
<li>ScOPTBox (https://practicelearning.info/login/index.php) would be really interested in this website resource</li>
<li>is the vision of this site/tool that it is openly available or will it be for a closed audience/marketed externally? I can see a possible additional audience!</li>
<li>What are the ethical issues around the research phase?</li>
<li>I think it will be great for work with practice educators to give a conversation framework</li>
<li>how long do expect the beta phase to last?</li>
</ul>        </div>
