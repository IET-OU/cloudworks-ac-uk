<ul>
<li><strong>change and anxiety</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The most significant feature of contemporary life is the accelerating rate of change.&nbsp; That reality invades all our lives - as individuals, family-members, members of society, workers - and, by no means least, as careers-workers.</p>
<p>It means that what we think, say and do needs updating on a daily bases - at times an hourly basis.</p>
<p align="center">_______________________________________________</p>
<p align="center"><em>careers work needs your say on this </em></p>
<p align="center"><em>sign up on the right and blog below</em></p>
<p align="center">_______________________________________________</p>
<p>Some people ride the waves - they are protected, but they are a minority. &nbsp;While the posturing of others hides from what we all know. &nbsp;For most people change stokes disappointment, undermines confidence and - at the extremes - shocks. &nbsp;I think you've been there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The big question is...&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>do we want to do anything about it?</em></strong></p>
<p>There is a dilemma.&nbsp; On the one hand are natural impulses to concentrate on positives, cool down, hang-loose and don't get agitated?&nbsp; On the other there is a challenge.&nbsp; The way the species - that's you and me - survives is by facing up to bad news.&nbsp; We learn more from bad news than we do from good news.&nbsp; There's more survival value in facing the facts.&nbsp; While good news says 'that was cool, do it again', it takes bad news to wake us up to what more we can do.</p>
<p>It's a mistake to shroud bad news.&nbsp; If we don't know what's going on we'll never know what to do about anything. &nbsp;So...</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>do we need to look at the dark side of life?</em></strong></p>
<p>Mind you, there needs to be a sense of proportion about this.&nbsp; We are talking principles not rules.&nbsp; And the principle&nbsp;is, when you're laughing things off, know what you are laughing about - and why.&nbsp; We all need more fun - and more people we can safely laugh with - trust.&nbsp; Which brings us to careers work.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>promotion and limitation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Lttle more than a glance at a careers-work journal realises how good the professionals are at self-promotion.&nbsp; It's understandable - there's no shortage of issues for careers-work to deal with - including media bad-mouthing, privatised competition and government neglect.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Journal coverage tends to be of specific programmes which are thought to illustrate general success.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Good-news satisfaction avoids mentions of disappointment, doubt or refusal.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>There are few accounts of how students and clients look for their own ways of dealing with day-to-day experience.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>In looking for hope careers-work profession go for an expansion of a limited range of certificated and conventional provision.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>The leading society awards prizes to 'best practice'.&nbsp; There are benchmarks for skills - for complementing, applying, improving, leading and complying - each bringing things to a 'last word'.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>But careers-work still has to deal to with how success in one location does not work in all locations - and why.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>All this raises issues for the transferability of learning - and its non-transferability</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Much of what is reported pursues economic success.&nbsp; But what about clients who see themselves on a journey and not in a race?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Careers work at its best is that branch of education where students and clients work on the terms by which they will claim their membership of their society. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>However, the end-point is this: self-promotion speaks of students fitting in rather than making a difference. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>It asserts that 'working is good for everyone', explicitly equating the term with 'paid employment'.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>It can all be insufferably cheerful.&nbsp; More importantly it deprives the profession of the dynamics of learning from mistakes.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>At the extremes there are good-news claims of macro-economic benefits from careers work.&nbsp; They raise questions about whom the authors are trying to impress, and invite the suspicion that it is a political-commercial coalition.&nbsp; But that coalition is not foolish, it can see that these economics are based on too-small a baseline.&nbsp; They will not up-scale.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>There are signs of careers work breaking free of some of these boundaries.&nbsp; In particular there is a publication of an article linking learning to playing. &nbsp;Plenty of room for a reflective profession there.</strong></p>
<p>Some of the emerging policy is overdue - 'The West' needs action on tax collection, on work-life productivity, and on a re-considered understanding of its debt to Russia.</p>
<p>But realities are being overlooked: the thatcher-reagan-blair-soap will continue to marginalise Gorbachev; global commerce will still favour neo-liberal economics; much of The West will be owned by China; Mexico, Canada and North Korea will still protect their people; as will religious interests; and trades-unions. &nbsp;The planet will continue to warm; the unwell will still need health-care; firearms will not lose their lethal capacity. &nbsp;And any single claimant seeking to be able to fix any of this will not be facing facts but will be self delusion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The people demand a fix, but this is no fan-fair for the common man. &nbsp;It is an appeal for the survival of 'The West' - which will survive by facing facts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are farther reaching groups each with an interest in how people see what can be done. &nbsp;The look-good political promotion agenda for careers work is out-of-touch with this. &nbsp;It can defend its own survival interests, but it is no agent ot radical change - and its leaders need to know how and why?&nbsp; Part of the answer is that its issues are out-of-date before the ink dries. &nbsp;Too many students and clients find that they have much more to say in those unfinished conversations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>hope and education</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The future belongs to the agencies that can grasp and understand the depth and breadth of change and its consequences in people's lives. &nbsp;There is a world-wide scramble for those positions. &nbsp;Understanding careers work as a branch of education doesn't need to scramble - it is where people need it to be in opening those deeper and wider perspectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Students and clients are working on the terms in which they will claim their membership of their society. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>The idea of ambition has been captured by the business world, where realised ambition means acquiring wealth.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>But more is going on - there are other ambitions to be realised, people to consider, moralities to pursue, dignities to respect, obligations to realise, and loves to nurture.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>In both the referendum and the US election a criss-cross of priorities demands immediate and recognisable improvement in people's lives.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Much of the politics is bogus, but the experience-based demand is authentic. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>One self-designated political liberal has characterised those demands as for 'settlers' - not strivers. &nbsp;And other supporters of what they call 'the good life' find the roots of their thinking in their own expertise, not in their client's experience.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>The liberals have missed what is happening. &nbsp;The working-classes see them as &eacute;lite abusers.&nbsp; Whole sectors of electorates have been neglected.&nbsp; And the neglected have lost interest in a politics which sees them as votes not worth winning. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>What&nbsp;</strong><strong>education and careers-work</strong><strong>&nbsp;know professionally is overtaken by what their students and clients learn experientially.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>There is nothing necessarily wrong with rebeliion - people are doing what they've learned to do - they are in their comfort zone.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>What is wrong is how they have been misled by a politics which more closely resembles soap-opera than democracy.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Progressive politics and professional positioning are a two-way loser. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>If careers work is a branch of education, where students work on the terms in which they claim membership of society, then that education has failed them. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>What of the rights of an electoral majority?&nbsp; Much is made of them.&nbsp; But a majority is no more than a headcount.&nbsp; It has no rights until the people whose heads have not been counted know more.&nbsp; They need to know not just how but why the majority voted as it did.&nbsp; And if the minority are not convinced by the explanation they are entitled to reject the majority's claim.&nbsp; Satisfaction with leaving the EU and support for Donald Trump come mostly from the elderly, &nbsp;the resistance to both comes mostly from the young.&nbsp; And that resistance has as much right as anybody to demonstrate its anger. &nbsp;Indeed, both the elderly and the young regard each their own opposing anger as an obligation. &nbsp;The streets of both the US and the UK are populated by the opposing cohorts.</p>
<p>If those are the causes, what are the consequences?&nbsp; Careers work is needed as a branch of education - where independence of mind, critical thinking and creativity have full reign.&nbsp; And that needs wide-ranging mainstream curriculum. &nbsp;Conventional careers education lacks the intellectual sweep and the organisational anchorage.&nbsp; No more than a handful of careers educators have both.&nbsp; I'd like to see more published&nbsp;on that complexity, its issues and the range of resolutions. &nbsp;All need to be published on paper and on-line.</p>
<p>There seems to be something of a hiatus separating paper-based from on-line activity.&nbsp; There is a tendency for professionals to attribute importance to the one or the other.&nbsp; It's true that paper-based sources give the internet a mention.&nbsp; But few citations go into any detail about on-line ideas, narratives and criteria.&nbsp; Too much is overlooked.&nbsp; Rationales for independent minds, critical thinking and creativity are largely found on-line, but neglected elsewhere. &nbsp;The field needs to listen to iits divided self.</p>
<p>So is there a gap in careers-work thinking? &nbsp;One or other side of the hiatus would be where ideas for curriculum are differently shaped and framed.&nbsp; It would be where political and commercial interests are separately scrutinised.&nbsp; It would disconnect arguments for fitting in from arguments for making a difference.&nbsp; It might differently interrogate dominant interests.&nbsp; It would allow citizenship education to work for either compliance or reform.&nbsp; None of this could be part of a unified basis for ready-for-anything action.</p>
<p>There are far-reaching groups each with an interest in how people respond to change and how they see the help the groups offer. &nbsp;The politically progressive alliance sees it's help as a fulfilment of...</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>'a longing for something different'</em></strong></p>
<p>If that claim means anything we would be finding a now-and-future client-led fulfilment of that longing. &nbsp;But what we find are expert-led proposals for reform.</p>
<p>And what of professional career workers?&nbsp; They are on are on record for...</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>'a careers-work programme that works for everybody'</em></strong></p>
<p>It's an enticing claim - but it is out-of-touch with how change differently invades organisations, locations, experiences.</p>
<p>The optimism is persistent but unsustainable. &nbsp;It has co-opted psychiatric ideas voiced as self-esteem, resilience and mindfulness. &nbsp;But these are quietist moves - working best for commercial and political interests.&nbsp; The consequence is an enduring failure to deal with change. &nbsp;And dealing with change includes being prepared angrily to resist what cannot be accepted. &nbsp;The&nbsp;quietists are&nbsp;damping down what needs to be fired up. &nbsp;They&nbsp;are not learning from the dark side of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That reform is ready for anything in...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ... independent thinking - because there is no universal script</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... critical thinking - because students and clients take the lead</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... creative invention - because hour-by-hour change moves on</strong></p>
<p>There are the makings of massive re-alignments in education and careers work - between careers work and education, between specialist and mainstream curriculum, between on-line and off-line thinking, and - most of all - between professional experience and client experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is learning for living.</p>
