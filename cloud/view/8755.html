        <p>Dear all</p>
<p>I currently work as an AL with the OU delivering a 1st year undergraduate law module - W100 - until it is phased out later this year but to be replaced with two new similar modules at the same level fo study.</p>
<p>I have recently commenced study with the OU on an education masters programme and am currently working through the first module which is technology enhanced learning. I have done this to skill up in the area of EdTech as I was a technological luddite.</p>
<p>I am keen to try to incorporate into my delivery next year some collaborative learning activities and wondered if anyone out there has any experience of this - either successful experiences or otherwise that I could learn from that would be willing to exchange ideas?</p>
<p>I have a few ideas such as the following:</p>
<p>1. To use blogs asa reflective tool - to encourage students to blog in respect of ongoing thrings through the module, things such as their strengths and weakness in respect of legal essays and problem solving questions. My thinking behind this is that it would encourage the students to engage more actively with the TMA feedback and to encourage them to really reflect on that feedback. This would be an organic process - with them anending this following each TMA to show, hopefully, how the list evolves as they hopefully respond to previous feedback and therefore receive different feedback throughout the module. This will ultimately assist them in focussing on their strengths and weakness and having a clear picture of areas which they really need to work on in the EMA when we reach that point in the module.</p>
<p>2. I also thought about them individually compiling a blog of their essay plans to tutorial activity questions and encouraging others in the group to use the comment function to work collaboratively with each other to comment on strengths and weaknesses of those plans&nbsp;&nbsp;- they could not do this in respect of actual TMA as students are not permitted to discuss actual TMAs with each other and so the comment function aspect of this activity would be lost.</p>
<p>2. I also thought about the possibility of them working collaboratively to produce a wiki and thought we could take perhaps an essay question and ask them to combine their collective intelligence and produce a first rate answer or to engage with some aspect of the module content, such as an outline of the law making process in parliament and by the judiciary. My thinking here was to take something which the students tend to find rather dry at the start of the module and help them to engage more actively with this to ensure that these foundations of the English Legal System are fully understood.</p>
<p>Alternatively I thought of asking them in a tutorial to perhaps put together a Youtube video on one of these drier areas of law to try to engage them with the content in a fun way. This, like the wiki, would incolve collaborative working and ought to enhance the learning expperience for the student. I would then ask each group to critique the video of the other group.</p>
<p>Just some thoughts.</p>
<p>Grateful for comments or other similar ideas shared.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Maddy</p>    </div>
