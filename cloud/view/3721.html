			<p><a href="http://dougclow.wordpress.com/2010/05/25/calrg-conf-what-do-players-think/" rel="nofollow">Doug's liveblog notes crossposted</a>:</p>
<p>Rationale &ndash; Malone et al on games as intrinsically motivating, trying to harness for learning. Gee on how games promote active/critical learning, throuhg participation in affinity groups, semiotic domains &ndash; link to CoPs.</p>
<p>But lack of empirical evidence &ndash; especially outside MMORPGs. Potential often unrealised &ndash; not successful, lack of integration, socio-cultural factors. So need to further our understanding about how engagement, motivation and learning come together in practice. Link breaks down in some contexts.</p>
<p>Audiences are changing &ndash; from stereotypical young, male, semi-evil player, to family young/old male/female cooperative play. Games are more socially acceptable and prevalent &ndash; but we don&rsquo;t know much about that.</p>
<p>So RQs around: motivation to play games, what affects engagement, how they describe learning, and the links between motivation, engagement and learning.</p>
<p>Looking at adults. Interview &ndash; 30 email interviews, 20 male 10 female, range of different game players. Used DGEM (Digital Game Experience Model, Calleja 2007) as unifying framework, and thematic analysis.&nbsp;DGEM model has six different frames, on two levels: macro involvement, engagement outside the game (motivation); micro involvement is about actual instances of game play, specific episodes (engagement). Less &lsquo;immersion&rsquo;. &nbsp;Macro/micro involvement.</p>
<p>Asking about motivations, reasons, and how they learn, approach new game, whether they think they&rsquo;re learning anything, and how they interact with other people.</p>
<p>Found some reports of general learning ideas, skills, etc. Also inspiration to look up stuff related to the game played; also self-knowledge.</p>
<p>Categories emerging:</p>
<p>Learning how: through play, others (paratexts &ndash; reviews, walkthroughs, forums; other players), tangentially.</p>
<p>Learning what: the game, different skills (psycho-motor, cognitive, metacognitive, collaborative), personal growth.</p>
<p>Trying to relate involvement &ndash; micro and macro &ndash; to learning. Also interested in &lsquo;Gaming capital&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Micro-involvement: progress, rewards, effort. Macro-involvement: expectations, resources (guides, wlkthrough, cheats, friends).</p>
<p>Gaming capital &ndash; Consalvo 2007 &ndash; reworking of Bourdieu&rsquo;s cultural capital. Not just being good at games, but knowledgeable about them; paratexts as a way of gaining. Four themes emerging in the analysis &ndash; competence, knowledge [...]. &ldquo;1337 players don&rsquo;t get stuck &hellip; oh, all right then&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Questions she&rsquo;s pursuing &ndash; which of the learning categories would be useful to consider in relation to gaming capital, how it relates to micro/macro involvement, and whether it&rsquo;s useful to distinguish between identity and community.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 1.6em; color: #000000; text-decoration: none; margin: 30px 0px 0px;">Questions</h2>
<p>Jeff: Identity and community as two sides of the same coin; CoP view. But games not great as CoPs because not necessarily wanting to become central, some would be happy to stay on the outside of that community.</p>
<p>Jo: CoP mostly about levels of participation. Gaming capital explains why someone wants to be part of that community. Can you be part of a community if you don&rsquo;t have an identity, if you don&rsquo;t see yourself as being a member?</p>
<p>Martin O: It&rsquo;s an analytic term &ndash; could be in a community but not see yourself as being one. Also constellations of practice &ndash; lots of small pockets with things in common.</p>
<p>Caroline: Interesting use of concept of capital &ndash; notion is to individualise it, creates tension between people who have capital, who trade it in a particular market, in Bourdieu&rsquo;s terms. There are other models of looking at CoP that don&rsquo;t use the notion of capital, more about how people differentiate themselves across time or practice. Looks at how the whole system works, at a group level.</p>
<p>Jo: Individuals form the groups</p>
<p>Caroline: Depends where you are coming from methodologically.</p>
<p>Jo: Interested in those frameworks.</p>
<p>Caroline: Comes out of CoP work, doesn&rsquo;t use notion of capital, looking at the whole rather than the sociological history of individuals.</p>
<p>Jo: Gaming capital based on cultural capital but doesn&rsquo;t strongly explore sociological histories. Not sure want to call these communities CoPs. Is it a small set of serious, dedicated group of gamers? Or does it include anyone who plays a game?</p>			<div class="posted-by">
