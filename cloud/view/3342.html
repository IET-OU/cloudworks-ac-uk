                   <p>I suggest we use the Nonaka and Takeuchi SECI model of the four modes of knowledge transfer to understand the AL's role. &nbsp;Here are the modes:</p>
<p>1 - Socialisation (tacit individual knowledge to tacit individual knowledge)</p>
<p>2 - Externalisation (this is where the tacit concepts move towards becoming explicit and codified and get transformed into digital and paper format)</p>
<p>3 - Combination (this is the course material that is delivered to the student in the box)</p>
<p>4 - Internalisation (this is where the AL comes in.)</p>
<p>In course design at the OU BS the first three modes of knowledge transfer are the preserve of the course team that has written the material. &nbsp;Course delivery is where the fourth mode of transfer comes in.</p>
<p>The tutor has to take the explicit material from the combination mode of knowledge transfer, add personal tacit knowledge to it--such as experience of business. &nbsp;S/he helps the student to transform the explicit knowledge from the course team into tacit knowledge at a higher level.</p>
<p>Then the spiral takes another turn. &nbsp;The student, through the externalisation mode of knowledge transfer&nbsp;will make explicit what s/he has learned, in the form of the tutor marked assignments). &nbsp;At residential schools and in tutorials the "Socialisation" mode of knowledge transfer is used.</p>
<p>The four modes of knowledge transfer are explained in Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi's book:</p>

                   <p>Congratulations John on again pioneering a sharing technology for us. Quoting from your text about the tutor's role:</p>
<p>"S/he helps the student to transform the explicit knowledge from the  course team into tacit knowledge at a higher level."</p>
<p>This is the key step from an AL viewpoint. What we could further explore is:</p>
<p>What is it that makes the difference between effective and ineffective&nbsp; AL help for this transformation process? For most of the time we are in (remote) contact with students, it's not about knowledge transfer at all. The student is doing the transforming and the AL acts as a catalyst.</p>
<p>"Catalysts that speed the reaction are called positive catalysts.  Catalysts that slow the reaction are called negative catalysts, or  inhibitors." So we want to identify what makes us positive. Note also that&nbsp; "Although catalysts are not consumed by the reaction itself, they may be  inhibited, deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes"!</p>

                   <p>Additionally we developed the notion of AL's using Social Networking and KM approaches as:</p>
<p>Co-Creators - using platforms to share and create best practice with colleagues and Course Teams</p>
<p>Teachers - using platforms (such as Elluminate) for teaching and tutorial purposes</p>
<p>Catalysts - enabling and supporting students (Manager Learners) in using platforms to collaborate for tbeir own learning purposes</p>
<p>We're looking at a matrix output of roles and platforms</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi all</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to meet up with you all and we have an exciting rpoject ahead of us to support the 4 dimensions posted by Paul for the new generation of MBA courses.I agree with Julian,this is a journey for us all and by particpating in the process hopefully as early adopters we can share good practices in the use of the digital -epsace/platfroms&nbsp; that will also enhance practicebased e-management development.I thought you might all be interested in this Mckinsey article (sorry keith I know I should ahve used a RSS feed:)</p>

                   <p>Thanks also from me to all colleagues for your insights and camaraderie.&nbsp;I'm hoping we will be able to&nbsp;make a lot of progress. <br /><br />One quick point about the&nbsp;SECI model is that it has been&nbsp;heavily criticised by western KM academics for claiming that you can interconvert tacit&nbsp;and explicit knowledge.&nbsp;In practical terms, if you discard&nbsp;the&nbsp;tacit - explicit dimensions and concentrate on the 4 steps of the SECI&nbsp;cycle,&nbsp;it seems&nbsp;to provide a&nbsp;reasonable description of how teams create knowledge in practice.&nbsp;What is 'E'xternalised is perhaps better called&nbsp;information, i.e. knowledge minus the context and the knower.&nbsp;(A map doesn't read itself.)<br /><br />So SECI is workable, but it's also right enough to be dangerously wrong, which perhaps offers a good teaching point about the need for critical thinking in the practical application of theory.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I came back to a realisation that First Class is about to be turned off and the VLE start up on the 10E presentations. So this is imminent for the AL population.</p>
<p>B820 is starting a "buddy system" for using the VLE but it strikes me that it will shake a few people out of their comfort zones when they have to start using the VLE in a few weeks time.</p>
<p>So I think the timing might be quite good for Crewe, and I wonder if it might be something that gets raised as part of a moan session in Barcelona?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Paul and KMSN team</p>
<p>One point on this-what about courses that are already running i.e. are half way through the presentation such as B700-09K/BZ713-09K? It would be very disruptive if both tutors and students could not continue with current TGF arrangements-unless the TGF's will only be accessible via the web version at tutor/student home ? Perhaps Keiyth can asnwer this one</p>        </div>

                   <p>I think it's a rolling switchover. The 6 month 09K courses like B820 09K have First Class for TGA's but the 10E starts will use the VLE. This is in 12 days time though. B700 09K will continue with FC until they end and the next presentation will be using the VLE.</p>
<p>To be honest I had completely forgotten as I don't tutor on the E presentations (though that may be about to change). However it hasn't been heavily trailed for people so the reality is about to kick in.</p>        </div>

                   <p>John,</p>
<p>I take your point about the SECI model and I agree that there is not much of a difference between explicit knowledge and information, if any. &nbsp;What is important is the ability to use knowledge/information to increase competency and to&nbsp;contextualize&nbsp;a body of written material so that it engages the student.</p>        </div>

<p>Thanks for your write up John; have skim read &nbsp;and I will add my comments and notes tomorrow, including first thoughts on the material for Saturdays event. &nbsp;I'm afraid my own time has been limited the last two days but I have read all the posts with which I broadly concur. Although I'm one of the AL's with change to VLE pending, I think we should not let this deflect us from our overall aims - but yes, a good, live case study!!</p>

                   <p>Great stuff&nbsp;and lots to do!</p>
<p>We've got a "discussion" here as per the "contribute to the discussion" box, but I agree with a forum post that said maybe better to discuss in the forum, as this seems not so discussed focussed to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re the switch over to VLE forums, this is not happening mid presentation.&nbsp; It will only happen at the start of a new presentation, so e.g. B700 starting last November will continue to use FClass through the whole presentation,&nbsp; FClass itself will be around till 2011 certainly, but with a managed and staged exit from it.</p>
<p>I have tried not to make a big deal of it with my tutors - but perhaps I should have :)</p>

                   <p>Ok I agree VL may be more appropriate but a first a couple of comments here:</p>
<p>1. Just spend an hour in learning mode as tutor who may have to move to VLE on 1 May. Been through the VLE training and info pages. Quite scary as trying to stay in learner mode but also monitoring my responses psychological&nbsp; and otherwise. For example...&nbsp;'s**t why didn't I do more than skim a few weeks back...why hasn't the B820 course team said ANYTHING...are we actually moving...oh but I like some of the tools...but where is the overview so you can see the whole picture...'</p>
<p>I'm sure that may be representative of the majority of AL's especially if there has been no message (and still none even after my email) from some course teams. Maybe we can use some of this dialogue to&nbsp;gain some empathy with the group on Saturday?</p>
<p>2. May be worth looking at or following as I am for some of you, found this: <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3327" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3327</a></p>

                   <p>Hi Julian and all</p>
<p>&nbsp;Determinism holds that everything is caused (determined) by a sequence of events that operate in a predictable way based upon past events .</p>
<p>This suggests that technological determinism is based on the idea that humans have little or no responsibility for controlling technology. The social constructivist model assumes the relevance of social groups&nbsp;who encourage flexibility in the design of the technology. The idea of whether virtual collaboration in VLE&rsquo;s work effectively or not, as Weller (2006) suggests, depends on the level of contribution, and whether the approach aligns to the users&rsquo; own values.</p>
<p>Some argue that technology doesn't alter our behaviours but rather simply enables us to do the same things differently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Weller (2006) debates on how decentralization (i.e.no managerial control dictating how a technology is used) is key to e-learning processes. What does this say about the use of Virtual Learning Environment (VLE&rsquo;s) ? Weller quotes Castell (2002),that' the internet can enable networks to compete against the traditional centralised models of control of learning and encouraging adaptability and flexibility.</p>
<p>From my experience in designing and moderating VLE&rsquo;s via web ct for example-,the teacher has autonomy to decide on which tools are appropriate for the task at hand. So my feeling here Julian is that we should not be overwhelmed by the technology and be focused on the &lsquo;must&rsquo; list of using tools&nbsp;post- first class usage, but more, that AL&rsquo;s and students can decide on appropriate tools for achieving the task(s) at hand. It seems the OUBS are allowing us all in the AL community to trial /experiment without pre-determining which tools we should use in the new generation of VLE's. I think we need to re-assure the OUBS&nbsp; AL community that this is an evolving process and the moodle VLE's in the first instance will be kept as simple as possible and that both learners and teachers are given e-space to develop e-learning innovations and in partnership betwen learner and provider. I gained a good slice of learning from&nbsp;students when triailing elluminate-but we were all in a 'level playing field'-learning together.</p>
<p>This may well suit the &lsquo;digital natives of the future generations as suggested by Prensky (2001).</p>
<p>Whilst I agree with Fenella that pedagogy should drive the technology,however ,it is my personal view that practice-based management learning requires e-management development in this global network of e-communications in day to day e-business/e-commerce and social networking .I think we would all agree on this point.The OUBS e-learning should therefore also be seen as a 'process'&nbsp; in management development.</p>
<p>Sometimes perhaps&nbsp;,the 'big bang'&nbsp; approach to introducing new technology is in the long run -more effective and research suggest that e-moderators should persist even when the going gets tough with e-hygiene factors ,Herzberg style:)</p>
<p>any thoughts &nbsp;from the project teams ?</p>
<p>BEST WISHES</p>
