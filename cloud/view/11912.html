        <p>Literature evaluation benefits from multiple perspectives (Savonick, 2018), and collaboration, communication and problem solving are viewed as key 21st century skills (Lombardi, 2007; Johnson <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Creating and curating an alternative mini-MOOC using Trello addresses these requirements.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lack of proper information on how to search relevant OER&rsquo; (Athabasca University. and Raisamo, 2000), and the skills to find &lsquo;fit for purpose&rsquo; (Kawachi, 2014) resources can influence students&rsquo; and teachers&rsquo; perception of open resources.</p>
<p>This project delivers a set of &nbsp;reusable learning materials, using the Trello software platform, to support students with a set GCSE literature text ,The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (AQA, nd). The powerful theme of duality in humans is as relevant for the 21<sup>st</sup> century as it was for Victorian Britain (Rankin, 2010). The BBC Bitesize website contains comprehensive study material on the text (BBC Bitesize, nd), but it has to be accessed online, and the resources are not downloadable or reusable. Revision questions are mainly multiple choice type which doesn&rsquo;t allow for real &lsquo;problem solving&rsquo; and &lsquo;deep thinking&rsquo;, nor &lsquo;collaboration&rsquo; (Brown, 2018). Other valuable resources available are mainly university and individual school resources, which are available online, but without an obvious licence that allows for reuse or adaptation.</p>
<p>Within the conference theme of implementation, this project therefore has as its goal a collection of resources, addressed by chapter in a MOOC-like style. It deviates from MOOC&rsquo;s as resources will be reusable and adaptable with a focus on problem solving, rather than multiple choice question. Students would benefit most from attempting it collaboratively. While the focus is on revision and study for GCSE students, it has the potential to be of value to a wider audience. Literature has many interpretations and can be influenced by personal context, culture and perceptions. Collaborative perspectives can therefore only add to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the text.</p>
<p>Trello is a project management website, but there is evidence that it can be used successfully as an educational curation and collaboration work space (Bettstetter, 2016; Martin K, 2018; Moon, 2018). Apart from being a collaborative space, the main advantage is the ability to upload and download adaptable resource documents and to create links to other available resources.</p>
<p>The OER Research Hub found that &lsquo;the more educators used OER, the more willing they were to share&rsquo;(Weller <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Hopefully users of this project material will be prepared to share their repurposed resources to help build a workspace voicing a variety of perspectives and interpretations to aid better understanding and enjoyment of the text and its value. &lsquo;Optimising the usability of the teaching and learning materials produced is one of the most important challenges involved in developing OERs&rsquo; (Whitfield and Robinson, 2012).</p>
<p>The conference presentation will discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>the value of reusable open resources.</li>
<li>Jekyll and Hyde as a text choice and the importance of collaboration in analysing texts.</li>
<li>the effectiveness of Trello as a curating space.</li>
<li>what is meant by &lsquo;an alternative mini-MOOC&rsquo;.</li>
<li>plans for dissemination.</li>
</ul>

                   <p>Hi Annette, this is great, looking forward to your talk. I'm just getting back in the swing of things after an unexpected long period of illness.</p>
<p>After reading your abstract, going to check out the Martin reference on Trello as I had not come across that one.</p>
<p>It's a shame I'm on after Robin de Rosa and not you as your citation regarding publishing 'flawed work' would go well after her talk!&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Hi Kelly. Thank you. I need to tidy up the extract a bit. Have a look on Martin K's blog Mind-Lab Journey. There isn't much, but he explains how he involves the students and their parents on Trello doing maths.</p>
<p>Robin is very inspiring in her passion for sharing education and I love the idea of 'flawed work'. Especially in literature where there are so many ideas and interpretations that one person can never extract all these possibilities from a text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glad you are back.</p>

                   Hi  Annette, 
Really happy to see how your work has evolved. Enjoyed your poster and glad you seem to have nailed the audio narrative. You and Kelly have really captured my imagination. 
Congratulations         </div>

<p>It would be interesting to hear what he thinks. The more I use Trello the more I like it. Some of my A-level students are considering trying it as a study area. Will be interesting to see how that goes, as well.</p>        </div>

If they want to change or add to any of the resources they are welcome to send it to me and I will upload it. That is part of the idea. I will credit them if they wish or they can stay anonymous. There is still so much that can be added, so please show them and let me know what they think.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Annette,</p>
<p>It is a really interesting idea to use Trello for offering OER and as a collaborative space for learners to interact with course materials and other learners. I have just had a look at it can see how you design your miniMOOC. Learning is mostly self-paced but you can also provide support to learners who have logged in to Trello and formed groups, I understand? In my own miniMOOC project I find it quite challenging to balance self-paced activities and instructor-guided activities.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi David</p>
<p>Yes I think I am focussing for the moment more on resources I know my students need and as I use it in class they are more assisted than somebody that might find the resources and use it for their own learning, formal or informal. On the other hand, any teacher can download the resources and use it on an in-house platform or as printed resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The balancing act is always difficult and I suppose you have to fit it into a certain amount of hours. It is always difficult with a new program as there are so many variables that can influence it</p>        </div>

                   Dear Annette 

Really interesting project.  I think it is great that as both Kelly and you are both using Trello you can actively digitally network and share resources etc. 

I really like the re-use element of your OER and think it will have great benefits for teachers to use it for self directed learning for their students or supported learning as you describe.

Trello is an amazing tool, I am going to try it out in my health library to create some OER solutions for some of the challenges we face. Trello seems to be a more cost effective and user friendly platform.  I have already shown your website to colleagues and they are equally as inspired as I am to give it a go. 

All the best with your presentation, I am looking forward to it.        </div>

                   <p>Hi Potenza. Trello is a really useful platform and I think the ease of use is one of the main benefits. Its functionality for things such as font size and so on can be better. Kelly mentioned this in Open Studio as well. As a project management tool, I suppose, those features are not such a priority. But if they can upgrade that it can become so much more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will find it very easy and well organised to upload open resources and to provide links. If you add all the parties involved to the team, they can all upload and share links and ideas. So far it has been free and I've creaed various boards and they haven't stopped me yet.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Annette,</p>
<p>Inspired by your Mini-Mooc, my partner who works as a History and Polictics A-level lecturer will be creating something in a similar vein. He'll proabbly ask me to start it! He thinks it will suit the US politics course well for those who have no experience or limited knowledge of that system and a Trello Mooc will make a well suited point to start.</p>
<p>All the best for the presentation tomorrow!</p>

                   <p>Hi Kelly</p>
<p>That is great. Well you know Trello so well by now; if he gives you all the resources, you can do it in no time. You can always ask for payment for your expertise :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see how well it works when students use it independently. I couldn't really test if my description for each chapter is clear enough as the students used it while I was around and because of time limits I couldn't really spend time on them figuring it out for themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the good wishes and I am so sorry I won't be able to attend your presentation, but at least I had the preview and will watch the recording again as I will use it for my EMA. 'See' you tomorrow.</p>

                   <p>Thanks Simon. I will group the answers and start with the problem of advertising on open resourses.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Annette great point - very distracting sidebar ads</strong></li>
<li><strong>Good point re the distractions of advertsing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure many students will be able to use the resources (and many of these are good resources) without much effort and distraction. For students with ASD or ADHD it is definitely problematic and it creates barriers to their learning. I am not sure if it is actually breaking the disability laws but there is not a way to stop the videos from playing and according to <a href="https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/photosensitive-epilepsy/web-design" rel="nofollow">epilepsy action&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;'[i]f the user is unable to control the flickering, blinking and moving (this includes stopping these effects from starting), then these effects should not be used'.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Questions about Trello.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is trello free or cost-based?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Trello is free but with the paid version you can have more power-upps, which are features such as Draw.io, Google Drive and so on.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Where do you see the future of Trello being used by students and teachers as a collaboration between two countries</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>It is very possible when you create a team. The students can be from anywhere in the world and they can all collaborate on the same board.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>I love this use of trello, and think it's great that students are getting practical experience of project management</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>My long term goal is for them to control the board and the resources. This is if and when I can convice the school that it is a safe space for them to work.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very creative use of Trello! Thanks Annette. I liked your point about not using talking heads but instead affording students their own interpretation</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried very hard with all the resources to rather ask questions and give some ideas to think about rather than to provide answers, which will ultimately be my interpretation. I was thinking a video where a few students discuss their own ideas about the text - a bit of vicarious learning - might not be a bad idea, but that would be another can of worms especially on an open board.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

<p>That is very true and why I focused on adaptable resources, which can be changed instantly by the learner to fit their preference. I have a couple of dyslexic learners and it works well for them.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

<p>Not really. The school is complex with many issues around digital learning. I did however, showed it to some of my previous GCSE students, who are now doing A-level ( not necessarily in English, but they did GCSE with me) who liked it. But none of them did a really proper review. Most just said it looks easy to use and they like the resources.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <ul>
<li><strong>How can you make trello work sustainable?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have you kept the same resources at alternative plaforms as well?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;It is impossible to say if the platform will be sustainable. I hope that the basic package will stay free. None of the resources are actually hosted on Trello so if the worse happens, I will be able to move it somewhere else. The one or two videos and Prezis I've used are hosted on vimeo and Prezi, but I doubt if I will use those again as they are not adaptable and not really suitable for my aim to have adaptable resources.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Annette,</p>
<p>Sorry that I dropped of the radar a litte, we had a very sudden and shocking family beravement at the end of January that has thorwn everything out of kilter. &nbsp;However, I have been reading your cloud and wanted to share what my twins had said about your Trello - I did promise you I would ask them to look at it remember?</p>
<p>Anyway, they did and I am sorry that I did not get this to you in time for your conference. &nbsp;Being boys they were not massively chatty as you can imagine but they did like it - as you have been told, it's easy to use, they particularly liked the mind map and even came up with bits to add to this - happy to send you a picture of what they wrote if you want! &nbsp;</p>
<p>But, the single thing about it, that made the biggest impact on them - as Yr11 students was the idea that they could add to it, would be encouraged to add to it, they could change it - that their opinions would be valuued in this way. I apprecite that this is not really about the content or the platform but it does show wider benefits about what you are doing, shows its value beyond these elements of the project. &nbsp;As their parent I was really encouraged by this, I think for a long time education has been about a lot of spoonfeeding, getting students to actively engage in their own learning is a real positive I took from your project and I was pelased that my boys had reconginsed this - there is hope for them yet!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Sioban</p>
<p>This is excellent. I would love a picture of what they wrote. I can use this perfectly for the EMA if they don't mind me using their picture. This is exactly the idea of the project&nbsp; that it can be adaptable and that they can add their own bits and make changes. I am very glad to hear that they found it useful. Please send me the picture and ask them if it will be ok for me to use it in my EMA.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
