                   <p>In many ways the document wasn't directly related to the questions but I guess was designed as a springboard for thought.</p>
<p>Whilst reading through i answered the questions as follows:</p>
<p>How do you and your      colleagues get new ideas?</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 0.375in; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;" type="1"> </ol>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">The only learning design activities I might be involved in would be face to face tutorials. Aha and in fact that is not an 'only'. I was working on the preconceived notion that learning design was for courses overall but that it very much not the case. <em>Note that this was written as I was going along, hence the realisation which I cannot imagine I am the only one to have experienced</em></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;How do you and      your&nbsp;colleagues design learning activities?</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 0.375in; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;" type="1"> </ol>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">Very individually. There is little sharing, which in many ways seems silly as that means that everyone creates all resources time and again rather than pooling them. <em>It is interesting that the document does indicate the benefits of the sharing.</em></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;What resources and support      are required/used?</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 0.375in; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;" type="1"> </ol>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">Depends on what and who you know really. Often it is what you stumble across or else you know what you want to cover and try to find some way of designing activities to cover that.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>What issues do new      technologies raise for teaching and learning?</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 0.375in; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;" type="1"> </ol>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">Access and availability in face to face tutorials. I luckily have access to a laptop and projector for all of my tutorials now but that did not used to be the case so it is a chalk and talk or death by worksheets concept for many people.</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>I thought the article was useful for directing attention to questions about the way learning is constructed both in&nbsp;a face to face and a distance context.&nbsp; In particular that distance learning has to be more 'user-proofed' than face to face learning as remedying it at the point of delivery is more difficult or impossible.</p>
<p>The concept of design interests me but does imply a much greater investment in understanding the user and their interaction with the learning materials and I wonder if there might be a 'return on investment' question that needs to be addressesed - does the design process improve the product or the earnings from it etc..</p>
<p>On the questions:</p>
<p>How do you and your colleagues get new ideas?</p>
<p>I&nbsp;do write one-day training courses in my 'day job' for Citizens Advice.&nbsp; The ideas for courses usually come from perceived needs of advisers and others for learning on a particular topic.&nbsp; I think the topic tends to drive the whole course with learning activities being a secondary consideration and on the whole we have relatively limited discussions about how the activites facilitate or improve learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you and your&nbsp;colleagues design learning activities?</p>
<p>As with Isaella - it seems to be a very individual process.&nbsp; I think it tends to be a repetition of what seems to have worked before - although why it worked is probably a bit vauge.</p>
<p>What resources and support are required/used?</p>
<p>I think something that links an activity or intervantion to learning outcomes would be useful.&nbsp; For example if being able to describe fundamental parts of the subject is a basis for further learning then what activities produce the best outcomes for learning description.&nbsp; I have been reading some things on evidence based teaching by Geoff Petty which goes in that sort of direction and is very interesting.&nbsp; Having these sort of building blocks to incorporate into the design process would be good.&nbsp; And time for design needs to be created as certainly initially it is an extra element and will add time until it is assimilated.</p>
<p>What issues do new new technologies raise for teaching and learning?</p>
<p>Lots I guess.&nbsp; I think the potential of wider access and consumption in different ways is immense.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been having a look at 'webinar' technology which is growing in use in professional training - that is very cheap (sometimes free) and easy to set up now and allows a lot of interaction at a distance with learners.&nbsp; That seems to be producing lots of learning outside mainstream routes by people who set up such services and maybe an expectation from learners on what should be offered by other insitutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked the LAMS system for producing sequences of learning with standard modules which provides technology for the teacher as well as the learner.</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <div>I find the document quite thought-provoking, especially as a starting point in this journey for developing good understandings of &nbsp;two interactive terms, 'learning design' and learning activities', with an aim to benefit all involving in good academic practice in teaching and delivery. However, few issues can be &nbsp;considered, for example, generic vs specific learning activities and learning design, pool of activities and programme development, and developing module on learning design and activities for different organizations.</div>
<div></div>
<div>if i may share my views of the activities below:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>How do you and your colleagues get new ideas?</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>This actually varies a lot, depending on the timeframe, aims and objectives of accessing new ideas, learning outcomes and intended learners/audiences, etc., From a general level, usually through research, literature search, informal discussion, past experiences, and implicit thinking.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>How do you and your&nbsp;colleagues design learning activities?</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>We follow the instruction from the course team and then apply any innovative ideas, previous effective designs and learning activities.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>What resources and support are required/used?</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>The resources from the learning design team will be useful, and the development of appropriate tools can guide appropriate design and delivery, with a focus on the module aims and learning outcomes.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>What issues do new new technologies raise for teaching and learning?</strong></li>
<li>Practicality, user-perspective, easy-to-learn</li>
<li>Cost-effective, managable, timeframe</li>
<li>Theoretical model underpinning any new design technology</li>
<li>Evidence-based technology</li>
<li>Application and intervention</li>
<li>Subject-focused and ethical issues</li>
</ul>

                   <p>How do you and your      colleagues get new ideas?</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"><em>I have had to design learning activities for face to face tutorials and also on-line tutorials, using Elluminate.&nbsp; With both of these I have obtained ideas from reading around and also asking for ideas etc from other colleagues.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not designed any activities using the forums or the wiki though students have used wikis for online projects.</em><em></em></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;How do you and      your&nbsp;colleagues design learning activities?</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"><em>The activities are initially done on my own but then I will also post material on a teaching forum to share with others in the hope that they will also share some of their materials.&nbsp; In my experience, I think it is a pity that more sharing is not done.&nbsp; We are all beavering away trying to come up with various learning activities when we can be more efficient if we share ideas.&nbsp;</em><em></em></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;What resources and support      are required/used?</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"><em>It depends - if you use online tutorial facilities then you need to have access to the software and also ensure that students have access to microphones etc.&nbsp; I have had online tutorials where no one had a microphone switched on and it just ended up being an online 'chat' session with some overheads added to the whiteboard.&nbsp; I found it really constraining as there was very little interaction.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"><em>Support - timely and effective training is important to ensure that you know the potential of the technology otherwise you can find yourself a bit limted. </em></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>What issues do new      technologies raise for teaching and learning?</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"><em>There is the issue of confidentiallity if you are going to record an online tutorial.&nbsp; Usually in a face to face tutorial it does not tend to get recorded (unless there are special cricumstances).&nbsp; Also the technology hinders the flow of conversation and perhaps therefore the creativity in the learning.&nbsp; It is a bit link asking someone to draw and rather than use a pencil they will use the IT software.&nbsp; It hinders the flow - IMO!</em></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.375in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11pt;"><em>There are however benefits eg ease of access and also avaoiding having to prepare material for a tutorial that only one or two turn up.&nbsp; This way you leave it on the web and students can access it at their convenience. </em></p>        </div>

                   <p><strong>How do you and your colleagues get new ideas?</strong></p>
<p><em>Discussions and materials shared on Tutor forums, staff development days, sharing material through the resources bank-this happens on the Openings courses with the Open University that I am on. own professional development&nbsp; and vocational experiences through individual courses attended/articles read and my &lsquo;day&rsquo; job as an educational psychologist.</em></p>
<p><strong>How do you and your colleagues design learning activities?</strong></p>
<p><em>Mixture of individual (as has been mentioned previously) as well as shared activities (as noted in previous question). It looks as if more material may be shared in the future as more tutorial time is shared by teams of tutors across cohorts of students&nbsp; online.</em></p>
<p><strong>What resources and support are required/used?</strong></p>
<p><em>Still doing a lot of face to face tutorials at present but take up from students is low. Have attempted to use a tutor group forum to generate discussion across my own students on different topics-but take up has been low. Am thinking of a targeted approach using Elluminate for small groups of students initially inviting them to take part personally through email first-looking for example at various study skills that are required for writing essays/putting together reports. Still experimenting with the technology here and starting very small scale!</em></p>
<p><strong>What issues do new technologies raise for teaching and learning</strong>?</p>
<p>I<em> think Elluminate is somewhat &lsquo;clunky&rsquo; at times. I agree with Ariana that the conversation flow can be hindered and creativity lost to some extent and am still looking at the best way that a tool such as Elluminate can be used with students so that it enhances the learning rather than trying to make the&nbsp; learning &lsquo;fit&rsquo; the technology. It seems from discussion with colleagues that small and focused, with good preparation beforehand with a clear set of direct teaching/learning aims and inviting a selected audience rather than a general open invite works best in this instance if using this tool.&nbsp;</em></p>

                   <ol>
<li>How do you and your colleagues get new ideas? </li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from the OU teacher forum, I am a member of many teaching for a, ning groups and other social networking groups specialising in language education.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you and your&nbsp;colleagues design learning activities? </li>
</ol>
<p>Many of the materials used are produced centrally by the Course Team (especially those that are used for Elluminate tutorials). However, I, like most other tutors, develop my own tutorial materials based on the needs of a specific group or depending where students are in their programme. Sometimes students approach me with specific requests for certain activities or topics, but most is based on error analysis of TMAs and performance in tutorials.</p>
<ol>
<li>What resources and support are required/used? </li>
</ol>
<p>Tutors have access to LORO, an online depository where resources for use with Elluminate (whiteboards&amp;PowerPoints) have been uploaded. Tutors can download as well as upload from there. As all language tutors can deposit resources, it is a useful tool, as resources in other courses and languages can be viewed, downloaded and can be adapted for one&rsquo;s one purposes.</p>
<ol>
<li>What issues do new new technologies raise for teaching and learning? </li>
</ol>
<p>I personally feel that at times too much is expected of students in terms of understanding and using new technology, which can distract from their main studies. Many students find Elluminate daunting or find it difficult to participate in online tutorials, either because of the technology or because of the fact that they cannot hear each other well enough due to less than perfect sound quality. While this may not be such an issue when the native language is spoken, this can become a real obstacle in a foreign language.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I found this so interesting, coming in to read about l/Learning d/Design straight from spending two 3 hour sessions being trained in how to use Elluminate this last week...</p>
<p>1. NEW IDEAS:</p>
<p>In those sessions I learnt a lot from other colleagues about our great differences in considering design of a tutorial activity, even in the same course, for a first tutorial. Less is definitely more in the Elluminate whiteboard space.</p>
<p>I've also learnt much along the way, not just in OU teaching, working in teams, and appreciating people's very different styles and attention to different details that they think important.</p>
<p>I've been tutoring in online forums for the last couple of years and have been surprised by how sociable the learning and teaching become for us all, students and tutors.</p>
<p>2. DESIGNING LEARNING ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>I refer back to the profound influence Eric Sotto (author of 'When teaching becomes learning' London: Cassell) had on me in the way in which I try to think about what the learner is actively doing in a session, not what I as tutor am delivering/transmitting. This is the primary shift that seems to enable creative design, whether it is a simple handout, or a whiteboard presentation, whatever.</p>
<p>3. RESOURCES &amp; SUPPORT</p>
<p>A wide range of things: from a working home printer to produce the handouts, through to good quality staff training on e.g. moderating an online forum, practising using the tools available on Elluminate etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. ISSUES FROM NEW TECHNOLOGIES</p>
<p>There is a point at which it is a waste of tutor and student time to fiddle around with a projector that is dysfunctional and it is better to decide to give up and wave pictures about and talk about them, however beautiful the prepared slide show was.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that anything new takes time to get used to, and there needs to be messing about time for staff to explore and discover whatever new technology comes along, and to have the opportunity to let the creative process that is design begin to dawn.</p>
<p>But the central thing to hang onto is the consideration of how the learner is spending their time: in active engagement as much as possible, regardless of the particular means of communication.</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>Before I approach responding to the four questions posed, I would like to include a bit about my association with the OU as an AL, which may put some of my contributions in context.&nbsp; I have worked with the OU as an AL for seven years.&nbsp; Currently I am tutoring on an undergraduate, Level 1, work based module:&nbsp; <em>Supporting learning in primary schools</em>, which is the first module in a suite of modules that make up a course of study leading to a Foundation Degree in Teaching and Learning in Primary Schools.&nbsp; I come to the OU with a background in Early Years and Primary education and my research interests include the enhancement of opportunities for critical and creative thinking and lifelong learning/enquiry.</p>
<p>At this juncture, I am able to identify some reasons for my enthusiasm for being involved in this Design-Practice Project:&nbsp; I am curious as to what is meant by Learning Design and learning design; how I might be able make use of what I learn from being involved in the project in the development of my abilities in generating and presenting module materials to my students; this projects provides a platform to be involved with the wider OU community; I am curious to evaluate the time I need to pursue the training compared with the suggested five hours.</p>
<p>How do you and your colleagues get new ideas?&nbsp; through reading, research, dialogue, experimenting/playing around</p>
<p>How do you and your&nbsp;colleagues design learning activities?&nbsp; within the context of my work as an AL this is an independent process; my starting point is usually the concepts and principles addressed in the module materials that I want to insure that&nbsp; my students are competent in their knowledge, understanding and application; review of and refection on the requirements of the individual students within the tutor group and then endeavour to construct learning activities that will address both considerations</p>
<p>What resources and support are required/used?&nbsp; the module materials, my subject knowledge and experience, literature review, online research</p>
<p>What issues do new new technologies raise for teaching and learning?&nbsp; firstly, I notice the repeat of the word new new;&nbsp; now, to get on to considering the question, insuring that a computer linked to a SmartBoard is available at the venue where I will be presenting the monthly face-to-face tutorial; supporting students in accessing the module online materials, online module forums and additional research materials</p>        </div>

                   <p>I hadn't really thought about it before reading the contributions from Ian and Ariana but I will have the chance to test some of these ideas as I have to develop some resources for Elluminate as one of my courses will be reducing its face to face hours from next year.&nbsp; As many of the tutors haven't used Elluminate, if some resources can be developed for them to just use then this might be a good start and encourage them about the use of IT.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Some interesting thoughts in the article. I hadn't realised it originally meant the technical XML side of design.</p>
<p><strong>How do I get new ideas?</strong></p>
<p>Reading resources available on OU site, accessing shared resources on course website, books, chatting to other tutors. I'm a trainer in organisations as well and I go through a similar process, looking at the web, books, etc. And also using stuff that I've seen other trainers use, e.g. when I'm on a course.</p>
<p><strong>How do we design?</strong></p>
<p>On DSE141 we've had a fantastic Tutorial Resources Forum where tutors have shared what activities, slides, etc they've created. The Course Team have been collating these and adding them to the Tutor part of the website. This has been brilliant and there's been evidence of a tutor adapting something someone else posted and then posting that up. Other than that, everyone designs their own tutorials. However, on the online forum tutorials, our cluster group tutors do email around ideas for activities and we come to some agreement on what to post up.</p>
<p><strong>Resources and support needed?</strong></p>
<p>Technical understanding, time and more time, technical support, access to other people's ideas/examples</p>
<p><strong>Issues of new technology?</strong></p>
<p>The biggie for me is that the learning designers seem to be ahead of the students. Most of my students seem to lack confidence online and in particular, very rarely contribute to online forums. I also loved Goodyer's question of whether we are helping learners abdicate responsibility. We can keep giving them stuff but they need to take advantage of it. Are we giving them too much? Do we need to prioritise or do we leave them to prioritise? Taking this broader,&nbsp;students come to OU learning for lots of different reasons, so what do we mean when we say they are 'learners'? Do they need to demonstrate they are learning and if so, what? Amongst some of my students, evidence from marking TMAs would suggest they are learning something about the subject but not about how to write academic essays - does this matter? Will using technology to create different activites change this or is this about someone choosing where they spend their effort?</p>
<p>Finally, having been involved as a subject matter expert on the design of 2 corporate e-learning courses, I absolutely agree that designing for online takes far more time than face-to-face. As a trainer this can be a big shift because checking, re-checking and checking again for spellings, phraseology, etc can get very tedious and is time-consuming. When face-to-face, we can adapt much more on the hoof and every single thing does not need to be thought out.</p>        </div>

Who owns what when it comes to open resources? Is it relevant? How can we incorporate new technologies into teaching and learning?</p>

                   <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>Hola Keylor, me alegro de verte en todos los sitios. Jaja.</p>
<p>This page always reminds me of Twitter.</p>
<p>Sorry to arrive so late with my contributions. Well, they say that it is better late than never...</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>1&nbsp; How do you and your colleagues get new ideas?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;We hold regular meetings at the end of term where we all contribute with some activities that we &nbsp;have found works well within the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>2&nbsp; How do you and your&nbsp;colleagues design learning activities?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I am not tech savvy, but I have always felt attracted by the introduction of new technologies for teaching and learning. However, in my opinion this &nbsp;depends on the tutor, the content, the students and the venue. I work in long life learning where VLEs started to be introduced about 10 years ago. Then more recently&nbsp; the Smartboards came. Some tutors are still somehow reticent to their use, although management has been &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; academic staff to use them ahead of Ofsted inspections.</p>
<p><strong>3&nbsp; &nbsp;What resources and support are required/used?</strong></p>
<p>There is a &ldquo;media resources&rdquo; department that can help (not always) sort out any last minute technical difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What issues do new technologies raise for teaching and learning?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;There are always technical issues in mind when we deliver lessons with the help of new technologies. It is always advisable to have a contingency plan available.</p>        </div>

<p>Hello Everyone (even later!)</p>
<p>LIke others, I was at first not sure whether this resource is for those who are delivering a course designed by others, as in my AL situation, but as it went on I felt it is for me too, as there is plenty of innovation and adaptation that an indivual tutor can do for their own students.&nbsp; I was also not sure if it applied to blended learning (with online activities supplemented by optional face to face contact) or pure online courses.&nbsp; I wonder if the design considerations are significantly different in these two situations, and am hoping this will become clearer to me as we go on.</p>
<p><strong>How do you and your colleagues get new ideas?</strong></p>
<p>From tutor resources on the module website, conversations with other tutors (who may then email me resources they have written themselves), workshops at regional staff development events, my own background as a school teacher.</p>
<p><strong>How do you and your colleagues design learning activities?</strong></p>
<p>For online activities on the tutor group forum&nbsp;I follow the framework designed by the module team, then use my own judgement to modify this (eg composing my messages and setting timescales).&nbsp; I share face to face tutorials with another tutor and we jointly plan a day that addresses basic or problem areas of the module, with a variety of activities to address different learning styles (eg listening and viewing powerpoint presentations, small group discussion, science practical work, maths practice).&nbsp; Sometimes there are no resources provided by the OU on a topic I wish to cover, so I will use Google to find something and adapt it (searching for &lsquo;XXX lesson plan&rsquo;).&nbsp; I am heavily influenced by my school teaching background, in that I will try to state learning outcomes, and follow a pattern of starter &ndash; main activity &ndash; plenary/assessment.&nbsp; This shows particularly in the Elluminate tutorials I design, which are just like school lessons when I think about it!</p>
<p><strong>What resources and support are required/used?</strong></p>
<p>For activities on tutor group forums, some module teams provide example messages and stipulate the timings, others leave me free to do this myself.&nbsp; I plan and write all Elluminate sessions and powerpoint presentations myself.&nbsp; Once these are written, I modify and update them for each presentation.&nbsp; Tutor resources provided by module teams include worksheets and accompanying tutor notes which can be used at face to face tutorials, or on forums, or sent to individual students.&nbsp; The most valuable resource provided by the module team is the tutor forum, where questions can be asked about assignments or resources, to be answered by one of the module team or usually another tutor.</p>
<p><strong>What issues do new technologies raise for teaching and learning?</strong></p>
<p>They provide new opportunities, especially for more contact with students through forums and email.&nbsp; There is an expectation that tutors are available quickly through these routes.&nbsp; There are more opportunities for students to work together online, as the only other formal option is at tutorials and residential schools, and in my faculty these are being reduced.&nbsp; There are also issues around the informal opportunities provided to students through new technology, such as FaceBook groups, and this can produce positive peer group learning and/or negative gossip or plagiarism.</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>Sorry I think I'm providing the better late than never input too :). Having thought through the questions, it has been interesting to read your ideas to see were our experiences and ideas overlap.</p>
<p><strong>How do you and your colleagues get new ideas?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Generally the learning design that I am regularly involved in is for activities at face &ndash; to face tutorials or weekly discussion forums. Ideas for this tend to develop from trying activities with a group and amending it depending on learner feedback and self reflection of it&rsquo;s effectiveness. Ideas may also come from reading, networking either face to face or discussion forums, and my own learner experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A few years ago I had the experience of being part of a working group developing a teaching package for a 2 day multidisciplinary training for health, social care and education workers. The learning design process was really informal with a &lsquo;pooling&rsquo; of ideas to determine the content and the activities which would be utilised. No mention was made of any teaching theories or processes to support the learning design &ndash; the focus was on drawing on the expertise of experienced teachers who developed teaching packages as an inherent part of their role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you and your colleagues design learning activities?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Quite an informal process &ndash; probably loosely based on a model of reflection, as this is a process I am familiar with and used in clinical practice for many years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Generally when I have identified the topic, I focus on what I feel to be the desired learning outcomes, consider options for activities which will be effective in achieving outcomes, plan the session in more depth and then reflect back on whether I anticipate whether the planned activities will achieve the learning outcomes, if the content is balanced in types of activity, if the activity instructions are clear and how the achievement of LO can be measured. As an AL with OU you are often autonomous so for some study skills activity I cajole my partner or children to be &lsquo;guinea pigs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Initially when I started working for OU I think I lacked confidence to share any of the learning activities I had designed &ndash; always thinking that other AL&rsquo;s had far more experience and more expertise than my self. Now I am happy to discuss with others and share ideas and experiences. This probably happens most often at staff update days or when co-facilitating tutorials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What resources and support are required / used?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>I think this really depends on the activity. The online discussion forums are supported by a tutor resource area which provides examples form other tutors. This has been great as a new AL in being able to &lsquo;borrow&rsquo; ideas and also as a starting point to developing your own activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I do get feedback from the staff tutor on the effectiveness of forum discussions and ideas for how they can be developed which has been useful in terms of building confidence and skill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m currently studying the H812 and the discussion forum for this is also a good place to share ideas and experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What issues do new technologies raise for teaching and learning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>I think the key ones for me are time and opportunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Time &ndash; Planning new activities as technology develops is good as keeps variety and interest in your tutor role but time is often precious so it&rsquo;s a balancing act of juggling student support, marking and developing new teaching activities and skills. There is also the time element of researching the new technology to ensure that it is appropriate and effective to support achieval of the learning outcomes of your session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Opportunity &ndash; Development days are a great way of learning about new technologies and having the chance to &lsquo;have a go&rsquo;. Sadly there is then often a gap until the next opportunity to try it out in a teaching session by which time my memory of the &lsquo;how to do it&rsquo; has faded.</p>        </div>

<p>Reading course materials,&nbsp; media etc&nbsp; Share ideas at staff dev events,&nbsp; Also questions from the students</p>

</ul>
<p>Take old work and improve on it - often as a result of further student questions or TMA chnages</p>
<p>Begin from scratch and&nbsp;use what experience says will work</p>
<p>Share powerpoints etc within regional team and build on common experience</p>
<p>This has become easier as I have got to know the others and feel able to trust them.&nbsp; Putting work up to share can be very nerve wracking and if someone makes a sarcastic comment, you can lose confidence very quickly, so I am very lucky in having a supportive group in my region.</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>Hi Everyone</p>
<p>Well this is a later response, as my first draft seems to have been lost as I was apparently not signed in!</p>
<p>I have read all your comments and have found myself nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>My background is that of a Secondary Mathematics teacher who has now become an A/L with the OU.</p>
<p><strong>New ideas:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Normally recycled &lsquo;old&rsquo; ones which I have seen other colleagues use or have adapted resources found online, and in some cases reinventing the wheel with my own ideas, sometimes through collaboration with other teachers/ colleagues.</p>
<p><strong>Design learning activities:</strong></p>
<p>Through experience of teaching and reflective practice on what worked well; what happened when learning objectives were not fully achieved, &nbsp;and &nbsp;evaluating which activities needed remodelling or binning! I aim for a balance of different activities which allow visual, auditory and kinaesthetic learning. I design learning activities by looking at new technologies and through evaluating/ exploring / adapting /updating existing activities if I can see a direct link to improving learning for my tutees.</p>
<p><strong>Resources/support required/needed:</strong></p>
<p>I have used different technologies as they have become available to teachers. I particularly like the use of interactive whiteboards and software available for mathematics. However through OU I am unable to make use of this knowledge, as all face to face tutorials have just whiteboards.</p>
<p>I do think that regular small inputs/ training sessions for A/L&rsquo;s with the ability to use/ practice is vital as a lot of time is invested in remodelling/updating resources. Here the &lsquo;generic&rsquo; template becomes invaluable as a means to adapt for my individual teaching style, along with the resources other colleagues have already used. Although I have completed Elluminate training I have yet to do a live session. So instead of offering a session &lsquo;if required&rsquo; I need to be more proactive and specifically invite tutees. Here though I had to invest in a tablet so that I could attempt to be professional when writing in Elluminate but even I am not convinced that it looks ok. These types of resources should be provided by OU, along with headsets etc. I know that a percentage of money we receive is for resources but now that we have to print off our own mark schemes and TMA&rsquo;s this pot is ever decreasing.</p>
<p><strong>Issues:&nbsp; </strong>For<strong> </strong>each new technology there is a lot of work required to<strong> </strong>adapt activities, and so many A/L&rsquo;s need time to learn, weigh up the advantages and disadvantages, and to become confident in the use of such. Also there must be a distinct efficiency for the teacher/lecturer overall to invest the time to adapt/ re write design learning activities.</p>
<p>I also liked the look of the LAM&rsquo;s site. Not too sure of the state of play of Phoebe or Reload as I was redirected to other sites.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>        </div>
