<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">First, a confession: at the beginning of OLDS MOOC Week 2, I didn&rsquo;t know what a rhizome was, let alone anything about rhizomatic learning (oh the shame, the shame). &nbsp;Desperately trying to recall a secondary school biology class, I had a notion that a carrot might be a rhizome but thank you healthyhomegardening for putting me straight that a carrot is a root and a rhizome is something completely different. It&rsquo;s actually a type of plant comprised of a network of intertwined roots that grow mainly beneath the surface with some offshoots for air. Think root ginger or water lily and you get the idea.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Hearing the word &ldquo;rhizome&rdquo; referred to in an educational context made me want to investigate further (although I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced that a metaphor that requires a definition search is 100% ideal. But maybe rhizomes are something that everyone knows about, and it&rsquo;s just me who needed clarification.) As Dave Cormier who originally came up with the metaphor explains: &ldquo;A rhizomatic plant has no center and no defined boundary; rather, it is made up of a number of semi-independent nodes, each of which is capable of growing and spreading on its own, bounded only by the limits of its habitat (2008).&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">What does that mean for learning, though? Cormier describes it further: &ldquo;In the rhizomatic model of learning, curriculum is not driven by predefined inputs from experts; it is constructed and negotiated in real time by the contributions of those engaged in the learning process. This community acts as the curriculum, spontaneously shaping, constructing, and reconstructing itself and the subject of its learning in the same way that the rhizome responds to changing environmental conditions.&rdquo; &nbsp;I was particularly taken with his suggestion that the rhizome metaphor &ldquo;may be particularly apt as a model for disciplines on the bleeding edge where the canon is fluid and knowledge is a moving target.&rdquo; He has me at &ldquo;knowledge as a moving target&rdquo; and more on that later, methinks&hellip;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Back to Week 2, though, and this week we were asked to consider learner context and explore ways of representing it in our learning designs. Practical approaches such as the development of personas, force maps, and scenarios, and something called the &ldquo;ecology of resources design framework&rdquo; were described. We were asked to pick and choose from these approaches and apply them to our own design challenges. Considering my own timeframes, I decided pretty quickly that I was going to have to do the &ldquo;Short Route&rdquo; which meant focusing on the design project and trying to work on the scenario activities relating to that as I felt I might learn something from those for my own practice as an instructional designer.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">So with that in mind, on Sunday, I &ldquo;hung out&rdquo; with Sheila MacNeill where we tried to figure out nex steps and bounce some ideas (and general grumbles!) off each other. Because of differences in timezones amongst interested participants, we decided to try to follow an asynchronous approach to the team for this week. Interested team members posted scenarios (three so far) and the plan is to pick one scenario for the full design treatment. So far, ideas focus on online icebreakers activity, a webquest for learning design tools and a design visualization activity.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">As someone who needs no convincing about the power of storytelling, I rather enjoyed the scenario development process. Going through this process with the scenario and persona development very much reminded me of a book that was recommended to me some years ago called Writing for Story: Craft Secrets of Dramatic Non Fiction. Written by Pulitzer prizewinner Jon Franklin, this book essentially dissects the elements of the short story narrative and claims that all &ldquo;good&rdquo; short stories follow a similar conflict-resolution format that can be unlocked and potentially replicated by others. Of course, not everyone will agree with this claim &ndash; is it too formulaic an approach? Could following such a prescriptive path confound the creative writing process? &ndash; but there&rsquo;s no doubt that the techniques he describes feature in many compelling stories and the idea of there being &ldquo;a system&rdquo; for narrative development is certainly interesting to explore.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">I&rsquo;m not sure if I fulfilled all the requirements of the Week 2 activities (I&rsquo;m not a great fan of complex-looking maps so couldn&rsquo;t really make sense of the force maps approach) but the scenario-development process did get me thinking about my new friend/learner &ldquo;Joan&rdquo; and to try to tell a story around her. Looking at other scenarios was also very helpful in this respect. Naming her, as recommended by Cooper (1999) and Nielsen (2013) certainly put a real picture of her in my head and going through the scenario/persona development activities did help me tease out the context in which she operates. In fact you could get quite carried away - Could Joan&rsquo;s mounting debt and crippling iPhone addiction threaten to destroy her marriage? Marian Keyes, eat your heart out!) &ndash; but such literary gems will have to wait, I&rsquo;m afraid. &nbsp; That&rsquo;s as far as I&rsquo;m going to get with Week 2 and I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting stuck in to Week 3 over the next few days. I got my badge for Week 1 &ndash; yahoo, I&rsquo;m likin&rsquo; these badges! &ndash; and hopefully have done enough to merit one for Week 2. Now that definitely is a carrot&hellip;</div>
