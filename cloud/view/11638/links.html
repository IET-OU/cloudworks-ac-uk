        <h3>Narrator</h3>
<p>I have recently been seconded, one day a week, to the role of technology enhanced learning lead to support staff with using and integrating technology to support teaching, learning and assessment. We have many electronic systems which if used correctly can help teachers monitor and track student performance and progress as well as the EdTech applications that we can use to support and frame the learning.</p>
<h3>Situation</h3>
<p>The video tutorials were designed for staff working in an FE college, teaching on courses from level 1 (pre-GCSE) to level 6 (BSc/BA). The videos were being created to reduce the time spent in workforce development sessions (or to supplement the training is staff requested it) as we found it difficult to get groups together and as such many staff asked for one-to-one support.</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>The purpose of the videos was to give instruction to teaching staff or anyone involved in course design, to be able to set up and use a Moodle VLE space for electronic assignment submissions. The videos also were designed to demonstrate how to provide an online assessment schedule in this space, which was optional as there is an existing system for this, although it would provide student with all assessment information in one place, therefore was encouraged. A sample assessment page with an assessment schedule and links to assignments and submission spaces is shown <a title="Sample VLE assesemnt page" href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsdnoFNX8s9mgtMFaapC_nMyfBvDsA" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>
<h3>&nbsp;Actions</h3>
<p>Firstly, planned out what steps needed to be included in the video and decided that a template VLE space would be a good starting point to try to provide a consistent appearance and reduce the amount of people involved in creating pages. I created a dummy assessment page to act as this template and ran it by our head of TEL for approval. It was suggested that I use online software called Panopto, as this was available to all staff and students in the organisation. My first obstacle was learning how to use Panopto, though being a TEL lead it was my role to support staff using it, so this was deep dive stuff, and in a hurry.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The expected outcome was that at east one member of staff was able to set up VLE assessment spaces for the courses within their department. The degree to which the objective was met appears to be favourable and upon last checking most teams had a VLE space for assessment although they were of varying design. Unfortunately, we were not able to get an accurate picture as there is currently no way of reporting on the creation of these pages electronically, other than to look through the VLE. It is planned to create a customised report to check this as we move forwards. IN the short term we have looked at the views the videos received and checked for the existence of assessment pages. I cannot also say, at this stage, how well it has been received across the organisation as I only support a small number of teaching teams.</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>Reflecting on the process, I feel it was a really useful activity and the videos are there for anyone who wants to watch them. Although, for some staff it would be more appropriate to attend a practical workshop and use the videos as a support tool thereafter. Not everyone is as technically minded and we need to be mindful to offer solutions that work for all.</p>
