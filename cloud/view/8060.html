    <div class="user-entry">

        <p>Based on my initial attempts to identifed OER, I've noted that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of the college courses take a clinician approach with lots of theoretical concepts and research studies. For business purposes, the focus has to be on applied psychology. Therefore, courses designed for a workplace audience will be more appropriate. Future OER searches will focus on those types of&nbsp;courses versus college courses.</li>
<li>Video&nbsp;classroom segments were too long if&nbsp;within many of the open courses (e.g., 45 minutes -1 hour)&nbsp;as they&nbsp;were merely videotaped lectures.&nbsp;For the business audience, the video segments&nbsp;must be shorter in length. No single video should exceed 25&nbsp;minutes to make it easier for students to chunk their work into available time slots. I will likely need to consider resources like Khan Academy and Coursera that are focused specifically on the online learning community and that have mastered simplifying complex topics by using every day examples.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other factor to consider within this whole scenario is the amount of time required to vet OER resources. Identifying reading materials will not be difficult or overly time-consuming. However, identifying quality videos will take a bit of time because each one must be watched. I've learned through other experiences that you do not want to incorporate something that you haven't fully vetted, even if it's including in a source that you respect. You just don't know whether there is alignment between your objectives (or values) and the source's objectives and values. Having the time to vet this videos would be the most daunting aspect of this task. I will need to involve additional people in the vetting process. To do this, I will need two different evaluation checklists to aid with consistent evaluation processes across the different individuals. The first checklist would focus on the videos designed to transmit knowledge and encourage learning. The second checklist would focus on the videos designed to provide opportunities for the students to critique real-life situations.</p>
<p>The evaluation of these videos could be a project for students studying instructional design.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    </div>

                   <p>Hello Tiffany</p>
<p>Thank you for this very useful post. It makes explicit the decision making process involved in &nbsp;assessing the value of an OER for reuse in your own context. As such, it is a valuable contribution to a topic of discussion that seems to be emerging in the context of week 6: How much effort (time) am I willing to invest in searching, vetting and adapting a resource that already existis? You provide a clear description of what it would take to vet the videos you had found, including devising checklists and engaging colleagues. This does seem like a lot of effort. What, in your opinion, could make it worthwhile?&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Joanna,</p>
<p>I think it would be worthwhile if it's able to identify resources that add a dynamic feel to the material; real-life examples, every-day applications, and the like. If their are resources that have already developed simulations and other tools that really appeal to adult learners then a lot of development and evaluation time would be saved. And if it all get's pull together into one spot, then someone else can build upon it and take it to that next level. I think in the early stages of OER there will be a lot of time packaging things together but once that's done, I think we will see continued improvement and enhancements that will ultimately result in world-class courses. I could see a rating system coming into effect at some point that would then make it easier for people to choose OER content and MOOCs.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks Tiffany, I agree with you. Producing rich media resources requires technical skills and is time consuming. Also, what teachers often say when asked about the benefits of reusing OER is that reuse prevents from 'duplication of efforts'. I think this is especially true when the 'imperfections' of a resource can be tackled/explained in a short introduction produced by a teacher &nbsp;(often referred to as pedagogical wrapping).</p>
<p>The problem with the continued improvement/enhancement of resources is that a) what constitutes improvement is context-specific and also depends on what a &nbsp;teacher subscribes to in terms of pedagogy b) so far there is little evidence of any ongoing dialogue around resources - at least in HE, it's slightly different in schools and FE. Teachers find resources, tweak them and use them in their own teaching, but rarely do they find that extra time to provide feedback on a resource they used or to share their version of it back to the repository. This is at least what I found in my recent study into teachers engagement with OER.</p>        </div>
