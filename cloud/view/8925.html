<p><strong>Focus on&hellip;&nbsp; The Psychology of Social Networkers </strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS; Science Direct; APA; The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to make presumptions about social media users, but to what extend are these borne out by evidence?&nbsp; Research suggests that Facebook users tend to be &ldquo;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211000379" rel="nofollow">more extraverted and narcissistic, but less conscientious and socially lonely, than nonusers</a>&rdquo;, but there is also evidence that <a href="http://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/02/student-narcissists-prefer-twitter-more.html" rel="nofollow">narcissism is age-related</a>, with student narcissists preferring Twitter, while more mature narcissists prefer FB.&nbsp; Separate research reported that &ldquo;higher degrees of narcissism led to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214000600" rel="nofollow">deeper self-disclosures and more self-promotional content</a> within these messages. [And] users with higher need to belong disclosed more intimate information&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Further research suggests that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211002020" rel="nofollow">personality was a more important factor than gender and FB experience</a>, with high scorers in neuroticism spending more time on FB, although extraverts were found to have more friends on the network than introverts.&nbsp; However, people who said they used FB as an informational tool (rather than socialising) tended to score higher on neuroticism, sociability, extraversion and openness, but lower on conscientiousness and &ldquo;need for cognition&rdquo;.&nbsp; The same study also found that higher scorers in sociability, neuroticism and extraversion preferred FB, while people who scored higher in "need for cognition" preferred Twitter.&nbsp; There is also evidence that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563212003317" rel="nofollow">anxiousness</a> (as well as alcohol and drug use) predicts more emotional attachment to Facebook.</p>
<p>And what of academic performance?&nbsp; An analysis of nearly 4,000 US students found that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211001932" rel="nofollow">the more they used Facebook to socialise, the poorer their grades tended to be</a>, although using the site to collect and share information was actually associated with <em>better</em> grades.&nbsp; However, an earlier longitudinal study found <a href="http://www.firstmonday.dk/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2498" rel="nofollow">no evidence for a link between FB use and poorer grades</a>; if anything there were signs of the opposite pattern.</p>
<p>Research published last month suggests that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0193397314001257" rel="nofollow">students may learn to regulate their use of Facebook</a>, both as a distraction from coursework and in their free time, as they progress through university.&nbsp; The study of 1,649 US students showed that seniors spent significantly less time on Facebook and spent significantly less time multitasking with Facebook than newer students.&nbsp; Time spent on Facebook was significantly negatively predictive of grades for freshmen but not for other students.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seniors were less likely to post status updates than freshmen and sophomores, comment on content less than the other class ranks, use Facebook chat less than freshmen and sophomores, post photos less than juniors, tag photos less than freshmen and juniors, and view videos less than all the other class ranks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a 2011 study of about 300 college students, researchers from Cornell found that students who were asked to look at their own Facebook page for just three minutes showed <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~telecom/people/faculty/gonzaamy/Gonzales-11-Mirror-FB- wall.pdf" rel="nofollow">a boost in self-esteem</a> compared with control groups who either looked in a mirror or simply sat in a room for three minutes.&nbsp; They speculate that we might get that ego lift because we self-select the information we include in our Facebook profiles and posts &ndash; and so looking at our favourite flattering photos and witty or erudite comments reinforces the version of ourselves we want to be.</p>
<p>Building on the ubiquity of Twitter, The Chronicle&rsquo;s Adeline Koh posts on her experiences of getting students to <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/live-tweeting-assignments-to-use-or-not-to-use/58949?cid=gn&utm_source=gn&utm_medium=en" rel="nofollow">live tweet whilst watching films</a> (feature films, documentaries or recorded lectures).&nbsp; The assignment does not require that students follow one another to read their tweets, they simply need to use public accounts and make sure each tweet contains the event hashtag.&nbsp; She has tried this both in a classroom and remotely, and she reports that, &ldquo;Every single time this activity has massively increased student engagement and learning&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; Audrey Watters; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>The latest Babson Research Group annual survey of more than 2,800 academic leaders suggests that <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-mooc-fades-in-3-charts/55701" rel="nofollow">MOOC hype is fading</a>, with the percentage of institutions offering MOOCs levelling off, at around 14%.&nbsp; There is a growing feeling that MOOCs will not generate money or reduce costs for universities, with only 16% of those questioned believing that MOOCs are sustainable, while 51% think they are not &ndash; in stark contrast to figures of 28% and 26% respectively in 2012 &ndash; and only 2.4% of academic leaders offering MOOCs said their main goal was to &ldquo;explore cost reductions.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a similar shift in responses to whether MOOCs were &ldquo;important for institutions to learn about online pedagogy&rdquo;, with 28% agreeing and 37% disagreeing, compared to 50% and 19% in 2012.</p>
<p>Daphne Koller has announced that <a href="http://www.afr.com/p/national/education/coursera_sets_sights_on_universities_YoYzesiG11p0QtnEsDV8pI" rel="nofollow">Coursera was rebuilding its &shy;platform &lsquo;from the ground up&rsquo;</a> to allow students to commence courses &lsquo;on demand&rsquo; and to give university &shy;instructors access to student data on progress and performance.&nbsp; She said Coursera had already shifted about 50 courses to an &ldquo;on-demand&rdquo; basis and by the end of this year most of its courses would be offered that way.&nbsp; Indications were that on demand courses were also&shy; beneficial for students. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a higher degree of learner engagement than with session-based courses,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The University of Central Florida has partnered with Educause and ed tech company Instructure to launch <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/01/27/u-central-florida-launches-blended-learning-mooc-for-educators.aspx" rel="nofollow">BlendKit2015: Becoming a Blended Learning Designer</a>.&nbsp; Building on the success of last year&rsquo;s BlendKit2014, the 5 week MOOC starts on <strong>23 Feb</strong> and will include: scholarly reading selections on blended learning; guest presenters each week; assessment and critique of course design work from experts and peers; and frequent interaction with other students and course facilitators via blogs or social networks.</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/01/14/new-mooc-platform-provides-free-it-certification-courses.aspx" rel="nofollow">Cybrary.IT</a> is a new provider offering 20-plus certification MOOCs in IT systems administration, network administration and cybersecurity.&nbsp; Courses range from 5&ndash;30 hours and combine individual study with instructional lectures, interactive demos, online discussions and collaborative activities. &nbsp;Students also have access to study guides, white papers, case studies and other materials through the Cybrary Web site. &nbsp;More than 3,500 students worldwide have joined so far.</p>
<p>Australian MOOC provider <a href="http://www.startupsmart.com.au/2015020514083/venture-capital/tech-entrepreneur-clive-mayhew-pumps-1-million-into-openlearning-as-the-mooc-provider-raises-17-million.html" rel="nofollow">OpenLearning</a> has raised A$1.7m to help meet its goal of increasing the number of students using its platform from 125,000 to a million by the end of thia year.&nbsp; Roughly 50% of OpenLearning&rsquo;s users come from Malaysia, while the majority of its other users are in Australia, the US and China.&nbsp; The company has recently struck a deal with the Malaysian government to deliver 15% of the country&rsquo;s public university courses using its platform, with the aim increasing this to 30% by 2020.</p>
<p>MOOC organisers can now include URLs that allow their registered learners to purchase print, eBooks and journal articles from <a href="http://www.springer.com/gb/about-springer/media/press-releases/corporate/springer-cooperates-with-mooc-organizers-around-the-globe/42598" rel="nofollow">Springer</a> at discounted rates.</p>
<p>The folks at the Daily Genius have come up with <a href="http://loocs.org/" rel="nofollow">LOOCs</a> (Little&hellip;) which are &ldquo;one-page courses that give you what you need in a simple step-by-step recipe format.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nice idea, but definitely over-egging the MOOC bandwagon: these aren&rsquo;t LOOCs, they&rsquo;re good old just-in-time learning factsheets.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian; THE, The Independent; University World News]</em></p>
<p>Latest figures from HESA show the number of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/15/part-time-university-students-numbers-fall?CMP=share_btn_tw" rel="nofollow">UK part-time students fell by 7%</a> in 2013-14 compared with the previous year, with the worst-case market &ndash; foundation degrees &ndash; falling by 18% to just 24,000.&nbsp; The figures underscored earlier research suggesting that part-time student numbers have fallen sharply since 2010-11, when fees rose to a maximum of &pound;9,000 a year for full-time study.&nbsp; &ldquo;These figures confirm another reduction in the number of part-time students, and should be a significant concern for policymakers and the higher education sector as a whole,&rdquo; said Les Ebdon, director of the Office of Fair Access to Higher Education.&nbsp; Over the same period, full-time student numbers rose by 2%.</p>
<p>According to new data from UCAS, the latest <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/student-admissions-bounce-back-after-2012-slump/2018225.article" rel="nofollow">rise in student admissions</a> in this academic year takes the total up by almost 14,000 (3.2%) to 447,450, meaning that nearly all universities in England have bounced back from the &pound;9k fees admissions slump, which saw core intakes shrink in some cases by 20%.</p>
<p>But not everyone wants to go to university for their degree.&nbsp; There was an 11.8% in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/thousands-of-students-shun-universities-in-favour-of-studying-for-their-degrees-at-local-further-education-colleges-10016084.html" rel="nofollow">undergraduates joining FE colleges</a> in the two years to 2012-13, helped in part by the relaxation in recruitment curbs.&nbsp; The Association of Colleges estimates that there are around 115,000 students currently studying for degrees at FE colleges.</p>
<p>Analysis by UCAS shows that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/record-numbers-of-women-going-to-university-according-to-ucas-9993201.html" rel="nofollow">a record number of women started university courses</a> last Sep, but they are still avoiding science, IT and engineering courses.&nbsp; The biggest gap between the sexes were in education, with 85% per cent of acceptances being women, and &ldquo;subjects allied to medicine&rdquo;, i.e. nursing (81%).&nbsp; In contrast, 87% of computer science undergrads were men, as were 85% of engineering students.&nbsp; In a dubious pre-election comment, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said &ldquo;&hellip;if you didn&rsquo;t know what you wanted to do, then the arts and humanities were what you chose to do because they were useful for all kinds of jobs.&nbsp; Of course, we now know nothing could be further from the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Colquhoun suggests that honours degrees aren't well suited to all students and that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/feb/03/honours-degrees-arent-for-all-some-unis-should-only-teach-two-year-courses" rel="nofollow">some universities should focus on two-year ordinary degrees</a>, similar to those offered by US liberal arts colleges, and these should be less specialist than what is now offered.&nbsp; Some institutions should specialise in teaching such degrees, others should become predominantly postgraduate institutions and have the time, money and expertise to do proper advanced teaching.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Sunday Times last month, shadow HE spokesman Liam Byrne said the present university funding system was unsustainable: &ldquo;We want to bring the cost down, but this has to be funded. &nbsp;The right long-term shift is to a <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2015012010053921" rel="nofollow">graduate tax</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, more recent speculation suggests that Labour may commit to a Robbins- or Dearing-style major review of HE and a <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/uuk-warning-over-6000-fees/2018347.article" rel="nofollow">cut in maximum tuition fees from &pound;9k to &pound;6k</a>, described by UUK as ignoring the &ldquo;legitimate concerns of vice-chancellors&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Overseas fee-paying students at the University of the West of Scotland could benefit from a proposed initiative to <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/university-students-who-fail-should-get-refund.117233988" rel="nofollow">have their costs waived if they fail to graduate</a>.&nbsp; UWS says it has broken ranks with other institutions to ensure it remains attractive in an increasingly competitive global market.&nbsp; If the scheme is approved, UWS would become the first institution in the UK to offer students a refund for failing to complete their courses.</p>

The time-to-adoption for makerspaces and wearable technology are estimated within two to three years, while adaptive learning technologies and the Internet of Things is expected to be mainstream in universities and colleges within four to five years.</p>

<p>Half of American adults now own an e-reading device and the Obama administration has set a goal of getting e-textbooks into every classroom by 2017.&nbsp; However, it remains the case that many people just don&rsquo;t like them and, in <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/readingreport/key-findings.htm" rel="nofollow">a 2014 survey by Scholastic</a>, 65% of 6 to 17-year-old children said they would always want to read books in print (up from 60% in 2012).&nbsp; In her new book, <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120765/naomi-barons-words-onscreen-fate-reading-digital-world" rel="nofollow">Words Onscreen: The Fate of Reading in a Digital World</a>, Prof Naomi Baron brings more data to the case for print, having surveyed over 300 university students in the US, Japan, Germany, and Slovakia.&nbsp; Whilst the delivery format is less important for &ldquo;light reading&rdquo;, she found a near-universal preference for print for serious reading and study.&nbsp; When students were given a choice of various media &ndash; including hard copy, phone, tablet, e-reader and laptop &ndash; 92% said they could concentrate best in hard copy.</p>
<p>Amazon has launched the <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/01/22/kindle-textbook-creator/" rel="nofollow">Kindle Textbook Creator</a>, which allows users to easily and freely transform PDFs into an e-book format and to organise images, graphs, equations, charts, etc.&nbsp; The resulting e-books include Kindle tools such as highlighting, note-taking and dictionary/Wikipedia lookup but will run on multiple devices including Kindles, iOS and Android.&nbsp; The company has also launched <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/03/amazon-kindle-convert" rel="nofollow">Kindle Convert</a> which allows users (in the US only for now) to turn their paper library into e-books&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US National Endowment for the Humanities and the Mellon Foundation will jointly provide $1 million to convert out-of-print humanities books into e-Pubs with a Creative Commons licence, ensuring that the books are freely downloadable with searchable texts and in formats that are compatible with any e-reading device.&nbsp; Books proposed under the new <a href="http://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2015-01-15/humanities-open-book" rel="nofollow">Humanities Open Book</a> programme must be of demonstrable intellectual significance and broad interest to current readers&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sean Michael Morris posts about <a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/announcements/mmcp-critical-critical-pedagogy/" rel="nofollow">critical pedagogy</a> &ndash; the theme of a 6-week &ldquo;MOOC MOOC&rdquo; that started on 19 Jan.&nbsp; He describes CP as a philosophy of teaching that <em>shows</em> more than <em>tells,</em> and he equates telling to what Freire calls the banking model of education in which &ldquo;the scope of action allowed to the students extends only as far as receiving, filing, and storing the deposits&rdquo; (p53).&nbsp; Compare that with an inquiry model which leaves learners free to ask, explore and experiment.&nbsp; With this approach, Freire notes that, &ldquo;Knowledge emerges only through invention and re-invention [&hellip;] through the restless, impatient, continuing, hopeful inquiry human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other.&rdquo; (p53).&nbsp; So how&rsquo;s the balance looking on your latest module?</p>

<p><strong>Plagiarism: A Disconnect between Students&rsquo; Thoughts and Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>[Faculty Focus]</em></p>
<p>Almost 800 US students completed a <a href="http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/teaching-and-learning/plagiarism-interesting-disconnect-students-thoughts-actions/" rel="nofollow">plagiarism survey</a>, in which 75% agreed or strongly agreed that copying text without referencing it was plagiarism, 81% said such behaviour should result in strong punishment, and 84% said that they never or rarely engaged in this practice.&nbsp; The same students were then given a scenario which opened with some original text from an academic paper and was followed by a piece of writing by a student which included two identical sentences from the original text that were not referenced.&nbsp; Now, when questioned, only 30% agreed that inserting the text was a breach of academic guidelines, although 64% did agree that a reference was required.&nbsp; So they <em>did</em> recognise plagiarism but the researchers speculate that they may consider that just two sentences (as opposed to lifting a whole section) didn&rsquo;t count as serious plagiarism.</p>
