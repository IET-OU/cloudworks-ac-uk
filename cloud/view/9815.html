        <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This narrative shows the design of a scenario for students to design a &lsquo;play space&rsquo; to encourage learning for children in early years</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>Age: 18+ Level 4 (First year of University) Early Childhood students at University. Lecturer was interested in how students would plan, work collaboratively and design a play space for children.</p>
<p><strong>Material</strong></p>
<p>Students are presented with a bag of model making resources, empty boxes, tubes and bottles, tape, string and glue. Each group has a separate room to work together for one hour. A 7 year old child will assess the learning possibilities and the durability of the play space.</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>Students are in their 3<sup>rd</sup> module and have had lessons on child development, communication and collaboration. We have also learnt about the importance of play in relation to children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>The students work well in their preferred groups and some students have concerns about their own creative skills, they are keen to achieve the activity and enjoy having &lsquo;real live&rsquo; children to work with. Parents of children have given their permission and are present throughout the assessment</p>
<p>The students seemed to understand the theory of play and were able to reflect on their own experiences of play as a child, however they did not have a good understanding of the benefits of learning through play. They also struggled with the concept of play spaces, therefore the tutor felt the best way to tackle this was for the students to &lsquo;have a go&rsquo; and also have a project where they were able to reflect on their work as a team, their reflective practice and their model building skills. Students will have the opportunity to go on placement this academic year and need to develop a number of skills to be placement ready.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>The goals of activity were for students to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan a play space with peers</li>
<li>Decide which resources to use</li>
<li>Decide the learning opportunities available for children in the early years up to 7yrs</li>
<li>Improve team working skills</li>
<li>Improve analytical skills</li>
<li>improve evaluation skills and listen to constructive criticism from peers and child</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>I informed the students of what they were going to do, you will go to a room which has a selection of resources, you will design a play space, you have 1 hour, and a child of 7 years will come with his parent and assess your play space, for learning capacity and play capacity.</p>
<p>You will be expected to work as a team, plan, assess, analyse and critique your play space</p>
<p><strong>Obstacles</strong></p>
<p>Some student were not confident to get involved with the project and let others take the lead, the lead people ensured that tasks were shared out equally in all but one group where one student watch the rest of her group rather than join in. difficulty for the tutor was to capture this and encourage collaborative working as the activity was split between 4 rooms. Some student became competitive and wanted to know from the tutor which was the best play space.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The child enjoyed all of the play spaces and the tutor was pleased to see the variety of learning taking place by the students. All students had implemented activities for learning maths and English within their play space, so for example, giving opportunities for mark making. Most groups worked well and planned their activity. The students analysed their play spaces and evaluated what they could improve on, they also had an opportunity to see other group spaces and give constructive feedback to other groups.</p>

                   <p>Hi Angela,</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing, this sounds like such a fun and authentic activity!</p>
<p>From personal experience I feel that my own approach has sometimes been to put students in groups and assume that group work will happen incidentally - from your experience here, I'd be interested to hear what your thoughts were at the planning / design stage regarding ensuring that effective group work occurred, &nbsp;Was the relucatance of some students to participate something you forsaw, and, if so, how did you plan to try to support this?</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
<p>Nathan.</p>        </div>

                   <p>A great idea to turn the assessment 'on its head' with the children doing the assessing.&nbsp; Did the parent take part in the assessing too?</p>

                   Hi Angela

I thought this was a creative way of engaging students in developing a play space. For some students doing this as a practical session made it easier to participate and a great opportunity to receive feedback and reflect on their activity. 
Did the student who did not actively participate in the session usually participate in discussion or group activities. Just wondering if this activity was out of her comfort zone or whether they usually lacked confidence to participate.

Best wishes, Dee        </div>

                   <p>Hi Angela</p>
<p>I thought this was a very clever way of acheiving your objectives for the teachers' learning. &nbsp;I can imagine too that this 'desgin' could be replicated in other student/teacher learning situations. &nbsp;For example if a teacher was trying out a design for learning on the computer and he/she involved students in the trial process then they would get back the kind of feedback necessary to improve the program. It's a simple idea but effective. &nbsp;Is this not also what Brown et al. referred to as 'situated learning'?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Angela</p>
<p>I like very much your design narrative. It is well designed, with clear goals and as you said successful for most of the students. As Dee said it is a great opportunity for students to receive feedback and reflect on their activity. It is also a great way of &nbsp;fostering co-operatiation amongst students.</p>
<p>Why do you think that some groups did not work well? (as you said most of the groups worked well). Were they not confident enough to work with other students? If the same problem comes up in the future, how do you plan to deal with it?</p>
