			<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>&lsquo;No man is an island,<br /> Entire of itself,<br /> Every man is a piece of the continent&hellip;&rsquo; (John Donne 1624)</p>
<p>Without meaningful professional networks, a classroom can feel rather like an island to a teacher. Perhaps these teacher-islands comprise a school &lsquo;archipelago&rsquo;, but the fact remains that many teachers face barriers to connecting with others professionally and because of this would not be characterised as &lsquo;engaged learners&rsquo; (Pedder &amp; Opfer 2013) themselves. In a contrast to other professional roles, Hargreaves (1996) suggests that a teacher making reference to research in a staffroom conversation would be regarded as &lsquo;showing off&rsquo;. So developing a &lsquo;community of practice&rsquo; (Wenger &amp; Snyder 2000) is not as easy within a school as one might expect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A large body of research about the effectiveness of collaborative working highlights the benefit of participation in networks outside of the &lsquo;internal structures and cultures&rsquo; (Pedder &amp; Opfer 2013) of a school. A large number of teachers want to engage with others, as the popularity of professional discussion forums on the Times Educational Supplement website reveals. Networking practices between schools were promoted heavily by government during the implementation of the Primary Strategy in 2004, however issues of power relationships, privacy, staff turnover and time demands led to many of these networks not functioning as well as they could have(Moore &amp; Kelly 2009).</p>
<p>Issues such as cost, time commitments and school priorities have led to Continuing Professional Development often being delivered in the form of day-long courses that are frequently selected <em>for</em> teachers based on school priorities linked to national initiatives, rather than led by teachers themselves (Ridley 2011). This fragmented approach is in contrast to the collaborative style of professional development that is shown to be most effective (Pedder &amp; Opfer 2012).</p>
<p>This presentation seeks to promote an approach that puts collaboration at its centre and encourages the creation of a network of professionals supporting each other. Using an open platform to discuss an artefact associated with teaching, such as a lesson plan or a particular resource can enable asynchronous communication from teachers who each bring a different view to the discussion. The inherent privacy, low cost, accessibility and lack of hierarchy on an open platform removes many of the barriers to effective collaboration that have been identified in school clusters previously (Moore &amp; Kelly 2009). This approach could transform school staff into engaged learners who have instant access to a wealth of experience in the form of colleagues working in other contexts. The teacher is no longer an island but becomes part of a &lsquo;continent&rsquo;, a community of practice.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation Transcript&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Jen Kendall for The Open University H818 online conference.</p>
<p>Saturday 7<sup style="line-height: 1.5em;">th</sup>&nbsp;February 2015</p>
<p>Slide One : Title and Accessibility</p>
<p>No Teacher is an Island: The Implementation of Open Practices for Improving Continuing Professional Development. A transcript of this presentation is available at: http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8876</p>
<p>As the title suggests, this presentation focuses on the theme of the implementation of open practices for the continuing professional development of teachers.</p>
<p>I am an assistant headteacher at a large primary school in outer London. Throughout my career, I have actively sought opportunities for continuing professional development, however, a comment made by one of my team at the beginning of the year made me think about CPD from a different perspective.</p>
<p>Slide Two: Identifying the problem.</p>
<p>As the speech bubble coming from the image of the car shows, the teacher said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ve put my MOT certificate&hellip; I&rsquo;ll just say I&rsquo;ll be getting the bus to the training centre. I won&rsquo;t bother doing any courses anyway&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At all schools in the borough I work in, you must present proof of your car insurance and MOT in order to drive yourself to the training centre to attend courses.&nbsp; This barrier to CPD is one of many but the comment highlighted the perceived low value of continuing professional development to this individual. After speaking to others, it was clear this view was widely held. Very few had attended courses that they found useful and most commented that speaking to colleagues from other schools was the only reason they attended any courses.</p>
<p>Slide Three: The Problem</p>
<p>An image of an island.</p>
<p>Slide Four: No man is an island.</p>
<p>The island pictured on this slide represents the problem: The teacher who lacks professional dialogue with colleagues has become isolated.</p>
<p>The quote on this slide of an island scene, by John Donne, reads, &lsquo;No man is an island, entire of itself, every man is a piece of the continent&rsquo;. As teachers, we are part of a vast education system. With the technology we have today, we are better placed now to connect with others than at any other time in history. <strong>However</strong>, as a busy teacher, <strong>my</strong> classroom feels like an island. I feel isolated from others. The professional conversations I would like to have are being pushed to the bottom of my &lsquo;To Do&rsquo; list because I have so many other things to do. If I could connect to others, perhaps I wouldn&rsquo;t feel like this. Personally, I have combatted this by signing up to study with the Open University, but not everyone want to choose this option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide Five: Why do teachers need to connect with others?</p>
<p>My research into this area included studies by Opfer and Pedder in 2010 and Thurston in 2008. As the quote on the slide says, &lsquo;The link between professional collaboration and improved pupil attainment has been noted in a range of contexts&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Slide Six: The barriers to effective CPD.</p>
<p>Following discussions with teachers and headteachers involved with my primary cluster, and wider reading, three key issues were identified that create barriers to CPD being effective.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is often decided on by the headteacher and linked to whole school development priorities rather than individual need/interests.</p>
<p>You may argue that school development priorities should drive CPD, but how many of us put 100% effort into something that is imposed upon us?</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It often comprises of physical meetings, which are not accessible to all.</p>
<p>As the MOT certificate example illustrates, not everyone is willing or able to travel. Besides which, studies have shown that the collaboration element is often more valuable than the content of the course. The location and timings for the majority of training I have experienced have not lent themselves to networking. When a course ends, my priority is more likely to be beating the rush onto the motorway than exchanging email addresses with the person I have been sat next to. (The speed at which a room clears would suggest that I am not alone in this either!)</p>
<p>3) It often has to be booked well in advance, so participants must wait for training.</p>
<p>If a teacher asks for help with teaching phonics, they need that help now. Or at least soon.&nbsp; Waiting three months for a training session is wasting three months of teaching time.</p>
<p>Slide Five: The problem of the school &lsquo;archipelago&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This slide shows an image of an archipelago, a group of islands.</p>
<p>You might think that a community of teachers would have a lot to share with each other, but in my own experience in a number of schools I have found that this simply isn&rsquo;t the case. I think of it as the school &lsquo;archipelago&rsquo;. In the quote shown on the slide, Hargreaves, in a lecture to the Teacher Training Agency in 1996, said that referring to research in a staffroom conversation would almost certainly be regarded as &lsquo;showing off&rsquo;. Help given from colleague to colleague is more likely, in my experience, to be linked to school practices rather than pedagogy. In many schools there simply isn&rsquo;t the culture of professional dialogue.</p>
<p>Last year, before I joined the school where I work, it was given a &lsquo;Requires Improvement&rsquo; rating by Ofsted. This, for anyone not in teaching, is the official equivalent of a public telling off. As a result of this, four teachers from my school were paired with four teachers at another local school that is rated as &lsquo;good&rsquo;. These four teachers are to coach our teachers and help them be&hellip;better! Hooray! Professional relationships and conversations about the practice of teaching! However, this is a little difficult to do regularly when you don&rsquo;t work in the same place.</p>
<p>Slide Eight: The Idea.</p>
<p>Just like the image on this slide of a slightly flooded pathway between two islands, my idea, to create a resource to enable teachers to connect with each other, is not yet complete.</p>
<p>In order to allow staff in my local network to communicate, I wanted to create an open online area for sharing thoughts, ideas and research while evaluating items, such as policies or lesson plans, posted to the site. This is in its development stages, but in the spirit of openness I would invite you to have a look at it. www.partofthecontinent.weebly.com.</p>
<p>Slide Nine: The website.</p>
<p>This is a screen shot of the home page of the website. It invites teachers to join in the conversation and become, &lsquo;part of the continent&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Slide Ten: So why bother?</p>
<p>I have just said that many teachers I have worked with do not seem to be interested in CPD. However, a recent survey carried out by the Association of Teachers and Lectures and published in the Guardian on 27<sup>th</sup> January 2015 revealed that, when asked what would improve their teaching, 70% of new and trainee teachers called for more time to reflect on their practice with colleagues. My own discussions with staff reflect this view among many more experienced teachers.</p>
<p>Slide Eleven: The benefits of collaboration.</p>
<p>The slide repeats the image of a path connecting islands and includes the information from a study by Thurston et al in 2008 that, in a study of CPD focused on group work for children in Scottish primary schools, collaboration between participants and the networks established during the CPD was found to be a key factor that changed the practice of teachers.</p>
<p>Slide Twelve: The possibilities.</p>
<p>The image shows a network of laptop computers around the world. An open online platform could allow sharing and discussion world wide. In this case, it seems much more likely that it will remain small scale and run for the benefit of my local schools. Either way, the flexibility of a tool that can be used asynchronously means that many of the barriers mentioned earlier can be overcome. And a community can develop.</p>
<p>Slide Thirteen: Privacy.</p>
<p>A key factor in helping teachers to get involved is the privacy issue. This is something that I have received a number of comments about from those involved in the H818 community. Why wouldn&rsquo;t teachers want to identify themselves? When speaking to teachers about being involved in this project as it has developed, they have wanted my assurance that their comments will not be attributed to them. There is rather a culture of fear in schools that appearing to be less than perfect will harm you during performance management. Criteria for progression through pay bands are strict and identifying a weakness in an area that you are supposed to have knowledge of would perhaps prevent teachers from getting involved. As noted in the Cloudworks comment for the abstract outlining this presentation, it can be difficult to admit that you do not know something when in a group of your peers.</p>
<p>The slide contains an image of the website and a speech bubble with text representing a summary of some of the views I have heard over the course of my development of this project. &lsquo;The ideas on here help me consider my own point of view. I don&rsquo;t have to reveal my &lsquo;true&rsquo; identity so I can say what I really think&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Slide Fourteen: Referring to research isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;showing off&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the background of this slide we can see a screen shot from the comments page of the website. We can see that responding to a comment with a link to research becomes a quick and easy possibility. Perhaps teachers may feel more comfortable to do this from behind their computer than they would face-to-face in the staffroom. The piloting of this project will reveal whether this really is the case. We will have to wait and see!</p>
<p>Slide Sixteen: The key message.</p>
<p>The island image is back as a reminder of where we have come from. As the slide says: Don&rsquo;t be an island, be part of the continent.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening, I&rsquo;m happy to take any questions.</p>
