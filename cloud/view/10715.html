<p><strong>U</strong><strong>K HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wonkhe; Avril Jamieson; Steve Parkinson; Peter Horrocks; University World News]</em></p>
<p>Last week&rsquo;s UCAS figures show roughly <a href="https://www.ucas.com/corporate/data-and-analysis/ucas-undergraduate-releases/2017-cycle-applicant-figures-june-deadline-0" rel="nofollow">25,000 fewer full-time university applicants</a> compared to June last year. &nbsp;This includes a 4% decrease in domestic applications, a 5% decrease in EU applications, and a 2% increase in other overseas applications. &nbsp;However, applications from full-time 18-year-olds are actually up this year to the highest proportion ever recorded.&nbsp; Aside from the EU, the hardest hits to the market are in nursing (-19%) and applicants aged over nineteen (-8%).</p>
<p>Prof Les Ebdon, Director of Fair Access to HE, highlights the crisis in part-time student numbers in OFFA's</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/year/2017/201707/" rel="nofollow">Monitoring outcomes of the Student Opportunity allocation 2015-16</a> report.&nbsp; Only 15 HEIs set a target for part-time access in 2015-16, and he describes as unacceptable the fact that &ldquo;little or no progress has been made against a substantial proportion of targets for mature and part-time students&rdquo;.&nbsp; OFFA is planning a further briefing on part-time students to be published later this year.</p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Sean Coughlan looks under the bonnet of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-40511184" rel="nofollow">UK tuition fees</a>, showing graphically how poorly English students fare compared to those in other nations but, despite this, we see that high fees have not reduced university applications, including those from less affluent students.&nbsp; Perhaps most depressing is Chart 4, which shows the stark contrast between English student loan debt and that of their counterparts in N Ireland, Scotland and Wales.&nbsp; Manchester&rsquo;s Steven Jones suggests that most press coverage of the IFS briefing on HE funding has been simplistic, and that headlines such as <a href="http://wonkhe.com/blogs/are-headline-writers-getting-it-wrong-on-fees/" rel="nofollow">Three quarters of graduates will never pay off student debts</a> may conceal what is &ldquo;effectively the government&rsquo;s subsidy for HE, a solitary concession that universities might just be a public good as well as a private one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prof Simon Marginson considers <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20170623085930640" rel="nofollow">how UK HE might fare after Brexit</a> noting that, from 2007&ndash;2013, we contributed &euro;5.4bn to the EU for research and innovation, while receiving &euro;8.8bn in research grants. &nbsp;Of this, &euro;6.9bn was from the Seventh Framework Programme, in which UK universities were the most successful recipients with a 71% share of projects; overall, the UK accounts for 3.2% of global R&amp;D expenditure.&nbsp; He also considers the likely impact on non-UK staff and students, with recent announcements providing some greater clarity, but only in the fairly short term.</p>
<p>The UK ranks first for <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20170624060026228" rel="nofollow">international students' overall satisfaction</a> compared with other leading destination nations, according to the 2017 update to The UK&rsquo;s Competitive Advantage report by UUK. &nbsp;The report analyses data from the International Student Barometer, based on feedback from more than 137,000 respondents, and examines the experience of international students in the UK and key competitor nations. &nbsp;Based on the percentage of international students who would recommend their institution, the UK comes top at all three levels (undergraduates, postgraduate taught students and postgraduate research students), with 91% of international students across all levels of study reporting that they are satisfied with their experience in the UK, followed by Germany, the Netherlands, the US, Australia and Canada.&nbsp; Those most satisfied with the expertise of academics at UK institutions include Chinese, Malaysian and US international postgraduate research students, where satisfaction is 96%, 97% and 97% satisfied respectively.</p>

<p>The University of Adelaide&rsquo;s David Santandreu Calonge questions <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20170620153346285" rel="nofollow">whether MOOCs are providing the much promised increased access to higher education</a> or actually deepening divisions.&nbsp; For example, not everyone has reliable internet connectivity or wants to study in English, but he believes it is in the purpose and design of MOOCs that the most gains could be made: &ldquo;There is an urgent need to shift the focus from the MOOC as a tool, from MOOCs as an institutional recruitment and branding strategy, from MOOCs as a potential generator of revenue, to an increased reflection on learning, engagement, diagnosis and assessment design in the MOOC format.&rdquo;&nbsp; And some similar views are expressed by Class Central&rsquo;s Dhawal Shah, who claims <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-07-06-moocs-find-their-audience-professional-learners-and-universities" rel="nofollow">MOOCs find their audience: professional learners and universities</a>.</p>

<p>Class Central estimates that around 60 million learners worldwide have studied or are studying over 7,000 MOOCs available from more than 700 universities.&nbsp; We all know about Coursera and edX, and some people in America have even heard of FutureLearn, but here&rsquo;s a useful listing of <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/mooc-providers-list/" rel="nofollow">33 MOOC providers</a>, although I was surprised by the absence of Australia&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.open2study.com/" rel="nofollow">Open2Study</a> and Europe&rsquo;s <a href="https://iversity.org/en/courses/" rel="nofollow">iversity</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Why &lsquo;Personalized Learning&rsquo; Can Feel So Impersonal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><em>[Steve Parkinson]</em></p>
<p>When the National Education Association (the biggest US teachers&rsquo; union) published a piece on <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-26-why-personalized-learning-can-feel-so-impersonal" rel="nofollow">personalised learning</a> last month, it resulted in more than 70 mostly negative comments, such as: &ldquo;I will fight &lsquo;personalized learning&rsquo; until my dying day. &nbsp;It takes away teachers&rsquo; and students&rsquo; humanity.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is unfortunate because many teachers routinely try to deliver learning that is as personalised as possible, but it reflects an unsurprising reaction to technologies and approaches that have either over-promised or simply been poorly implemented &ndash; and we all know that this is more likely to put off the doubters than bring them willingly into the fold.&nbsp; Well-written distance learning can have humanity, through insightful design, authors&rsquo; voices and the interaction of online peers, but the data-driven adaptivity that will fuel personalisation needs a considerable amount of technical and design investment, and it is probably only in some of the more formulaic topics such as basic maths that this is starting to deliver.&nbsp; Consider how much Amazon must have invested in its &ldquo;people who&hellip;&rdquo; recommendations &ndash; but what percentage of those actually result in a sale?&nbsp; Just because I bought a replacement Dyson hose last month should not mark me out as an avid purchaser of vacuum cleaning components.&nbsp; But personalised learning is coming, it will quickly move from adequate to good and, before long, we&rsquo;ll wonder what all the fuss was about.</p>

<p><strong>A New World of Corporate Learning Looks Like TV</strong></p>

<p><strong>Students&rsquo; Digital Experiences</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Jisc]</em></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s university recruits may struggle to remember a world without many of the technologies they take for granted, but recent experiences at the State University of New York&rsquo;s Center for Online Teaching Excellence have shown surprising amounts of <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-19-what-if-students-are-the-biggest-barrier-to-innovation" rel="nofollow">resistance and anxiety from students who are accustomed to traditional lecture models</a> and who don&rsquo;t feel they are learning when they are forced to do group work and interact with peers (who they do not view as subject-matter experts).</p>
<p>Jisc&rsquo;s Sarah Knight has found some similar views.&nbsp; In the latest <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6662/1/Jiscdigitalstudenttracker2017.pdf" rel="nofollow">Student Digital Experience Tracker</a>, only 65% of UK students (<em>N=</em>22,593) reported that they have access to digital training and support when they need it.&nbsp; However, they&rsquo;re not short of kit, with HE students owning an average of 2.7 devices each.&nbsp; When asked about personal devices used for study, 88.4% used laptops, followed by smartphones (84.3%), tablets (40.7%) and desktops (18.5%).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Device Shipment Forecasts</strong></p>

<p>But IDC predicts <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2017/06/22/led-by-watches-wearables-market-expected-to-nearly-double-by-2021.aspx" rel="nofollow">the worldwide wearables market will increase 20.4% this year</a> compared to 2016, and nearly double by 2021 to around 240 million units.&nbsp; IDC believes the market has moved beyond raising awareness and is now about getting the experience right, so &ldquo;in the years ahead, they will be treated to second- and third-generation devices that will make the today's devices seem quaint. &nbsp;Expect digital assistants, cellular connectivity and connections to larger systems, both at home and at work.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Is the Business of Scientific Publishing Bad for Science?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Chris Hough; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>In 2005, a Deutsche Bank report referred to scientific publishing as a bizarre &lsquo;triple-pay&rsquo; system, in which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;the state funds most research, pays the salaries of most of those checking the quality of research, and then buys most of the published product&rdquo;</a>.&nbsp; Might this have something to do with the early involvement of a young and ambitious Robert Maxwell and his fledgling Pergamon Press?&nbsp; Stephen Buranyi&rsquo;s article makes an interesting read and, if it&rsquo;s at all possible to set aside the ethics of his latter years, Maxwell&rsquo;s ability in the 1950s and 60s to spot and cultivate business opportunities was astounding.&nbsp; But does that explain the current state of journal publishing and pricing?&nbsp; Perhaps not.&nbsp; Buranyi notes that &ldquo;By 1994, three years after acquiring Pergamon, Elsevier had raised its prices by 50%.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps you prefer open access journals, in which case <a href="https://iris.ai/" rel="nofollow">IRIS.AI</a> could prove useful.&nbsp; The free tool will &lsquo;read&rsquo; the abstract of any research paper and extract what it believes to be the key concepts, presenting them in a visual format and finding relevant papers for each topic from its database of more than 60 million OA papers.</p>

<p><em>[The Memo; The Guardian]</em></p>
<p>Milton Keynes (which is apparently located in north-west London) is rolling out <a href="https://www.thememo.com/2017/05/16/forget-driverless-ai-lights-will-solve-our-traffic-woes/" rel="nofollow">smart AI traffic lights</a> as part of the smart city project.&nbsp; Rather than run a standard looping program, smart lights have cameras that can &lsquo;see&rsquo; growing queues of ambulances, buses and cyclists and give more time for these to get over a crossing or, if there&rsquo;s no one waiting to turn, the lights can skip that part of light cycle to ease congestion.&nbsp; The camera system can also monitor traffic flow, vehicle types and parking spaces to create a live map of the town.&nbsp; By 2019 the lights will be hooked up to a new centralised town traffic management system, which should be able to adjust the timings on lights across the city and further reduce congestion.&nbsp; I can already picture three Mini Coopers being chased across the roof of Xscape&hellip;</p>
<p>But frankly, who cares about smart traffic lights when you can have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2017/jul/13/andy-serkis-transforms-into-gollum-to-read-donald-trump-tweets-video" rel="nofollow">Gollum reading Donald Trump&rsquo;s Tweets</a>?</p>
