                   <p><strong>3-D Immersive Environments for Teaching Science<br /></strong><br />I thought it was quite interesting, but I would have liked more focus on the 'immersiveness' of 3D environments.&nbsp; E.g. what makes an experience 'immersive' in the first place, and why is that a desirable thing?&nbsp; What kind of research has been done into the pedagogical impact of such environments?&nbsp; I felt that the speaker spent a bit too much time showing us what his different applications did and I would have preferred more of a discussion of these issues.&nbsp; But it was interesting to learn more about the processing and rendering issues, etc. that appear figure foremost in the minds of 3D designers.</p>
<p>As usual, the event was very well run and managed!</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Robert Farrow (IET)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />A well-organised event. The early morning tea/coffee was very welcoming. <br />&nbsp;<br />Overall the talk was interesting and I could see clear links with the work that I am carrying out in Second Life. However, the talk was perhaps a little too technical at times and if some initial contexualisation was done on how the concepts fit within learning and teaching, it would have helped.<br />&nbsp;<br />But overall a very inspiring talk and lot of thoughtful research and hard work has gone in to make something quite complex - very engaging for the students to learn.<br />&nbsp;<br />Regards,<br />&nbsp;<br />Shailey Minocha (MCT)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Computer graphics aside, we haven't come a huge way in the last decade in our thinking about immersing students in a virtual laboratory. The emphasis is still on undertaking standard experiments. What's the reason for that? Sadly we didn't get any insight into this during Rob Lucas's talk, which was essentially a canter through the foothills of computer graphics. Where was the 'application and its evaluation' that we were promised? <br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is much still to be done to establish the educational value of practical work and a significant need to challenge many of the traditional assumptions about doing experiments. Clearly graphics can play a large part in making particular virtual experiences more effective but we must go much deeper than this into our underlying pedagogy.</p>
<p>Mark Endean&nbsp;(MCT)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />An interesting session &hellip; it certainly sparked ideas for use in the CPD arena with some very nice demos of what could be achieved by the techniques. The old adage of a picture being worth a 1000 words is rejuvenated with 3-D! The possibilities for &lsquo;learning by doing&rsquo; &ndash; of being able to mix physical action with theoretical reaction is full of potential, as are the possibilities for conditioning physical responses to changing conditions. There are questions to ask though &hellip; one is to do with the veracity of the 3-D reality that is being presented for the learner to experience &ndash; how like any reality is it that they are likely to experience outside of the course? Is it a course objective that the student learns to manipulate a 3-D environment or that they learn what the same manipulation would do in reality? A year down the line, should the student be able to recall what happens when they twiddle their mouse on a 3-D mock-up or the theory explaining the experiment? As with many ICT-enabled opportunities, much thought needs to be given to what learning is being facilitated.&nbsp;<br /><br />As to the presentation &ndash; I found that I had to do a lot of work understanding what was going on (all those years in computing and IET helped me there!), some of the jargon and acronyms got in the way. Possibly for a general audience it would have been a bit difficult which was a pity because I think the idea of 3-D Immersive Environments could benefit lots of courses. It would have been nice to have been given some idea of the possibilities / likelihood of this sort of technique entering the repertoire of general course production &ndash; I wasn&rsquo;t sure who they were done for &ndash; was it Science or the PiCETL?</p>
<p>Still &ndash; looking forward to the next Coffee morning!</p>
<p>Simon Rae (CPLD)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />This is the first time that I came to IET Technology Coffee Morning hoping to learn something new and exciting that might help us (Science Faculty) to understand what is possible to do when developing a new &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; residential course (S288). The meeting fulfilled all my expectations; that is it confirmed that the possibilities are enormous but, at the same time, almost prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>Dr Lucas did an excellent job taking us slowly through the world of 3D environment for teaching science; hence asked one of my colleagues (Dr Mark Hirst) to contact him as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The whole event was very useful for me and I would appreciate receiving more info on your activities in the future.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
