        <p>Bill Law<br />www.hihohiho.com</p>
<p>Big news: Twitter has provoked deep thinking - and in packages of no more than 140 characters.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s socially layered thinking,&nbsp; because personal rights-to-privacy conflict with public rights-to-know.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s commercially layered, because there&rsquo;s money to be made.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s culturally layered,&nbsp; because we could do with restraining influences on some of our celebrities.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s politically layered, because there are votes to be counted.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s legally layered, because judges are there to defend legitimate interests.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also educationally layered, because few professionals are more deeply embroiled in all this than careers workers.&nbsp; The turmoil forces to the surface issues for the value of what our students and clients&nbsp; disclose.&nbsp; And for the credibility of what other people claim.&nbsp; The internet is said to manifest &lsquo;the wisdom of crowds&rsquo;.&nbsp; But that is an aggregated phenomenon.&nbsp; The mix actually contains a lot of posturing self-interest, some faceless malice, and more than a smattering of opinionated pig-ignorance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, how did we get here?</p>
<p><strong>the journey</strong><br />The trouble is that the net doesn&rsquo;t work at all without disclosure.&nbsp; But before we engage with it we need to know who is out there.&nbsp; And, before we commit to anything we need to know what they are looking for - and why.&nbsp; The word is &lsquo;trust&rsquo; - and the question is &lsquo;how would we know who to trust?&rsquo;.&nbsp; Nobody is closer to that question than careers workers.</p>
<p>The question is getting urgent in interactive social networks, and in experience-based narrative sites.&nbsp; We think of them as for personal use - but&nbsp; once on-line it&rsquo;s no longer just you.&nbsp; But this is not an argument for run-and-hide caution; it is an argument for managing risk.&nbsp; And, for that, both we and the people we set out to help, need to know where we are?</p>
<p>The internet is not static.&nbsp; It started as a kind of continuously self-updating resource centre.&nbsp; It became a minute-to-minute newsreel, where anyone can be the photo-journalist.&nbsp; It has become a spring-board for assertive action.&nbsp; From desk-top reading to street-level leading - in two decades.&nbsp; And that was only web 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0.&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch out for 4.0 ...and later.</p>
<p>It is also a journey from trust in solid expertise to trust in interactive experience.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnintrntbox.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">evidence</a> is that people make rather less use of expert careers-work sites than they do of social-networking sites - such as 'Linked-in&rsquo;.&nbsp; That accords with what we know about a society which - across the board - is becoming less deferential.&nbsp; No claim to know goes unchallenged.&nbsp; And so there is a growing range of narrative sites - such as &lsquo;Talking Jobs&rsquo; - where people find out about work from accounts of direct-and-personal experience.</p>
<p><strong>images</strong><br />Careers work has its enthusiasts for all this.&nbsp; True believers characterise its users as...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>natives</strong> - as if the net is wholly natural and wholesome; </li>
<li><strong>liberated</strong> - as if it opens gates and dismisses guards;</li>
<li><strong>empowered</strong> - as if it fires people up to be ready to go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not everybody is persuaded.&nbsp; So there are negative images for the sceptics...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>luddites</strong> - as if selfishly protecting their own interests; </li>
<li><strong>out-of-date</strong> - as if a calendar were an index of credibility;</li>
<li><strong>audience</strong> - as if passively trapped in front of a mere movie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither set of metaphors fits the facts.&nbsp; Both enthusiasts and sceptics deserve a hearing.&nbsp; And both can get over-excited.&nbsp; Careers work could do with some of the breath-holding, heart-pumping, sleep-invading excitement which move people to &lsquo;the next level&rsquo; on-line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it could also do with more of the question-posing, thought-provoking, tear-inducing, person-connecting experience that a good movie calls up.&nbsp; Decent movies live on a deeper level in life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, all said and done, I find on-line learning working with too-limited a gamut of experience.&nbsp; It offers too few points of contact with the virtualities it promotes.&nbsp; It makes even fewer with the realities it mimics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need new metaphors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>new images</strong><br />A recent <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrninternet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">article</a> develops two metaphors for on-line careers-work.&nbsp; They do not image what the net is like - we&rsquo;ve probably got more than we need on that.&nbsp; Instead, they image what careers workers do on the net.&nbsp; There are two images: we can try to &lsquo;colonise&rsquo; the net, or we can seek to &lsquo;inhabit&rsquo; it.&nbsp; Each image calls up its own distinctive range of careers-work activity.</p>
<p>In the past we have tended to colonise the net.&nbsp; To do that means bringing to it the apparatus that we formerly used off-line.&nbsp; We have, for example, exported the procedures, databases, and diagnostics that we use in our face-to-face interviews and classroom materials.&nbsp; A purpose would be to extend the accessibility of what we do, by moving into locations which the internet makes available.&nbsp; It would be to assume that what we were doing before the net will work well enough on the net.&nbsp; And it did work on web 1.0; but it won&rsquo;t work now.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t, because the net has developed its own interactive and experience-based dynamic.&nbsp; It has changed and we must change with it.&nbsp; But, in some respects it has stayed the same, and in these respects it is offering us an opportunity to call on what have been, until now, largely untapped professional resources.&nbsp; And what we do best.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what is it that has not changed, and which needs us now?&nbsp; The net has always been, and remains, a vehicle for communication.&nbsp; From on-line library to getting organised for action, everything that happens of the net comes as a message - voiced as memories and facts, words and images, meaning and purpose.&nbsp; Whatever we do we must engage that unchanging position.&nbsp; But we must now do it in changing interaction with experience.</p>
<p>It is this that suggests the second metaphor.&nbsp; Instead of colonising with what we do, we can inhabit to understand what our students and clients are doing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It means following the pathways that they navigate - especially in web 2-3.0 social networking and narrative sites.&nbsp; It puts us in partnership with users who are familiar with that territory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that changes our role.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no longer part of our work to keep up with what&rsquo;s going on on-line - students and clients can do that better than we.&nbsp; But we can engage in a probing reflection on what is said, what is shown and what is done on the net.&nbsp; Indeed, there are few who can do that better than we.&nbsp; That sounds to me like an inhabiting partnership rather than a colonising invasion.</p>
<p>So how do we develop our side of that deal?</p>
<p><strong>learning verbs</strong><br />Partnership means thinking less about what we do, and more about what our students and clients do.&nbsp; And we have a language for that.&nbsp; The words are not nouns or adjectives, saying what they are like; they are verbs - learning verbs - saying how they engage with the net.&nbsp; Careers workers are ready with four generic <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/CPIpdfs/cafcpi2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">learning verbs</a>.&nbsp; These verbs work well on the net&nbsp; - &lsquo;<em>finding</em> out&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>sorting</em> out&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>checking</em> out&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<em>working</em> out&rsquo;...</p>
<ul>
<li>the net is for <strong>finding</strong> things out - looking for the &lsquo;who. what, where, when, how and why&rsquo; of experience;</li>
<li>and what people find there needs <strong>sorting</strong> out - whether by listing, mapping or narrating - all ways of comparing and ordering things to make a useable meaning;</li>
<li>that done, they are in a position to engage in <strong>checking</strong> out - focusing what is relevant, useful, important to their purposes - and ensuring it is reliable;</li>
<li>now they are in a position to get to grips with <strong>working</strong> out - how things get this way, and what they can do about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We all do it.&nbsp; Sometimes quickly sometimes deliberatively.&nbsp; Both impulsively and intuitively.&nbsp; Wherever infused with inner-feeling and however complicated by other people.&nbsp; There is always some randomness, but the more chaotic the situation the more we need to learn.</p>
<p>The more we do it the more we learn to do it.&nbsp; But how?&nbsp; Largely from each other.&nbsp; In some homes probing questioning like this goes on all the time.&nbsp; But for many people, maybe most, talk goes no deeper than the &lsquo;who, what, where, when, how and why needed to stay in touch, be accepted, have a laugh, and gossip.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that - indeed it&rsquo;s useful.&nbsp; But it doesn&rsquo;t resolve career dilemmas, it doesn&rsquo;t get anybody through selection interviews, and it doesn&rsquo;t fire-up a person for a wider search for meaning and purpose in life.&nbsp; That needs a wider gamut of learning verbs - interactively interrogating experience.</p>
<p><strong>careers workers on the net</strong><br />Our students and clients can learn that from us.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what we do.&nbsp; They learn from the questions we ask in engaging them in reflection on their experience.&nbsp; The questions we ask them become the questions they learn to ask.&nbsp; That modeling becomes their basis for how they learn to be a witness to their own lives.&nbsp; We should remind them of that - give feedback on how they are learning, talk with them about its importance.&nbsp; Ad we should cue them to go on questioning into the future - not just now for this, but life-long for anything.&nbsp; Modeling, feedback and expectation are among the most compelling teachers.&nbsp; And the net has nothing more experience-based, or more interactive.</p>
<p>We can all - them and us - learn to do this: it&rsquo;s a species thing.&nbsp; We have evolved brains which have any number of pathways to finding what is going on and knowing what to do about it.&nbsp; It generates ready-for-anything learning&nbsp; - our finger-hold on survival.&nbsp; On the savannah, on the street, and on the net.</p>
<p>So be grateful for Twitter.&nbsp; It has located you where you can help most.&nbsp; Because, if anybody is in a position to enable a person to probe anything, it needn&rsquo;t be a celebrity, or a politician, or a business person, or a judge.&nbsp; Probability is against all four.</p>
<p>But it might well be you.</p>    </div>
