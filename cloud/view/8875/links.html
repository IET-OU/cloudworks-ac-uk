<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" rel="nofollow">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Careers work inhabits a world of accelerating change, carrying unforeseen risks, and provoking radical responses in overwhelmed locations.&nbsp; It's hardly surprising that whatever careers work does somebody finds something wrong with it - the practicalities of careers work are contested.&nbsp; Meanwhile the challenge for students and clients is be ready-for-anything.&nbsp; Careers work is confronted with the need somehow to reconcile all this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not easy.&nbsp; An understandable reaction is to wonder why the career-learning caf&eacute; makes things so complicated.&nbsp; The following five paragraphs explain why.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center">careers work needs your say about this&nbsp;<br /><br />sign up on the right and blog at the foot of the page</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"><br />change</strong></p>
<p>What is going on now has effects at least as far-reaching as what was seen through the first telescope, or found in the first printed book, or experienced in the first urban factories.&nbsp; And the causes and consequences of such changes stretch from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; At each stage we can have little idea what results to expect, but we can know that nothing will be the same again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviews below ask whether careers work can survive contemporary change by doing the same again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>risk</strong></p>
<p>Contemporary change is multi-layered, mounting all its challenges at the same time.&nbsp; Commerce is more demanding, it's technologies pervade how we all live, and the cultures they nurture are deferential to neither &eacute;lite or expertise.&nbsp; All of this poses risks for careers-work credibility.&nbsp; Policy, commerce, media and anecdote throng with ready-made demands of careers-work practice, throwing it into continuous dispute. &nbsp;The causes of all this are multi-layered and their consequences seem to be irreversible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviews ask whether the risks pose existential threats to careers work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>response</strong></p>
<p>Long ago careers work gets started by concentrating on a self hopefully searching work categories for opportunities that match hopes.&nbsp; Early on just how much choice is available to that self is in doubt.&nbsp; And, soon after, the thinking acknowledges how the attachments and loyalties of social background figure in what the self does about career.&nbsp; As the navigation of that complexity and accelerating change become more demanding careers work looks to stage-by-stage learning - enabling the self to make useful sense of confusing, chaotic, and misleading experience.&nbsp; The growing need to respond to points-of-view in a social world means that recounting narrated sequences works better than scanning ready-made categories.&nbsp; It also accords with neurological findings which show how multi-layered learning so entwines feelings-and-thoughts to make a self capable of fruitful self contradiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;reviews ask how readily careers work is responding to this continuing expansion of the idea of self.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>location</strong></p>
<p>A 'self' may be understood psychologically, economically and neurologically; but a career-managing self must also be understood as socially situated.&nbsp; Work is done with and for other people. &nbsp;Careers work is adept at understanding career management in its national and global contexts.&nbsp; But causes-and-effects in village, neighbourhood and network need to be understood in these particular social-and-cultural locations - where self-awareness is infused with an awareness of other people.&nbsp; Whether in postcode, url or appointments diary, these contacts are experienced as close-up encounters with people who are readily recognisable, understood, valued - and, therefore, trusted. &nbsp;That experience is invested in locations called 'social enclaves' which frame and shape what people do - including what they do about work-life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviews point to enclaves ranging from what people might claim is 'our-cosmopolitan-set' to what people might feel is 'our-side-of-the-street'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>practicality</strong></p>
<p>Concerns for practicality appear to ask 'how well does it work?'.&nbsp; But where different enclaves attribute different meanings to different experience the question becomes 'who does it work for?'.&nbsp; And that is a question of ownership not efficiency - practice must belong to the people it serves.&nbsp; There is a wide range of expectations for what benefit careers work should bring.&nbsp; The spectrum of claimants ranges from shareholders to stakeholders. &nbsp;And the way their influences are levered is meant to determine the direction that practice takes - and sometimes it does.&nbsp; Whether voiced on behalf of nation or families there are underlying oppositions between shareholder and stakeholder voices.&nbsp; The former claim most to value economic success, competitive achievement and libertarian freedom.&nbsp; The latter claim most to value personal-and-social fulfilment, fair access to opportunity and critical independence.&nbsp; Each different position takes a different interest in what voices are heeded, what research is commissioned and therefore what practice is favoured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviews show what practice works for stakeholders - and what does not.</p>
<p>They follow below, each updating caf&eacute; material on one or more of the five challenges to contemporary careers work.</p>

<p>Bill Law's Career-learning Caf&eacute; is in danger of closure. &nbsp;It has&nbsp;supported learning-for-living&nbsp;for approaching twenty years. &nbsp;It welcomes visitors, from careers-work and education outfits, working on enabling career management. &nbsp;It is independent of business, government and professional interests.&nbsp; Its material is free to access and download. &nbsp;Vistors are asked only to acknowledge caf&eacute; sources, and to feedback suggestions for their improvement.</p>
<p>But the caf&eacute; cannot go on indefinitely.&nbsp; It has been funded from Bill's earnings from his research-and-development work.&nbsp; That money will run out - the caf&eacute; needs new funding.&nbsp; Part of that comes from a scheme offering on-line professional mentoring in enabling career-management. &nbsp;There is an award of a Career-learning Caf&eacute; <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sblicence.pdf" rel="nofollow">certificate or diploma</a>.</p>
<p>Further arrangements must take account of the caf&eacute;'s users.&nbsp; They include people...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...not in a position to contribute - for them things will go on as they are for as long as possible</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...in a position to contribute - who can decide for themselves what would be an affordable contribution</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">...in an organisation - who might be able to ask their managers to consider contributing</p>
