        <p><strong>Your situation (context)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Describe the material and social characteristics of the environment in which you operate. Where will your project take place? Who are the main actors involved? Include images, videos, sketches - anything that would help others understand the opportunities and constraints you are dealing with.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen the time and effort taken to produce many training courses at institutions I have worked at with different departments re-creating the wheel, in different systems, platforms and creating a patchwork of ideas that don't tie in with the any institutional strategy. I realise you can't impose strict standards on people, but some type of system that allows for Staff to dip in and out of training resources - videos, quizzes, worksheets, resources they can customise.</p>
<p>These resources would be the full range of resources in a HE institution - from Leadership and Management to Healthy and Safety, for PhD, Post Doctoral, Lecturers through to Professors.</p>
<p>They would run on any device, so be mobile friendly and allow 'just in time' learning to occur, with statistics being delivered to a central location for senior management to view, but also this impact would be measured in more mixed method approaches, so not just on the figures, via regular staff surveys etc.</p>
<p><strong>The change you would like to see (challenge)</strong><br /><strong>What do you hope to achieve? What would be different if you succeed?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability via technologies to enable all staff in a HE institution to access Staff Development / Training tailored to their needs via a Portal / MOOC etc. If this was achieved, more staff would feel that the institution cared about their development, would be prompted within the institution and would be retained for longer. As anyone knows, replacing good staff is costly. Results, via surveys and data would show an increase in staff satisfaction and better wellbeing and hopefully an upskilling of staff. These resources would not stop face to face training, they would supplement it, for 75% of all courses. The institution in the long run would have a robust automated staff development system suggesting courses based on tags / fields / job specifications of staff. "Ah, Professor X, I see you are supervising 8 PhD students, there's an online course for this, please sign up here. There's also a face to face course in 2 weeks." - sent to their email / SMS etc. <br /><br /><strong>How you might go about bringing that change<br />What is your pedagogical approach? Which technologies will you use to implement it, and how?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would done via a series of in-house resources, based on the needs of the institution. There would be a 'grand plan for development'. The pedagogical approach would be a Constructivism. Due to the complexities of what's required, a customised LMS / SharePoint or other solution in terms of technologies would need to be deployed, but rather like Cloudworks have the ability to embed and display social media feeds, to enrich the user experience and to give features like 'rate resource' etc more context and meaning.</p>    </div>

                   <p>Hi Kristina,</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments. That sounds great - looks like you have a lot more experience in this area than me. I just have an idea, which hopefully I can take bits from into my day job, at some point :)!</p>
<p>We need 1 more person, before we have a team, then we can create a Cloudscape and link it to http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2470. Maybe a title of 'A Staff Development / Training Online MOOC / Portal' ?</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
