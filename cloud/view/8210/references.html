        <p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>Where are you coming from? What is the context in which you are working and participating in OLDS MOOC?</em></p>
<p>I have a company in Canada where I develop instructional products for clients in the context of e-learning. This includes online learning program and course designs, and development of online courses, e-tutorials, webpages, etc. My clients range from academia to the corporate world (i.e. training).</p>
<p>I love to learn and I know I must keep atop of latest trends in technology yet continue to explore and reflect on learning in our current time. As well, I base my work and thinking on theory &ndash; that has always worked for me.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>What did you hope to achieve? What were your goals in joining OLDS MOOC?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really have a project in mind or on the drawing board but rather was a &lsquo;shopper&rsquo; or lurker. I was immediately impressed (and still am) with the quality of the program and presenters that I knew I would learn from the best. I really enjoy following developments in the UK and gravitate to their work/presentations/resources.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>What did you do? What were the main events, interactions, practices and activities in which you participated?&nbsp;What were the obstacles - and how did you tackle them?</em></p>
<p>I tried to participate as best I could with odd comments, but mostly reviewed the presentations and explored the tools and resources. I felt like I was letting someone down but not being more active but I didn&rsquo;t have the time or any special project or challenge to explore at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><em>What were the outcomes of your participation? Did you meet your goals? What went well, what didn't? What unexpected outcomes did you notice?</em></p>
<p>I found I gathered some great tools but more important, I was reminded by great instructional designers to deeply think about design and take the time to reflect and plan before composing a piece of work.</p>
<p>The big &lsquo;aha&rsquo; for me was to thoroughly consider the context of a learner - difficult to do but so important. I think about the many who are unsatisfied with e-learning at this time and that challenges me to approach such learning with more intention and perhaps slightly differently. I roll my eyes at messages &lsquo;out there&rsquo; on 5 tips to a successful online course. In the end, the proof is in the pudding.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>What did you learn? What advice could you give others?</em></p>
<p>I struggled with the MOOC structure (a bit over structured) and Cloudworks (not a common or intuitive platform) and this provided me with some reflection on any future MOOC I may decide to deliver (with a team!). I think MOOCs are an interesting phenomenon in education and evident of the OER movement; however, by learning from them we can build them better. I think MOOCs are very much an organic environment of building distributed knowledge within and across networks (Stephen Downes perception) that is unpredictable and somewhat uncontrollable. This lends to informal learning in a crazy connected world. I believe MOOCs also require different ways to support their learners, but I haven&rsquo;t really fashioned what that would look like, yet. This is my 4<sup>th</sup> MOOC and I will attend another one, after a wee break. :0)</p>
