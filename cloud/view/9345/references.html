<p>This account of the future poses some pressing questions for careers work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>is careers work usefully thought of as an institution or a movement?<br /></em><em>does it most need defending or galvanising?<br /></em><em>does that mean it knows where it's going?<br /></em><em>and who it needs to take with it?<br /></em><em>and does that mean supporting some interests and opposing others?<br /></em><em>and if it does is there any agreement about which is which?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the issues, and this is an account of a careers-work leader who took them on - and did so some time ago. &nbsp;He's worth listening to now, because no issue was resolved then, and none is resolved now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are existential issues - if careers work can't tell itself what it is about, it needn't expect anyone else to show much interest.&nbsp; Careers work needs the issues resolved now.</p>
<p>The examination comes in five stages...</p>
<p>1: &nbsp;<strong>unemployment</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the politics of careers work damages society<br />2: &nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">education and the local state</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; central controls are displacing local understanding &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />3:&nbsp; <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">manpower and careers services</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;central and local actions are inseparably entwined<br />4: &nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">youth opportunities</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the best training in the world does not create work<br />5: &nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">the future</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a good future brings dignity, respects individuality and conceeds control</p>

<p>What follows is the most insightful polemic on the issues facing careers work that I have come across.&nbsp; It is compelling stuff and intended to galvanise change.&nbsp; It's Kevin Devine's presidential address to The Institute of Careers Officers annual conference, in September 1981. &nbsp;Contemporary careers work is yet to catch up with him. &nbsp;And yestrerday's ICO was the forerunner of today's Career Development Institute .&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've edited this version into the available space.&nbsp; None of Kevin's ideas have been lost.&nbsp; A post-script takes a look at the implications of his long-ago thinking for today's and tomorrow's action.</p>

<p>Kevin Devine<br /> President, The&nbsp;Institute of Careers Officers</p>
<p>I run the risk of falling into the category of...</p>
<p align="center"><em>...bleeding hearts&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so-called liberals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marxist agitators</em></p>
<p>But what I hope to do is demonstrate that the way society treats its young people, and particularly the unemployed, is nothing less than a prescription for social chaos and confusion. &nbsp;And when I say society I mean all of us.&nbsp; More importantly, we run the risk of perpetrating one of the greatest social outrages that this country has seen. &nbsp;It is to cause youngsters to be the victims of a society which behaves as though it has no place for them.</p>
<p>I will take a look at the nature of unemployment among young people and society's response to their needs.&nbsp; It means examining the place of education, the nature of the local state, and the youth opportunities programmes. &nbsp;I want these threads to come together in a glimpse of a future which can enable young people to participate in their society, to improve it, but - most of all - to have a sense of dignity and self-respect in whatever they do.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1:&nbsp; UNEMPLOYMENT</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For many careers workers a detailed examination of the features of youth unemployment is clearly unnecessary.&nbsp; However, on the off-chance that there may be some who have learned about unemployment from pernicious propaganda, and whose higher consciousness is immersed in the theories of monetarism, I will briefly look at some aspects of unemployment among young people because this background is relevant to my theme.</p>
<p>I shall refer later to the role of the Manpower Services Commission.&nbsp; But itis interesting to note now that it established a working party which, with the support of parliament, produced the package we now know as the <em>Youth Opportunities Programme </em>(YOP). &nbsp;Its report, <em>Young People and Work</em>, is adocument of profound significance - not only for members of this Institute's careers services - but, in my view, also for local education authorities and for society itself. &nbsp;The report established that juvenile unemployment was likely to stay at on exceptionally high levels. &nbsp;It also noted that there is an increase in seventeen- and eighteen-year-olds entering the labour market. &nbsp;The results have been, by anybody's criteria, a remarkable achievement in delivering a programme of opportunities, from which many young people have benefited. &nbsp;However, one significant conclusion is notably absent from the report: it is that unemployment among young people was no longer a cyclical phenomenon, but essentially structural in nature. &nbsp;At least YOP affords society a chance of buying time to consider other strategies that meet the real needs of unemployed young people - who are now affected to an extent unthinkable a decade ago.</p>
<p>The young jobless frequently hit the headlines in the media. &nbsp;Most of us know that it is young people in the age range of sixteen-to-twenty-four who are now adversely affected. &nbsp;The majority come from backgrounds where craft or manual occupations are common. &nbsp;In the early days of the growth of unemployment, most of the youngsters affected were unqualified.&nbsp; It is now becoming increasingly difficult, sometimes impossible, for any young person to find a job.</p>
<p>We face a future where the total unemployment figure continues to rise. &nbsp;The grim government figures are an under-statement.&nbsp; An economic consideration is the failure to invest in training.&nbsp; It is difficult to imagine the anxieties of sixteen year-olds leaving school. &nbsp;Teachers are reluctant to prepare young people for unemployment.&nbsp; And they are beginning to experience the backlash of students no longer motivated for trying to benefit from education.&nbsp; Students see little purpose in it. &nbsp;Many are sharp enough to perceive that learning comes to nothing with no employment at the end.</p>
<p>In the five years to 1900, there was a sixty per-cent increase in unemployment and a fifty per-cent rise in young-people's suicides. &nbsp;&nbsp;Young blacks are disproportionately affected.&nbsp; Yet for each prosecution for tax evasion there are 160 for social-security fraud. &nbsp;The ministerial response?...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'there are many people in our society <br /> who are harder pressed than immediate school leavers'</em></p>
<p>My purpose, then, is not to offer raw material for some sociological journal, but to illustrate the reality of these cruel inequalities.&nbsp; Part of it is the vicious phenomenon of fascism whose propaganda blames unemployment on Jews, and which sees the dole queue as a fertile recruiting ground. &nbsp;Part of the reality is the materialistic advertising of the popular press - offering an anodyne escape from the reality of unemployment. &nbsp;It lays a smoke screen, obscuring the realities underlying what it sees as unacceptable expressions of antipathy or alienation.&nbsp; Aneurin Bevan has already voiced it...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'this so-called affluent society is an ugly society' <br /> 'it is a vulgar society<br /> 'it is a meretricious society<br /> 'it is a society in which priorities have gone all wrong'</em></p>
<p>These are the turbulent waters on which teenagers embark when they leave school. &nbsp;The secondary curriculum has precious little to do with their real needs. &nbsp;There are pious statements about...</p>
<p align="center"><em>...personal and social education.</em></p>
<p>They show every sign of being written in a cosy and secure world, they are an emasculated programme far-removed from the overcrowded tenements of inner cities.</p>
<p>And there is also what passes for...</p>
<p align="center"><em>...careers education.</em></p>
<p>It emphases content over the process by which youngsters learn for a life after school. &nbsp;The resources available to teachers encourage conformity, fitting pegs into holes - and, heaven help the ill-fitting. &nbsp;If careers education is to have any real guts as a subject, then one of its principal purposes must be to enable young people to learn how to take control of their own lives.</p>
<p>On leaving school youngster becomes clients of a careers service. &nbsp;Careers-service staff know the profound effects of the remorseless day-in-and-day-out pressure of dealing with young people - who conclude that society has nothing to offer them. &nbsp;The risk is that the service becomes an agency siphoning off resentment which might be expressed in activity against society. &nbsp;Feelings of apathy give way to a sense of rejection. culminating in angry and melancholic alienation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The path of escalation is obvious - for some in society the only remedy is to silence the protest. &nbsp;A more insidious call is for doing whatever is necessary to preserve the fabric of society.&nbsp; But there is a third possibility...:</p>
<p align="center"><em>we must do something so that these young people can help <br /> in changing the fabric of society</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Careers officers help youngsters do something worthwhile in their lives. &nbsp;But for many the initial optimism about the Youth Opportunities Programme has given way to a weary sense of forlorn hope. &nbsp;There is no need to criticise the programme, but there is a need to examine the odds stacked against its success. &nbsp;In sharp contrast with apprentices and students, the jobless-young lack a sense of purpose and - most importantly - any sense of status.&nbsp; They need the help of the community around them.&nbsp; This must not be condescending prescription but a constructive enabling.&nbsp; More is needed from education, and not only inside their institutions but also through setting up fulfilling and vigorous roles in their communities. &nbsp;But has local education the resources and freedom to get it done?</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>2:&nbsp; EDUCATION AND THE LOCAL STATE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a decline in the financial resources available to local education authorities. &nbsp;It has led to some centralisation.&nbsp; There is also an intrusion of party politics into education.&nbsp; The local management of education is the most consistently political part of local government services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The most recent example of that intrusion is in central-government initiatives for curriculum.&nbsp; It famously began with the speech by the then Prime Minister at Ruskin College.&nbsp; It was followed by a series of great debates, a spate of publications, and persistent pressure from the central education ministry. &nbsp;But there is still a wide gap between all this and the facts of life facing school leavers.&nbsp; While almost every aspect of the debate raises questions for local autonomy versus central direction. &nbsp;The curriculum is dominated by the examination system, itself centrally influenced by the universities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But the practice of local authorities varies widely - perhaps too widely. &nbsp;And the debate raise doubts about whether they can properly meet the demands. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>I think they can - and should. &nbsp;And there has been some government acknowledgement of the need to have local mechanisms to deal with local needs.&nbsp; But the only effective answer to this is to reform the financial structure - and base it on local income for local authorities.</p>
<p>How do we reconcile these traditional values of local democratic accountability with the need to reduce all aspects of national expenditure?&nbsp; The pressure is to bring all into line with central economic policies.&nbsp; Various groups protest and fight the resulting cuts.&nbsp; They include the students' parents, council tenants, the elderly, the infirm and minorities. &nbsp;But there are fewer who actually organise for more to stimulate employment.</p>
<p>The underlying conflict is between what government can do about social <em>investment</em> and what local authorities can do about social <em>provision</em>.&nbsp; The issue becomes...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what is the role of local government in the British state?'</em></p>
<p>Take first the notion of the British state, and assume that it is a capitalist rather than communist state.&nbsp; Centralisation then positions local government as an arm of capitalism. &nbsp;It's argued that government has two key functions: to maintain social order, requiring either legitimation or coercion; and to maintain profitability in the private sector, requiring social investment contributing to citizen well-being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The involvement of the state in social investment is frequently overlooked by opponents of increased public expenditure.&nbsp; But it provides resources which the private sector does not supply. &nbsp;And once those infrastructure costs are pushed upwards to government, the private sector shifts away from improving private-sector profitability. &nbsp;And that reduces employment opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile jobs in industries which contribute to social investment, such as the steel industry, are eroded.&nbsp; Some, such as the railways, are under-capitalised.&nbsp; And price increases are forced elsewhere, for example in gas and electricity. &nbsp;The results are a drop in labour requirements, falling demand and rising prices. &nbsp;Yet we stifle industries which could bring recovery, and there is under-investment new industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time local-government expenditure on social provision is curtailed.&nbsp; That is the case for housing, hospitals and welfare.&nbsp; And social provision indirectly ensures a local supply of labour.&nbsp; But, if local employers don't need workers, they see little point in social and welfare services to look after them. &nbsp;Local government has had some responsibility for social investment, for example in gas, electricity and water, roads and public transport.&nbsp; But those services have been taken away.</p>
<p>There is conflict between social investment controlled by the central state and social provision consumed in the locality. &nbsp;At the national level corporate boards have direct access to policy-making. &nbsp;At regional level non-elected authorities are gaining control of essential services.&nbsp; However, housing and welfare remain local provisions where priorities can be locally argued. &nbsp;That also applies to education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Central government is taking measures to bring local authorities into line. &nbsp;It must also try to reconcile its economic priorities with the social demands expressed in democratic protests.&nbsp; But the impositions of central government, the remoteness of its officialdom, and the insensitivities of whitehall departments all contribute to a growing cynicism in society. &nbsp;Cynicism gives way to apathy and apathy to alienation.&nbsp; And public-expenditure cuts are a constant companion of rising unemployment.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>3:&nbsp; MANPOWER AND CAREERS SERVICES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Manpower Services Commission Is a central agency for social investment.&nbsp; It is not democratically appointed. &nbsp;The investments aredesigned to contribute directly to private-sector profitability - they serve employer interests. &nbsp;Services which do not serve that main purpose are discarded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A careers service is a local agency for social provision.&nbsp; It is democratically accountable.&nbsp; As part of social provision, consumed locally, careers services have had both losses and gains - but on balance they have contracted&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notable is the loss of the centrally-based Careers and Occupational Information Centre. &nbsp;The centre has made an outstanding contribution to the provision of information and resources to clients and students.&nbsp; It found a ready acceptance among youngsters, their parents, their teachers and in careers services. &nbsp;To the extent that this service has maintained its principal priority, of offering a service to young people, it resembles social provision.&nbsp; Examples include providing group work, counselling, interviewing and&nbsp; placement services. &nbsp;All are locally consumed.</p>
<p>The question must now be asked...</p>
<p align="center"><em>given the distinctions between central investment and local provision <br /> what is the role of careers services in local government?</em></p>
<p>There can be no simple answer.&nbsp; The operation of an employment service cannot succeed unless it attends to the needs of employers.&nbsp; A majority of employers would probably accept that, by providing a first and significant priority to the needs of job seekers, the&nbsp; service is helping employers.&nbsp; Careers services have a much better record than any private provision in covering work vacancies.&nbsp; They therefore offer a uniquely sophisticated pre-selection service to the labour market. &nbsp;Employers make the final recruiting selection, but careers services are as much a form of social investment as central government.&nbsp; There can be no simple separation between central-manpower needs and local-consumer needs.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>4:&nbsp; YOUTH OPPORTUNITIES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In a recent joint publication of the Manpower Services Commission and the Education Committee of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the following statement appears.</p>
<p align="center"><em>'The Youth Opportunities Programme is designed around<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">the needs of unemployed young people of different levels of ability,<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">and for whom work experience, training in basic skills and constructive vocational advice and guidance are likely to be of value in their search for suitable employment'</em></p>
<p>The big problem is that there isn't any suitable employment for many youngsters. &nbsp;There is considerable evidence of disaffection among youngsters who question the value of going on the programme when on completion there are few, if any, employment opportunities.</p>
<p>About a million young people are to take part.&nbsp; And the programme certainly has some significant successes - it has been a life-line for many. &nbsp;But, although a vast majority have derived some benefit, the number completing the programme and going into suitable employment is decreasing all the time.</p>
<p>A <em>Youthaid Review</em> of the programme reports concerns&nbsp;&nbsp; A disproportionate burden of unemployment is carried by young black school leavers. &nbsp;There is a 'creeping rigidity', and repeated complaints that the programme is weighed down with rules, regulations and administrative procedures.&nbsp; The most common cause of complaint seems to be bureaucratic delays, particularly in the approval of schemes.</p>
<p>The Youth Opportunities Programme was originally intended to be an alternative to unemployment, but - as matters have developed - it has become an alternative to employment. &nbsp;Red tape aside, the most effective training programme cannot create jobs.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5:&nbsp; THE FUTURE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A radical and new approach is necessary. &nbsp;But the creation of new jobs is a long-term and ambitious goal.&nbsp; Even a sudden switch to a crash programme of public expenditure, investment and expansion will not achieve overnight.</p>
<p>For too long an assumption has been that employment services and training sum-up the national enterprise. &nbsp;But local authorities have more active roles - in stimulating employment growth, and operating employment services.&nbsp; Local services are more client-centred, more responsive to need and more accountable to consumers. &nbsp;We allaccept that education, training and employment are closely linked together - but they are also local services designed to meet local needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To any who doubt the ability of local authorities to respond, I cite examples of what can be done by a determined and dedicated services. &nbsp;There are local authorities which have vigorously pursued radical policies for stimulating employment growth.&nbsp; The Inner-London Education Authority has a consistently good record of making available resources to careers services so that they can meet the demands made on them.&nbsp; Those services have provided for unemployed youngsters over-and-above what is afforded by the Manpower Services Commission.</p>
<p>We don't need more agencies, we need a more radical approach to cut through red tape of existing agencies and to get on with expanding work opportunities. &nbsp;We must be prepared to re-appraise the relationship between local education, careers services and government. &nbsp;Careers services will play key roles.&nbsp; &nbsp;But how that reappraisal works out in detail is a task for local authorities.</p>
<p>I see training workshops and real community projects as the backbone, closely linked to a purposeful programme of skills training. &nbsp;Whatever the provision, it must be based in the local community, draw on its resources, and serving its needs.</p>
<p>It must also show respect for the individuality of each young person - enabling them to feel that they have status and purpose in society. &nbsp;That means socially providing learning which is relevant to their needs, over-compensating for disadvantage, and positioning all young people for taking control their own futures.</p>

<p><strong>POSTCRIPT<br /></strong>Bill Law</p>
<p>Kevin's voice has authority.&nbsp; He spoke as the Head of Cambridgeshire Careers Service and president of the ICO.&nbsp; He was later appointed director of the government-funded Schools Council research-and-development project on working life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were other authoritative voices at the time - <a href="http://www.cegnet.co.uk/blog/peter-daws" rel="nofollow">Peter Daws</a> had most influence on government.&nbsp; But Kevin was not negotiating with government, he was galvanising a profession.&nbsp; The speech is not about attaching careers work to politics, it's about attaching careers work to the lives of clients and students.&nbsp; His is not a voice for defending convention, but for catalysing reform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He spoke from the guidance wing of careers work, and I'm mostly on the curriculum wing.&nbsp; So I didn't come across his lecture until he casually mentioned it.&nbsp; On hearing his summary I asked for a copy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I admire the nerve that blows the whistle on the narrow self-interests of the simple-minded - some of whom are among the influential.&nbsp; I don't remember anybody so comprehensively taking on the task as Kevin - dismantling trends, disentangling analyses, facing reality.&nbsp; It predates by decades today's careers-work thinking. &nbsp;And it was way ahead of any current argument for reform -&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/careers-work reform" rel="nofollow">including my own</a>.</p>
<p>Kevin Devine was the first in his field to identify the impact on careers work of neo-liberal austerity. &nbsp;And he developed an early grasp of the way the locality influences career development. &nbsp; Those local authorities have since been seriously damaged by central government. &nbsp;And what is going wrong still needs probing...</p>
<p align="center"><em>is careers work usefully thought of as an institution or a movement?<br /></em><em>does it most need defending or galvanising?<br /></em><em>does that mean it knows where it's going?<br /></em><em>and who it needs to take with it?<br /></em><em>and does that mean supporting some interests and opposing others?<br /></em><em>and if it does is there any agreement about which is which?</em></p>
<p>I can report hands-on experience of a failure to address such questions. &nbsp;The government's Careers and Occupational Information Centre was the publisher of my<em>&nbsp;</em>open-learning pack, whose title coined the term '<em>Careers Work'.</em>&nbsp; For several years, in centres throughout the country, and running to three editions, the pack was a resource for locally-based programme development.&nbsp; An official unilaterally replaced it with a few pages of advice to practitioners.&nbsp; He had been a former careers adviser and I had helped to train him. &nbsp;I can't help feeling, on encoutering him in government, that this former careers worker was, after all, rooted in the narrow, the self-interested and the simple-minded.</p>
<p>That self-serving mentality is an enemy of progress. &nbsp;And change is the agenda. &nbsp;But, left to itself, there is an unreadiness that displaces free-thinking enlightenment and hard-won evidence with whim and superstition. &nbsp;Conflicting versions of religious extremism spill into our schools, colleges and universities. &nbsp;It gets harder to appreciate migration as a gift. &nbsp;Life, well-being, and survival are put at risk - while commercial and political interests&nbsp;move on unhampered. &nbsp;They capture and curtail the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf" rel="nofollow">usurped and weakened public services</a>&nbsp;- by which civilised societies manage change. &nbsp;The agenda needs to be progressive change, and its enemies are any combination of the complacent, the narrow, the self-interested, the simple-minded and the powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did anybody predict any of this in 1981? &nbsp;Contemporary careers work cannot afford to ignore it. &nbsp;Public-service careers work is in a worse state now than in 1981 - brought&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf" rel="nofollow">close to extinction</a>. &nbsp;And this twenty-first-century failure was set in motion by that plodding twentieth-century complacency. &nbsp; A persistent unwillingness to&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094" rel="nofollow">learn from failure</a>&nbsp;means that the last careers-work leader left standing will, in any now-and-future, be empty-handed.</p>
<p>Education has a counter-narrative, offering careers work wider horiizions. &nbsp;Kevin Devine's thinking on 'central investment and local provision' gets on-going research-based support, examining '<a href="http://cdj.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/suppl_1/i132.abstract" rel="nofollow">corporate management and community development</a>'.&nbsp; There are massive areas of expansion for careers work to understand and enable. &nbsp;People are <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094" rel="nofollow">learning from experience</a> at least as much as from expertise.&nbsp; That experience is increasingly shaped in <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/nicecspace&place.pdf" rel="nofollow">locally-based</a> enclaves.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/NICECHit&Myth.pdf" rel="nofollow">internet</a> is at the same time a help and hindrance to learning. &nbsp;Local educators know more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-views/productivity-a-puzzle-policymakers-not-fe" rel="nofollow">improving productivity</a>&nbsp;than central government, its sponsors and its favoured advisers. &nbsp;The way people understand themselves in the world is <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9272" rel="nofollow">outflanking conventional politics</a>.&nbsp; It is even possible that the word 'socialism' no longer attracts&nbsp;knee-jerk&nbsp;derision from closed minds. &nbsp;Instead the call is for the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9272" rel="nofollow">ready-for-anything-flexibility</a> of independent minds, critically thinking, and creatively inventing.</p>
