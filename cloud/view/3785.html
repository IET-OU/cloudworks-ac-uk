			<p>Marian is starting of the session by introducing 4 of the previous PhD students (Katerina Tzanidou, Mohammed Salifu, Mike Ellims and Tom Heath). &nbsp;This session is about using your PhD in industry.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Heath</strong></p>
<p>Tom Heath is going to kick off the presentations. He is saying there is living proof that there is life after a PhD. He&rsquo;s in industry from Talis Systems Ltd. In industry you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to wear a suit &ndash; he wears exactly what he is wearing (jeans and a T-shirt). He joined KMI in 2004 and finished in January 2008 (on a Saturday afternoon at 4 o&rsquo;clock).</p>
<p>Talis one of the oldest software company in the UK and it is in Birmingham (40 years later). Talking bit more about Talis and what they do. Before he joined, there was some research going on in the topic but it was not systematic instead it was just to solve problems arising in the company. His role is to look at the long term research.</p>
<p>He is talking about the interview plenary yesterday. He is saying sometimes there may not be interviews it might be more organic. Instead he was invited up to the company for some lunch, see what they&rsquo;re doing and then he was offered a research position. How this arose is because he created assets in his PhD that paid off later:</p>
<ul>
<li>Becoming visible outside of the OU community e.g. doing the developer&rsquo;s tract at a conference</li>
<li>Thus networking and profile raising</li>
</ul>
<p>He has been there about 2 years. The assets that he brings to the company are not so much the research he did in his PhD but the contacts he knew and other such assets.</p>
<p>He has to build the research capacity inside and outside the company (particularly in SMEs) &ndash; and this is not often clear as in academia. One of his most challenging aspects of his job is propagating a research-driven perspective particularly for people who are not researchers.</p>
<p>Another challenge is to deal with uncertainty and constantly evolve requirements &ndash; also need to know about the business world whilst retaining a need-to-know mentality. Also, building an agreement within the company about the value of research. Sometimes you have to live without a large existing infrastructure such as in an university.</p>
<p><strong>Mohammed Salifu</strong></p>
<p>He is going to give the organisational structure of his company and an example project on cost modelling system to show how he uses the knowledge he earned from his PhD. He&rsquo;ll also discuss whether he got here by design or accident.</p>
<p>His company is quite small (60 persons), under the director there are two parts the technical delivery and the service delivery. He works with the Business analysts (?) which is located under the service delivery to determine if the project they&rsquo;re doing is feasible (?).</p>
<p>He says unlike in the PhD where you have 3 years in the business world you need to justify every day you go over ... you need to estimate the number of days for development.</p>
<p>The company deals with cost modelling systems (works with insurance and banking systems). In the project they have to do content specification, quality control and a cost calculator.</p>
<p>In delivering this you have service level agreements. You need to specify when you&rsquo;ll get it done and 95% of the time it needs to be get done (?). If you miss the dates then it translates into real concrete money.</p>
<p>His research looks more into software engineering and fits into what he is doing at the moment. Having a level of knowledge clarity helps in fitting in and ensures he does not cross boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Katerina Tzanidou</strong></p>
<p>She is going to talk about the soft skills she developed during her PhD. Started her PhD in 2002 &ndash; where she was using eye-tracking. She submitted in 3 years and 3 months. Published a few conference papers.</p>
<p>Since she finished her PhD, joined a company in London as a consultant. After a year became a Deputy Head and the last year she is now managing and working with others. Key things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn to mange and work with others 
<ul>
<li>You need to manage your supervisors &ndash; particularly when they&rsquo;re from diverse backgrounds and different schedules</li>
<li>Tried to find ways of offering things to do so the supervisor can offer something back to you (e.g. baby-sit her supervisor&rsquo;s kids to get info from her supervisor without the pressures of a university)</li>
<li>Organise and structure work in a self-sufficient way 
<ul>
<li>Teach yourself to be discipline or structured (learn, plan, do, review)</li>
<li>We become memorable in industry because we know how to work independent, organised, analytical and have learnt to deliver</li>
<li>Networking and talking to key people 
<ul>
<li>Found it difficult in the beginning of her PhD as she was shy &ndash; and has learnt to overcome that fear</li>
<li>Her first step was talking to peers &ndash; and learnt the key things when you talk to other persons &ndash; it is all about empathy</li>
<li>Use the online tools to network with people &ndash; for exactly LinkedIn and make sure you follow where they might be presenting and make an effort to talk to them</li>
<li>Creating a persona that you talk to the right people in the industry (talked about how she got into Google by building networks and asking people if they knew anyone who knew anyone and start talking to those people and find things in common with them)</li>
<li>Acknowledging and giving credit to peers 
<ul>
<li>Giving credit to the people that you work with and saying thank you and can add value to the relationship that you build with your peers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mike Ellims</strong></p>
<p>He is saying his PhD is kind of like a chocolate teapots as it was not very fashionable and very specialised. Previously he was a chief engineering (94 to 08) and his function was a jack-of-all-trades and was reasonably good at it (software, analysis etc).</p>
<p>The bad news, 99% of the jobs don&rsquo;t require a PhD (he is based in Cambridge). Exceptions to that is research based companies such as Microsoft and Google as well as venture capital start ups who want bragging rights.</p>
<p>What is wanted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexibility 
<ul>
<li>Be able to address different problems</li>
<li>Become an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; quickly i.e. be better than anyone else there</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>He started as a life as a programmer and then his PhD in software testing. And then he became a system safety engineer (and then became redundant) and then moved on to making new products with new standards which presents a lot of interesting problems.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s doing hazard analysis for in-wheel motors &ndash; and his work is to do with vehicle dynamics and his job has nothing to with software engineering. Lots of his work is to with controllability i.e. the human factors. He says now he has to pay for journal papers (&pound;30 each) and now has to do a lot of filtering. This is research in an industrial context and needs to convince his employers these papers are worth buying.</p>
<p>Transferable skills from PhD</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem analysis 
<ul>
<li>What <em>actually</em> is the problem? (You have to define the problem)</li>
<li>Information access 
<ul>
<li>Finding information (cheaply!)</li>
<li>Evaluation, relevance (art of reading abstracts)</li>
<li>Organisation 
<ul>
<li>Of data</li>
<li>Of ideas (e.g. 2 page executive summary)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<p><em>How do people react to you with a PhD in an industrial setting when they don&rsquo;t have one?</em></p>
<p>Tom: Pretty interesting reactions. Some awe, some intimidation. The challenge to show some humility and to say that your path is different and not devalue others or yours path</p>
<p>Mohammed: Less than half of the people in his company have a PhD. He prefers to use his skills covertly. Having a PhD is not a basis for giving someone a PhD when he is looking at CVs for recruiting business analysts. Bringing the skills to the interview is needed.</p>
<p>Katerina: Her research is research driven &ndash; bringing &nbsp;a PhD to her company brings value. She has recruited another PhD in her team because of the type of work and it is a benefit.</p>
<p>Mike: Over the last 20 yrs, a large proportion of the people he worked with have PhDs or failed to complete PhDs. The company he currently works with a third has PhDs particularly from the Physical sciences and engineering. The PhD is just an introduction, you still have to convince you&rsquo;re the right person with the right skills.</p>
<p><em>What were your unique selling propositions? What were the timescales you agreed with the company to achieve things? </em></p>
<p>Tom: The second one. No not really. It was a very open road that was relatively undefined. There was recognition from the upper management company that they needed new research. There is a consistent need to deliver value to the company but this is very heterogeneous (e.g. actively doing research that may lead to a proper product). First question, I really don&rsquo;t know since my recruitment was very loosely defined. Besides doing rigorous research, you should network and speak to people and don&rsquo;t worry too much about the details.</p>
<p><em>Why was industry right for you and why you didn&rsquo;t consider an academic career?</em></p>
<p>Mike: I came to do a PhD from the industry. As I got older, academia seems a bit better as I don&rsquo;t have to compete with the youngsters. But industry is creating a lot of neat stuff.</p>
<p>Katerina: She wanted to do her PhD to get into industry. She wanted to develop the expertise in eye-tracking and then apply to the industry as there was a gap. If she wanted to do theory etc. she can transfer it into a more applicable ways.</p>
<p>Mohammed: He always knew he wanted to work in industry &ndash; in industry things are always falling apart and putting together without having to think. Probably in the long-term he might come back to academia.</p>
<p>Tom: His original plan was to do his PhD to go into industry, although sort of forgot that during his PhD. But when the job came along he remembered that. The problem of leaving academia was leaving the security. Once he passed his probation at his company, it was probably more secure than at academia where there are 2 yr contracts etc. He has no expectation of coming back. He still supervises PhD students and still has a foothold in academia.</p>
<p>Marian is explaining that the transition from industry to academia is easier sometimes than academia to industry but you need to map yourself to the career.</p>
<p><em>How many of you still publish?</em></p>
<p>Mike: He attempted to publish and hopes to do so as it increases his credential of being an expert. It is difficult to find the time since he works during the week and during the weekend he is occupied with his family.</p>
<p>Katerina: I would like to publish more and don&rsquo;t know it often. Just wrote a paper and presented it in conference. She publishes articles online via her company&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>Mohammed: Lots of his work is extremely sensitive and difficult to publish them. Although he is in contact with his supervisors to see how he can do some joint bidding.</p>
<p>Tom: He has been publishing since he graduated and most of the stuff is to do with edited proceedings.</p>
<p><em>What are the important differences do you see between academia and industry? And what if I come in with an academic mindset would trip me up in industry?</em></p>
<p>Mike: Industry wants a result in a useful timeframe.</p>
<p>Katerina: It is all about the deliverables. When she wrote her first report of 38 pages, her line manager freaked out saying it was like a dissertation &ndash; asked her to write an executive summary &ndash; keep it short with the key point. No in-depth research all the time as in an academia. It sometimes feel as if the work you&rsquo;re doing is not valid.</p>
<p>Mohammed: The problem is with flexibility and pragmatic ... that is managing the context that he needs to deliver what he wants to do (i.e. layers of bureaucracy) ... unlike in academia where it is resource rich.</p>
<p>Tom: We have a reporting regime which is more regularly and fine grained than 6-monthly reports. All the teams are doing high level incremental tasks and there is a high turnover of things that fit into the large reporting scheme of the company. There is always a need to report something for the week.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
