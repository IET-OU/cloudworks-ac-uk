        <p>Its been a long time since I've blogged about the <a href="http://freear.org.uk/content/ou-media-player-project" rel="nofollow">OU Media Player project</a>. So what has been going on?  I thought I'd take a brief look back, then look forward...</p>
<h3>Last spring - 2011</h3>
<p>Last spring and summer we developed an embeddable player based on the <a href="http://flowplayer.org/" rel="nofollow">open-source Flowplayer Flash-based toolkit</a>. Two designers form Learning and Teaching Solutions here at The Open University, David Winter and Peter Devine created to bold and attractive designs or themes.</p>
<p>The 2011 player hit many of the original aims of the project, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li> Developed for a number of contexts, with different requirements - OUVLE, OpenLearn, public sites with OU-Podcast media assets, </li>
<li> Accessible, including to screen reader and keyboard users - we ran two rounds of user-testing (I should explore whether these reports can be published), </li>
<li> Easily embeddable via oEmbed, and delivered in a maintainable way. </li>
</ul>
<p>However, it also fell down on a number of points:</p>
<ul>
<li> The implementation of the designs contained a number of CSS alignment bugs, which proved hard to solve, </li>
<li>The bold, 'big' nature of the themes took some people by surprise. There are some VLE pages which contain a large number of audio players (the design team had not realised this - preparation and communication is key!),  and the design didn't work in this context, </li>
<li> There wasn't full screen functionality, due to a combination of a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8309086/calling-as3-fullscreen-with-javascript" rel="nofollow">a Flash security restriction</a>,  and Flowplayer's implementation, </li>
<li> There remained some bugs on mobile/tablet devices, chiefly Android, </li>
</ul>
<p>The first two points proved decisive, and the player was not launched for the VLE or other sites in summer 2011. I and my colleagues moved on to other projects.</p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>On reflection, there were several lessons to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li> The VLE variant was added to the project after initial requirements gathering, and some of the issues around multiple audio players on VLE pages weren't picked up, </li>
<li> Developing a common player with different variants (VLE, podcast/public, OpenLearn) added to the complexity, </li>
<li> We had not talked to key stakeholders at critical points in the design phase, </li>
</ul>
<p>Happily though this isn't the end of the story...</p>
<h3>Phase 2 - 2012</h3>
<p>In December 2011 we developed a phase 2 deployment plan, which put in more skaffolding:</p>
<ul>
<li> Defined development and consultation phases, </li>
<li> A date for sign-off of the design by key stakeholders, </li>
<li> Better defined and closer collaboration, particularly with LTS, </li>
<li> More testing, </li>
<li> A steering group, </li>
<li> Roll-out to the VLE in June 2012, </li>
<li> Roll-out to other OU sites starting shortly after. </li>
</ul>
<p>We have a challenging timetable given our other commitments, but we are keeping to schedule. Watch this space!</p>
<h3>Technical review and tasks</h3>
<p>We are working through a number of technical development tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. We reviewed our use of Flowplayer, and after consultation and based on a tip from my colleague Guy Carberry, we are moving to Mediaelement.js. This has a number of benefits: </li>
<li>**  It is a HTML5-based solution, so is more future-proof. Flash is not a 'second-class' citizen though, </li>
<li>**  There is a fullscreen solution, including for Flash - yay! </li>
<li>**  It is more accessible than some of the HTML5 media libraries that I've explored, though there are issues, </li>
<li>**  It is modular and very easy to extend, so accessibility problems can be fixed. And it is open-source and actively developed, </li>
<li>**  Better support for mobiles and tablets, </li>
<li>**  It requires either jQuery or Ender. We don't really want a jQuery-based solution, as our VLE is Moodle-based, uses YUI, and research indicates that a   <a title="Search: 'How many users view Yahoo! pages with a full cache'" href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/04/performance-research-part-2/" rel="nofollow">surprisingly high proportion of users may view pages with an empty cache</a>.  Ender is a smaller, modular solution when compared to the monolithic jQuery (Ender support is currently less mature), </li>
<li>**  Also on the performance front, Mediaelement implements a build and minification process, and it is structured with this in mind, </li>
<li>**  The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14g0Qbh5CB8YhQWSQ-0MyBN4aumKbmRYJ2NLO3auC8QI/edit" rel="nofollow">consultation notes are on Google Docs</a>. </li>
<li>2. We are working to so that no variants of the player (VLE, OU-podcast..) require direct database access. For the OU-podcast variant,  we are building on work by LTS colleague Jamie Daniels from last summer, to implement a loosely-coupled feed-based access.  In time, we can publish documentation for the RSS extensions that the player requires. </li>
<li>3. Re-structuring the code base so that it will be easier to support and maintain.  Mediaelement.js will be defined as an 'engine' for the player (Flowplayer will be retained as a legacy engine).  Themes will use an engine, and there will be 'engines' and 'themes directories. </li>
<li>4. Implementation of the new design as a theme. AS we did last summer, we are using sprites to reduce HTTP requests.  We've been quite impressed with the <a href="http://spritegen.website-performance.org/" rel="nofollow">online CSS Sprite Generator</a>.</li>
</ul>
