        <p><strong>Further notes on OLDs MOOC Wk4</strong></p>
<p>Verbatim notes written as I went through the various stages of ignorance and befuddlement, to confusion and 'anger' ending in enlightenment and joy! A not untypical learning curve for me whether learning to drive, bake a cake, or learn new software.&nbsp;<br /><br />It took me several hours over a few days to try and get the terms and groups defined by Grainne Conole from Week 3 into my head - to start again, brushing these aside, makes me feel like someone who has tried to learn the violin in order to play in an orchestra and is now asked to pick up a saxaphone in order to play in a jazz band. Same language - music, but different terminology, different instrumentation, different culture and groupings &hellip; and no doubt a different potential outcome for a different audience &hellip; all ideally decided in the first place by the nature of the problem that I am trying to address. &nbsp;We need a common language for learning design - and then to have credible, easily understood terms that everyone can believe in. <br /><br /><strong>Labels, flags and categories are required, but I want are IMAGES &hellip; of video clips.</strong> <br /><br />I want to see what this entails, experience it for myself and lodge these memories and experience in my mind in a way that my mind can understand. I sometimes feel that I am trying to learn the impossible in an distance, online experience - like trying to learn to tap dance using PowerPoint Slides when all I need and must do is to &lsquo;get out there&rsquo; and physically engage. I am a professional writer. I live by and for words. I see a column of words out of context and need definitions that mean something to me. If I think the wrong word is being used I will say so as it is vital that everything has a common understand of what is meant - I don&rsquo;t think people do. I think we all have very different takes on what they mean or refer to, not least because our experiences will be so very different. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a times like this when I want to say, &lsquo;explain it to me in French&rsquo;.<br /><br />For a list of reasons the PPC video lost me &hellip; out of context, couldn&rsquo;t get my head around it, don&rsquo;t relate to it, don&rsquo;t like the look and feel, and just could not figure out what the speaker meant or was saying because of the bizarre stresses on English words. For a piece of communication it failed to communicate anything other than confusion. <br /><br />None the wiser. <br /><br />A number of screens or windows are offered from &lsquo;Understand authentic practice&rsquo; but I am quite unable to find &lsquo;classroom teaching&rsquo; as an instance so cannot click on it. By inference terms I am still getting my head around from Week 3 courtesy of Grainne Conole and JISC should now be replaced. It is vital that there are commonly used and understood terms throughout. We cannot or should not be expected to master two or more new languages like this. No wonder there is confusion or lack of collaboration. <br /><br /><strong>Last week I was told to use Greek, now I&rsquo;m being told to use Latin. English would do.</strong> <br /><br />Here I guess I could refer to the Google Spreadsheet I created imagining how activities might be split across a 32 hour course on use of DIY Multimedia in Higher Education. Or I could design another one, perhaps building on ASA Level 3 Coaching, or imaging a creative course for D&amp;AD or something in relation to spaced education in medicine.<br /><br />I could see myself working on paper, or with several colleagues on a vast whiteboard, with a mixture of people with experience of the system or with particular curriculum design experience or subject matter expertise. It is a joint effort though.<br /><br /><strong>Unable to Zoom control the screen so viewing and use of the windows is compromised.</strong><br /><br />Changed all text into a scenario I am familiar with so can quickly see how it could be applied. <br /><br />My first go<br /><br />In teaching coaches how to work with athletes with disabilities it is straightforward to imagine a pattern of activities and how this is divided over a period of time given your resources, students other participants and location. Once a programme has been built and carried out this pattern might be shared and copied, with notes on how to adapt or improve it. The pattern may work across sports. A pattern for a particular skill set might be repeated in a single sport, say the &lsquo;transition&rsquo; in swimming between each of the four competitive strokes, so a pattern created for Breaststroke would be applied to Front Crawl, Butterfly and Backstroke. <br /><br />Yes, it has to be based on personal experience as a student and as the educator &hellip; or other participant/contributor. Based on a context, or context and specific to those learning goals. It is then possible to project yourself into variations on this pattern based on a different student group, or learning objectives, as well as resources in relation to the time, space(s) and how assessed or reviewed. <br /><br /><strong>This worked, in fact I&rsquo;d say I started to fly so I then imagined a weekend curriculum for the DIY Multimedia Course.</strong><br /><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.34299647551961243"><br /><br /><br /></strong></p>    </div>
