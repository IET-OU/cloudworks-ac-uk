        <p>Prompted by a tweet and post by @mattlingard, I've set up this cloud.</p>
<p>Matt has set up a <a href="http://twtpoll.com/9f890h" rel="nofollow">quick survey </a>to ask people how using twitter has impacted on how much they blog or not. The results are really interesting. Matt is planning to do a more reflective blog on this, but some questions this raises for me are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If twitter has resulted in a decline in blogging, is this good or bad?</li>
<li>What is the right mix of differnt communicative tools - twitter and blogging have different affordances - one short, quick, community-based, the other more reflective?</li>
<li>In addition to twitter and blogging there are now a plethoral of other social netwokring tools for communication, for sharing information - is this good or bad? Is there a danger of dilution of message if there are too many communcation channels?</li>
</ul>    </div>

<li>Technology adaptation by users and co-evolution of tools/users; mimicking mechanisms for connecting people and things</li>
<li>Dilemma of twitter vs. facebook; facebook to reconnect with old friend/family vs. twitter reflecting your true friend-network </li>
<li>Blurring boundaries of networks for work/learning/leisure</li>

                   <p>Yep - it was a bit of a nudge to u to do so! Dying to see what u are going to say! Seriously I think this is a really really interesting question. I am torn - having different communcative channels is great, but can be confusing/can dilute. You wont be surprise to hear this is something we are really concerned with in terms of cloudworks - we want to ensure it adds value, rather than distracts/dilutes. Not saying we have it right yet, but one value potentially seems to be as one mechanism for flash debates llike this to complement/expand from twitter conversations. Another is as an aggregate record of an event, which can be added to - that is in part what we were trying to do with the alt-c 2009 cloudscape. So.... getting blogging, or in spanish vaya blog! (note use of imperative ;-))</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>very good use of the imperative ;-) I think I've managed to get back to my blog a bit recently, after it almost having gone in to deep freeze when i twittered/facebooked and had only enough time to do quick updates. Terry Wassall just said on twitter "I'm struggling these days to write blog posts. They turn into essays so I run out of time and don't post!" I found this had become the case. I have many blog posts in me that I mentally wrote in bed, or away from a keyboard, and never got chance to write up but didn't get twittered either, and things I want to say that are too big for twitter. Then again I want to more permanently home some of the things I've just thrown onto twitter as though it were delicious. Over the last couple of months I've realised I want to find the time more to write more quantatively, if not qualitatively, again, and am making more of an effort.</p>
<p>I'm not sure though, that this is directly attributable to twitter in either direction. I already had run out of time to write (or, frankly read) blogs, but since I can tweet from my phone on the run/way to&amp;from work, I could twitter instead. The topics probablly overlaped only minimally - if I knew what software I could analyse my blog in I would probably find there were few 140xr equiv postings.</p>
<p>However it would possibly be true to say that since I've been twittering I've read more tweets and less rss of other's blog posts, only going to them if directly linked posts on twitter interest me. I'd be curious to know if others had experienced this. I don't -or only ver rarely- post my own blog posts to be entered on twitter, so I don't encourage that traffic, I've never done that. In fact I've only relatively recently (ok, couple of years, as it were, possibly less) made it so my name appears on my blog, and that was through my twitter feed, which I've since stopped. Although I don't hide my blog or deliberately hide who I am, it's not really either a work blog or one about technology, so advertising it seems unnecessary - friends subscribe and you can link to it from my twitter and facebook profiles if you wanted.</p>
<p>Going back and attempting to blog more is partly a space to reflect, though I currently feel the need to consider a more personal portfolio type space to reflect more openly than I do on my blog - I also contribute very occasionally to a blog a few of us started a couple of years ago to share on our theology course, and I'm aware I should use that more too. Thus although I might have amplified in posts things that have&nbsp; made it to twitter, there is no competition between the two.</p>
<p>So, have I blogged less since I started tweeting? Yes, but not to blame twitter for that.</p>
<p>Have I blogged more/about the same since I started tweeting? Yes, too, because after a gap I've got back into it a bit and possibly either the amount of twitter, or the lack of depth of twitter has helped encourage me to keep it up/get back to blogging.</p>
<p>If we'd done this four five six months ago, I'd probably have said I blog less, and possibly blame it on randomly twittering rubbish instead. But the lack of time isn't caused by or being eaten up by twitter. Now I'm probably hesitantly prepared to say that twitter arrived in my psyche (i had an account for quite a while only using it professionally whilst still facebooking personal statuses) and took over from status-posting in facebook at a point when my blog was running out of time/space/steam. Twitter helped keep me connected through that, and has potentially helped me back to blogging. Or perhaps I'd have come back anyway. Either way, I couldn't rightly feel that I could vote in the poll without skewing the results.</p>
<p>Ooops, there's an essay. Most of my blog posts aren't that long!! Interested for other's views :)</p>

                   <p>This was a debate between josie fraser and Grahame Attwell at F-ALt 09 about this (I'll leave them to summarise as it was a bit inconclusive).</p>
<p>My own view is that technologies are endlessly and variably adapted by their users, thence infuencing developers to accommodate new requirements.&nbsp; Many of the social technologies are technologies of integration mimicking the links between people and things (in a connectivist sense).&nbsp; So for me, Twitter links me out to images, videos, web pages, blog posts - and I link out to those I find, and bookmark those I like from others.&nbsp; So it's not Twitter OR blogs but how these link together and enable me to network with others.</p>
<p>I guess I should blog this;-)</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks for posting this, Grainne.</p>
<p>I agree with most of what Kate had to say; that it's easy to think of ideas for blog posts - or short, pertinent tweets- but actually doing *either* can be an issue (unlike her, I haven't tried tweeting from my phone - anyway, i suspect even if it offered it, doing it from a bicycle isn't quite as easy as on the bus!)</p>
<p>I also missed Josie &amp; Graham's debate, due to my naff map reading skills &amp; thus heading a long way the wrong way in the rain.</p>
<p>But, I have felt that my blog's been seriously abandoned recently. I've got more than a few drafts that really need posting - or deleting!</p>
<p>The dilemma, though, I've had recently is Facebook vs. Twitter.</p>
<p>When I first got onto Facebook, I wasn't that keen - decided to keep it primarily for work related purposes &amp; indeed it was work people that I linked up with. Then increasing numbers of school etc. friends found me - some of whom I'd lost contact with (&amp;, importantly, regretted having lost that contact). I didn't use Facebook that much; meanwhile, I'd discovered and then (albeit about a year later after I got the account) realised Twitter was much better for work related stuff - more people were using it.</p>
<p>So, now my dilemma is - do I remove people I consider purely "work" &amp; not "friend" from facebook - or do I leave them in there, for fear of upsetting them?</p>
<p>I guess, like Frances, I'd really better *blog* about all these ideas!</p>        </div>

                   <p>to return to the original question... my answer would be nope (though no evidence to support it as such...), because blogging supports depth and reflection, while micro-blogging&nbsp; is great for distributing news (or quick reflections), mundane thoughts and mobilizing friends, networks and communities...</p>
<p>but there's something to be said about 'compartmentalising' networks and finding the time to participate in each one's own networks in meaningful (as well as mundane) ways...writing, posting news and info in a social way is another thing too...I guess it's about the ways in which one manages networks, time and activities, like Emma mentioned ;-) But I feel that this multitasking can be confusing too...&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Really interesting debate! Like others many times I write a blog post in my head and then never post it. I also find that although I hate lots abot facebook I am finding it incresingly useful as a way of keeping connected with distant friends/relative etc. Having twitter on my iphone has been transformative. I agree with you Frances its about the connections between people that's important and we each have our own preferred mix, the technologies themselves in some ways can eb and flow.&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Emma, that was a diversion I didn't think needed at the time, but I'm somewhat similar. I have friends in FB, many of whom are Bb colleagues around the world who I would still call friends. Many of these guys went to twitter professionally, so I went too, then when you could send tweets to fb most of them stopped using fb. I rarely go into fb now, and always feel i've missed out on updates from other friends who only use fb when I do - however i've also been inundated with old school acquaintances and extended family there. As my 'real' friends more and more gathere/d on twitter, it was just easier than fighting through the rubbish on fb. Now i find that i twitter spam followers I pick up who think i'm going to continue posting vaguely sensible stuff after events, who realise i tweet all sorts of irrelevancy and generally soon go away again :)</p>
<p>For a while I wondered about the old almost easy divide between twitter and fb and professional and home, but since i have 3 lives anyway they're all a bit blurred, and I gave up!</p>
<p>I'm sure if Frances persuades Josie or Graham to put their more authorative stamp on this discussion it will be much more useful to Matt than my ramblings :)</p>        </div>

                   <p>For me personally, I think there have been a few competing effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are things that I want to share that I may previously have written a blog post about, but in fact 140 chars is enough to share them with the people I want to, so I tweet them instead. </li>
<li>Because of the low barrier to entry, Twitter has got me back over the inertia barrier with publishing things which I think has transferred to me being more likely to blog. </li>
<li>I feel that I will probably hear about anything timely through twitter so don't check my RSS feeds so often. I suspect people are also blogging less than they used to generally, so that may also be a contributing factor. It feels like there is less of a 'blogosphere' than there used to be. I'm not quite sure what the impact of this is, but there probably is one!</li>

                   <p>I don't believe that Twitter is killing blogging. Those who want to blog will continue to blog regardless of the short messages they can send via Twitter. Personally, if anything, my blogging volume has actually increased since I started Tweeting. There may not be a strong correlation between the two, but I incorporate my Twitter stream into my blog, and I also promote my blog posts&nbsp;through Twitter. The two could exist independently of each other, but they also have a nice synergy.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Interesting how debates emerge! I largely agree with Frances. Personally I have never got on well with Feedreaders and find I read more blogs these days as a result fo following links in Twitter. Equally I know many people who would never have started a blog but contribute regularly through Twitter (and I think twitter is particularly helpful for those who are not writing in their first language).</p>
<p>However, I am not convinced that Twitter is just another kind of blog. As the great AKA Specials once said "Equal but different" :)</p>
<p>And the main point I was trying to make at the F-alt debate is that blogs can do things Twitter cannot - namely support reflective learning over time. I am not saying Twitter discourses are not per se reflective but it is difficult to develop a reflective post in 140 characters.</p>
<p>And for me, the ability for reflection is the great point about blogging.</p>

                   <p>Late contribution from&nbsp;a non-blogger who has been tweeting a bit in the last few months.</p>
<p>Another dimension to this debate is that of the blog follower. I read more blogs since I've been on Twitter because of the links (e.g. Steve Wheeler) but I also still read blogs independently of Twitter. There are lots of people out there who don't use Twitter at all but still follow blogs. Wonder if they feel there's been a dip in output.</p>
<p>Funnily enough about to start a couple of blogs in the work context because it seems the best way to get particular messages across.&nbsp;&nbsp;Twitter woudn't work at all in this context.</p>
<p>Facebook - barely use it but might take a look at Facebook Lite.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Everything comes down to motive, audience and time. I was motivated to Blog through an interest in ePortfolios. I found that the &lsquo;process&rsquo; of Blogging helped me to sort out my thinking, I could Blog sense out of things with little regard for the poor reader that had to read what I offered and &lsquo;published&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I had a motive to Blog, but then became a little worried that I did not have an audience. The questioning began; why publish something if no one is going to read it, it would be a waste of time and effort &ndash; I rationalised that it was for me; that if someone read it, if it did move thinking forward in some way, so much the better.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Like others in the discussion, I followed the crowd into Twitter and do find it really useful for finding out &lsquo;what is going on&rsquo; and finding useful links. I tend not to use it much for &lsquo;chat&rsquo; except if I am following, from a distance, a conference.&nbsp; Twitter is addictive; I spend a lot of time monitoring it hoping to glean that useful gem of information or that contact that will either change my life, or will enable me to move something forward and split the information atom. I now spend less time Blogging but always have a Blog Post in my head along with the intention to actually find the time to post it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From my Lurking I believe that fewer people are Blogging now and that people are less and less prepared to contribute to comment on a Post or contribute to a Blog discussion (as here).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Back to the question, yes Blogging is in decline; bad or good? &ndash; just evolution while we wait for the application that will &lsquo;automatically&rsquo; organise; structure; indexes and present everything that an individual &lsquo;writes&rsquo;. The application that helps every individual to &lsquo;get out&rsquo; the &lsquo;book&rsquo; that we all have in us! &ndash; Of course the Beta version will link together all of the individual books! &nbsp;Best have breakfast + check Twitter</p>        </div>

                   <p>I agree Rose, the following aspect of blogging is really important. I think twitter has definitely resulted in an increase in people reading blogs in some respects because of the ease of following a link. I think we under estimate some of the conceptual challenges of new technologies. Alot of people still find the concepts of RSS feeds challenging and I know alot of people I showed Twitter to at first just didnt get it. Also we know that we web 2.0 technologies there is an exponential drop from Producer, commenter, to reader. For example the number of people who put up images on flckr or videos on youtube is far higher than those who use them.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Motivation and addiction - two key words in this debate John! And I also agree that we have to accept there is a natural progression/evolution of these things. We have so many competing technologies, - routes for communication, sources of information that there has to be a direct perceived benefit to us for us to bother with something. That's of course why so many well meaning repositories of good practice, learning object repositories failed. Why wont anyone bother to contribute? What's in it for them?</p>        </div>

                   <p>There're also 'long tail', network effects components that I would add to your points Grainne. A lot of top bloggers have done a lot of work with search engines' metrics, and success escalates when comments/posts are mentioned in mainstream media too. Similar trends with twitter too. It's use increased massively after the publicity it got from its use political campaigners and activists alike as well as celebs...</p>        </div>

                   <p>A brief comment:</p>
<p>Twitter currently helps me discoverer blog posts of interest - surely both have their roles!</p>
<p>Further the whole point of social software is that is use evolves socially.&nbsp; The technologies have particular affordances that lend themselves better to different types of interaction but I "believe" (ironically as a systems engineer) that it the social development of this use that dominates the technical factors in determining which become dominant in terms of usage.<br /> <br /> As seen in previous posts we use the tools that enable us to keep in contact with our existing social networks or discover or construct new networks.</p>
<p>Now different people use the same tools for different and multiple purposes.&nbsp; This can generate levels of "noise" that some find intolerable.&nbsp; In attempts to&nbsp;mange the noise levels they may constrain their networks or shift to alternative tools.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this situation will converge to the dominant use of a single tool or even small set of tools at any point in the near future.&nbsp; Twitter will have&nbsp;a finite life time.</p>
<p>I find the desire of humans to communicate and our inventiveness in ways of doing it over the millennia fascinating.&nbsp; Web 2.0 is a tiny blip in that.&nbsp; How much better a society we construct&nbsp;if we do effectively communicate.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Great points Martyn! Totally agree - we co-evolve with the tools and we each have our own personal mix. Interesting point about noise. I have just de-coupled my twitter and facebook feeds because a certain someone said that I was bombarding facebook with my boring work stuff. Then some other people in facebook said don't decouple!&nbsp; Also I know some people get really annoyed when there are lots of tweets around a conference. Whereas I quite like it. And I really can't see why people have private twitter spaces - defeats the point!&nbsp; There is no perfect solution and as you say I think people find there own mix.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Some interesting point here.&nbsp; I agree with Martin, and it's not just 'social' software whose functionality and use evolve side by side in a dance between users and developers.&nbsp; Even as we scroll down the comments, I bet that Juliette is thinking about how to reaarnage this page (and maybe reading my comment;) ).</p>
<p>I came to Matt Lingard's poll via Twitter, then stumbled on this Cloudworks space, and have followed up my reflections in a blog posthttp://francesbell.com/2009/09/12/learning-from-alt-c-2009-technology-as-co-digital-rather-than-post-digital/ that links to Dave White's blog post that I also found via Twitter.&nbsp; And why did I read his post - because I know him IRL and online and am interested in what he says.&nbsp; And so rolls on the overlapping networks of people and things that emerge and decay through our interaction or lack of it.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Great discussion, and a first useful intro to Cloudworks for me. I'm off for a week's walking with the family so will just&nbsp;add a link to a post on this for now - <a href="http://www.terrywassall.co.uk/terry/2009/09/12/is-twitter-killing-the-blog-no/" rel="nofollow">is twitter killing the blog? No</a>.</p>
<p>The gist: for me twitter is changing the way I am thinking about blogging and potentialy I see the 2 activities mutually beneficial and enhancing with implications for the relevance and interest of more focussed blog posts. The either/or terms of the original debate are incorrect.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I think Matt was on to something with the poll. Although we're probably doing more reading and writing online, something's gotta give; surely we can't keep doing more of one thing without doing less of another?</p>
<p>Perhaps the wording should have been 'is <strong>microblogging killing blogs as a conversational medium'?</strong><br /><br />Many have drawn attention to blogging's conversational nature (e.g. <a href="http://www.blogninja.com/hicss05.blogconv.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marlow 2004</a>; <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cameron/cv/pubs/04-01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Herring et al. 2005</a>). However, will blogging become more of a broadcasting medium (which for many bloggers it already is) and less about discussion as conversation moves on to Twitter, Amplify etc.?</p>

                   <p>Tony these are great points: There're interesting dimensions about the blurring of boundaries in blogging / twitting with regards to searching for info or people/finding/discovering/reading/networking and also between broadcasting/conversation as well as socialization/self-representation. I guess it would be interesting to see whether the modes of participation in either twitter or in blogging (one's own or following others) and the nature of 'talk' /conversation is conditioned by different sets of 'inscribed' interpretations of sites and expected or 'serendipitous' purposes / motivations for using such sites...</p>        </div>

<p>Hi Giota, thanks for the comments and yes the whole question of how users interpret the technologies they use - often in very different ways to the 'preferred' uses the designers intended - is fascinating. You've probably read these articles on this question but colleagues who haven't might find them interesting:&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>Lots of interesting observations here which I have spent some i.e. probably too much&nbsp; time reading.I suspect Twitter is at the peak of the Hype Cycle now and its use will drop off shortly. Blogging has dropped and may drop some more before stabilising. Done properly blogging is a lot of work!</p>
<p>I write a blog - average about one post per month.&nbsp; Posts are all work-related and analytic or reflective. They take two to three hours to write - including checking facts, finding suitable images etc. For me it is a form of publishing. I get a few comments.</p>
<p>I don't use Twitter that much except around conferences or to publicise things. Looking at the 20 most recent incomimg tweets - most are news/information, the rest are 'what am I doing' and comments. So it's fulfilling a very different role from my blog. More like a listserv in many ways.</p>

                   <p>Hi Niall I agree with you in part about the hype cycle - tools come and go in terms of fashion. At the end of the day it all&nbsp; boils down to us wanted channels to communicate via and mechanisms to get information. ICT remains its just the tools for doing it that change!</p>        </div>

                   <p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Hi,</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">A few posts have commented on Twitter as being at the peak of its hype curve.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">I'm afraid I disagree. What's interesting about Twitter is that it sits at the intersection of mobile technology, social networking and micro-content - all developments that look set to continue in the short to medium term (even longer?). Ok, arguably other services and environments do this too and do it better (e.g. Facebook) but there's space for more than one and Twitter still does it pretty well.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">I also think users tend to stick to the tool they came across first. I still use Delicious for social bookmarking although I know it's not the best and I think that both Friendfeed and Yammer are preferable to Twitter. But I'm a Twitter user because that's the tool I came to first, that's where my network is and that's the interface - web, iPhone apps, Mac and PC clients - I'm most familiar with. It's going to cost me time and, perhaps money to switch to something different.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Twitter may or may not make it to its, say, 5th birthday but users won't abandon it because it's no longer the 'in' thing but, rather, because something else has come along that their colleagues, contacts and friends are using that does Twitter-like things much, much better.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">My hunch is that the majority of twitterers use it not because of the hype - a slightly patronising suggestion that constructs technology users as unthinkingly in thrall to the latest fad&nbsp; -&nbsp; but because its ease of use and versatility (e.g. for serendipitous networking, conference/lecture backchannels, banter, crowdsourcing, resource sharing, inc. from network to network via RTs etc.) has created a user base that may be harder to dislodge than we think.</p>

                   <p>Interesting point abut sticking to the tool you first come across, I think there is some truth in that. I also agree about the intersection point. We are seeing some interesting patterns here in cloudworks in terms of it acting as some sort of conduit between twitter and individual blogs. At the core is that people will use tools IF they have some value for that individual. We are all too busy to participate in things that dont add value or aren't interesting.</p>        </div>

<p>I'm trialling use of Twitter for HE learning and teaching activities and so far the pilot has been characterised by very low levels of student enthusiasm - see &nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.kingston.ac.uk/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Promoting student engagement with Twitter</a>. This may change but it's clear that the students - media and cultural studies and Eng. Lit and Popular culture &nbsp;- aren't perceiving the relevance of the activities and technology to their learning in the same way as their tutors do.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Tony I had a similar experience on the spanish course I have just completed as a student. I thought twitter would be a great way for us to pracatice our reading and writing. But it didnt take off, only a few students tried and even then they didnt really seem to get the concept. I think twitter is quite a subtle concept and it takes a while for folk to make sense of it. Also of course requires your peers to also be in the twitter network which is a big ask.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi&nbsp;Gr&aacute;inne, yes bigness of the ask slowly dawning. We produced some instructions on using Twitter, including following both module account and &nbsp;peers' accounts. Hopefully we'll have a network going as the semester goes on but first few weeks might be Twitter as broadcast tool. I wonder if they'll get the subtlely eventually ...?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Yes not sure, also there is the issue that people have different personal likes and dislikes which adds to the complications! Some people love blogging others hate it. Would be interested to hear what my collegue Martin Weller has to say on this as he has been using twitter with his students I think... Will set up a cloud n twitter with students to see if we can get some discussion and maybe even some answers!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi&nbsp;Gr&aacute;inne - thanks for this. Sounds like a great idea to create a cloud on Twitter and students. It would be interesting to get some insights into how Twitter is working in u/g and p/g education. Sian Bayne and Jen Ross doing some interesting work on their MSc in e-Learning at Edinburgh.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Just to come in late to this, I don't know if Twitter is <em>killing</em> blogging (it looks to me as if it's used in a supplementary way, rather than as a replacement), but it could be killing RSS:</p>

I am definitely blogging less, but still doing so when I want to write a more reflective piece on something. Goodness knows what impact google wave will have on all of this!!!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Of course, I tweeted you about this at the time, Grainne ;-)</p>
<p>I blog for hobby rather than work purposes, but I do take it very seriously and it's noticeable that other bloggers in the same sphere are increasingly using Twitter as a means of both, (a) flagging new content on their blogs, but also, (b) passing on little titbits of news that wouldn't be worth a full blog post.</p>        </div>
