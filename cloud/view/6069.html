<p>Disabled learners face barriers to entry all the way through their educational careers.

			<h2>Interview with the author</h2>
<p><em>The research paper you are presenting is titled &lsquo;&lsquo;You either went to university or you worked in Sainsbury&rsquo;s&rsquo; - disabled learners and entry to higher education&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m interested in learning why you chose to pursue this piece of research: Why these issues in particular?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>This research project was funded by a partnership within the UK government Aimhigher initiative. The partnership had recognised disabled learners as a specific target group for increasing entry to HE and had set up a steering group from across the sector. One of the areas we were keen to focus on was providing a more robust evidence base for this work. I had previously identified that many studies within the HE and disability field neglect to compare the experiences of disabled learners with their non-disabled peers. Additionally, we knew from other work that transition from FE into HE is a particularly difficult time for disabled learners. So we were keen to incorporate these 2 aspects into the study.</p>
<p><em>What are the key findings of your research? Were there any findings your found particularly surprising? </em></p>
<p>Key findings were that disabled learners report experiencing a number of significant barriers in their educational journeys which are simply not present in the accounts of their non-disabled peers. By chance one of the non-disabled interviewees was a care leaver and she reported very similar barriers to the disabled learners. We also identified a number of enablers which had a significant effect on their educational experiences. Overall, participants reported the transition from college to university as the most significant with the change in teaching styles being a particular barrier. At the time of the study the respondents did not see financial constraints as a major factor holding them back from entering HE.</p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s a really interesting set of findings, thanks. OK, final question: Where do you see this research and yourself heading in the future? Are there particular themes or strands of the work that you particularly want to follow up on?</em></p>
<p>Apart from getting the work published there are no other plans to follow it up at the moment as the funding for Aimhigher has ended. I produced a report for the regional group which was circulated across various stakeholders such as the local authority and the HE providers in the area. However, I am currently undertaking some further research within the institution I am currently based in on the student experience of inclusion. As with this research I am comparing the experiences of disabled learners with their non-disabled peers but also working with students as co-researchers.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
