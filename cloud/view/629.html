<strong>Views from learning and teaching in HE  – some reflections from those with particular expertise in managing and evaluating strategies</strong> <strong>for the enhancement of learning and teaching in HE</strong><br />
<br />
1.    Some questions – apply theoretical perspective to very concrete applications<br />
2.    Teaching as design and changing nature of HE context<br />
3.    Personal change strategies and identities – how and why people might change their practices<br />
<br />
Comment by Peter Goodyear – we need an ethnographic awareness of teachers’ context, its about social context and current social practices and where innovations are introduced and understand how they impact on practice. Constellations, orders of meaning, identity, power relationships
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Questions – developing an anthropological lens<br />
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>How do the new practices relate to current social practices?</li>
	<li>What practices are we expecting people to engage in and how do they relate?</li>
	<li>What codes of signification are evoked by what is being offered?</li>
	<li>What discourse are we using and what are teachers using?</li>
	<li>Power relations – what does it do for teacher autonomy, professionalism etc?</li>
	<li>What are teachers tacit theories?</li>
	<li>Can you leave room for ‘domestification’ – shaping to current practice, domesticating a new technology?</li>
	<li>Who are the users and where are the cultural boundaries?</li>
	<li>Where is the profitability for users and more importantly how can you show them the benefits?</li>
	<li>What is a reasonable vision for the tools we are developing in terms of scaling up – do you want everyone to use it?</li>
	<li>What are our theories for change?</li>
	<li>Discourses of the field give a number of metaphors</li>
	<li>Gift metaphor – offering – need and want</li>
	<li>Marketing metaphor – the product</li>
	<li>Requiring metaphor, co-creating – this is our tool, driver of compliance and sharing</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
Impetus for a more purposive approach to the construction of learning moments, its time has come. Chronic factors are how to create interesting, challenging learning environment for learners, this has been a problem for a long time, coupled with a policy drive and transparency/accountability. <br />
<br />
<strong>Three axes of consideration thinking about teaching and teachers as designers</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>1st axes – policy and professional context. In the UK there is a performative impetrative in HE, foregrounding of it as a set of public practices, teachers are having to talk about what they do and why they do it, students are having to pay for HE process, governments are questioning how much money should be distributed to HE. There is a transparency and accountability thrust. The panoptic – being watched, fears of deskilling, being watched etc – i.e. there are negative imperatives about this as well in terms of teacher perspective.</li>
	<li>2nd axes – the basis on which colleagues in HE might be prepared to change. Drawn from empirical data from evaluation studies around various EU projects. Teachers have embedded theories about change and on what basis they would change. What kind of zeitgeist or frame of mind do teachers need to be in to take this change on board?</li>
	<li>3rd axes – engagement strategies. On what basis would teachers be prepared to take these new opportunities on board. Palette EU project http://palette.ercim.org/ – set of different CoP applying a participatory design methodology (PDM). People found it hard to understand what PDM was, even though they signed up to the rhetoric. Continuum – developers, teachers and learners (and other boundary brokers between these). Notion was that they would be co-constructors of design solutions. At the other end of the spectrum was the one-dimensional notion of a client and developer, little discourse between them. PDM is a really powerful and important approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Personal change theories</strong><br />
This is reflected in the personal change theories Saunders et al have developed. First is a practice-based exemplar. People catch an interesting idea/embodiment and will begin to apply this. The problem is that is a weak theory of change as we don’t know who will take this up and when. There is no theory of engagement. More about them catching it by osmosis. Notion of a demonstrator, a pilot etc. Second is idea of resource dependency. Is strongest way to enact change is attached funding to it. Invite bids against a change programme. Quite a good theory. Third one is the idea of rhetorical support. Need a strong vision statement at a senior level to make it happen. Fourth one, which is one of strongest theories of change. Professional imperative. Looking for interesting and high quality teaching solutions for your learners, which is core to what professional teaching practice should be about. Fifth – to do with technological determinism. Three possible theories. 1. Global marketing – an institution has to engage with new technologies from a competitive perspective and also using the technologies to market their course as well. 2. Students expect the new technologies to be used. Push from student expectation. 3. Affordances of the technologies – what the technologies actually offer. Change in embedded in the technologies. The environment is transformed by them. <br />
