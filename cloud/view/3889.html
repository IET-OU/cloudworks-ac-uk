        <p>Obesity and overweight have increased significantly since the mid 1980&rsquo;s in children in England, however recent data suggests a slowing of the trend. Obesity and overweight are now recognised as public health issues however their classification, treatment and prevention are still under considerable debate. A decline in physical activity levels and an increase in sedentary behaviours have been implicated as one of the determinants for the rise of obesity and overweight in recent times, however research has revealed that these behaviours are partly influenced by the obesogenic environment in which we live.</p>
<p>Community based physical activity interventions may be effective in preventing or treating overweight and obesity in children. Chances4change is a portfolio of 62 community based projects located in the South East funded by the Big Lottery Fund Well-being programme. Individual projects within chances4change address physical activity levels in children. Evaluation of these projects is vital to display their importance and effectiveness. However, at this stage little or no evaluation of physical activity behaviours has been conducted amongst the chances 4change projects due to various difficulties.&nbsp; Therefore I have the role of designing and developing a toolkit for use with these projects to investigate the effectiveness of community based physical activity interventions.</p>
<p>This presentation will discuss the key insights and questions I have found through my literature review so far. I will also discuss any difficulties I may come across when evaluating physical activity in children within the chances4change projects. This will form my rationale for where my research will continue.</p>    </div>

    
<h2 id="extra-content">Extra content</h2>

			<a name="content-635"></a>
			<p>He has just started his PhD in January and he is a bit nervous today &ndash; his background is in sport science and that is where he got involved into obesity. His work is mostly on the evaluation</p>
<p>His project is co-funded by chances4change (Lottery Board) (<a href="http://www.wellbeingsoutheast.co.uk/chances4change/" rel="nofollow">www.wellbeingsoutheast.co.uk/chances4change/</a> &nbsp;):</p>
<ul>
<li>It is funded by national lottery located in the south east</li>
<li>It addresses health inequalities</li>
</ul>
<p>Objectives for Physical activity</p>
<ul>
<li>By November 2011, that 42114 individuals form excluded groups will have taken part in activities </li>
<li>From evaluation point:   
<ul>
<li>Hope 65% would have increased their levels of activity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Diverse range of projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The physical activity projects   
<ul>
<li>Focused on sport by play such as dance class</li>
<li>Family engagement with the projects like drop in and play some sports</li>
<li>There is varying attendance which makes it difficult to evalue</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>HE went to see the Detached (?) play workers as part of an observation</p>
<p>He noted that there were mainly primary school-aged children with two play workers present in the deprived neighbourhoods in Royal Tunbridge Wells. It is a drop-in session. All the equipment is provided by the funders such as badminton nets and rackets. Children were quite spontaneous and then changed activity quickly (like only play badminton in just a minute and then change to football). He spoke to the people and they said they found it really difficult to evaluate the project.</p>
<p>Key Challenges for evaluation</p>
<ul>
<li>Will levels of physical activity in children increase because of the projects?</li>
<li>Can we measure a child&rsquo;s change in motivation for taking part in physical activity?</li>
<li>Will change in fitness take place because of the influence of the projects and how do we measure a change in fitness? For example is there baseline data available such as BMI?</li>
<li>How to do the evaluations such as using questionnaires etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is obesity?</p>
<p>He says it is a controversial topic. There is considerable debate on its classification and even the treatment and prevention in terms of whether we use diet, exercise, individual or environment. WHO classified it as a disease in 1985, but Gard and Wright (2005) that it is not a disease in itself but a risk factor for other diseases.</p>
<p>Why a problem in children? It has increased by 30% from the mid 1980s. This picture is quite complex, as it is rather disproportionate in the social gradient &ndash; higher in the lower quartile (?). Further there are differences between, black, minority and ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Obesity in children is associated with a clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and associated with an increase in Type 2 diabetes. There is also negative self image and low self-esteem. The cost of obesity is nearly &pound;7 billion in 2002 (direct and indirect costs).</p>
<p>There have been significant increases in obesity and overweight children (he is showing some graphs now &ndash; which shows a very sharp increase!) from the mid 80s.</p>
<p>He is showing another graph of obesity by boys and girls from 1994 to 2008. It increased from 1994 to 2006 and then decreased (?)... he is wondering if this is from policy changes</p>
<p>Overweight does not have such a sharp trend increase but he is wondering why the data differs between obese and overweight.</p>
<p>There is also lacking historical data on the physical activity. Studies
[removed][removed]
sho [removed][removed] w that a large percentage of obese and overweight children now take part in 4h/day of sedentary activity, they&rsquo;re also not walking to schools as they&rsquo;re now being driven and further they&rsquo;re watching more tv.</p>
<p>He is showing a very complicated conceptual-map diagram by McPherson and Brown (2007) which shows the number of influences on obesity in which energy is at the centre.</p>
<p>The perception of the parents&rsquo; idea of how safe a neighbourhood is as well as the road safety i.e. speed limits, will prevent children from going out to play. He is asking whether there are green parks and spaces available for children to go out and play and are they safe. Can the children walk single file to</p>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep up with his literature review by focusing on the wider determinants and relationships associated with physical activity in children.</li>
<li>See what tools are currently being used</li>
<li>Visit other Chances4change projects</li>
<li>Identify any ethical issues</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Struck that the Chances4change is focused on the health inequalities, wondering if these activities would change health inequalities?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I think I need to look at whether they&rsquo;re looking at risk groups or not, since some of the projects are working in deprived neighbourhood. We need to look at the whole social gradient not just at the at risk groups.</p>
<p><em>My question is a political one. IS the Chances4change going to be affected by the change in government?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;Someone called Jo is taken over answering the question: It is just funded for 4 yrs come to an end in 2011 &ndash; there&rsquo;ll be a political impact on where there is going to be greater need.</p>
<p><em>One person is saying that he is stepping into a huge debate in determining the indicators for knowing if the policies worked etc and if he needed some help in understanding outcomes of projects that she&rsquo;ll be willing to help.</em></p>
<p><em>Is BMI the only indicator you&rsquo;ll only be using?</em></p>
<p>BMI is usually contested anyway and there is no base data &ndash; I was just using that as an example. It might be more children&rsquo;s attitudes towards physical activity</p>			<div class="posted-by">
