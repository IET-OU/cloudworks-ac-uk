        <p>This is an extract from a call for urgent action on <a title="part two" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8528" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the politics of education</a>. &nbsp;It says that it's shock that stokes the energy needed to reclaim curriculum.&nbsp; Shock can live dangerously enough to step outside the shallow and narrow manipulation of opinion.&nbsp; It's small-mindedness that puts the future of education at greatest risk. &nbsp;And its big thinking that will bang on the doors of show-biz politicians.</p>
<p>The starting point is that the UK electorate mistrusts politicians - some hold them in contempt.&nbsp; Politicians may not deserve this; but surveys vary only on the extent to which they show it. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s easy enough to find politicos doing nothing more impressive than angling for power. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;d be surprised if you&rsquo;ve not also noticed some trying to get something worthwhile done. &nbsp;And then we have the razzle-dazzle-&lsquo;em performers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe we should be thinking of politicos in three groups: politicians, policy makers and performers?:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electioneering politicians</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serious policy makers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show-biz performers.</p>
<p>But is every politico only one these?&nbsp; Surely they move there-and-back across a range of standpoints?&nbsp; That movement would make each position an episode in a story, rather than a category on a list. &nbsp;Mind you, some politicos don&rsquo;t move their standpoints very much.</p>
<p>Much of politics deserves to be dismissed.&nbsp; But the serious stuff is where policy makers genuinely try to do something worthwhile with education. &nbsp;And they deserve respect. &nbsp;They also deserve to be interrogated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take, for example, policies to &lsquo;raise aspiration&rsquo;. &nbsp;And who could be against that?&nbsp; But, before the cheering starts, let's ask the questions. &nbsp;Are we rooting for aspirations to be a good out-of-work dad?&nbsp; &nbsp;Do we favour aspirations to quit work and end that stress?&nbsp; Suppose it were an aspiration to oppose the economic growth that damages the planet and ruins the neighbourhood? &nbsp;And, even if any of these get a political cheer, who would make sure that the neglected poor are in on this aspiration thing? &nbsp;A politican can win applause for a claim to &lsquo;justice available to all&rsquo;. &nbsp;But there&rsquo;s enough argy-bargy among the sources cited here to show that &lsquo;justice&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean what you think it means.&nbsp; Neither does &lsquo;available&lsquo;.&nbsp; Nor does &lsquo;all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Policy for aspiration is about people&rsquo;s chances in life - far too important to be left to politics, and certainly not to show-bizz. &nbsp;It's not a lot of laughs, not in Sunderland, anyway. &nbsp;So, if anything can help Alice in Sunderland it will be policy&nbsp;interrogation&nbsp;- acting in whose interests? - heeding which voices? - driven by what stakeholders?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<em>Prospect Magazine</em>&nbsp;monograph,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/free-download-poverty-in-the-uk/" rel="nofollow">Poverty in the UK</a>, makes a good start on policy.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t know how its seventy pages could have packed in more disagreement about what it should be.&nbsp; Never a dull moment.</p>
<p>And, of course, things changed before&nbsp;<em>Prospect&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;ink had dried.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s out-of-date on bishops, popes and action in the name of religion.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t caught up with what&rsquo;s happening on wages, debt, predators, and economic myths. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s behind the curve on the philosophy of &lsquo;what's fact?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what's knowledge?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;what's valuable?&rsquo;. &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s longer on opinion than on evidence.</p>
<p>But it bumps into all the influences on Alice&rsquo;s life chances.&nbsp; And it surprised and provoked me into trying to get the argument for progressive education into something like a narrative form.&nbsp; A narrative needs a starting point leading to a turning point.&nbsp; Does this?</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; fast-growing technologies mean that unfettered growth is damaging the planet &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; those technologies are also strengthening commerce and weakening government  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; and they&rsquo;re bringing both help and harm to people&rsquo;s personal and social well-being</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; so people can think for themselves about what they believe, value and expect &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the thinking is located in communities that become strangers to each other &nbsp;</p>
<p>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which means that each community makes a different demand on education</p>
<p>... &nbsp; &nbsp;no resolution of this is inevitable it persists with consent and withdrawn consent changes everything&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a narrative if it sets out one thing leading to another. &nbsp;It's like a journey, moving on from the starting point and coming across the turning points. &nbsp;A turning point often surprises and sometimes shocks. &nbsp;And either can lead to unanticipated change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are surprises coming to educational professionals - especially if they are so convinced of their righteousness that they've waited for politicians to ride to their rescue. &nbsp;But they've been&nbsp;stood up, so should they withdraw consent? &nbsp;The planet has enough examples of withdrawn consent for people to wonder whether the days of national politics are numbered. &nbsp;Some of the people are brits. &nbsp;And some of those are students</p>
<p>Could it be a turning point for 'provoking the imagination and realising new possibilities'? &nbsp;And how crazy is it to wonder that, if educationist can't rely on national government, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea to look around for what might be more reliable?</p>
<p>This blog&rsquo;s evidence show that a national government stability depends on inclusive and responsive institutions.&nbsp; It documents policy which excludes open institutions. &nbsp;It quotes&nbsp;global commerce's&nbsp;unresponsive scripts for education. &nbsp;There are, of course, denials; but the evidence is that commerce is moving in on education and policy is not obstructing it.</p>
<p>And so the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) is sticking its neck out. &nbsp;It wants national governments to back off. &nbsp;National governments are too big to grasp locally variable experience, and too small to protect that experience from globally-generated damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSA looks instead to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal" rel="nofollow">The Power of Cities</a>&nbsp; (journal #3).&nbsp; For a start, it requires us to rise above the show-biz clowns in charge of some of our cities.&nbsp; The more important reality is that around half the world&rsquo;s population is living in metropolitan areas.&nbsp; Sunderland is among them.&nbsp; And the numbers are increasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cities people need to learn to live with all kinds of others. &nbsp;They are close enough to the action for people to know what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;And cities are big enough for them to find more than one way of dealing with things. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why RSA-chief Matthew Taylor (p.5) recognises cities as a promising new setting for designing education policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are significant advantages. &nbsp;A city can develop a network of local stakeholder organisations, reaching to all its neighbourhoods, outlying villages and other settlements. &nbsp;Few locations are entirely out of urban reach. &nbsp;Those that are choose to be.</p>
<p>Political scientists (pp.20ff) find four upsides. &nbsp;Cities have: (1) a wide-enough range of sources to draw upon; (2) a great-enough range of ideas to engage with; (3) a willingness to let go of what no longer works; and (4) an ability to re-integrate the insights that large-scale clumsiness has fragmented. &nbsp;They&nbsp;see cities as thriving on that scope and complexity rather than relying on the bogus persuasiveness of the narrow and shallow.</p>
<p>There are exceptions but, world-wide, cities are gathering approving coverage. &nbsp;The records show that they can act quickly on dealing with the consequences of global warming. &nbsp;They are well placed to undermine trafficking in flesh and drugs.&nbsp; They are moving into locally-relevant crime-control measures, traffic-management schemes and health-and-safety programmes. &nbsp;And no policy needs this combination of local responsiveness and wide-ranging scope than a policy for education.</p>
<p>And cities do not need to be dependent on commercial and government funding; indeed, they really need to be looking elsewhere.&nbsp; Economists (pp.10ff) have tracked city-based capacity for gaining alternative funding with fewer strings attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also business-world voices (pp.32ff) that can see how such trends are usefully getting organised independently of commerce and state.&nbsp; They are seen to be fostering change that is owned by communities and is developed on a human scale. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Metropolitan smarts seem to hold out a hope of dumping national politicking and outflanking global power. &nbsp;But Matthew Taylor advises the hopeful not to hold their breath: it&rsquo;s going to take time. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s right: there are logistical issues for anchoring civil society to metropolitan areas; market players try to eliminate competition not encourage it; and transatlantic trade agreements already protect them. &nbsp;Matthew Taylor is talking about policy, and policy takes time to be realised. &nbsp;It will need persistent stakeholder action to neutralise shareholder guile.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a long haul. &nbsp;It won&rsquo;t be completed in a parliament - I doubt in my lifetime.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m betting it will happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a narrative that is relatively easy to talk about.&nbsp; And a backstory that is not. &nbsp;Education needs the bigger story...</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; civil society is bigger than the big society  because it gets organised for coordinated action</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stakeholder&rsquo;s interests are wider than shareholder&rsquo;s  because they work with the people whose lives are affected</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; citizen voice is bigger that consumer demand  because it knows how a local past, present and future belongs to local people</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conversation is bigger than commissioned consultancy  because it voices both expertise and experience&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning for action is bigger than winning an argument  because it understands the narrative in order to change it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the backstory. &nbsp;It makes the promise possible. &nbsp;The evidence is that without informed resistance to the hegemonic power that it reveals there can be no progressive education. &nbsp;It shows that the resulting promise can be kept with or without national government support. &nbsp;It believes that nothing is inevitable and that withdrawn consent can change everything.&nbsp; It holds to the stakeholder interests and voice that can make change happen.&nbsp; And it insists that education is community property and must be returned to its owners.</p>
<p>Alice will believe none of this unless her educators do.</p>
