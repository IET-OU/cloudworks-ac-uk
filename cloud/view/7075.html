        <p><strong>The context:</strong><br />The University of Lausanne in Switzerland. I'm working as a learning engineer. I collaborate on a pilot project which aims at developing and enhancing student's soft skills such as Information Literacy (IL) and ICT skills</p>
<p>The main goals of the Project are:<br />-helping the students to self-evaluate their IL and ICT&nbsp; skills <br />-helping the students to develop their skills through existing pedagogical resources (courses, modules, etc.) -helping the students to reflect on the 'soft skills' acquired with different learning experiences and artefacts ( academic works such as dissertation, exams, etc...<br />...</p>
<p>It would be interesting to expand the project to Digital Literacy.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> According to the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/subsites/dilframework/skill1.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Digital literacy framework from OU</a> 'Digital literacy includes the ability to find and use information (otherwise known as information literacy) but goes beyond this to encompass communication, collaboration and teamwork, social awareness in the digital environment, understanding of e-safety and creation of new information. Both digital and information literacy are underpinned by critical thinking and evaluation'.</p>
<p>I think that a cMOOC could help the students to enhance one of these digital literacy skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate the ability to create a personal learning environment incorporating elements of OU digital study practices and external applications and environments. <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/subsites/dilframework/skill1.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Level 3 of the OU framwork, skill: 'Understand and engage in digital practices')</a></li>
<li>Demonstrate effective use of social and/or professional online networks outside the OU study community. <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/subsites/dilframework/skill1.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Level 3 of the OU framwork, skill: 'Understand and engage in digital practices')</a></li>
<li>Articulate the characteristics of digital scholarship in the relevant subject and/or professional area <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/subsites/dilframework/skill1.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Master Level of the OU framwork, skill: 'Understand and engage in digital practices')</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The change I would like to see (challenge)</strong><br />For the participants: I need to reflect on this point further but I really think that if you can survive to a cMOOC until the end then you have acquired high digital skills and enhancing your own PLE ;-)</p>
<p>I agree with Bronwyn Hegarty who has given us on the forum this afternoon an interesting reference to his articles on this topic.</p>
<p>(See the exec summary and full report: <a href="http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/publications/tertiary_education/80624" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Digital Information Literacy: Supported Development of Capability in Tertiary Environments.</a> An article that arose from the research is published in JITE:<a href="http://www.jite.org/documents/Vol10/JITEv10p383-413Jeffrey1019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Developing Digital Information Literacy in Higher Education: Obstacles and Supports</a>.)</p>
<p>I quote him from the discussion forum : 'From our perspective digital literacy is a subset, and to be an active player on the web, and a proficient online learner digital information literacy is more important than mere digital literacy.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me: this MOOC could be part to the Magellan project. We could then offer to the students the opportunitiy to develop their Digital skills (both digital information literacy and mere digitsl literacy).<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Pedagogical approach</strong></p>
<p>-A connectivist MOOC,&nbsp; (I'm more interested by the connectivist feature than the massive one) / participative pedagogy</p>
<p>According to the report 'The MOOC MODEL FOR DIGITAL PRACTICE (McAuley ET AL., 2010, p.46-47)</p>
<div title="Page 47">
<div style="background-color: rgb(100.000000%, 100.000000%, 100.000000%);">
<div>
<div>&lt;&lt; <em>The ability to work with current digital tools to connect fragmented, diffuse, and distributed knowledge nodes, both human and artifactual, is perhaps the most important literacy that the MOOC environment rewards. Developing one's personal knowledge and presenting it through a coherent reflection or contribution, whether by means of blog posts, concept maps, video or another tool, <strong>is a high-level digital literacy</strong></em>&gt;&gt;</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Which technologies will I use to implement it, and how</strong></p>
<p>a cMOOC plateform, (wordpress, moodle), aggregation tool, web2.0 tools, eportfolio Mahara.<br />I don't have yet experiences in designing and implementing a cMOOC....<strong><br /></strong></p>    </div>

                   <p>Hi Catherine</p>
<p>This looks like a very interesting approach. I tend to feel, like you, that the digital/ information literacy skills can best be learned through practice and social learning processes. I have been trying in a fairly unsystematic way to get this embedded into my course and I hope this MOOC will help me design a really good process for doing it.</p>

                   <p>Hi Catherine,</p>
<p>This sounds really interesting and I think we're on the same page! I work at the OU and we aim to embed digital and information literacies across the curriculum in all qualifications. Which is quite a big task! We (Library Services) have been working with faculties for a while now and had some success with integrating information literacy, which we are building on.</p>
<p>We've developed a <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/pages/dilframework" rel="nofollow">Digital and information literacy framework</a> in which we have attempted to capture the relevant skills and suggest how they might look at different levels of the curriculum. It's still work in progress but might be a useful starting point.</p>
<p>Cheerio for now!</p>

                   <p>Hi Katharine,</p>
<p>Thank you for your message. I think that we are doing the same thing ! Our Library services are at the origin of this project. They have also worked with faculties nd one of them has integrated somes courses into its curriculum.</p>
<p>It could be interesting to exchange&nbsp; our experiences if you want, I can ask my colleague, the coordinator of the project to contact you ...</p>

                   <p>Hi Catherine</p>
<p>There is now a cloudscape/posible team around digital literacy&nbsp;&nbsp;generally&nbsp;but I have now added a cloud on digital identity and social media. Unless I get thrown out on my ear, I think it is OK to add to the cloudscape a little fluffy cloud on any related topic. I have simply been adding a few links in there.</p>
<p>It would be good if you joined in rather than having a separate cloudscape, but if you do decide to go your own way, let me know so I can join you!</p>
<p>Its all new to me, so I guess we just stumble along until meaning emerges!</p>

                   <p>Hello Catherine</p>
<p>I believe that we're on the same page too. I 'm interested in embedded approaches.My interest is in literacies (digital and trad) and iteracy is always embedded in a context. The context in which the skills are required is the&nbsp; best place to develop them, in my opinion.</p>

                   <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am too interested in the topic. I work at Open Universities Australia, which only delivers courses online. Hence, digital literacy is of paramount importance for our students. What we are trying to do is to develop accessible preparatory courses that students can undertake either before they start or at any point in time during their studies, should they relaise they need help.</p>
<p>Jane,</p>
<p>thank you for creating the cloud. I am interested in following it.</p>
