<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian; University World News; Wonkhe; Eric Stoller]</em></p>
<p>Despite the fact that they bring more than &pound;10.7bn to the UK economy, the Home Office is considering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/dec/12/uk-halve-international-student-visa-tougher-rules?CMP=share_btn_tw" rel="nofollow">cutting numbers of international students from the current 300,000 to 170,000</a>.&nbsp; The unnamed head of one leading university commented that &ldquo;politics is trumping economics&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hefce has published its >consultation on the second Research Excellence Framework</a> (REF 2021), which is now open for responses until 17 Mar.&nbsp; If you just want the highlights, Wonkhe has summarised the >key proposals and context</a>.</p>
<p>In one of 190 responses to the Parliamentary Education Committee, Cambridge University has warned that one of the effects of Brexit is <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20161209123907549" rel="nofollow">a potential two-thirds reduction in admissions of students from EU countries</a>.&nbsp; The university is also calling for clarification of the status of EU staff working in the UK as a matter of priority.&nbsp; In 2014-15, 31,635 non-UK EU nationals were working in UK universities, 16% of the total; 12% of staff were non-EU, the university said. &nbsp;Among its own 2,000 or so staff, the percentage of EU nationals is 17% and, of the university&rsquo;s 3,000 postdoctoral researchers, around 36% are EU nationals.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[The PIE; Class Central; University World News; NYT; Steve Parkinson]</em></p>
<p>FutureLearn has announced a <a href="http://thepienews.com/news/futurelearn-deakin-partner-postgraduate-degrees/" rel="nofollow">PG partnership with Australia&rsquo;s Deakin University</a>, that will make it the first MOOC provider to offer a series of postgraduate degrees from one partner institution.&nbsp; The six master&rsquo;s degrees and two PG certificates in Information Technology, Financial Planning, Cyber Security, Humanitarian and Development Action, Property, and Diabetes Education will be launched early next year.&nbsp; Each subject will cost $A2,600 (&pound;1500) but students will also be able to enrol in a free, two week taster course before fully enrolling.</p>
<p>Class Central looks at <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/moocs-no-longer-massive/" rel="nofollow">the evolution of MOOCs</a>, noting that many early examples were &ldquo;essentially college courses put online &ndash; they were approximately ten weeks long and had weekly or bi-weekly assignment deadlines with a final exam&rdquo; and they also generated huge volumes of online discussion (Coursera once boasted about an average forum response time of 22 mins).&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s MOOCs are more available and more popular than ever but they have changed to reflect current student needs and behaviour.&nbsp; For example, most MOOCs are shorter (4-6 weeks), with a lower weekly time commitment and more flexible deadlines, and around 35% are now self-paced, meaning that cohort sizes and forum traffic are lower.&nbsp; And there are many more opportunities for monetisation, but mostly without limiting access to the core content.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ministry of Education predicts <a href="http://thepienews.com/news/chinese-mooc-learners-top-10-miilion-year-end/" rel="nofollow">the number of students enrolled on a MOOC in China</a> is set to exceed 10 million by the end of 2016, up from 1.5 million just two years ago.&nbsp; Some 1,200 MOOCs have so far been developed by around 30 universities, with a much greater focus on higher education rather than vocational courses.&nbsp; However, despite the boom in enrolments and courses, 90% of China&rsquo;s colleges and universities have not yet begun to develop MOOC provision.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/eduopen-italian-mooc-provider/" rel="nofollow">EduOpen</a> is an Italian MOOC network, headed by the University of Foggia, which has been live since Apr 16.&nbsp; In that time, it has expanded from 8 to 17 universities, there are more than 14,000 registered students studying around 70 courses, and typical completion rates are an impressive 20%.&nbsp; Having evaluated Open edX, the consortium chose Moodle as its host platform because of its &ldquo;better pedagogical environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is estimated that around half a million US tech jobs went unfilled last year so Udacity&rsquo;s new <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/technology/udacity-an-online-learning-start-up-offers-tech-job-trials.html" rel="nofollow">Blitz</a> service allows employers to define what skills they are seeking.&nbsp; Udacity will then suggest candidates who are suitable for a short internship &ndash; typically a 3m contract assignment, for which Udacity takes a fee of 10-20% of the worker&rsquo;s salary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Udacity made a <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/29/udacity-and-boot-camps-offer-money-back-guarantees-job-placement" rel="nofollow">money-back guarantee</a> earlier this year for graduates of its nanodegree programme who did not find employment within 6 months, an initiative that has since been copied by some other providers such as coding bootcamp, App Academy.&nbsp; Inside Higher Ed considers the impact, risks and legalities of such offers, noting that state and federal agencies take a dim view of money-back guarantees in HE.&nbsp; App Academy was fined $50,000 last year for operating in California without a licence, but Udacity received an exemption because its charges are less than the $2,500 per year state threshold.</p>

<p><strong>Defining and Demonstrating Teacher Quality and Impact</strong></p>
<p><em>[Rand; Mail Online]</em></p>
<p>RAND was commissioned by the HEA to conduct <a href="http://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/defining-teacher-quality-impact-tef.html" rel="nofollow">a literature review relating to defining and demonstrating teaching quality and impact in higher education</a>. &nbsp;They claim to have found relatively little robust empirical evidence, with peer reviewed and grey literature dominated by opinion pieces based on secondary, documentary analysis rather than rigorous comparison group studies, which they believe points to a lack of a body of evidence for notions of &lsquo;quality teaching&rsquo; across higher education more broadly.&nbsp; The authors call for more implementation research to test theories about how to operationalise and measure &lsquo;quality teaching&rsquo; but, before this can start, more consensus, or at least constructive discussion, is needed on the notion of &lsquo;quality teaching&rsquo; in higher education, the goals and priorities of higher education institutions themselves, and how these elements must be harmonised.</p>
<p>All of which must be music to the ears of Oxford University&rsquo;s defence team as they prepare to contest a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3998394/Oxford-University-graduate-sues-college-1m-claiming-appallingly-bad-boring-tuition-led-getting-2-1-instead-left-depression-insomnia.html" rel="nofollow">&pound;1m claim by Modern History graduate, Faiz Siddiqui</a>, that only gaining a 2:1 degree from Brasenose College in 2000 denied him the chance of becoming a high flying commercial barrister.&nbsp; Mr Siddiqui, who trained as a solicitor after university, says his life and career have been blighted by his failure to obtain a first class degree because, &ldquo;the standard of teaching was objectively unacceptable&rdquo;.&nbsp; But surely the process of teaching (and many other soft-applied specialisms) is considerably more subjective than objective?&nbsp; If teaching could be conducted based on an objective checklist, one might presume the HEA, TEF, Oxford and other HEIs would have worked out what that looked like by now.&nbsp; Forget PGCE, follow this checklist.&nbsp; Actually, forget teachers, here&rsquo;s the teaching machine.&nbsp; Skinner was right all along.</p>

<p><strong>Experts Agree Online Education is Good.&nbsp; And Bad.</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; Campus Technology; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>Laurence Brockliss reports that, despite considerable growth in UK student numbers in the last 50 years, the proportion of GDP spent on HE is little higher today than it was in the 1960s.&nbsp; Income from donors and other private sources has grown but is finite, so <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/comment/mass-learning-must-mean-web-based-study" rel="nofollow">why are HEIs not routinely considering online solutions?</a>&nbsp; He suggests, &ldquo;at a fraction of the present cost [of F2F], undergraduates, if not postgraduates, could study far away from their host institutions, accessing books, articles, lectures, demonstrations and debates at any hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; He notes the success of the OU as a distance learning provider but believes, for mainstream HEIs, &ldquo;What predominately stymies interest in online study is institutional inertia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A report from the US Council of Independent Colleges and Learning House finds that <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/11/14/report-private-colleges-universities-expand-online-learning-opportunities.aspx?admgarea=News" rel="nofollow">online education is on the rise at private colleges and universities</a>.&nbsp; In 2013, the survey found that about 15% had &lsquo;extensive&rsquo; online offerings (defined as five or more fully online programmes) and 90% of institutions reported obstacles which &ldquo;prevented them from growing the number of online courses or programs they were offering&rdquo;.&nbsp; Now, 25% have &lsquo;extensive&rsquo; online offerings; obstacles are only reported by 48% of institutions; and more than half believe online delivery enables them to reach students &ldquo;outside of what they would consider their traditional service area&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Aardman has partnered with Rapt Media to produce an interactive animation, <a href="http://www.raptmedia.com/project/aardman-dead-lonely" rel="nofollow">Dead Lonely</a>.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t expect Wallace and Gromit &ndash; this one features zombie Fred searching for his lost love, Barbara, in a post-apocalyptic world, and you get to help him find her.&nbsp; Aardman was seeking to explore &ldquo;how interactive video could be used to tell stories in new and innovative ways &ndash; ways that would allow the viewer (you) to connect deeper with the story&rsquo;s protagonist by having a say in the choices made.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s fairly short (or I made some lucky guesses) but quite engaging.</p>
<p>But, for a younger audience, Apple&rsquo;s >iBooks StoryTime app</a> for Apple TV will read to your kids.&nbsp; They can flip through the pages of the books on their own, or switch on Read-Aloud narration which will sync the audio to the on-screen text and flip the pages for them.</p>    </div>
