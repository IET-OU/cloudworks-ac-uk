                   <p>Thanks for starting us off , Pam. &nbsp;This is the core of the discussion. Can we get rid of the 'Or do you' at the beginning? &nbsp;It has always seemed to me that one of the problems with educational research is the lack of experimentation ( compared with medical research). We should use evidence -based information to make decisions where we can. &nbsp;I am assuming that we all believe tuition ( either individual or generic) is proven to be helpful to students even though the evidence -based is limited. London University External does not systematically provide individual tuition but its success rates. &nbsp;If others agree that tuition is NB &nbsp;then &nbsp;we can get into the nitty -gritty of the debate.</p>

                   <p>Hi Roger</p>
<p>I expect we need to distinguish between tuition and tutor support. Tuition is a non-negotiable but tutor support is an option. At Unisa, tuition is 'done' by lecturers through responses to assignments and tutorial letters which are really tuition letters and through comments posted onto MyUnisa (our web platform) and materials uploaded to MyUnisa but the latter is not part of the compulsory tuition package supplied to all students.</p>
<p>Our question is therefore&nbsp; 'How do you provide additional support to large numbers of students by means of tutors?</p>
<p>I agree about evidence based research and practice though.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Dear Pam and Roger</p>
<p>The discussions regarding offering student support at Unisa has always stared at the huge numbers involved and the numbers have become a Medusian gaze - keeping us (me thinks) captivated and often paralysed. I include myself in this "captive audience"...</p>
<p>I agree with Roger that we need evidence - not evidence indicating that student support works (I think we accept that), but what type of support will which students need at what stage of their learning journey. Only after these three questions have been answered, can we actually "face" the numbers. Not all students need or want tutorial support all the time. Thinking about the almost 300 000 students of Unisa, a good place to start would be to determine how many students need <em>and</em> want extra tutorial support at which part of their learning journey (beginning, middle, before the exams, or throughout) and only then start to think about the how. Or do I miss something?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Paul,</p>
<p>Thanks for this helpful focus. &nbsp;What do others think?The 3 models in the conceptualisation paper give a hint of thinking on this. &nbsp;Who decides when, and what students need? &nbsp;Is there additional cost? etc etc&nbsp;For example should we expect students to become more independent learners as they become more experienced and therefore require less or no tutorial support- other than being able to email questions to Unisa faculty.I shall not post any more comments now until we have the first contributions from the Group</p>

                   <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am the one responsible for that 1.3MB file - sorry! I am also off to a late start since Cloudworks does not like my usual email address - an important lesson for online learning I think.</p>
<p>Following on from contributions already made, I think a phased approach is needed. We need to focus first on courses with large student numbers but low pass rates and throughput and then, as Paul has suggested, get some idea from students about the kinds of additional support <strong>they</strong> feel they need. This was a central aspect of the previous ODL Student Support Task Team proposal so it is a pity that the project approved by the STLSC to 'experiment' with 2 modules has been shelved.</p>
<p>We also need to look at the larger context: graduation rates in higher education in RSA are pretty poor generally - in both contact and DE modes. I cannot believe that all institutions teach badly and therefore conclude that many students entering HE are underprepared - not suprising considering how badly RSA fares in comparative literacy and numeracy at school level. I was hoping that Unisa's ROAP project would shed some light on this issue ... but suspect that we could achieve a lot simply by providing more intensive integrated academic literacy development in our first level modules - and such support could be mediated by more advanced students, community leaders, teachers etc rather than discipline specialists.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks Tony. Your comments about low literacy levels amongst school leavers prompt me to start talking about the need to increase the time for a degree at Unisa to four years and to make the first year a bridging year during which we teach writing across the curriculum, computer skills and critical thinking. And I would like to extend this conversation to those outside South Africa to ask if something like this is done elsewhere?</p>

                   <p>Hallo all!</p>
<p>At the OU UK we haven't required people to study a bridging year but we do have some open access resources on skills for study which include a diagnostic on using English. We may well advise students to work through something here before registering. You should be able to access these here <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/skillsforstudy/english-for-learning.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.open.ac.uk/skillsforstudy/english-for-learning.php</a></p>
<p>Another approach we've taken is to encourage students who are unsure about study to take one&nbsp; of our "Openings" courses which are designed for those who have no recent previous experience of study. These courses provide a high level of personalised tuition mainly by telephone. I think this takes us back to an interesting&nbsp;point Paul made earlier - do students at different stages of their Univesrity career need different amounts of tuition? And how can we be sure of this?</p>
<p>Best to all</p>

                   <p>You know Anne, you have got me thinking about alternatives to the additional year idea which will in any case need government approval. The notion of allowing students to register for an "opening" course is very appealing as it isn't punitive, leaves the choice up to the student and could be done flexibly and over a period of weeks or months as opposed to a year.</p>
<p>i am also fascinated that the OU makes such extensive use of the telephone. A lesson here for Unisa?????</p>        </div>

                   <p>The issue of extended study time was explored by a CHE task team in 2007 at the request of a previous Minister and concluded that rather than extending the time, HEIs should simply teach better! And a key indicator for that was creating opportunities for more active student engagement with content in context. And THAT raises the issue of greater decentralisation as the historical and current model of tutor support at Unisa has been centred on student request after registration for tutorials at one of the regional centres. So we also need to be able to keep tabs on just WHERE students are and WHO they are. Saide has consistently argued that a learning centre is a place where learning happens and that could be a virtual space for those who have access and inclination but also workplaces, schools, community and church halls etc. In such a scenario Unisa's regional centres would then be support hubs for a much wider network of physical community centres and virtual spaces. I would see this increasingly being coordinated at a programme level rather than centrally.</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>There seems to be three issues emerging here- not all directly relating to tutoring but all bearing on the issue</p>
<p>1. Access and preparation. &nbsp;Studying in a second language is always going to be difficult and diagnostic materials, plus preparatory and openings type courses can be of help- but can't other institutions ( Technisa's ) help here with preparation? &nbsp; Did the 'managed admissions project ( 2007) get off the ground and what was the outcome</p>
<p>2. Different approaches for different programmes and different types of courses - yes provided the management of this does not become to complex</p>
<p>3. Yes it is critical to have information about student demographics and location .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can we focus on the large student number issue and how one deals with that.( paul's Medusian gaze)</p>
<p>At present , as I understand it, student can still telephone or email lecturers at Unisa, receive tutorial letters ( via MyUnisa) &nbsp;, have assignments marked by Computer? and in some cases directly by academics.</p>
<p>If you have 2000 students on a course and not enough people to provide face-to-face ,telephone, correspondence or on-line tuition, what do you do?</p>
<p>1. Drastically limit numbers on course</p>
<p>2.Offer reactive support only ( as at present)</p>
<p>3.Get other institutions to provide &nbsp;tuition</p>
<p>4.Send out audio tapes/video tapes/ or use broadcast radio ( TV is too expensive)/satellite broadcasts</p>
<p>5 Don't provide individual &nbsp;formative feedback</p>
<p>What does student feedback say? we want more face-to-face tuition? (Why do they say this? &nbsp;just because they are used to this model of educatuon?) but this is a distance teaching University</p>
<p>Is there anyone else out there?</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>Hi Roger et al - Unisa servers were down this whole weekend (...) so that is why it was so quiet!</p>
<p>A number of things are happenging at present:</p>
<p>1. Unisa is seriously engaging in (on the one hand) raising its academic admission requirements for its degrees and diplomas based on the reality that (i) we have the lowest (the minumum) admission requirements in the country; (ii) our students are totally under-prepared for higher education (iii) and we are under-prepared for such type of students. Therefore it would seem as if, in the absence of a thorough, application screening, the language requirement for the language of tuition will be raised substantially - students between 50-60% will be allowed to reqister for only four modules a year while students with 60% or more will be unrestricted. The "restricted students" will be needing extra student support. This is the thinking at this stage - not yet formalised.</p>
<p>2. While this seems like "closing" the gates of higher education, Unisa is also in the process of formulising alternative pathways for students who are impacted by these new requirements, like a Higher Certificate which will be a qualification in its own right, but which will provide a "pool" for preparing under-prepared students with potential.</p>
<p>3. It would seem as if the four year degree is back on the table on the national agenda. This will further allow additional academic support and preparation in students' first year.</p>
<p>From where I sit (or run...), I think the three institutional factors impacting the most on increasing our student success is the lack of a formalised student profiling on application (which will allow placing students on a range of trajectories) and the linking of effective and appropriate institutional interventions based on the evidence of this profiling. The first of these is in development phase and will provide Unisa with actionable intelligence, while the latter is less coordinated (at present) but there is a task team that will put a strategy on the table. The third factor is a 16 week tuition cycle in a country where postal services are unreliable, students' postal addresses are often those of family members and employers, students internet connectivity is costly (and often erratic) and students, who are underprepared, register for too many courses per semester.</p>
<p>Apologies for this long response - but I suspect it maybe adds value to thinking about the impact of tutors taken the above. If we don't address the above, tutoring will be less-effective.</p>
<p>Paul</p>

                   <p>Hi Roger and Paul</p>
<p>Yes there was a deathly silence over the weekend.</p>
<p>Focus on courses where there are large numbers, ie Economics with 10,000 students. This is where the mind starts boggling I'm afraid and where course designers opt for multiple choice assignments as the method of tuition.</p>
<p>Has anyone out there any thoughts about outsourcing marking to India?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Pam, not 10 000, but 28 000 considering Economics 102 as well...</p>
<ol>
<li>Not all of these students would want support</li>
<li>Not all of these students would need support</li>
<li>Not all of the students who want/need support will be able to attend face-to-face tutorials</li>
<li>Not all of the students who want/need support have access to the internet</li>
</ol>
<p>Before we think of who will tutor those who want/need, we must first, me thinks, get a clear indication of who would want/need what kind of tutorial support. Me thinks. Before we are thinking outsourcing... :-)</p>

                   <p>Hi Paul</p>
<p>I think our terms are muddled and that's the nature of the thing - it's complex.</p>
<p>I wasn't offering outsourcing as a model for tutoring per se but for marking as a way of getting away from multiple-choice assignments. If one of the most effective forms of student support is feedback on assignments and MCQs (let's be honest) provide precious little of that in a personalised form, then outsourcing to a company that prides itself on swift turnaround time and intelligent comments would be preferable I think to 25,000 students getting MCQs only.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Dear Pam et al - oops, I missed your last sentence stating "outsourcing of marking to India". Apologies.</p>
<p>Interesting idea, mmmm. A number of thoughts come to mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>If these assignments contain short and longer paragraph type questions, this will greatly enhance student's effort and learning ... and the overall quality of teaching.</li>
<li>If these assignments are <em>written</em> assignments (as students on this level may not have acess to the internet) then the assignments will have to be scanned (+-14 000) and sent to markers - turnaround time implications of scanning such an amount?</li>
<li>Why specifically India? Or would Unisa be able to source markers from another source? Will having these markers being located in one 'location" make a difference? Will international markers be willing to mark assignments for the current rates we pay our South African markers?</li>
<li>Why not involve posgraduate students in Economics which will be local, will help them with an extra income and celebrate our alumni?</li>
</ol>
<p>Jst some thoughts.</p>

                   <p>Hi Paul et al</p>
<p>Why India? I've posted a new link which will lead you to the article I read in The Chronicle that inspired this train of thought. I also went to the company in question in India and was impressed by their webpage.</p>
<p>But yes, other options of course are sensible.</p>
<p>Naturally this would apply only to assignments received on MyUnisa. We couldn't scan assignments but in Economics for instance, I suspect that the majority of assignments are posted electronically.</p>
<p>There you go!</p>        </div>

                   <p><strong>Assumption:Large numbers mainly at level 1, student want face-to-face, not enough tutors to give individual feedback</strong></p>
<p>Face-to Face--- easy to franchise out to Colleges, schools/work-place organisation. &nbsp;No need to bother about QA - the QA procedures for the Colleges/Schools (? but not perhaps work places) would be responsible.</p>
<p>Unisa already franchises out to UofNamibia and others,doesn't it&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individual feedback much more difficult BUT at level 1, much of it is routine. Tutorial letters help but individual feedback could be given by post grad students, individual schoolteachers/college lecturers/ house persons ( suitably qualified)&nbsp;OR why not try the Virtual-TA in Pam's post ( politics aside) on a small programme for one year.&nbsp;Have you used intelligent Computer feedback systems?</p>
<p>I realise you have all been through all this before so apologies if am I going over old ground</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">PS I saw Tony Dodds, for those who know him today who has recovered well from a very serious operation</p>
