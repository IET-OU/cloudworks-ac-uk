        <p>This cloud has been set up to live blog, aggregate resources and further discussion, referring to Charles Leadbeater's talk "<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearningpedagogy/elpconference09/programme/openingkeynote.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The role of innovation in education"</a>, scheduled on 24th November at the fourth <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearningpedagogy/elpconference09/programme.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">JISC online conference.</a></p>
<p>From the abstract:</p>
<p>Using examples from his research into schools and work relating to the arts, Charles Leadbeater discusses in the opening keynote the role of innovation in education, exploring not only how the web can break down barriers but also how the benefits it promises can be nurtured and sustained.</p>
<p>Key questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How should educational establishments deal with innovation     both in ideas and means of delivery? </li>
<li>What will the universities, schools and     colleges of the future look like? </li>
<li>Where will they be located, and who will they     employ?</li>
</ul>    </div>

			<p><strong>THE ROLE OF INNOVATION IN EDUCATION</strong></p>

<p>The question you ask largely determines the answer you get<br /><br />Your vantage point determines what you can see&hellip; <br /><br />Where would you look to see what education and learning might become ?<br /><br />Mapping education innovation<br /><br /><strong><em>A) Innovation as IMPROVEMENT</em></strong><br /><br />Good people teaching, well trained, well motivated and supported in the right conditions <br /><br />Order and calm: hard &amp; soft power<br /><br />Relationships that build: Care, Recognition, Motivation, Participation<br /><br />But&hellip;Performance plateau <br />Ingrained inequality<br />Hitting the target, missing the point<br /><br />Improve is essential but not enough&hellip;</p>

                   <p>Indeed an excellent springboard for a conference, much food for thought. Disruptive innovation as catalyst for systemic innovation? If I think of the very conservative university environment I have been working for years I would rather say: 'disruption prevents from starting an effecive process of innovation', as much literature on technological innovation in HE (Bates, Jenkins,...) has widely stated. Anyway, look forward to joining the asynchronous discussion to understand more in-depth the issue.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I really like the themes, esp. the idea of reform! There're political undertones there I think ... I think it would be interesting to explore the idea of innovation diffusion (Rogers) with the idea of reforming, socially situated practices within the context of education.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Leadbeater has just added a note that better explains he intended practical use of his framework. Quoting:</p>
<p>"  I suppose I am trying to use it (above framework) to do four things. <br /> <br /></p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp; Getting people - policymakers, heads, teachers - to think beyond just the Improve strategy, to realise there are other strategies available. </li>
<li>&nbsp;  To get people to think about the mix of approaches that work best. </li>
<li>&nbsp; To look at the movements between them. Making it easier to move from Improve to Improve and Reform, making the boundaries between them more porous.</li>
<li> Seeing it all as a whole where the balance of emphasis might shift, At the moment Transform is really seen as "Marginal Alternatives for Learners with Special Needs" but if this became the dominant pole would be much better.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Finland </strong></em>it seems to me does all four and combines them well. Other good places, Victoria in Aus similar. <strong><em>England</em></strong> focuses on Improve and treats the rest as following from that. <strong><em>India</em></strong> should really focus on the right hand side (informal = Supplement/Transform) which is where I think the big opportunities are".</p>        </div>
