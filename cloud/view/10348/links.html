<p>Readability</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="151">
<p>Of all the example models provided in Activity 2a of H800, I found this the easiest to comprehend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also found the &lsquo;swim lane&rsquo; diagram provided on ld-grid.org to be highly readable and easy to understand without prior knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="180">
<p>The e-Design template is fairly readable, but it relies on a lot of small text to get its points across.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The x-axis could be less prescriptive about the passage of time (it could be days/months/chapters/sections, rather than weeks).</p>

<td valign="top" width="95">
<p>Expressiveness</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="151">
<p>The diagram with the four interconnecting circles (with Technology in the centre) doesn&rsquo;t quite manage to express the nuanced dependencies between each of the four Ts, in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the Time required for the Task may increase with larger Teams (more people involved in the discussion) or decrease (many hands dividing up the jobs to be done).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The swim lane chart is an improvement, as it conveys the chronological sequencing of activities in the lesson (in other words, the &lsquo;narrative&rsquo;).&nbsp; I would improve upon this by using different sized circles to indicate the size of the Team or Time required, thereby making it easier to see at a glance which are the most labour-intensive tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="180">
<p>I feel it succeeds in conveying the linear progression within an online course, where the activities require the learner to become increasingly self-sufficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This progression recalls a three-act &lsquo;Discovery &ndash; Exploration &ndash; Reflection&rsquo; structure that I have used in online course design previously, but turns into it a four-act journey with clear development in the roles played by tutor and learner:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tutor&rsquo;s progression:</p>
<p>Instructor<br /> &nbsp; &gt; Guide<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; Coach<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Facilitator</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learner&rsquo;s progression:</p>
<p>Access<br /> &nbsp; &gt; Extend<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Adopt<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; Integrate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model (and diagram) could do more to emphasis these changing roles: as the learner&rsquo;s confidence and domain knowledge grows, he/she becomes more self-sufficient and the&nbsp; tutor becomes less and less active.</p>

<td valign="top" width="95">
<p>Utility</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="151">
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the 4Ts diagram itself is particularly useful in communicating anything about a specific design, but the conceptual model makes it quick and easy to get started on designing a new lesion/activity/module by breaking it down into the four component parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="180">
<p>I think the e-Design template is extremely useful for online projects based in a single technology environment over a number of weeks, where there is room for the progression of a narrative and the development of learners from novices requiring hand-holding into independent self-directed learners.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="95">
<p>Adequate for expressing my own design?</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="151">
<p>It strikes me that the 4Ts model is useful for blended learning programs where there is a face-to-face element in which Teams come together to collaborate and the designers have the option to utilise a variety of different Technologies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, for a fully online course (SPOC) where the Technology is fixed &ndash; a single online platform will host the course &ndash; and there is no opportunity to work in different sized Teams, the model is less useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="180">
<p>This model is very well aligned to the approach I took to my design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first section of the course I wrote about in A1b was quite instructive &ndash; the tutors needed to establish the facts and give all learners an <strong>induction</strong> to the basics of the new sales model to ensure they shared a common understanding on which to build. There was also a diagnostic self assessment early on to help the learner understand their current behaviour and skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the second phase, the tutors <strong>guided</strong> participants towards a deeper understanding of the sales techniques, with case studies and discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the third phase, participants were asked to <strong>adopt</strong> elements of the new sales model in their interactions with customers and then report back, with coaching from their own manager, their peers on the course, and their online tutor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, having <strong>integrated</strong> the new skills into their standard practice, learners were asked to assess themselves again and re-evaluate their behaviours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="95">
<p>Benefits for my design</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="151">
<p>The emphasis on estimating the Time needed for each component part of the lesson is very useful to MOOC/SPOC designs, such as mine, especially as my design was for a time-poor, mobile user group for whom frequent shorter Tasks were preferred to fewer longer sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="180">
<p>This model would have been extremely beneficial when I was developing the course I described in my design narrative. &nbsp;It feels like we unknowingly followed it when designing the online courses I described in A1b.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four week MOOCs are very common on FutureLearn, so I the four-part structure of this model could be very helpful when developing a short course where learners start out knowing very little and are expected to become self-directed by the end of the fourth week.</p>
