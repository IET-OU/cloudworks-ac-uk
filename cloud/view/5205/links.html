<p><br /><br /><br /><br />Like  a swiss army knife, mobile phones are already being used across the  planet to solve many everyday problems. From vote monitoring in Nigeria  to micro-loans in South America. From parenting advice in China to sex  education in India.<br />Educators  are slowly starting to adopt the same mobile ideas to enhance learning,  and a growing number of m-learning projects in both UK and Europe are  showing marked successes in reaching new learners.<br />Despite  these successes, there is no simple formula for ensuring an m-learning  project will succeed: Equipment vendors are often biased. Technical  solutions are often locked to a specific device or supplier. Many  current m-learning projects and m-learning suppliers use non-standard  solutions that make it hard for another institution to build on those  for themselves and further the knowledge gained.<br />These  technical considerations make it challenging for academic reviewers to  abstract out a solid theoretical basis for success, or failure.  Successes (and failures) might be due to matching the right pedagogical  approach to the right learners, but might also be due to technical  considerations. And given the rapid evolution of technical tools and  mobile devices, it is equally likely that the technical impossibilities  of last year are the mainstream accepted norms of this year.<br />How  then to learn valid lessons from last year&rsquo;s projects, and build  educational models that can flex and adapt as the tools themselves  evolve.<br />The  authors are in the final stages of a multi-national review of mobile  learning, and would like to propose that despite the vast array of  different project, nations, approaches and technologies - mobile  learning is actually reaching a convergence point of accepted best  practise and technological approach.<br /> <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pXej_7QQ72gTw-ibyqgpyF3JxdBR3O9SFJaZDhQfhjHt27ZOvUptY8zw-pIbDcBwBgLkd_sUITvKA9wD6SqwOGTXtyIAhz1rFg3PvPNr0hSpFobT3RM" alt="" width="401px;" height="280px;" /><br />On  the one side are projects that have set about to work &ldquo;within the  system&rdquo;, building on the current infrastructure - both technical and  conceptual - to add richer learning experiences to traditional learner  groups. This would include school classes given PDAs or iPads to enrich  their learning, as well as software solutions to connect mobile learners  with traditional e-learning systems, like VLEs<br />On  the other side are the more open ended explorations, adding a wider  range of technologies, often described as &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo;, to places where  mainstream class-based learning isn&rsquo;t happening. These projects span a  much wider range of technologies, and learning approaches. They include  high tech solutions like virtual worlds for rehabilitating war wounded  and 3-D visualisations of motors to support aircraft mechanics on the  job. They also include mid-tech solutions like mobile portfolios  accessed by a learner&rsquo;s own phone, language training for deployed  soldiers on their iPods and skills training for taxi drivers on their  phones while waiting for the next job. Low tech examples would include  radio-lessons to Indian children missing school on market days. <br />We  would like to propose that these two types of m-learning that  historically have operated in different pedagogical frameworks, are in  fact converging into a single model. That the technologies in use are  becoming increasingly unified, that the tools for working with them are  moving slowly into the mainstream, and that the best ways to integrate  them into educational interactions are becoming agreed and shared.<br />In  discussing this, we will take a step back from a UK-centric view of  m-learning to look more broadly at solutions from across the world and  to draw out key success criteria, as well as exploring some of the more  significant differences to see what Europe can learn from our  international friends.<br />The  authors have been actively involved in a broad range of mobile learning  programmes across countries (USA, Africa, UK, Europe), sectors  (schools, work-based, FE, military, charitable) and languages. They will  be demonstrating some of the technologies and pedagogies used, as well  as providing unique insights into both their successes and their  failures. Projects covered will include:<br />m-uBuntu:  working with impoverished South African schools to improve English  Literacy (so successfully that students and teachers were invited to the  USA to share their knowledge with the Whitehouse and US schools). The  project derives it&rsquo;s name and purpose from the African word &ldquo;uBuntu&rdquo;,  meaning &ldquo;I am what I am because of who we all are&rdquo;. The vision is to  work with teachers, helping them work with other teachers, and their  students to inform and improve all of their skills. All the schools  involved are in impoverished neighbourhoods. Some urban. Some very  rural. They have each adopted their own approaches to mobile learning,  with a range of devices and many different techniques underpinned by the  uBuntu philosophy. <br /><a href="http://www.m-ubuntu.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.m-ubuntu.org</a> <br /><br />SMS  examination of range of project from across the world .

Working with adult learners  working in the transport industry. The Bloom learners were selected  because they were not actively doing any learning at all. The project  aims were to find new, motivating channels to reach these hard-to-reach  people via their own phones, and to re-awaken their enthusiasm for  learning by making it a viable way to spend their down-time while  waiting for their next job. <a href="http://www.bloom-eten.org/component/option,com_frontpage/Itemid,1/lang,english/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bloom-eten.org/component/option,com_frontpage/Itemid,1/lang,english/</a> <br /> <br />Mole-project:  working with the US Government and 22 nations to provide mobile  learning for medical issues at the point of need to relief workers and  other remote learners. None of the countries included, which includes  USA and UK, use any form of mobile on-the-job learning when deploying  their people for humanitarian or disaster relief, even though the rapid  changing information landscape would make these invaluable tools. <br /><br />The  examination of this range of approaches in a wide variety of context  using mobile will make participants think of models frameworks that can  be applied to mobile and how these models frameworks change over time  and space . This will possibly expose the mobile paradox of  educationalists wanting to formalise mobile a media that by its very  nature and usage patterns is anything but formal and static. <br /><br />About the Authors <br /><br />Andy Black<br />A  &nbsp;colleague says &ldquo;to describe Andy as an out of the box thinker misses  the point Andy doesn&rsquo;t understand what a box is. He will make linkage  find opportunities and give that commitment to make a difference to  learners. &nbsp;Frankly at times he is exhausting to work with &ldquo;<br />Andy  joined British Educational Communication Technology Agency (Becta) 2003  and is Technology Research Manager is looking at and evaluating  technology that may impact on education in the next five years .

He and his  team of technical inventors and educational wizards build apps, tools  and websites to serve learners and tutors across the world. Every year  over 1.2m learners use their tools and resources.<br />He  is considered one of the Godfathers of Mobile Learning, and has  travelled the world encouraging practitioners to embrace mobile tools  and opportunities since 2001. He was recently appointed advisor to the  US Government on their first large-scale mobile learning project which  will provide mobile apps to support aid workers and locals in disaster  relief situations. <br />Geoff&rsquo;s blog http://moblearn.blogspot.com/<br /><a href="http://www.mlearn2006.org/" rel="nofollow"></a></p>    </div>
