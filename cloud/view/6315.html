        <p><strong>Abstract:&nbsp; </strong>In the 6 years since the OpenLearn website launched, it has evolved from being a two year externally-funded pilot to being embedded within the core business of the Open Media Unit. In this talk, I'll look at what this progression has meant for users and for us as an institution. How do we currently represent OERs to the public? What does the site mean for the University? How has that changed over the years? And how will it continue to change as we find ourselves in a world of shifting boundaries between informal and formal learning?</p>

                    <br />

                   <p>I very much enjoyed Laura Dewis' clear and amenable explanation of OpenLearn and how the new site will look (I had to leave before 11am). In my opinion, however, the OU still seems to be mentalising a hybrid offering:&nbsp;open&nbsp;resources but with strong tinges of taster materials aiming to lead users into study with the OU.</p>
<p>I welcome the homepage explanation of what OpenLearn is (that is due to appear), as a way of clarifying the overall point of the site - and look forward to seeing what the wording there will say - but I think that the underlying complexity of the site stems from having a range of objects on offer: units lifted from OU modules, bespoke units derived from OU modules, OU-associated media objects such as TV programmes, 'articles' created by the OpenMedia Unit which link to module teams, and more. It's confusing knowing what is what. Why not simply arrange the navigation of the site through the subject areas rather than&nbsp;the Explore, Try, Study tabs, which&nbsp;give an offputting, abstract start to the experience and seem&nbsp;to lead towards an underlying third option tug of 'study with us'?</p>
<p>I work as an editor in the OU's Learning and Teaching Solutions and the more Openlearn units we produce, the more I see the need to fashion units into&nbsp;<strong>discrete learning experiences</strong> appropriate for an anonymous user rather than as dollops of material taken from a module, which unfortunately some of them still are, for reasons of resource.&nbsp;Proper Taster sites are now being developed and should fulfil the role of providing potential students with a flavour of what studying a module might be like. I think there are definitely <strong>quality</strong> issues, which are being weeded out, but much more slowly than the promotion of OPenLearn warrants. (I know the content of the Languages units as that's my specialism and I'm afraid several of them have been cobbled together and I would not recommend the BBC linked to them, to take a leaf from the presentation.)</p>
<p>I think that focussing on providing a genuinely <strong>altruistic platform</strong> of Open resources would pay enormous dividends for the OU, and that there should be minimal 'pull'&nbsp; and 'sell' into Studying at the OU, within the arrangement of the OpenLearn materials - simply a link on each page. The quality of content and careful consideration of its purpose will be essential for&nbsp;the OU to&nbsp;follow through its mission in this space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks as if the 'merged' platform is going to be an enormous improvement; the enhanced use of Drupal/Moodle will be great, and forging strategic links with other institutions and platforms is clearly being addressed with great&nbsp;vigour.</p>

                   <p>This was a clearly structured and informative presentation about the mainstreaming of OpenLearn and OpenLearn Works. We were told that there is plenty going on which was likely to be beneficial to learners. There was also appropriate acknowledgement of potential challenges at the institutional level (in regard to the relationship with the BBC) and at the level at which learners were engaging (in regard to encouraging learners to take the step from informal and free learning to registration for a qualification). Some interesting solutions were proposed.</p>
<p>While there were concerns about mixing sales and education, the culture of the OU has long been multifaceted (eg there used to be sales of &lsquo;packs&rsquo; in the 1970s and 1980s) and, given the awareness of the dilemmas, it appears that it should be able to balance being both &lsquo;the home of free learning from the OU&rsquo; and a trading site.</p>        </div>
