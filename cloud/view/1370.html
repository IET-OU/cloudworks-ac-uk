        Richard Tomlin has been working with the OU for a couple of years to support developing strategies. Not such an uplifting start – &quot;we all need to pull together or drown together&quot; as we face the various economic changes. However we have got a good basis for getting into good shape for a difficult future. There are a couple of years grace before hardship hits the university sector as it helps address recession issues at the moment but will inevitably suffer as the government has to meet its bills for rescuing the economy.<br />
<br />
He also described the &quot;mode 1&quot; and &quot;mode 2&quot; research characterising mode 1 as traditional standing on the shoulders of giants research. Mode 2 as problem solving research integrating knowledge. The trouble with mode 2 is that it might not show up in citations, but could well be more effective in meeting needs. Need to meet both requirements mode 1 to show evidence, mode 2 to meet society's needs.<br />
<br />
The general approach to research he described as depending on the dissemination aspect to share it and apply it. The key therefore is to be able to tell the research &quot;story&quot;. Research itself does not help people but its use does. This will be enhanced if research as dialogue – with plans from the beginning to think of the context, dialogue and who to communicate with. Can learn from businesses (though not the banks these days!). This implies considering the synergy, alliances, and market for research.<br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/BCG-matrix.png" alt="BCG Matrix" /><br />
<br />
The classic business matrix of market share v market growth (the Boston Consulting Group matrix) could help us think in terms of cash cows, stars, dogs, and question areas. Market share can be seen in terms of – reputation, mature capacity, resource perhaps measured by funding, and with our current RAE income that we are overall in a strong position. Market growth itself does not translate so easily but was presented in terms of connectedness, convergence and sustainability (lower political risk).<br />
<ul>
	<li>Dog = kill it!</li>
	<li>Cash cow = consulting and short courses</li>
	<li>Star = agenda setting</li>
	<li>Question = high-quality BUT low impact (can it move to star!)</li>
</ul>
<br />
As a group we need a portfolio – earning to invest, allowing failure, partnering responsibility.<br />
<br />
A definition of a &quot;strategy&quot; as a means:<br />
<ul>
	<li>To achieve a common vision</li>
	<li>To communicate shared values</li>
	<li>To recognise different contributions</li>
	<li>To evaluate different ways of doing things</li>
</ul>
<br />
To move on need to reflect on:<br />
<ul>
	<li>How did we get here?</li>
	<li>Comparative advantages</li>
	<li>Distinctive competences/USPs </li>
</ul>
<br />
Where do we go from here?<br />
<ul>
	<li>Competitors</li>
	<li>Things to worry about</li>
	<li>Emerging themes</li>
</ul>
<br />
How can we make the most of what we have got?<br />

                   <p>
At the end of this session we were asked to discuss how we could achieve this in our groups of about 8 people around each table. 
</p>
<p>
As a group, my table was rather unimpressed. The talk by Richard Tomlinson had felt a tad patronising and all agreed that management needed to make these high levels decisions - none of us really knew what strategic direction the OU was aiming for.
</p>
<p>
However, as people talked, a lively discussion developed which seemed to be pretty-much on topic. For example, bidding for the big 2million£ bids by collaborating across faculties was mentioned as a desirable aim in the talk. However our table saw institutional barriers to this. These were that everybody is committed to 100% plus of their time, so any bidding work needs to be carried on in the margins of their time. The term &quot;micro-management&quot; was mentioned by one and several anecdotal stories were discussed in which a person had attempted to put together a big bid but had been unable to get it together in time because this work was not prioritised either for them or for the people they were trying to involve.
</p>
<p>
It was suggested that employees needed a percentage of their time set aside for this type of work, not only identifying and submitting the bids, but for networking with others so that they knew who had the appropriate expertise. 
</p>
<p>
Such a change in attitude needs to be implemented from above.

                   <p>Micromanagement can be distinguished from the mere tendency of a manager  to perform duties assigned to a subordinate. When a manager can perform  a worker's job more efficiently than the worker can, the result is  merely suboptimal management.</p>
