			<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<h2>From &lsquo;Why should I?&rsquo; to &lsquo;How could I?&rsquo; Innovating learning in the workplace through the implementation of open practice.</h2>
<p>Is it time to move from the traditional classroom and change the way that learning is approached in the workplace?&nbsp; Many organisations are looking to innovate workplace learning with a move to open practice and knowledge sharing within an extended network.&nbsp; This innovative approach brings with it new opportunities for learning and knowledge management but also new challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In implementing change the organisation needs to understand and value the range of explicit and tacit knowledge that exists within it.&nbsp; Clear communication is essential to ensure that all individuals can identify the core values of the organisation that they are a part of. There are many factors affecting motivation and job roles need to facilitate an approach to working which incorporates autonomy, allowing individuals to carry out tasks that align to both the organisational goals and their own personal objectives.</p>
<p>In exploring what motivates individuals to share knowledge there is a shift from the &lsquo;carrot and stick&rsquo; approach (Herzberg, 1968) with extrinsic rewards being offered to &lsquo;Motivation 3.0&rsquo; (Pink, 2009) focussing on intrinsic motivation.&nbsp; Pink describes individuals working on &lsquo;Goldilocks tasks&rsquo;, engaging autonomously in activities which offer challenges that are not excessive, or too small, but have just the right amount of reward versus anxiety therefore resulting in achieving the optimum working state of &lsquo;flow&rsquo; (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). When intrinsic motivation is combined with autonomy there is potential to become the director of your own success and fulfilment - an enticing prospect in the workplace.</p>
<p>In the same way that there are multiple factors affecting motivation, there are also personal factors driving the tools and methods of sharing that are preferred by individuals in facilitating confident and effective communication with an authentic voice.&nbsp; All knowledge sharing should not be approached in the same way and if tools and methods of sharing are imposed rather than chosen this resembles Maslow&rsquo;s statement &lsquo;I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail&rsquo; (Maslow, 1966).&nbsp; The common phrase &lsquo;Death by PowerPoint&rsquo; is indicative of a tool being laid at fault for the products that are created using it.&nbsp; The tools that are used should be transparent in their use and become part of an individual&rsquo;s learning and communication toolkit.&nbsp; A car would not dictate where it travelled so the tool should also be flexible.</p>
<p>This conference presentation follows the development of a multimedia presentation outlining the transition from &lsquo;Why should I? to &lsquo;How could I?&rsquo; in relation to innovating learning in the workplace and the personal experiences of the author along this journey.&nbsp; &nbsp;The proposal is that this artefact be used to generate discussion in this area and be used as the foundation for designing a blended learning programme to facilitate this change within organisations.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<h2>Conference Presentation text transcript (planned)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Slide 1:&nbsp; From &lsquo;Why Should I&rsquo;? To &lsquo;How Could I?&rsquo; Innovating learning in the workplace through the implementation of open practice.&nbsp;Catherine Dartnall, OU H818 Online Conference 9<sup style="line-height: 1.5em;">th</sup> February 2015 @CatDartnall</h2>
<p>Hi everyone, my name is Catherine Dartnall and I&rsquo;m an independent consultant working in workplace learning.</p>
<p>I started H818 with the aim of developing a multimedia artefact that would help me to generate discussion around the area of innovating learning in the workplace primarily to help organisations wanting to move from a traditional classroom based approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Slide 2:&nbsp; And so the journey&nbsp; begins.</h2>
<p>This has become much more of a personal journey for me than I first anticipated at the start of H818 . The phrase &lsquo;where life mirrors art&rsquo; springs to mind as the development of this project has become entwined in all aspects of my current work projects and my approach to both online and offline networking.</p>
<p>In fact I do believe that H818 is the module where we don&rsquo;t just &lsquo;talk the talk&rsquo; but we also &lsquo;walk the walk&rsquo;.</p>
<h2>Slide 3: The Organisation.</h2>
<p>The project has four distinct areas.&nbsp; The first being the organisation itself.</p>
<p>My project and I, visited Learning Technologies exhibition last month at London Olympia and we attended many seminars where organisations and consultants shared their stories of moving from training towards a culture of learning.</p>
<p>This included anecdotal &lsquo;horror stories&rsquo; of management viewing learning logs and exclaiming that those at the top of the list &lsquo;must have too much time on their hands&rsquo;. On the flip side others shared stories of giving employees access to a wide range of learning materials and encouraging them to use these to develop new skills to move into new roles in the organisation as part of a talent management and staff retention program.</p>
<h2>Slide 4:&nbsp; Culture and Job Design (Foss et al, 2009).</h2>
<p>Job design pays a large part and needs to allow for autonomy which in turn helps to increase motivation.</p>
<p>Just last week I identified that I am in fact a &lsquo;serial organisational networker&rsquo;.&nbsp; In my role as a consultant I have a lot of autonomy and also many opportunities to meet employees from across all business functions.&nbsp; I have received many comments over the years along the lines of that after a couple of weeks on a project I know more about the people that work there and their interests and skills than many internal colleagues do after working there for years!&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Slide 5: A Job for Life? The Social Contract. (Stodd, 2014).</h2>
<p>The phrase &lsquo;I&rsquo;m working on a project&hellip;&rsquo; became one of my favourite conversation starters at Learning Technologies where it was quite liberating to have a focus for my discussions and people seemed to be genuinely interested in chatting further (or they may just have been being polite ;) )</p>
<p>At Learning Technologies I jumped at the opportunity to be part of an hour long small group discussion with Julian Stodd, author of The Social Leadership Handbook &ndash; and yes, you&rsquo;ve guessed it, my project came too&hellip;</p>
<p>Listening to Julian talk was a &lsquo;breath of fresh air&rsquo; and I realised that there were many similarities in the way that I have been working mainly in a freelance contract capacity for the last 20 years and the way that organisations and employees will need to approach the way that they work moving forwards.</p>
<p>No longer do we have &lsquo;a job for life&rsquo; with a carriage clock at the end of our service and organisations and employees need to be behave in a more agile manner.&nbsp; I think that if employees realised that &lsquo;job security&rsquo; is perhaps more of a perception than a reality then they may be more inclined to take their future into their own hands, ensuring that they have a social community to support them in their move between multiple job roles.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is a &lsquo;win-win&rsquo; situation for an organisation as they not only get the benefit of the skills of an employee but also the skills and knowledge of the communities that they operate within.</p>
<p>So, thanks go to Julian Stodd who kindly gave me a copy of his book &ndash; this may however be due to the fact that I had so many questions that I really needed to go away and read it!</p>
<h2>Slide 6:&nbsp; What Motivates You?&nbsp; (Herzberg, 1968).</h2>
<p>Now, what motivates you?&nbsp; We are all different.&nbsp; This is the second focal point of the artefact.</p>
<p>I explored three types of motivation &ndash; intrinsic, extrinsic and introjection (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985).</p>
<p>Intrinsic motivation is linked to &lsquo;autonomy&rsquo; within a role with the ability to perform tasks in a way which the individual finds enjoyable and that aligns to their personal values.</p>
<p>Extrinsic motivation is linked to &lsquo;feedback&rsquo; such as bonuses or external praise &ndash; the classic example being &lsquo;The Carrot and Stick&rsquo; approach (Herzberg, 1968) which is renowned for being an unsuccessful long term strategy.</p>
<p>And Introjection is where an individual adopts the values of the organisation resulting in these internalised values having a similar effect to intrinsic personal values.</p>
<h2>Slide 7:&nbsp; Motivation comes with Autonomy, Purpose, Mastery.</h2>
<p>I know that I recognise my own motivating factors here as I always feel a strong need to have a sense of purpose and enjoy my autonomy and ability to progress towards achieving goals.</p>
<h2><strong>Slide 8:&nbsp; Flow &ndash; Get in &lsquo;The Zone&rsquo;. (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).</strong></h2>
<p>I often describe that I have &lsquo;a love of learning&rsquo; when on closer inspection this may actually be a &lsquo;love of flow&rsquo;.&nbsp; Flow is the optimum state we experience when we have a balance between stress and achievement &ndash; it&rsquo;s that fabulous feeling when we are &lsquo;in the zone&rsquo; and time simply flies while we are both engaged and absorbed in a task.</p>
<h2>Slide 9:&nbsp; &lsquo;Goldilocks&rsquo; Tasks. (Pink, 2009).</h2>
<p>Another serendipitous meeting that my project and I had was at a Learning and Development conference where I was invited to attend a sample workshop on motivation.&nbsp; The presenter strongly recommended that I explore Dan Pink&rsquo;s book &lsquo;Drive&rsquo; (you can see I&rsquo;m going to need to get a bigger book shelf or go digital before the end of this project&hellip;)</p>
<p>Pink talks about the concept of &lsquo;Motivation 3.0&rsquo; where individuals within organisations are able to work on &lsquo;Goldilocks Tasks&rsquo; &ndash; tasks that are not &lsquo;too easy&rsquo; or &lsquo;too hard&rsquo; but &lsquo;just right&rsquo; thus enabling employees to access a state of flow.</p>
<h2><strong>Slide 10:&nbsp; &ldquo;If you are working on something exciting that you really care about, you don&rsquo;t have to be pushed.&nbsp; The vision pulls you.&rdquo; (Image Steve Jobs).</strong></h2>
<p>This is a sentiment that is echoed here.&nbsp; If we can all find something in our work that ties in with our personal values and we are able to approach this work with autonomy this provides us with the necessary intrinsic motivation we need to drive forwards.</p>
<h2>Slide 11:&nbsp; From Push to Pull. (Brown and Hagel, 2005).</h2>
<p>This again links to Brown &amp; Hagel&rsquo;s &lsquo;From Push to Pull&rsquo;.&nbsp; Sometimes training is approached in a &lsquo;sheep dip&rsquo; fashion with individuals &lsquo;passing through&rsquo; courses and often coming out the other end with very little learning having taken place.&nbsp; The move from &lsquo;pushing&rsquo; information to employees towards generating a desire within employees to &lsquo;pull&rsquo; information and be in control of their learning takes a self-directed approach.</p>
<h2>Slide 12:&nbsp; Sharing Tacit versus Explicit Knowledge &ndash; Show Your Work (Bozarth (2014).</h2>
<p>This takes us to the 3<sup>rd</sup> element of the project &ndash; Knowledge.</p>
<p>Not all knowledge that needs to be shared is the same and therefore needs to be shared in different ways. And so I bought another book&hellip;.&nbsp; Jane Bozarth talks in a very practical way about the challenges of sharing tacit knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Show your Work, Bozarth discusses the use of annotation to explain the intricacies of tasks.&nbsp; Some examples of sharing tacit knowledge also bought to mind Yishay Mor&rsquo;s Design Narrative approach where the &lsquo;big picture&rsquo; is explained together with lessons learnt along the way and suggestions for amendment.</p>
<h2>Slide 13:&nbsp; Working out Loud Circles &ndash; Working Out Loud (Stepper, 2015) Blog/Book.</h2>
<p>John Stepper introduces the concept of &lsquo;Working out Loud Circles&rsquo; and how these can be introduced into organisations to enable individuals to learn to work and share in a collaborative way.</p>
<p>The draft outline of this project and the submission of TMA01 coincided with John Stepper holding a &lsquo;Working out Loud week&rsquo;.&nbsp; After submitting TMA01, I tweeted my mind map incorporating some references using the &lsquo;Working out Loud Week&rsquo; hashtag.&nbsp; In true open practice, or &lsquo;Working out Loud&rsquo;, style this was picked up by Stepper which has since led to both Twitter and email exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already introduced this concept into a work project and propose to experiment further by setting up my own open Working Out Loud Circle to see if this can help me to develop some personal work goals too.</p>
<p>Thanks again go to John Stepper for emailing a copy of his book which is expected to be launched in April.&nbsp; My own experience of being open to date has brought many nice surprises and a generosity of spirit that I didn&rsquo;t fully anticipate.</p>
<h2>Slide 14:&nbsp; What&rsquo;s Stopping You?</h2>
<p>So far we&rsquo;ve explored the Organisation, Motivation and Knowledge so what&rsquo;s stopping us now?</p>
<h2>Slide 15:&nbsp; Choose your Tools.</h2>
<p>Part 4, Tools.&nbsp; This was the part of the project that I always knew had the potential to de-rail it.&nbsp; So many tools and so little time.</p>
<p>This chaotic workshop is a pretty accurate representation of how I felt about my office during my quest to discover which tools would best fit the purpose.</p>
<p>First stop, free products.&nbsp; But are they really free?&nbsp; Licensing is very different for educational purposes compared to the requirements of a business or a consultant.&nbsp; I needed a licence that would allow me to create content for third-parties on a commercial basis.&nbsp; Bye bye, free versions in many cases.&nbsp; This commercial use also applies to my use of images and music.</p>
<p>I also felt that the tools that I used should be seamless and allow me to create an artefact that was sufficiently polished in presentation but was still an authentic representation of my work.</p>
<h2>Slide 16:&nbsp; Universal Design for Learning (Chrissie Butler&rsquo;s Passonable Blog, 2015).</h2>
<p>Accessibility was also an essential factor in choosing the right tools for the job.&nbsp; Many tools rely heavily on visuals, or audio with limited options to be inclusive.</p>
<p>The very tool which I began the project not wanting to use had many of the features that I was looking for right in front of me.&nbsp; PowerPoint - with built-in options for using captions, alt-text and screen readers also being able to access the notes area.</p>
<p>I wanted the artefact to be non-linear in its design, accessible and to be supported on multiple devices.&nbsp; Again, at Learning Technologies, I spoke with Adobe about my project and also chatted to some e-learning designers and found that as Adobe Presenter 10 enabled me to use PowerPoint in the background this would really help with the learning curve.&nbsp; It also met the requirements of my brief.&nbsp; Result.</p>
<p>This experience is something that I will take with me into my future workshops in this area to generate awareness that many resources that are created have the potential to exclude participants by the nature of their design.</p>
<h2>Slide 17:&nbsp; Draft front screen view of project artefact.</h2>
<p>So, thanks to everyone&rsquo;s help both inside and outside of H818, this is it, the first draft screen from Adobe Presenter of my multi-media artefact which is still very much a work in progress.&nbsp; The images represent the four areas of my project:</p>
<p>Organisation</p>
<p>Motivation</p>
<p>Knowledge</p>
<p>Skills.</p>
<p>My proposal is that behind each one of these areas will be a menu linking to a variety of resources that expand upon my research into this area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently working on a website that will be a professional portfolio and when this artefact is in a fit state to be displayed publicly then this will be it&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>So what next?&nbsp;&nbsp; The way that this project is expanding, I&rsquo;m sure that before long I will be working on the screenplay for &lsquo;H818 &ndash; The Movie&rsquo;.&nbsp; So, if anyone has any preferences as to which famous Hollywood Star will play them in the big screen version, please get in touch :)</p>

                   <p>From reading your abstract I hope that this could apply to my own context, as a teacher in a school. We are actively encouraged to think about 'How could I' instead of 'Why should I' and I will be interested to see what lessons I could learn here.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Great title by the way. &nbsp;This has some connections with my presentation in particular why should people share. &nbsp;I am beginning to feel that there are nautural sharings roles that people adopt. &nbsp;A bit like a knowledge sharing equivilent of Belbin for team members. &nbsp;I guess the nearest well known classification might be the Tipping Point ideas, &nbsp;Mavens etc. &nbsp;If its like Belbin then people will naturally take one sharing role but may be encouraged to take others. &nbsp;Looking forward to the presentation. &nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Catherine - good informative poster regarding your slot at conference. From your abstract I see you intend to take the viewer on a journey from Why should I to how could I in relation to innovating in the workplace. &nbsp;An informative message that encourages thinking. &nbsp;In some ways, although a different topic and theme, my presentation mirrors a similar journey in that I intend to create thinking about how jargon affects participants in the form of inclusion by awareness. &nbsp;In my case why should I and how could I do things differently when speaking in work aid incusion.</p>
<p>Look forward to seeing the presentation.</p>

                   <p>Thanks for your feedback everyone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Marese - &nbsp;it is interesting to think about it from the 'How could I? angle rather than just being 'told' what to do to meet an objective/target. &nbsp;I think that the element of choice is really important.</p>
<p>Hi Louise - thanks for your kind comments about the project title :) Thanks for the links to Belbin too. &nbsp;I can see how the motivation element of the project links to the&nbsp;different roles that you/Belbin mention, so there may be a 'type' of open practitioner but this extends further &nbsp;to the choice of tools that each practitioner uses to facilitate their sharing. &nbsp;I'm wondering if the choice of tool may be more personal and more difficult to categorise? &nbsp;Maybe groups of tools relate to different groups of people. &nbsp;Definitely one to think about. &nbsp;Thanks again.</p>
<p>Thanks Sheila - I'm glad that you could see the story about the journey from 'Why should I?' to 'How could I?' from my poster. &nbsp;I love the use of storytelling in learning and agree that is important to be able to provoke thought on a topic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing everyone's conference presentations too - not long now!</p>        </div>

                   <p>It's all about motivation right?! I really love this approach Catherine, and I know you have been on an interesting and reflective journey throughout this project. I am really looking forward to hearing about your personal journey, as there are so many things that I have already learnt from you, and I do believe that your final product will help others to think about the 'how'. The choice of tools to use is definitely a personal thing, and there are many questions about how that personal choice may then affect the interaction that comes about. It's abit like choosing a phone or a laptop, or a presentation tool (I love powerpoint by the way, and don't tell anyone, but I also love my windows laptop). Therefore there is something about each of sharing the 'hows' that will maybe enable others to feel there are lots of options, rather than being forced into doing something. After all, I think its a deep seated human trait that none of us like doing what we are told to do! I also think that sharing your personal story, could help facilitate change for others. There is a sense of authenticity in knowing that the person who is helping you change, has also experienced similar journeys. Looking forward to it!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Catherine</p>
<p>Your opening question is really thought provoking and I do think the time is right for organisations to rethink the way learning is framed. The culture change required from organisations is significant especially large corporates with embedded L&amp;D teams who have a vested interest in keeping things the way they are. I guess there is also a need for employees to take ownership for their own development too? I like very much that you are creating an artefact to generate the discussion around the changing nature of workplace learning and I love that you are using your own experience too - I imagine this will be very powerful.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I kind of wish someone had taken some of my former managers on this journey. I might have a much shorter CV. I'm wondering if there might be something in your presentation for me too. In the past I have worked training teachers and providing language support classes for private and public organizations. How might asking "how?" affect my practice in this role? Or might I be out of a job as organizations move to open practice and knowledge sharing? How might I adapt my practice to this new learning environment? You certainly have piqued my interest!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Catherine,</p>
<p>Your poster is great,I know it will have taken a long time to prepare. Your abstract is so interesting and relevant for me.. In my setting we are subject to the 'stick' dressed up as a carrot! Online learning and OER were imposed on us to help with&nbsp;attendance&nbsp;figures and compliance . It would be really interesting to observe the differing quality of the online&nbsp;education depending on the intrinsic or extrinsic will of the teachers?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks Sam. &nbsp;Motivation is definitely a key factor and, as you say, if we are told how we are going to do everything and what tools we have to use this impacts on our autonomy and impacts our motivation. &nbsp;The tools shape the way that we represent ourselves online and I know from my own personal experience that if the tool isn't working for me and I don't feel that the end result is an authentic representation then it's 'teddies out of the pram' and back to the drawing board :) &nbsp;Both frustrating and time consuming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do feel that I have 'walked the walk' during this project and I know that this will enable me to support and understand others who choose to move towards being more open. &nbsp;Getting there...</p>

                   <p>Hi Alison. &nbsp;Thanks for your feedback. &nbsp;I was at Learning Technologies Exhibition this week at London Olympia and there was a lot of discussion about the current and future role of L&amp;D. &nbsp;I spoke to Julian Stodd at the exhibition who was talking about there being no 'jobs for life' anymore and that workers would become increasingly mobile, moving between organisations, which increases the value of communities of learning. &nbsp;I caught the recording of the conference keynote from Sugata Mitra which was based on 'The Future of Learning' - here is the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SlXHZKC3Rg&nbsp;&nbsp; He talks about asking a group of children what learning meant to them and showed a Wordle. &nbsp;The interesting point was that the word 'teacher' or 'teaching' was missing completely. &nbsp;This led to discussion of the evolution of the horse drawn carriage to the first sit-on carriage/car - this time the horse man had been written out of the picture. &nbsp;Soon we will have driver-less cars. &nbsp;Self-directed learning is becoming an increasingly essential skill to have but isn't something that happens over night or I think that we can be told to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I too hope that telling the story of my own journey and experience helps to put an authentic edge into the project. &nbsp;Thanks again.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Hugo. &nbsp;Thanks for your comments on my poster - I too loved the background on yours that tied in wonderfully with your Fine Arts theme :)</p>
<p>I suppose what we are talking about here is the motivation of the organisation in encouraging knowledge sharing. &nbsp;There has to be an element of trust. &nbsp;That said, I think that there are so many changes ahead and happening already that we all have to be prepared to be flexible. &nbsp;Surely by working in communities and sharing openly this gives us a window to more opportunities and support rather than clinging to just one life raft...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just thoughts...</p>

                   <p>Hi Cath</p>
<p>Yes, the good old 'carrot and stick' :) &nbsp;As Sam said, we all like to have choices and when we feel that these are taken away from us this reduces our motivation. &nbsp;My view is that it would be much more productive for an organisation to communicate its core values and objectives to staff and then enable and support staff in making their own decisions about what they can do to achieve these. &nbsp;This increases intrinsic motivation and can improve feelings of job satisfaction and self worth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that when I was teaching I would put a huge amount of work into the resources that I used with my groups as my own intrinsic motivation was to engage the students the best way that I possibly could. &nbsp;To make a difference. &nbsp;There was a lot of time spent in linking to their own interests, contexts and current events. &nbsp;Due to the autonomy I was given I was able to choose my own approach with my reward being increased engagement within lessons which, as a tutor, is always great to see :)</p>
<p>Thanks too for your comments on my poster. &nbsp;It probably took me about 2 days but that included learning the software, storyboarding and creating two versions. &nbsp;If I was going to do it now it would take me less time. &nbsp;It was a good experience though. &nbsp;Thanks for the feedback.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Catherine</p>
<p>Thanks for the link to Sugata Mitra's keynote speech. Loved the words collected from the kids - definitely the future. I think there is still some work to do in some workplaces on generating individual ownership for learning. I came out of a meeting about performance reviews/appraisals recently held with a big company knowing that their culture is still very much based around an expectation that L&amp;D will provide a 'training solution' for identified training needs. This culture is being protected by both the employees and the L&amp;D department. I feel that in cases like this the change of culture may well come from the 'bottom up' ie employess themselves developing their knowledge in different ways other than by attending a training course. I think there is much of this happening already but it is just not recognised as learning</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>Thanks to everyone who commented on my presentation and for Simon for uploading the comments. I know I was able to answer a couple of direct questions on the day but have added some comments to the discussion below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interesting contrast between the attitudes some organisations have to training/learning - <em>I think that this is really important. &nbsp;If the organisation has a committment to a learning culture and open practice then this would surely link to how employee development is approached together with job design and expectation setting at the recruitment stage too? &nbsp;</em></li>
<li>Research shows that successful PMs have widest networks - <em>maybe there is a link between networking and open practice leading to gaining more recognition and this could give access to enhanced job opportunities?</em></li>
<li>Flow is a lovely viseral approach very linked to gaming - <em>I love flow! &nbsp;And so addictive I think. &nbsp;I am really interested in how individuals can achieve a state of flow within the workplace - this really has to be one of those 'win-win' situations for both the organisation and the employee.</em></li>
<li>user generated content - related there? - <em>This all definitely links with user generated content. &nbsp;This is where the 'tools' part comes in though - without the skills and training then creating user generated content has a time implication that is often stated as a barrier within the workplace. &nbsp;I would like to see organisations adopt a 'toolkit' approach where everyone has access to a range of tools that they can use to create content and are supported in gaining the skills to use these efficiently for their own aims.<br /></em></li>
<li>So many employees are on workshops because they've been sent by their manager to 'fix' a problem. So frustrating for them...and the facilitator - <em>Definitely a 'Why Should I?' &nbsp;scenario that you describe. &nbsp;My view is that the motivation should precede any workshop, once we move from 'Why Should I?' then 'How Could I?' is likely to be received more positively.</em></li>
<li>Do you think knowledge management and learning is coming together? - <em>I think I answered this one in the session. I sometimes avoid using the term 'Knowledge Management' as I think that employees in the workplace could see this as having a bias towards the needs of the organisation and then we are back to the 'Why Should I?' or 'What's in it for me?' scenario. &nbsp;Of course it is really important for an organisation to be able to ensure continuity by having access to both the explicit and tacit knowledge required to fulfil the roles within an organisation but there is also a benefit to the employee in developing their own skill set by learning from others both inside and outside the organisation. &nbsp;I linked this in the conference to Julian Stodd's 'The Social Contract' where employers benefit from the extended networks of an employee.</em></li>
<li>A huge bonus of online learning is the ability to interact with original authors, profs etc - which would never happen in a F2F environment - <em>I agree, this is so powerful. &nbsp;</em></li>
<li>it is a struggle to find quality free tools - <em>Definitely one of the times that open practice comes in useful in getting recommendations and tips from others. &nbsp;I'm sure that many of you will have seen Jane Hart's list of tools that she produces at the Centre for Learning and Performance Technologies&nbsp;http://c4lpt.co.uk/directory-of-learning-performance-tools/ - a fantastic list but it is still great to get some first hand tips from peers too. &nbsp;In my project Sam Marks was able to point me in the direction of Wondershare, amongst many others and I gained lots of tips from everyone in using Prezi, Powtoon etc.</em></li>
<li>and images - <em>Images too, yes. &nbsp;Favourites are currently www.pixabay.com and www.morguefile.com. &nbsp;Flickr too, although attribution required under CC. &nbsp;I've started creating a bank of non attribution images and music, just on my laptop, but it makes life so much easier :)</em></li>
<li>There is a massive range of free software out there, but using commercially can be tricky as Catherine says - <em>always worth checking the terms of the licence agreement</em></li>
<li>I love how much networking you have done. You are a great example of 'living H818' Very impressive - <em>Thank you for your kind comments. &nbsp;This was the main focus of my project as I wanted to understand the motivation for 'Why Should I?' in relation to open practice. &nbsp;I hope that my experiences will help me to support others in future. &nbsp;Plus, I had lots of fun too :)</em></li>
<li>I think there are lots of people in my organisation who have not got further than why should I - <em>I can understand this. &nbsp;Organisational culture and motivation could possibly be explored further here?</em></li>
<li>freelance/consultant sharing - is this risky?<br />Sharing and getting paid - are they mutually exclusive - <em>I know, this is a tricky one. &nbsp;I'm going to explore with 'degrees of openness' and then reflect upon what works best for me in my situation. &nbsp;</em></li>
<li>Very risky, people can 'steal' ideas and package them as their own. The trick is to share concepts not fully developed 'products' -&nbsp;<em>Very valid comment. &nbsp;I have thought about this in relation to my final proposed artefact and will probably do just as you describe here. &nbsp;Thank you.</em></li>
<li>I share core material with lots of trusted associates and they share back. It can be very rewarding -<em> I know, sometimes the rewards outweigh the risks but there is definitely a balancing act. &nbsp;I think the key word you use here is trust.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks everyone for a great conference experience. &nbsp;I enjoyed watching all of your presentations too :)</p>        </div>
