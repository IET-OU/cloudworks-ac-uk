<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; The Ed Techie; IRRODL; Kellogg; Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>EdSurge considers the future for edX, which has been less commercial/industry-facing than rivals Coursera and Udacity.&nbsp; The provider has over 90 partner institutions, with close to a third now approaching the end of their three-year contracts, and CEO Anant Agawal is conscious of the costs of producing and supporting MOOCs.&nbsp; He wants <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-11-23-edx-buckles-down-to-offer-credit-for-moocs" rel="nofollow">edX 2.0</a> to mark a &ldquo;transition from a &lsquo;curiosity&rsquo; platform to an essential pathway for learners in their education&rdquo;.&nbsp; Hence the article describes plans for a Global Freshman Academy, Alternative Credit Project and a now Micromasters.</p>
<p>Martin Weller predicts that <a href="http://blog.edtechie.net/mooc/2016-the-year-of-mooc-hard-questions/" rel="nofollow">2016 will be (another) year of the MOOC</a>, but that some hard questions will need answering.&nbsp; He suggests five areas will lead to &ldquo;an investment rethink&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MOOC education won&rsquo;t be as cheap for learners as envisaged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Producing MOOCs is expensive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOOCs are usually not effective recruitment avenues for universities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOOCs are not democratising education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enrolments for repeat presentations will drop after the initial burst of enthusiasts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One problem with session based MOOCs can be gaining access to materials during the &lsquo;closed&rsquo; period (and sometimes not knowing when or if a course would be offered again).&nbsp; Class Central reports that 55% of all courses listed on its aggregator site do not have an upcoming start date and that around 300 Coursera and 180 edX <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/mooc-trends-2015-rise-self-paced-courses/" rel="nofollow">MOOCs are now on-demand/self-paced</a>.&nbsp; However, students report that deadlines are a motivating factor and that forums and peer grading/commentary often do not work well with self-pacing.</p>

<p><strong>Horizon Scanning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; Will Woods; TechCrunch; Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>The 2016 NMC/EDUCAUSE Horizon Project HE expert panel has just selected the six key trends (e.g. measuring learning), six significant challenges (e.g. balancing our connected and unconnected lives) and six important developments in ed-tech (e.g. learning analytics &amp; adaptive learning) that will be featured in next February&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nmc.org/nmc-horizon-news/submit-your-projects-2016-nmc-horizon-higher-ed" rel="nofollow">NMC Horizon Report</a>.&nbsp; Now NMC is interested in learning about any kind of research, pilot programs, innovative projects, or faculty work happening at your institution or organization in any of the areas identified, ideally by 4 Jan 16.</p>
<p>Also just out is the OU/SRI <a href="http://proxima.iet.open.ac.uk/public/innovating_pedagogy_2015.pdf" rel="nofollow">Innovating Pedagogy 2015 Report</a> and, although this has a pedagogic focus rather than the technology drivers of NMC, there are many areas of overlap such as: <em>Blending Formal &amp; Informal Learning &ndash; Crossover Learning &ndash; Incidental Learning;</em> and <em>Learning Analytics &amp; Adaptive Learning &ndash; Adaptive Teaching &ndash; Analytics of Emotions.</em>&nbsp; Also interesting is the ebb and flow of the themes in Innovating Pedagogy over its four-year life (p7), with <em>Extension</em> and <em>Personalisation</em> trending this year while <em>Scale</em> has cooled.</p>
<p>There are also some remarkably close overlaps between some of Innovating Pedagogy&rsquo;s themes and those envisaged by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/28/how-education-will-be-smarter-less-intrusive-and-able-to-respond-to-how-you-feel/" rel="nofollow">Pearson&rsquo;s Amar Kumar</a>, who believes we are, &ldquo;on the verge of a tide of smarter innovation&rdquo; that will include technology that learns from learners, adapts to how students feel and provides invisible, less intrusive assessment.</p>

<p><strong>How Online College Classes Adversely Affect Student Performance</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; The Conversation]</em></p>
<p>Researchers from Stanford and Harvard examined data from DeVry University to investigate <a href="http://cepa.stanford.edu/content/changing-distributions-how-online-college-classes-alter-student-and-professor-performance#.Vif-lrB2lFs.twitter" rel="nofollow">the effects of online HE courses on student performance</a>.&nbsp; The average DeVry student takes two-thirds of their courses online and the study covers 230,000 students across an average of 10 courses each over four years.&nbsp; The authors found that, on average, online course-taking reduced student learning by one-third to one-quarter of a standard deviation compared to conventional F2F classes. &nbsp;They also claim that taking a course online also reduces student learning in future courses and persistence in college.&nbsp; They speculate that this may be partly attributable to higher levels of procrastination by online students, particularly those who are lower-performing.</p>
<p>Perhaps <a href="http://www.psmag.com/nature-and-technology/theres-no-substitute-for-in-person-lectures" rel="nofollow">video lectures</a> are the answer?&nbsp; Not according to researchers from the University of British Columbia, who found that students (<em>N=</em>276) who watched a videotaped lecture recalled less of the material, and felt less engaged in the subject, than they did after sitting through a similar live lesson.&nbsp; However, this was not due to inattentiveness because students in a control group reported roughly equal amounts of mind-wandering during the two lessons.&nbsp; For students watching the video lecture, &ldquo;memory declined as mind-wandering increased&rdquo; but this was not true of the students watching the lecture live, suggesting that memory &ldquo;is more sensitive to shifts in attention when the material is delivered online.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Australian researchers believe online courses <em>can</em> work if designed in the right way, finding that students who have access to <a href="https://theconversation.com/online-learning-can-work-if-universities-just-rethink-the-design-of-their-courses-50848" rel="nofollow">better designed, and more personalised, courses</a> tend to have higher engagement and better outcomes.&nbsp; For example, a 2013 study of 1,200 engineering students showed that the introduction of measures including staff development, adaptive online tutorials and a community portal reduced failure rates from 31% to 7% between 2007 and 2011.&nbsp; Adaptive tutorials also improved student performance on a medical degree course by 56% on standard exam scores.</p>
