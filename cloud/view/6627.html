        <p>Directions to EIC: <a href="http://www.uwe.ac.uk/eic/eicPhysical.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.uwe.ac.uk/eic/eicPhysical.shtml</a></p>
<p>Good to see you all second meeting and hear you research ideas. Don't forget to send a  precise of these research ideas to me so I can include them in the BRILLE  Business Plan.<br /><br />We agreed to hold the next SIG on Monday 17th Dec 1pm EIC  Seminar Space. Have a few lines prepared on research method to investigate your  chosen problem. We will discuss this more in session and make suggestions for  those new to research.</p>
<p>I was asked to provide slides for my lecture on  Digital Literacy given to 3rd Year Initial Teacher Education UGs, I sent these but to you but they are embedded below. Also, here is the pointer to my paper exploring HE student use of mobile phone  on and off campus: <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/redir.aspx?C=r5tgxI7OcE6eOnxyAeJwtd-6JZciks9IXe00Z_WI8ZpnTbk7f2wUPrlQ0wSWds_KlK3CcGOdrV8.&URL=http://tinyurl.com/cva7eu5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/cva7eu5</a> comments welcome</p>
<h2>What methods? New report that may be helpful in advance of next SIG meeting</h2>
<p>This report is relevant to next meeting SIG Wednesday 17th Dec 1pm EIC (and useful for many a lit review). I was one of the researchers surveyed for the report!:</p>
<p>Academic research in education, technology and media: mapping the field <a href="http://newmediaresearch.educ.monash.edu.au/lnmrg/article/academic-research-education-technology-and-media-mapping-field" rel="nofollow">http://newmediaresearch.educ.monash.edu.au/lnmrg/article/academic-research-education-technology-and-media-mapping-field</a></p>
<p>Based on survey data from 462 &lsquo;research active&rsquo; academic researchers this new research report examines the state of academic research in educational technology and educational media. The report focuses on three broad research questions: (i) who is conducting research in the area of education, technology and media; (ii) what methods (or kinds of methods) of data collection and analysis are privileged in this research; and (iii) what is the use of theory in shaping the kind of research work that gets done? The findings highlight a number of ways in which academic research in education, technology and media can be improved as it becomes an increasingly important area of academic study.</p>
<h2>Also, just in case you don't know UWE have access to Sage Research Methods</h2>
<p>"Sage Research Methods allows you to explore methods and concepts to design research projects, understand  a particular method, and write up research. For further explanation of this useful resource, please consult the brief Sage Research Methods guide"</p>
<p><a href="http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/library/usingthelibrary/researchers/researchmethodologies.aspx " rel="nofollow">http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/library/usingthelibrary/researchers/researchmethodologies.aspx </a></p>
<p>(I had to log in via local OpenAthens!)</p>
<h2>UWE  has purchased a Blackboard Mobile Learn licence</h2>
<p>So students do not have to pay  for the app. Students just need to search for Blackboard Mobile Learn in their  app store.</p>
<p>We  have some basic guidance on the Blackboard support website on what can be done  within the app: <a href="http://info.uwe.ac.uk/online/blackboard/students/guides/mobile/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://info.uwe.ac.uk/online/blackboard/students/guides/mobile/default.asp</a></p>
<h2>Nesta Report on ICTand Learning now out</h2>
<p>This report sets out where proof,  promise and potential lie for<br />technology in education. It then identifies  the contextual factors and actions needed to ensure current and  future opportunities for school children to take full advantage of  technology for learning.<br /><a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/library/documents/DecodingLearningReport.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nesta.org.uk/library/documents/DecodingLearningReport.pdf</a></p>
<p>See also: Technology has the power to transform schools, claims the report, but costly hi-tech kit lies unused in schools <br /><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-20348322 " rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-20348322 </a></p>

<h2>The NMC Horizon Report 2012 for Higher Education Edition</h2>
<p>Six emerging technologies are identified. This year&rsquo;s <em>NMC</em> <em>Horizon Report</em> identifies mobile apps and tablet <a href="http://www.nmc.org/publications/horizon-report-2012-higher-ed-edition" rel="nofollow">computing</a> as technologies expected to enter mainstream use in the first horizon of one year or less. Game-based learning and learning analytics are seen in the second horizon of two to three years; gesture-based computing and the Internet of Things are seen emerging in the third horizon of four to five years.  BRILLE&rsquo;s John Cook serves on the Advisory Board for this report. Two key trends that John pushed for, and that are included, are: 1. People expect to be able to work, learn, and study whenever and wherever they want to. 2. The world of work is increasingly collaborative, driving changes in the way student projects are structured. The report is available from here: <a href="http://bit.ly/vLD2fr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/vLD2fr</a></p>
