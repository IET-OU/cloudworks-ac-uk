    <div class="user-entry">

        <p>Back in 2003-04 before the term "social software" meant <em>Facebook</em> Clay Shirkey published two articles which are as germane to the design and function of social software (including Cloudworks) today as they were when he published them. I wonder how many software designers have actually read these.</p>
<p>Nowadays we hear less about 'flame wars' (and that may just be me not listening) but I think they're still there in a different form and still a menace. I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts about the two articles I summarise below.</p>
<h2><a title="External link to http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_user.html" href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_user.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Group as User: Flaming and the Design of Social Software </a></h2>
<blockquote>First published November 5, 2004 on the "Networks, Economics, and Culture" mailing list.<br /></blockquote>
<p>The article should be a <em>must read</em> for all web application developers concerned with user interaction. Shirkey deals with <strong>Learning From Flame Wars</strong> &mdash; I love the comment :</p>
<blockquote>"You couldn't go through the code of the Mailman mailing list tool, say, and find the comment that reads "The next subroutine ensures that misunderstandings between users will be amplified, leading to name-calling and vitriol." Yet the software, when adopted, will frequently produce just that outcome. "</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and he looks at <strong>Netiquette</strong> and why it almost always fails (the people who needed to use it most didn't) and <strong>the Tragedy of the Conversational Commons</strong> together with how Slashdot in particular addresses these issues.</p>
<dl><dt>Verdict: </dt><dd>Insightful and so very very applicable.</dd></dl>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a title="External link to http://shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html" href="http://shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A Group Is Its Own Worst Enemy</a></h2>
<blockquote>Published July 1, 2003 on the "Networks, Economics, and Culture" mailing list. This is a lightly edited version of the keynote I gave on Social Software at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology conference in Santa Clara on April 24, 2003<br /></blockquote>
<p>Again, this is packed with good sense. Some excerpts :</p>
<h3>Three Things to Accept:</h3>
<ol>
<li> Of the things you have to accept, the first is that you cannot completely separate technical and social issues.</li>
<li> The second thing you have to accept: Members are different than users. A pattern will arise in which there is some group of users that cares more than average about the integrity and success of the group as a whole. And that becomes your core group, Art Kleiner's phrase for "the group within the group that matters most."</li>
<li> The third thing you need to accept: The core group has rights that trump individual rights in some situations.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Four Things to Design For</h3>
<ol>
<li> If you were going to build a piece of social software to support large and long-lived groups, what would you design for? The first thing you would design for is handles the user can invest in.</li>
<li> Second, you have to design a way for there to be members in good standing. Have to design some way in which good works get recognized. The minimal way is, posts appear with identity. You can do more sophisticated things like having formal karma or "member since."</li>
<li> Three, you need barriers to participation.There needs to be some kind of segmentation of capabilities. The user of social software is the group, and ease of use should be for the group. If the ease of use is only calculated from the user's point of view, it will be difficult to defend the group from the "group is its own worst enemy" style attacks from within.</li>
<li> And, finally, you have to find a way to spare the group from scale. Scale alone kills conversations, because conversations require dense two-way conversations. In conversational contexts, Metcalfe's law is a drag. The fact that the amount of two-way connections you have to support goes up with the square of the users means that the density of conversation falls off very fast as the system scales even a little bit. You have to have some way to let users hang onto the less is more pattern, in order to keep associated with one another. </li>
