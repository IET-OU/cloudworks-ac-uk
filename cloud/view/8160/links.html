        <h1 dir="ltr">Summary</h1>
<p dir="ltr">I am use to problem solving techniques having used them in corporate communications and training for some 25 years. The contrast between higher education and learning and development always fascinates me - they are so different. Simply put the L&amp;D drive is usually to deliver more for less and to measure and justify the spend. It has to work and shown to work, saving money and improving results on previous approaches, so typically reducing and eliminating the cost of travel, overnights and being away from work. There will be a budget, schedule and brief. There will be a team of participants, a key player at the client end with their colleagues, support and their own line manager/director. The agency team will in all likelihood involve six or more people: project manager, learning design, subject matter expert, writer, designer, programme and an assortment of graphics designers, visualizers and testers. This seems to be in sharp contrast where those in education have no budget, no time and little support and in the old model of the lone teacher and their class have to come up with everything on their own, plan and create in their own time and often have systems and kit foistered on them.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week I looked at the time allocated to the OLDS MOOC by the OLDS MOOC team and quickly learnt to DOUBLE the time that would be required. And in the two most busy weeks I had working on Personas and Design I spent 12-16 hours on the reading, the activities themselves and maintaining contact with a fledgling group. This kind of commitment became unsustainable as I needed increasingly to commit this time to other projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I wonder if young people should start work part time at 14 as they did 100 years ago, and do so with a close, online support. They will increasingly benefit from sophisticated learning systems and catalogues and be able to apply what they learn.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Context</h1>
<p dir="ltr">What were the conditions and constraints in which your design experiment was situated?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Online, for me this mean STANDING at the dining room table. This is my office. After some Horizon programme on health I now stand all day. Works for me, in fact I find I am more alert and have had no back or no strain since &hellip; though the ball of my left foot doesn&rsquo;t like it and I&rsquo;ve worn through the slippers my daughter bought me for my birthday. This is context for me. The dog watches me all day expecting to me taken for a work. The &lsquo;footfall&rsquo; is such morning and later afternoon that I am disturbed by family members at meal time. Come to think of it, I prepare these meals so that&rsquo;s another period of disruption to me day. 4 x 3 hours across the day is how I try to operate. That is before breakfast, after breakfast, after lunch and after dinner.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I don&rsquo;t recommend it. In the past I have walked up the road or driven a few miles to an office. In future I would hope at least to have an office &lsquo;down the garden&rsquo;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This context has the potential to be highly disrupted as the ebb and flow of family life runs through the house - teenage children at, or not at school and my wife who also works from home even more stressed when she has no work than when she does. When she has work lucky her enters her study and is only ever seen at meal times &hellip; and perhaps if either she wakes me late at night, or I wake her early in the morning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the context. I could relate this to years in various production and agency offices working on linear then, as we quaintly called it &lsquo;non-linear&rsquo; interactive training. More recently experience of the 9 to 5 has been blissful as a team of 8 on a project in an office of 50 or so hunker down collectively to the task in hand. In this context an e-learning project, like producing TV and video (and film) where I have experience, runs almost like clockwork. I say almost because occasionally there is an overnighter or weekend panic. &nbsp;I have a dream context it would be the new Google-plex, especially with the opportunity to camp out on the roof if you&rsquo;ve got a deadline and would prefer to hang out around the office.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Material</h2>
<p dir="ltr">What are the spatial characteristics of the settings? What tools and resources are available to protagonists?</p>
<p dir="ltr">See above. Kit is one desktop, two laptops and an iPad.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A scanner and digital camera.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Art materials. A print on the wall is taken down in the morning and replaced with a white board. I resist the guitar, TV and piano.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Though there is a game of chess in permanent suspended animation between my son and I. The greater distractions are the ability and desire to read niche books and download papers before I add a fullstop to the end of a sentence</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is my office. I don&rsquo;t know what others tools and constraints others have.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cloudscape is the VLE, it the blog, is our social network and ought to be our singular means of communication. We are all used to and happy with other platforms. To be this comfortable online we have learnt to make our favourite tools sing. I feel as if I have spent over a decade learning the flute, guitar and piano to play in an orchestra and have been told to drop these to play an accordion in a brass band.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Social</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Who are the protagonists, what are the relationships between them, and what are the social and institutional configurations in which they operate?</p>
<p dir="ltr">I am used to working online. In 1999 I was in touch with a writers group through my blog that ran &lsquo;til 2004. Our office was a cloud somewhere above the North Atlantic that shifted as other members moved in turn to Japan, then South America, Scotland &hellip; then back to North America. Even in an office I work online, typically using a wiki like collaborative e-learning design/build platform. This is genius. Each project may have between 5 minimum and 8 people on it - more where assistance is required or the deadline gets close - which are also points where around the office people start to gather to meet and those working from home come in. I&rsquo;ve done this too as a postgrad student - I forget which MAODE module but six of eight gelled on a two work collaborative project between New Zealand, Thailand, Germany and the UK. In the OLD MOOC one, then two then occasionally, perhaps three of us worked on the same project. It was touch and go and after five weeks it fizzled because the &lsquo;team leader&rsquo; as it were who had been instrumental in galvinising a couple of us to join in felt they could no longer do it. Perhaps she&rsquo;d got the answers she needed. I do rather think that a couple of meetings and a solution was in place &hellip; find the right person to ask how? and you take their response on faith and you are done without having to plan the construction of the Empire State Building. Designing a one hour e-learning intro to multimedia is vastly different to designing a 60 credit MBA module on creative problem solving. I don&rsquo;t even think they compare if we were to use the metaphor of architecture (Christopher Alexander, 1970). One was a few bricks to make an outdoor BBQ, while the other is a self-build six bedroom house. (with indoor swimming pool).</p>
<p dir="ltr">I have written screenplays and TV &hellip; no more credits than a short on Channel 4. I hear &lsquo;protagonist&rsquo; and I need the antagonist and an entire family of other characters. Narrative is driven by conflict. This is where the metaphor or structure is weak - there should be no conflict where there is collaboration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If there were to be an &lsquo;antagonist&rsquo; then it would be Cloudworks. It has a character of its own which I&rsquo;m afraid I would described as doomed - rather like the Titanic. There was conflict in this narrative and it was always with the platform. Importantly the other characters, the players were the extraordinary array of character actors, the big name e-learning academics who have been schedule in for a star turn each week. They are players in this performance &hellip; as they led each week, and happily shared thoughts with us directly. Indeed, contact with the gliteratti of e-learning who for an MAODE student have been largely noticeable by their absence during the last three years - figure heads while moderator/facilitator tutors with very varied interest guide the students through &hellip; but I&rsquo;m wandering onto a different stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As players, these e-learning top guns, perhaps with a vested and professional and academic interest in how the MOOC plays out have been exception - all educators who, escaping the restrictions of distance and online learning, would surely enjoy and gain from &lsquo;teaching&rsquo; by giving lectures from time to time, but more importantly sitting down with students in tutorials too. I think the loop into cyberspace with e-learning is coming home and that the desire by students and tutors alike will be to have more face to face, online and in person. I cannot help but KNOW that had those of us in our MOOC group who could have said, let&rsquo;s all meet in person in such and such a place that that meeting would have bound us as a team to the end of the MOOC. This is why meetings still happen.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The constraints are (negative drivers):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Working online</li>
<li>Working with strangers</li>
<li>Working without pay</li>
<li>Working without the likelihood of the project being realised</li>
<li>The unlikeliness of meeting face-to-face</li>
<li>Cloudworks - Why send us to Mars when there are familiar landscapes where we could work?</li>
<li>Time (each participant runs to a different schedule and agenda).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Positive drivers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When meet someone with a common goal</li>
<li>Leadership from a project that others wish to follow</li>
<li>Using a variety of tools with which we are familiar to communicate</li>
<li>The comprehensive nature of the OLDS MOOC</li>
<li>The liveliness and commitment of the OLDS MOOC team</li>
<li>Time (it is my own, but other commitments jostle for attention)</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Intentional</h2>
<p dir="ltr">What are the protagonists beliefs, desires and intentions, which shape the problem space?</p>
<p dir="ltr">This &lsquo;space&rsquo; does exist where there is a fixed landscape, even one that is online via a blog, a common social group or website. This &lsquo;problem space&rsquo; where the protagonists meet has to have a sense of space and place. In Cloudworks, and this is my second effort to work in it, the reflection of real-life hubs and nodes simply do no exist. I still find it impossible to log directly into my own cloud, let alone find those of the groups I took an interest in or get back to the base camp. In our group we rapidly debunked to email and Google docs. I&rsquo;ve done this on other platforms too - in a student group where Elluminate had failed twice, or the tutor was clueless at how to operate that construction from the mind of Professor Brainstorm, we debunked successful and repeatedly to Google Hangouts - the ultimate bond being a &lsquo;pyjamma party&rsquo; which reminded me that none of us wanted to do any of &lsquo;this&rsquo; unless it was fun. .</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Force Map</h2>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fx3oTWyy8GIBB77-qqgzz1v2IFnG3_xwux_E5O3c9RA_wDKYiyEx5Nbxp6heWUDYH6UxV0put5SoaWsuW6OU-5V6251p0iPHYvsblfXQXBrMRcD-AVIa4VLbRw" alt="" width="348px;" height="522px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>This may pre-empted the MOOC by a week but expresses three things in relation to team work</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>top down hierarchical</li>
<li>democratic</li>
<li>everyone pitches in</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">For me this might illustrate working on a programme of work or curriculum for a school ten years ago, working on a creative project in the last five years where everyone has direct contact with each other and finally, online collaboration where not only can you be inside each other&rsquo;s heads and beds (see Google Hangout above), but there can be, for good or bad, other interlopers and powers getting involved.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This could also be drawn up in a series of Activity Theory plans &hellip; not just from first to third generation, but in the final episode in which an activity system, like icicles in spring, melts.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Challenge</h1>
<p>In advertising and corporate communications we might create a campaign to launch a new beer in a country, launch a new range of cars, or run a Government health awareness campaign over three years and it is reduce to A SINGLE PAGE OF A4. <strong>The most important question is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the problem?</li>
</ul>
<p>If there isn&rsquo;t a problem there can be no answer, no advert, no campaign. The same applies to academic research - the proper research question has to be to address a problem. If there isn&rsquo;t a problem then the enterprise is already a shopping trolley with a missing wheel. This applies to EVERY training video, every interactive DVD, or web-based learning project I have been involved with. It there isn&rsquo;t a problem to fix then the learning is unnecessary. If you cannot express it as a problem, then stop.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The advertising brief continues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Who are you speaking to?</li>
<li>What do you want to say?</li>
<li>How do you want them to respond to this message?</li>
<li>Is there anything else we need to know.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">And all of this must be researched and worked on until it can be kept to a SINGLE SHEET OF A4. i.e. a sentence or two in response to each of these questions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I apply this to running a 12 week series of classes in Primary School, a day long workshop on revision techniques, a 9 month squad swimming programme, an hour long e-learning module, an 8 minute short film, a poster campaign for the local sailing club, teaching 3,000+ swimming teachers how to fix breaststroke &hellip;</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Theoretical / Pedagogical Framework</h1>
<p dir="ltr">See above.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Actions</h1>
<p>I proposed a &lsquo;design&rsquo; that has worked dozens of times before - a weekend workshop with no need to do anything online. Indeed, having been made to think it through that was the conclusion. I keep an OLDS Mooc journal.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Obstacles</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Two, maybe three &hellip; or was it four complete strangers, all busy full time elsewhere, most of us new to this game, trying to commit to something were increasingly we felt lost. From beginning to end I had no idea whether there were 10 people, maybe 25 people or just 3 doing the MOOC. If there were a 1000 then I never had any sense of this, not a stream of tweets and messages, not long lists of names. None of it. In sharp contrast the last two MOOCs I have taken an interest in I felt as if from day one there were 10,000 people sharing the same Ferry<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNC5iLNguRQ" rel="nofollow"> energizing</a> in and out by transporter</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Results</h1>
<p>To work online is to complement meeting face-to-face. Projects I join or initiate in the real world might begin online, become a conversation and relationship but then develop and embed by meeting. If it is a speculative, even an unpaid project (I&rsquo;ve done a number of these), then people get the measure of each other and are far, far more likely to commit to the end.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roles are established</li>
<li>Motives are understood</li>
<li>Diaries are compared</li>
<li>Problems identified and resolved</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be done online but needs at least a Skype or Google hangout level of interaction. There is a reason and value to seeing a person&rsquo;s face. There is a reason why the face is so expressive - it is a vital form of comprehension, communication and connection.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>A three person team became two, then none.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite expressing interest in four other projects NOT ONE of these people came back in any shape or form to express an interest in my contributing to their effort. I pitched in some ideas, was ignored &hellip; so in turn ignored them.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Reflections</h1>
<p>I keep a learning journal. No longer a person diary, but a record of everything I do that relates to work and personal development - which for me is learning, with a significant nod to learning online and e-learning / e-coaching. <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SXghPePe0oSddFAGAgjwelMg7eJas5Mwer_vCaUM_QQSjJf3uNtwRZu_noJAzqzjvRLgUT0bAegNVG1BXbUzC0bBBmyIPGun5xZ_S-HY5QFJeg3m3SkyWlaT" alt="" width="601px;" height="212px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">These posts happen to be in <a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/mod/oublog/search.php?user=635984&query=olds+mooc" rel="nofollow">my Open University Student blog</a> as the OLDS MOOC complements the postgraduate courses I have done over the last three years to complete the Masters in Open &amp; Distance Education.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was able to being the OLDS MOOC with a clear diary - this became busier after week 5 and as the only group that I had joined that showed traction faded away it became less easier to justify staying onboard. I do however follow the activity, read through the weekly activities and dip into some knowing that in my own time, or should the course be repeated, that I will re-join in order to do the subsequent weeks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a &lsquo;narrative&rsquo; I would prefer to write three or four short stories. There is a narrative to specific busy weeks, particularly my/our love hate relationship with Cloudworks, &nbsp;&lsquo;Personas&rsquo; where I was able to consolidate knowledge of the extensive use and development of Personas at the Open University Business School, extending my interest in design based research, bringing my knowledge and understanding and practical application of Activity Theory into focus, using <a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/mod/oublog/viewpost.php?post=135543" rel="nofollow">Activity Cards,</a> which was the highlight of the my time on the OLDS MOOC, bringing a pack of cards into the real world, to shuffle, pick through and then lay out on the kitchen table and share - this would be an invaluable activity to use with colleagues in &nbsp;workshop. And formulation of my own conception of Learning Activities, which I reduced to THREE, from Grainne Conole&rsquo;s Seven and named them <a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/mod/oublog/viewpost.php?post=136081" rel="nofollow">&lsquo;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&rsquo;. </a>&nbsp;Working in corporate Learning &amp; Development e-learning modules run for 45 minutes to an hour, they don&rsquo;t require the kind of thinking that is required and justified by a 30 or 60 point module in tertiary education where the OLDS MOOC is squarely aimed..</p>    </div>
