<p>&nbsp;Hello, myself and Melissa Highton will be talking about our OER Impact project for JISC and OER activity in general around the University of Oxford. The Impact project (<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearning/oer2/oerimpact.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearning/oer2/oerimpact.aspx</a>) is investigating the academic use/reuse of OER.</p>
<p>I'm very interested in stories of the use/reuse of OER and how they fit in the broad spectrum of online resource use. To help position the conversations we are having with people we have developed a 'map' of use/reuse: <a href="http://oerblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/?p=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://oerblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/?p=1</a> which you might find helpful?</p>
<p>Our workshop will be looking at the use/reuse side of the OER coin and at what it means form an institution to be 'open'. Where does openness take pace around your institution and what form does it take?</p>    </div>

                   <p>Hello David,</p>
<p>as you might have gathered, I'm quite new to OER, and I'm familiar with language teaching more than anything else, but seeing your map, I was wondering whether it would be sensible (or silly!) to make a distinction between an Educationnal Resource (what you use when teaching / learning), and the content it is built around / upon. An example might be clearer : as a language teacher, I can use songs, videos, images, anything to design an activity (the "material" would be what I called the content, and the activity would be the resource). Other teachers might reuse the material in a completely different activity... I'm not sure I would say I adapt the OER in this case - unless you consider any document you use in a classroom is an OER (which can be an option as well).</p>
<p>I hope my point is clear, but if it isn't or doesn't fit the questions or discussion you'd like&nbsp;to raise, please feel free to say so (I'm not sure this is relevant for a discussion about what it means for an institution to be open...).</p>
<p>Sandrine.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>you say "I'm very interested in stories of the use/reuse of OER and how they fit in the broad spectrum of online resource use". Can I ask you what tools you are using (or you can recommend) to capture those stories?</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="http://loro.open.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LORO </a>project, we are running a workshop in the afternoon of the 23rd with a group of our associate lecturers&nbsp;on the&nbsp;impact&nbsp;that LORO is having (or not!) in their teaching. We will be using&nbsp;personas to focus some of the discussion,&nbsp;and then also ask participants to write some narratives using narrative frames (Barkhuizen and&nbsp;Wette (2008)) after the event, but I was wondering what other tools you might think are useful. If anyone else has any ideas, I'd love to hear!</p>
<p>Tita</p>

                   <p>@Sandrine The distinction between 'content' and 'activity design' in the context of OER is complex. My view is that something only becomes OER when it is used for education, up to that point it is simply CC licensed 'stuff'. Some people use the Open CourseWare (OCW) title to make the distinction between OER that contains a learning design/structure and those that are standalone chunks of content like images.</p>
<p>@Tita I'm a huge fan of mapping concepts onto a quadrant of thematic areas. When this type of exercise is discussed it brings useful narrative to the fore.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I didn't know about the OCW (one more acronym for me to learn!) but it makes sense to me, thank you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;So OER would be "CC licensed stuff + additionnal value", and this additionnal value would be for one part what you add to it (or how you present it) and for another part how you use it. the firt part is quite easy to trace (as it is material...) and I gather the use is what you mostly work on ? I guess this is related to what you said last time in the OU (can't remember when it was, but it was in the lab in the Jenny Lee Building, a very dark room...) about what is open&nbsp;: content or discussion (sorry about the shortcut that may distort what you said)?</p>
<p>from a sharing point of view (and a user one), I find it difficult to know what information you should give about your OER for it to be useful to other people... it's probably useless to give it without any information about&nbsp;its first&nbsp;context, but neither can you (if only for time reasons) explain everything in details... I think the tools you use to share the OER are important in that perspective (tools focused on content / tools focused on discussions).</p>
<p>Oh and I'm curious about the quadrant shape of your concept maps... I know concepts maps with several boxes, as those you can do with stuff like freemind, is it the same principle? why a quadrant? is it use to graduate stuff?</p>        </div>

                   <p>I suppose my point is that you can use almost anything as part of an educational process. It could be a single image or the structure of a whole module. It has the potential to be OER if it's CC licensed but it only becomes OER when it's used educationally (to teach or learn). This was we don't make assumptions about how it might be appropriated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The map is in quadrants to help roughly define use/reuse areas. The reality is the use/reuse takes place one a sliding scale across the whole of that area. The map would work without the quadrant but becomes difficult to reference.</p>        </div>
