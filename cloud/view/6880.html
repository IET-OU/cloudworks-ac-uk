        <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is the term used to denote the huge array of networked devices that are transforming computing and related digital technologies. &nbsp;The OU developed the module, My Digital Life (TU100) in response to these developments in technology. &nbsp;However, the ongoing debate about computing at schools raises an opportunity for IoT technologies to be used with younger learners, encouraging them to become creators of digital technologies rather than simply consumers of them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My project idea is to design learning resources that would allow young learners (e.g., aged 6-11) to use the Sense IoT platform (http://sense.open.ac.uk), developed by The Open University - and currently being used by OU undergraduate students.</p>    </div>

                   <p>Hi Arosha,</p>
<p>This sounds very interesting and thanks for your message on my cloud. I also tutor on TU100 and have used Scratch in the classroom a few years ago. I would be very interested in helping out. I think that I also saw you online yesterday at the DigitalMakers webchat. I certainly imagine that we may be using/developing activities with Scratch (not Sense because of the need for the board) for students to use in the GCSE project. Our aim being to introduce students to a number of different languages by going through a design-produce-test process with the produce-test elements using several different programming languages.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I also work for the OU, though not on TU100, I am very curious about this area though as a social scientist I have no idea whatsoever how to do any of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I have two children and I am keen that they learn about programming and thus would like to contribute, I am sure lots of other parents are in the same place as I am, and perhaps part of the open design could be about building capacity across generations</p>

                   Thanks Ronald. I think you idea about supporting learning across generations is a really good one. My own personal experience of learning programming as a child involved my father teaching himself BASIC (he was a doctor, so not something that he was formally taught) and then teaching me. Supporting this type of learning could be an interesting approach to take for this project.         </div>

                   <p>Hi Arosha,</p>
<p>My proposal is different than yours (mine involves collaborative writing) but I am working with a similar age group (8-9 year olds). I'm going to look more into what this platform in your proposal involves - it sounds interesting, thanks for sharing the link. I just wanted to connect with you since we may be able to share some resources and ideas about the unique needs of young learners considering many of the projects in this MOOC are focused on adult learners.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Alisha</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks Arosha, so do you think we it would be possible to "team up" and work on this together, it looks like quite a few people are interested in this thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I missed the "team up" yesterday as&nbsp; I needed to go and buy building supplies, where I live that is a day trip, so uncertain what happened in terms of getting together</p>

                   <p>Hi Ronald, &nbsp;Apologogies for the delayed response. &nbsp;It would be great to team up and work together on this idea.&nbsp;I will be around on 16 January if you would like to meet up on campus in Milton Keynes. &nbsp;Drop me an email with your availability and we can organise a specific time.</p>
<p>Mandy would you be interested in joining us on this project team? &nbsp;Alternatively, perhaps everyone who has indicated an interest in this area would like to self-organise into a study group?</p>

                   <p>I like the general idea. A couple of questions:</p>
<p>- why not the arduino?</p>
<p>- what's the process that would use the resources i.e. would this happen in a classroom setting or outside?</p>
<p>fwiw you'd probably be interested in the hackidemia project <a href="http://www.hackidemia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hackidemia.com/</a></p>

                   <p>Hi Dan, &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the message and also the link to Hackidemia. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding your questions, the SenseBoard is based on an Arduino but can be programmed using Sense, a visual programming language that is based on Scratch, extended to allow online data sharing, file handling and interaction with the SenseBoard.</p>
<p>At the moment my thinking is that this would be used outside the classroom, e.g., in afterschool clubs like those organised by Code Club (http://www.codeclub.org.uk).</p>
<p>From a OLDS-MOOS perspective, would you be interested in collaborating on the project or the Study Group, or both?</p>

                   <p>Hi Arosha and all,</p>
<p>Unfortunately I'm a bit off-schedule here, but I had some assignments to do this weekend, and am now reviewing people's projects to find likeminded people. I'm interested in digital literacy, and IoT is completely related to that. Do you think I could join your project?</p>

                   <p>Thanks Arosha, I am around on the 16th of Jan, but I think my timing is tight, possibly better on the 28th of Jan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like we have a small team forming here, though I do feel slightly inadequate as I do not know anything about coding or how technology works, I know more about the technology in its social context. But if we are to design something for all stakeholders then I could be a good "test subject"&nbsp; the interested but lacking knowledge :-)</p>

                   <p>OK, so it looks like we could put together a project team that is interested in digital literacy and young learners, using the IoT as a concrete example of a digital technology. &nbsp;From the conversation above, Ronald, Joao, Dan and myself are interested in this.</p>
<p>Additionally there is a study group that covers the broader area learning design for young learners, which could inclue Alisha, Ronald, Mandy and myself.</p>
<p>If this sounds roughly OK, I'll set up two cloudscapes and add them to the relevant parts of the MOOC cloudscape. &nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>I've set up the project cloudscape, which is here:&nbsp;http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2783</p>
<p>Not had a chance to do the Study Circle one yet. &nbsp;Too many deadlines, too little time! :-)</p>        </div>

                   Regarding the study circle, it may be a better idea to join the existing circle that looks at  digital literacy in broader terms than just for young learners - http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7326.         </div>

                   <p>I am afraid I have had absolutely no time to think about , let alone do work relating to, the MOOC. &nbsp;Sadly, the work commitments are not getting any less over the coming weeks, so I have decided to withdraw from the formal part of the work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully you can still work on the project - and will do my best to answer particular questions relating to this as needed.</p>

                   <p>Sorry I had to go off and do other stuff for a few days and have completely lost track. I'm trying to catch up though and would love to get involved as my "team" has gone quiet. But I am likely to lurk more than contribute. I will see how things go the rest of this week.</p>
