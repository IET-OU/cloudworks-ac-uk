        <h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>My task was to prepare a group of sales-reps - with limited skills in computer technology - for an international new product launch-webinar, in which they would be expected to actively participate fully, without feeling restricted by the medium.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>I was working in Barranquilla, a coastal city of Colombia, South America with an average temperature of 40</em><em>&deg;C, away from any formal company-owned office space. Given the sensitive nature of both the content and the medium, I decided to hire an enclosed office with air-conditioning and wifi-connectivity, equipped with my own video projector, unblemished white walls, a long rectangular table and six comfortable office chairs, carpeted (for sound quality), but no windows. This meant less interference with the projection, but after a while encroached on the spatial awareness.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I set the table (6&rsquo;x3&rsquo;) to compliment the long rectangular room approximately in the middle, restricted by outlets to connect with the equipment, giving us a projection on one of the long walls of approximately 6&rsquo; x 4&rsquo;. The chairs were set, four along one long side, opposite the improvised screen and one at one end for the instructor and one at the other to create a horseshoe of participants. The two air-con units were mounted directly in front of and behind the four chairs, which meant at one point we paused proceedings to turn off the one behind as it was causing discomfort. We also had two extension cables close to the table to ensure each of the participant&rsquo;s own laptops were charged and in use throughout.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The five participants included myself; an English native-speaker, fluent in Spanish with above average familiarity with technology. My professional role within this community is that of Academic Consultant for the region, hierarchically, I am superior to the team and in the absence of their regional manager; my role was clearly defined as &lsquo;leader&rsquo;. Though personally we have been working together for two years and there is a strong bond of professional friendship between us all. The remaining four participants, two male and two female are aged between 35 and 45, with limited English language and technology skills. Each has a laptop, used predominantly for emailing and generating basic Excel spread sheets. Some help was required to find and connect to the wifi signal.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The webinar session, was given from Brazil, by a Brazilian, with a strong accent and tendency to code-switch between Spanish and English. The new product was of paramount importance to the entire team and features a never-seen-before-in-the-primary-sector online component &ndash; a &lsquo;LAB&rsquo;. The &lsquo;LAB&rsquo; format had been seen before in previous products, but not with the Primary focus. Thus there would be familiarity accompanied by many questions. </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The additional element of this webinar was that we were to be in the company of twenty of our colleagues in three other cities with similar demographics.</em></p>
<p><em>The belief was that this wouldn&rsquo;t be possible. The desire was to make it so.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>We wanted to not only demonstrate presence in the exchange but also dominance of the subject material. Our measure of success would be the perception from other stakeholders in the proceedings. </em></p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>I had phoned each of the members beforehand and asked them to bring one item each, without informing the others and without stressing any element of secrecy. When they arrived, I collected the four items; Coca-Cola, disposable cups, cookies and crisps and put them good use and reimbursed each of the participants. The aim of this exercise, besides giving us all some well-deserved refreshment during the break, was to highlight the importance of teamwork and the prevalence of such within this group. This was illustrated further by the fact that one of the participants, realizing he would be late and called another team member and delegated the task. By pooling the resources of the team as a whole, each member was critical to task completion and the burden was shared. It also demonstrated their adaptability in task completion under varied circumstances.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I first presented a similar product that they were already familiar with and asked testing questions in order to establish context and engage with prior knowledge, leading to predictions of their expectations of the &lsquo;new&rsquo; product.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Secondly we covered a sales technique, which I knew would be presented as part of the &lsquo;new&rsquo; product pitch, using the same image-rich slides from the ppt. that the upcoming presenter would use later. Knowing that my team are predominantly visual learners, this meant for faster recollection of data later on. </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Thirdly, we considered the logistics of the latter part of the session, which helped put them at their ease, in terms of; who they would be communicating with, the degree to which they would be expected to participate and the sorts of questions that they were, by now, beginning to muster.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We took a break after 70mins, to ensure a change of environment, bathroom use, and the opportunity to catch up on phone calls, to avoid interruptions or strained concentration during the webinar.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Returning from the break - some hadn&rsquo;t left, as they were keen to get into the debate, we connected to Saba Centra; a virtual meeting space very similar to Elluminate. Amusingly it was my own laptop, the only one that wouldn&rsquo;t join the meeting, as a result we had one of the delegate&rsquo;s laptops connected to the video-projector and mine gathered access some eight minutes after the start, so we left it as was. Each of the tutees was connected and directed to the &lsquo;chat&rsquo; option, whereupon they began greeting colleagues from afar settled in to what resulted in a very successful online session.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>As expected the trainees within our real space were all familiar with the fundamentals of the session, thus more prepared to ask more probing questions of the speaker than other participants in the webinar. What was unexpected was the fiercely competitive nature of their exchanges or at least the urgency with which they attempted to share every idea, doubt, realization, thought, question and point of view. As each of them made an observation out loud, so they would race to type this in the chat box and boost their appearance and presence.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>List the expected and unexpected outcomes of your actions. To what degree did you meet your objectives? What additional outcomes did you engender? Provide evidence to back your claims.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>Sadly, we were the only group to present more than one portal into the discussion (one laptop each), which meant in another group of close to 15 reps and only one laptop, there must have been only one poor sole doing all of the typing, thus very little online personality and I am quite sure, not all of the ideas were either heard or shared. The resulting utterances were often incoherent and impossible to track back to their owners for clarification.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Happily, our team all seemed thrilled with what they had achieved and immediately asked about the next webinar. They also gained a great deal of understanding, confirmed doubts, raised queries and resolved issues over the implementation of the &lsquo;new product&rsquo;. They were expectedly the first to respond to questions from the speaker, not only in themes that we had recently discussed, but due to the confidence within the medium, took what I would consider &lsquo;<strong>considerable social risks</strong>&rsquo; in answering questions to which, they could justifiably have answered incorrectly and under normal circumstances would therefore have hesitated over. But due to their obvious comfort in the virtual environment, ignored the threat of being jeered or put off by their peers and helped to generate and develop greater understanding of the content, potentially for all concerned. </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong><em> - never under-estimate the power of desire to perform with technology, amongst a group of naturally born show-offs, online.</em></p>    </div>
