<p>The idea of life design sets out an agenda for enabling people to become agents of career success in an increasingly career-challenging world (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000187910900058X" rel="nofollow">Mark Savickas et al, 2009</a>).&nbsp; It's a vigorously ambitious project, based in America.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was there at the time, and I can remember how brit careers work was slower off the mark than the Americans.&nbsp; In the early days we needed to import American ideas. &nbsp;But they never fully took hold of brit experience.&nbsp; We needed to think for ourselves - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUW8V7Jupns&feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">and we did</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But reading about life design has given me a dose of d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu - it's an idea well worth importing.&nbsp; Life design engages psychological constructs to catalyse career-development in response to a changing world.&nbsp; It's good stuff.&nbsp; And, with some European help, it can be better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm talking about unrealised potential.&nbsp; The realisation agenda is set out here in a five-stages..&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by re-constructing life-design possibilities</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by recognising significant influences</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by re-examining dynamic experience</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by resolving demanding issues</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by narrating meaningful action</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li></li>
<li><strong>1. possibilities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Life design is an ambitious programme, and that willingness to take things on can connect to a wider agenda for action. &nbsp;The life-design conversation is with a free-standing individual - it's a person-to-person technique.&nbsp; That person is then understood as revealing some inner and recurring ways of seeing this - psychological constructs.&nbsp; That's good, but there are other ways of talking about how to get on with a career.&nbsp; They crop up a lot on this side of the pond. &nbsp;And they're at least as likely to talk about neighbourhoods and their goings-on as they are about inner life.&nbsp; Life design can be talked up to take on more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a particularly influential European voice on this (<a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674510418" rel="nofollow">Pierre Bourdieu,1991</a>).&nbsp; His ethnographies set out social and cultural experience.&nbsp; They illuminate how individuals and communities attribute meaning in experience.&nbsp; Life design is in a good position to take on this wider range of social sciences - and the social constructs that they develop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2. influences</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together talk of psychological and social constructs build broad-based foundations.&nbsp; They lift the social sciences to where they can glimpse other platforms for understanding career. &nbsp;The humanities have their own voices on drama, literature, society, culture and geography.&nbsp; All speak of career.&nbsp; History is on that list. &nbsp;And a richly-informed and arresting example of its thinking (<a href="http://www.academia.edu/15623012/Timothy_Snyder._Black_Earth._The_Holocaust_as_History_and_Warning_London_The_Bodley_Head_2015_forthcoming" rel="nofollow">Timothy Snyder, 2015</a>) probes the damage that mismanaged change can cause.&nbsp; It shows how political and professional stances are claimed by agencies and accepted by onlookers.&nbsp; It is an extreme example of how reactions to change can formally reframe culture, politics and professionalism.&nbsp; And that reframing reshapes informal social behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The humanities can expose what the social sciences miss.&nbsp; And so, while experience may find what is felt to be a problem, and the social sciences may welcome it as an opportunity, it can take history to expose it as a conflict of interests.&nbsp; It is talk of careers as politics, raising questions about who gets to do what, who is favoured and who is marginalised.&nbsp; No learning programme lives in a political vacuum.&nbsp; And history speaks of how those influences play out.&nbsp; Such talk is necessary for establishing the credibility of life-design processes.&nbsp; The programme will be strengthened by being able to identify the political and constituency interests that it reflects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3. dynamics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Any construction of life design as a response to change needs an understanding of what is changing, and how, and why.&nbsp; It's a long story: as a species we have learned to deal with change associated with migration, and then settlement, and then communication, and then invention.&nbsp; It is change after change.&nbsp; But twenty-first century dynamics are different because all of these changes are invading our lives simultaneously.&nbsp; The emergence of the trends, the crises and the reforms overlay each other.&nbsp; This is change upon change.</p>
<p>Its causes are in the leverage of commercial practice, in the proliferation of digital technologies, and in the diversification of cultures.&nbsp; Its consequences are new ways of finding things out, of settling on what to do about them, and of linking to the people who will share them. &nbsp;The dynamics are fired up both on- and off-line (<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/NICECHit&Myth.pdf" rel="nofollow">Bill Law, 2012a</a>). &nbsp;And those dynamics are constantly shaping and re-shaping careers. &nbsp;Navigating that turmoil calls for a stage-by-stage process of learning and re-learning.&nbsp; It needs to be portable - transferable from one thing to another.&nbsp; That learning enables students to take charge of their careers - they define the agenda. &nbsp;So this is more about student self-propulsion, and less about expert recommendations.&nbsp; It is called 'career management' rather than 'career development'. &nbsp;These are expansive dynamics, and they belong to a root-and-branch expansion of the life-design programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4. issues</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Talk of career management, where students define an agenda, raises issues for how far-ranging that agenda can be.&nbsp; As it stands the life-design process introduces a client to a career counsellor, opening a question-and-answer process.&nbsp; Clients are free to talk about whatever surprises them, what troubles them, what excites them, what is important to them and why.&nbsp; The conversation is then about how those thoughts-and-feelings figure in career management. &nbsp;It's a process of recalling experience, revisiting memories and finding patterns which suggest priorities. &nbsp;There need be no limit to where that conversation can go - that is life-design's strength.&nbsp; But there is an issue for career counsellors who don't want career-development expertise to be diluted by career-management autonomy. &nbsp;Expert exclusivity curtails, student inclusivity expands (<a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461494591" rel="nofollow">Bill Law, 2014</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>That expansion needs greater place-and-space than face-to-face work can find.&nbsp; The reality is that life design is set in an hinterland occupied by social attachments, political-and-commercial manoeuvring, and accelerating change-upon-change. &nbsp;This issue is for how the enablement of stage-by-stage and portable learning can taking hold of self-propelled career management.&nbsp; A question is how much of a future is there for a life-design contained by face-to-face encounters. &nbsp;An answer is that life-design needs to link encounter to curriculum.&nbsp; There is no part of the curriculum incapable of carrying some part of career-management freight.&nbsp; The outcome is then for students and their helpers to learn from each other about what issues are thrown up and how they can be navigated.&nbsp; It enlarges the scope for life-design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5. narrative</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A summary: the hinterland of life design is a place of puzzling complexity, out-of-the-blue surprise and confusing dynamics.&nbsp; The essentials for an acceptable educational response are being narrowed by politics, its sponsors and some professionals. &nbsp;Educators who listen to students find learning-for-living developing an inclusive rather than exclusive agenda.&nbsp; That's because what people do about career is what they do about life, and neither the social sciences nor the humanities have found any limits to that.&nbsp; The life-design project is right, therefore, to assemble its careers constructions into a narrative.&nbsp; People are better able to make sense of a narrative however vague, than of analysis however precise (<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/NICECSbEnlarge.pdf" rel="nofollow">Law, 2012b</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A narrative is a sequence - one thing leading to another.&nbsp; It can be long-term or short, plodding or wide-ranging, trite or layered.&nbsp; An inclusive agenda needs a long-term, wide-ranging and layered narrative.&nbsp; It can raise who-what-when-where-how-and-why questions.&nbsp; And that doesn't whizz its audience along, it draws them in.&nbsp; Now they are both interested onlookers and galvanised agents.&nbsp; And students and their educators want to know how the story speaks of their lives, their child, their family, their work, their fear and their hope. &nbsp;That narrative is expansive.&nbsp; And that account of life-design is most expansive a response to change when it features turning points, changes-of-mind, and ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">____________________________________</p>
<p>Was there ever a time when that ability - to look and look again, to reflect and discover another way, to be shocked and to resolve to do something about it - were more needed? &nbsp;With America It is the change-after-change back-and-forth story of migration, settlement, communication, and invention.&nbsp; Living memory knows a lot about that Euro-American story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of it is where brit careers work got its ideational kick-start.&nbsp; But now, and throughout the globe, change-upon-change puts pressures on work-life that have never been more intense, and controlling interests that have never been more entrenched.&nbsp; This expanded life-design programme, realising more of its potential, will engage students and educators in new and more inclusive ways for finding out what's going on, and firing up a more complete apparatus for dealing with it. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
