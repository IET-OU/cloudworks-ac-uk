        <p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>The Career-learning Caf&eacute;</em></a></p>
<p><a title="storyboarding" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6218" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Three-scene storyboarding</a> is a format-and-process for reflecting on how past experience can become a new starting point.&nbsp; The theory is of turning-point episodes as new departures.&nbsp; The aim is ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; The philosophy is that nothing is inevitable</p>
<p>An EU Leonardo <a title="Leonardo" href="http://www.kpcgroep.nl/leonardo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">project</a> has done enough piloting to suggest that this use of narrative is worth developing.&nbsp; But there are issues about how far we can sufficiently...</p>
<ul>
<li>enlarge education professionalism</li>
<li>expand learning purposes</li>
<li>re-situate student narratives</li>
</ul>
<p>The issues are wide ranging.&nbsp; The links below will fill you in on storyboarding and related issues.&nbsp; This is not about so-called academic learning for use in assessment, it is about recognisable learning for use in living.</p>
<p>Your experience of working with any such use would be useful. &nbsp;The discussion section at the foot of this blog can hold your comments on any issues raised here - together with whatever you can tell about your organisation and role.&nbsp; Thanks for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>enlarging professionalism - making room for storyboarding</strong></p>
<p>The issue is do careers-work <a title="professionals" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6226" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">professionals</a> have the freedom and resources to make good use of these kinds of narrative techniques and processes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Leonardo workshop participants voice frustration at being in no position to do what they know they are capable of doing.&nbsp; Going through training in storyboarding can add to that bad feeling.&nbsp; There are resource and strategy issues here concerning...</p>
<ul>
<li>whether your position      gives you enough scope... or not</li>
<li>if you have special ways      of managing this... and how</li>
<li>what the people      introducing such methods should be      doing about it</li>
<br /> 
</ul>
<p><strong>expanding purposes - storyboarding for the race and the journey</strong></p>
<p>Narrative methods, like storyboarding, can enable the people who already know what they want to do to find a distinctive voice for realising that purpose.&nbsp; In recruitment and selection it gives them something special to say - showing the different ways they each stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s possible to be too certain about what you want.&nbsp; So storyboarding is designed, first, to take people through episodes in their lives where they can find clues to new meaning and purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; It raises questions about turning-points.</p>
<p>There is a <a title="metaphor" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6313" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">distinction</a> here between getting-ahead competitiveness - as though in a race, and wait-a-minute exploration - as though on a journey.&nbsp; The distinction gets a lot of attention in storyboarding workshops and follow-up discussion.&nbsp; There are programme-development issues here concerning...</p>
<ul>
<li>how frequently people want to use the story to compete for a known intention... and whether this works out well</li>
<li>how frequently people want to use storyboarding to explore new possibilities... and whether this works out wel</li>
<li>what the people introducing such programmes could be doing about this</li>
<br /> 
</ul>
<p><strong>re-situating narratives - different places calling up different stories</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrative methods raise questions about moving on in life - &lsquo;stay or go?&rsquo;, &lsquo;where can I go&lsquo;, &lsquo;what to hold onto and what to let go?&rsquo;.&nbsp; They are questions differently answered in different locations - the stories are situated.</p>
<p>Situated areas of community experience are called &lsquo;<a title="enclaves" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6374" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">enclaves</a>&rsquo;.&nbsp; They link people together in a sense of belonging.&nbsp; There are enclaves in neigbourhoods, and also on the net.</p>
<p>Narratives can therefore show how people who are psychologically different are also bound together by shared experience in enclaves.&nbsp; Although personally different they may well be culturally similar - their stories reflecting shared beliefs, values and expectations.</p>
<p>Project feedback and follow-up discussion sees the importance of this.&nbsp; Enclaved attitudes can entrap - so narratives need to be re-situated to embrace new possibilities in surprising futures.&nbsp; There are equal-opportunity issues here, concerning...</p>
<ul>
<li>what range of different situations your people come from... and how that is reflected in their stories</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>whether narrative methods help people to recognise unforeseen possibilities... and help you to see what you can usefully do</li>
<li>what people advocating such approaches might usefully do</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">_____________________</p>
<p>Narrative methods are increasingly canvassed as congenial ways of engaging students in learning for living.&nbsp; But a tour through these links shows that narrative methods are not problem free.&nbsp; Nonetheless, they can usefully represents contemporary experience.&nbsp; We therefore need to be able to present these innovations to all our stakeholders in terms which are not just congenial but also practicable, defensible and robust.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help with that.</p>    </div>
