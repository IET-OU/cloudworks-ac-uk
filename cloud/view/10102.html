<p><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/open-university-aims-be-top-validating-institution" rel="nofollow">The OU is launching a new validation service</a> for FE colleges and alternative providers as it aims to become the biggest player in validating qualifications for that part of the sector.&nbsp; The OU has validated other institutions&rsquo; courses since 1992 and, in addition to the 25 for which it already validates qualifications, the OU has announced five new partners.&nbsp; It aims to speed up the historically slow process by working with the QAA to ensure that colleges can use documentation produced for review by the agency for validation as well, removing the need for work to be duplicated.</p>
<p>Consultancy UK reports on the OU&rsquo;s partnership with KPMG to provide <a href="http://www.consultancy.uk/news/12533/the-open-university-and-kpmg-launch-joint-apprenticeship-services" rel="nofollow">three higher-apprenticeship scheme programmes</a> for businesses seeking to train: Healthcare Practitioner Assistant Higher Apprenticeship; Chartered Manager Degree Apprenticeship; and Digital and Technical Solutions Degree Apprenticeship.</p>

<p>The number of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/08/18/rise-in-eu-students-applying-to-british-universities-ahead-of-br/" rel="nofollow">students from EU countries applying to British universities</a> has jumped by 11% to 26,800 - the highest number on record.&nbsp; EU students have access to lower fees and student loans but there are fears they could lose their benefits after Brexit; however, experts now fear the number of those leaving the country without paying their loans back at their end of their degrees could rise.&nbsp; There are also concerns over &ldquo;a likely <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160909200046886" rel="nofollow">sudden decline in EU student applications</a> across the UK&rdquo; unless reassurances are made, according to the head of UUK.&nbsp; More than 125,000 EU students are currently studying at UK universities, making up 5% of the entire student population.</p>
<p>British universities and scientists say a United Kingdom government statement promising to <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160815182818657" rel="nofollow">underwrite funding for approved European Union science projects</a> &ldquo;applied for before the UK leaves the EU&rdquo; will only partially address concerns that they are already being excluded from EU consortia.&nbsp; Philip Hammond announced last month that the Treasury &ldquo;will underwrite the payments&rdquo; of awards such as Horizon 2020 funding &ldquo;even when specific projects continue beyond the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU&rdquo;.</p>
<p>HEGlobal &ndash; a joint initiative between the British Council and UUK &ndash; reports having regular conversations with university chiefs about the likely impact of Brexit, with many asking about opportunities to <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160831094131524" rel="nofollow">expand transnational education on the European continent</a>.&nbsp; The delivery of British TNE is growing five times faster than international student recruitment to the UK over the last two years but only around 23% of British TNE programmes are on offer in the EU, with SE Asia forming the largest market.&nbsp; Middlesex University is one of the strongest UK HEIs for transnational education internationally with over 5,000 TNE students.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[WhaTech; Audrey Watters; EdSurge; Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>Business research organisation, MarketsandMarkets, has released a new report, snappily entitled: &ldquo;Massive Open Online Course Market by Platform (CMOOC, XMOOC), Course (Humanities, Computer Science &amp; Programming, Business Management, Education &amp; Training), Service (Consulting, Implementation, Training &amp; Support) &amp; by Region - Global Forecast to 2020&rdquo;.&nbsp; In this they estimate the <a href="https://www.whatech.com/market-research/it/200028-massive-open-online-course-market-will-be-worth-usd-8-50-billion-usd-by-2020-according-to-market-forecasts" rel="nofollow">MOOC market growing</a> from $1.83bn in 2015 to $8.50bn by 2020, at an estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.0%.&nbsp; The report is pay-walled but the brief summary seems to focus mostly on IT issues: &ldquo;MOOCs are likely to evolve into a scale business, which relies on the technology and data backbone of the medium to optimize and individualize learning opportunities for millions of students.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://coursera.tumblr.com/post/149099249092/a-new-challenge" rel="nofollow">Daphne Koller is leaving Coursera</a> to pursue her passion for &ldquo;machine learning and its application to improving human health&rdquo; with Alphabet (Google)-owned biotech company, Calico.</p>

<p>Coursera has launched an >enterprise edition</a> to provide professional training and development in the workplace.&nbsp; The platform will offer more than 1,400 university courses, provided in partnership with 145 university partners.</p>

<p>A more positive outlook comes from the Center for Online Education, which reports that <a href="http://www.onlinecolleges.net/for-students/online-degrees-at-nonprofit-universities/" rel="nofollow">online degrees are growing in popularity</a> among US traditional four-year colleges and universities.&nbsp; Of the top-ranked schools, nearly 75% offer online degrees, and about half are increasing their online degree offerings. &nbsp;The fastest adopters of online learning include both public and private colleges and universities, including some academic heavyweights like Harvard and Johns Hopkins.&nbsp; Most prevalent subject areas are Education, Health and Business.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Having a holistic strategy for opening up education that encompasses the 10 dimensions of the OpenEdu framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making the open education strategy part of the overall institutional strategy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting intra, inter and cross-border institutional collaborations and partnerships in order to achieve open education goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploring new practices and welcoming changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revising their practices at all levels: mission statement and vision, current organisational management structures and day-to-day policies, and the institution&rsquo;s role in the community and globally</p>

<p>It may surprise you to learn that there is much more to augmented reality (AR) than Pokemon Go.&nbsp; Fridolin Wild and Peter Scott described two years ago >how an augmented reality job performance aid could be used for kinaesthetic learning in manufacturing work places</a>, and now employees at a Rhode Island construction firm putting the theory into practice by using Microsoft&rsquo;s augmented-reality computer, HoloLens &ndash; replacing paper blueprints with <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602124/augmented-reality-could-speed-up-construction-projects/" rel="nofollow">life-size 3D models of a $70m STEM Academy</a> about to be constructed in Boston.&nbsp; Spotting just one mistake alone (planned steel frames were too long) saved the costs of the AR investment.</p>

<p>Writing on the Scholarly Kitchen, Robert Harrington speculates on <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/08/15/curation-nation-thoughts-on-the-future-of-textbooks/" rel="nofollow">the future of textbooks</a> in a discourse that ranges from OERs through to personalised learning, via McGraw Hill Create, Blackboard, Flat World and student preferences.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an interesting read with some useful links but it&rsquo;s quite thin on evidence and lacks any substantive conclusions, other than the anodyne &ldquo;&hellip;in all the excitement in the potential of ebooks do not ignore the print &ndash; there is value in both forms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Research from Pew into <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/09/01/book-reading-2016/" rel="nofollow">US reading habits</a> shows 1 or 2 percentage point increases in uptake of print, e- and audio books over the past year, whereas the five-year picture shows print declining (from 71% of adults reading at least one book in 2011 to 65% in 2016) but with increases for audio (11% to 14%) and e-book use (17% to 28%).&nbsp; 28% read both print and digital books last year (although 26% read none at all) with college graduates and top earners being most likely to read in multiple formats.&nbsp; Of those reading e-books, the tablet was the most prevalent platform and the fastest growing since 2011 with the dedicated e-reader last on both counts.</p>

<p><em>[Nicky Ellis;</em> <em>NewsBiscuit]</em></p>
<p>From our political news desk, the Independent reports that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korea-bans-sarcasm-kim-jong-un-freedom-speech-a7231461.html" rel="nofollow">North Korea has banned sarcasm</a> because Kim Jong-un fears that people are only agreeing with him &lsquo;ironically&rsquo;.&nbsp; People have been warned about directing sarcastic remarks against Kim Jong-un or his regime.&nbsp; As an example, saying &ldquo;this is all America&rsquo;s fault&rdquo; would constitute unacceptable criticism.</p>
<p>And from closer to home comes news of UK government plans to turn every school into a <a href="http://www.newsbiscuit.com/2016/09/13/every-school-to-be-a-grammar-academy/" rel="nofollow">Grammar Academy</a>, with increased exposure to the eleven plus exam ensuring that &ldquo;almost every young adult in the country hence will know how many men it takes to dig a hole in three hours if four men are required to dig the same hole in ten&rdquo;.</p>    </div>
