<p>An earlier <a title="the poor don't listen" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5322" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog</a> examines &lsquo;why the poor don&rsquo;t listen to us&rsquo;.&nbsp; It finds that the comfortably-off don&rsquo;t understand the priorities of poverty.&nbsp; And it shows how that puzzlement spills over into disapproval.&nbsp; The conflict comes to a head in a crisis.</p>
<p>The August &lsquo;riots&rsquo; are no easier to understand.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve already been labelled as criminality...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;pure and simple&rsquo;<br />'to be confronted and defeated'<br />&lsquo;in an all-out war&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s troublesome enough.&nbsp; But vested interests are also out in force, with their claims...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;if-you&rsquo;d-only-listened-to-us&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;and supported our programme&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;while following our lead&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Careers workers can understand that no explanation of what people do is ever that simplistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From its beginning careers work has negotiated a threshold between what we can work with and what must be controlled. Every teacher faces it every day.&nbsp; So does every parent.&nbsp; And every policeman.&nbsp; They can...</p>
<p>...<strong>work with people</strong> when they recognise an outcry - and the possibility of communication - with people engaged in a search for a way forward - ready to take hold of something with promise.</p>
<p>But they must...</p>
<p>..<strong>hand over to control</strong> when they know there&rsquo;s no more they can do - recognising dangers and damage - to other people and to their clients - standing aside as helper to make way for sanctions.</p>
<p>Having to resort to control is always a failure.&nbsp; To take pride in its advocacy diminishes the advocate.&nbsp; The harder but more promising task is to find a threshold for help.</p>
<p><strong>thresholds</strong><br />People do not always tell us what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; One of the reasons - as the earlier blog shows - is not seeing any point in bothering to explain yourself to people who are not going to understand.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a sort of exasperation.&nbsp; It needs alert, patient, and observant attention to clues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the clues are set out below - as if they are quotes.&nbsp; (You might copy-and-paste the list, to compare reactions from colleagues and students.)&nbsp; It invites a response to each &lsquo;quote&rsquo; by asking...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is this a careers-work concern?&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>underline it</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...can we work with it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>tick it</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em>'I want a proper life - like other people'<br />&lsquo;people look down on me&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;with good gear, I&rsquo;ll make them look up to me&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;these shops have never been for me&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;people who buy there get respect&rsquo;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em>&lsquo;there&rsquo;re not enough jobs&rsquo;<br /></em><em>&lsquo;what&rsquo;s the point of trying if there&rsquo;s no hope&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;when you can, you must grab any chance that comes along&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;what have I got to lose?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted a really good watch&rsquo;</em></p>

<p align="center">___________________</p>
<p>Two careers work comfort zones here:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no underlining</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not a careers-work concern, no need to get involved<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; no ticks</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing we can work with, leave it to the courts</p>
<p>Reform is not a comfort zone, but it means we have something to offer.&nbsp; To settle for &lsquo;no need to get involved&rsquo; leaves us empty-handed.&nbsp; It means we can only seek support for doing what we have been doing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a limp response to change - expected, unimpressive, dismissible.&nbsp; But acknowledging the need for reform is strong - unexpected, constructive, promising.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember hearing any of these &lsquo;quotes&rsquo; on any of the streets.&nbsp; I don't recall seeing them on any banners or posters.&nbsp; They came up later, usually from <a title="kidscompany" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/camila-batmanghelidjh-caring-costs-ndash-but-so-do-riots-2333991.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">people in a position to speak for them</a>.&nbsp; The looters were not seeking our understanding.&nbsp; They know about the futility of explanation.&nbsp; These are, then, &lsquo;unspoken quotes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They are an attempt to reflect an tacit inner life.&nbsp; If we can gather no clues to those thoughts and feelings we&rsquo;d underline nothing and tick nothing.&nbsp; Is that it?</p>
<p>People who break the law should be arrested, tried and sentenced by the same rules as all criminals.&nbsp; It's a civil right - justice, not populist retribution.&nbsp; In a law court, not a &lsquo;reality&rsquo; tv show. &nbsp;The risk is that once people have offloaded their anger onto a punishment that satisfies them, they can be persuaded &lsquo;job done!&rsquo;.&nbsp; It would be a collective failure.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>in politics</strong><br />So, was this not political?&nbsp; It was not done in the name of Mark Duggan - not his cause.&nbsp; But politics played a hand.&nbsp; In global conditions governments are weak. &nbsp;What they can do about anybody&rsquo;s chances-in-life is constrained by the consequences in massive monetary shifts.&nbsp; So they look for compensating feel-good domestic policies.&nbsp; It means attending to the electorally and economically strong.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t know how many of the rioters see themselves as part of any of those constituencies.&nbsp; But where there are no votes there&rsquo;s weakened political interest.&nbsp; That means that strong constituencies can capture government. &nbsp;And that can consign the poor to the margins.&nbsp; The rioters might have considered campaigning against the politics that fails them.&nbsp; But they didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Though it is failing them.</p>
<p><strong>in education</strong><br />Some of this might have been examined at school - in &lsquo;citizenship&rsquo;.&nbsp; Great teachers know that effective learning has to relate to experience.&nbsp; Students are certainly helped to fit into their experience.&nbsp; But the poor experience is that the world they are asked to fit into already belongs to other people.&nbsp; Teachers call it learning for cooperation, but it feels like compliance - more like jumping through hoops than useful learning.&nbsp; Useful learning is working out how to change things.&nbsp; And the looters seemed capable of doing that.&nbsp; The riots are not a failure of wit or energy.&nbsp; Let them find something they can see is really worth doing, and then try to stop them!&nbsp; Some of the people on those Blackberries are able seriously to out-manoeuvre the police.&nbsp; What a waste of talent.</p>
<p><strong>in culture</strong><br />Commerce has been able to push consumer choice to the top of the policy totem pole.&nbsp; But some commerce is worried about the riots.&nbsp; It looks as though it will recover from the loss; but some is reported to be worried about damage to product images.&nbsp; Many of the looted products are associated with crime, not because of the riots, but because of the promotional iconography.&nbsp; They are sold as &rsquo;up-for-it&rsquo; - tough, independent, ruthless, bold... like ex-cons.&nbsp; Such imagery shapes a culture - feeding into what people believe, value and expect in their lives.&nbsp; It becomes part of a media-branding complex, with media able to capture audiences - with cool, celebrated, rap-and-gossip - and media then able to promote influential interests to whatever audience they have been able to capture.&nbsp; Some of the riots had family support; but why assume that the adults-at-home are any less influenced by that m-b complex than their children?&nbsp; The government says it can&rsquo;t be on every corner, but the m-b complex is on every corner.&nbsp; And it needs its customers to forget the violent imagery built into product branding.&nbsp; So watch out for posters and press releases, disentangling those brands from that imagery.&nbsp; As failures go, this is spectacular.</p>
<p><strong>in community</strong><br />The term &lsquo;broken society&rsquo; is, itself, badly damaged.&nbsp; It labels as &lsquo;bad influences&rsquo; people who are, often-enough, heroically dealing with bad influences.&nbsp; But - with so much innocent suffering, crime and heart-break - being able to punish somebody can be a slight compensatory comfort.&nbsp; And that needs a clear separation between &lsquo;them&rsquo; and &lsquo;us&rsquo; - maintaining that &lsquo;they&rsquo; are not like &lsquo;us&rsquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not universal - we rightly honour the bereaved, magnificently calling for shared restraint.&nbsp; But the us-and-them segregation was there long before the riots.&nbsp; And you don&rsquo;t have to invade the gated communities of the sequestered super-rich to find it.&nbsp; Sometimes the fissure is inside a post-code.&nbsp; But these near but gentrified neighbours face in different direction - buying in different stores, enjoying different venues, send their children to different schools, avoid each other&rsquo;s gaze - strangers to each other.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easier to label a stranger &lsquo;scum&rsquo;, &lsquo;fascist&rsquo;, &lsquo;inhuman&rsquo;, &lsquo;evil&rsquo;.&nbsp; Easier still if convinced of one&rsquo;s own righteousness.&nbsp; But the broom-brandishing will work better when it shares its clean-up with the culprits. &nbsp;It will open a conversation between the perps, the victims and the families.&nbsp; It is what teachers, police and neighbourhoods <a title="restorativeevidence" href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/RJ_full_report.pdf" target="_self" rel="nofollow">are finding effective</a>.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t repair what is broken by bearing down on it.&nbsp; Is a word we have so-far not heard enough of &lsquo;healing&rsquo;?&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">________________________</p>
<p>This is political, but not like SOLIDARNOSC or the Jarrow March.&nbsp; Does citizenship ever mention <em>Lech Wałęsa</em> or Ellen Wilkinson?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that part of its students&rsquo; story?&nbsp; Do they know that they&rsquo;ve got one?</p>
<p>Speaking of class - I suppose it&rsquo;s not out of the question that some rioter from a middle-class home has been asked...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;get me a Breitling' - nothing too gross!&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>If and when we get the demographics we&rsquo;ll know better about that.&nbsp; But, for the moment, much of what we are witnessing is the poor trying to compensate themselves.&nbsp; I doubt they see it as immoral - some take their allegiance to each other to be moral.&nbsp; As many other people do.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the rioters have made it harder-than-ever for anybody to defend for their interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the call is for &lsquo;a single minded crime-fighter - to lead the Met.&nbsp; The call doesn&rsquo;t speak to me of the breadth-of-mind we need. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s harder-than-ever to hold people&rsquo;s interest in that kind of understanding.&nbsp; But it has never been more necessary to try.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s a critical challenge for careers work.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it <a title="professionalism" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" target="_self" rel="nofollow">careers work&rsquo;s task</a> to enable people to take hold of their stake in society?&nbsp; It needs to be...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;tough on career - tough on the causes of career&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Suppose &lsquo;unspoken quotes&rsquo; offered a basis for working with these young men and women.&nbsp; The probability is that it will be in schools.&nbsp; Although that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it is only for students.&nbsp; School&rsquo;s can and should be accessible to anybody, at any stage in life.&nbsp; It would mean seeing our work in a changing relationship with both policy and commerce. This would unfold an appreciation of the subtle and pervasive influence of culture and society.&nbsp; That would re-work our partner- and stakeholder-networks.&nbsp; There would be a new basis for research-and-development and for exchanging feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And also for attracting support. &nbsp;But if the support we seek is for what we have been doing, then we&rsquo;ll be dismissed as predictable, unimpressive, self-serving.&nbsp; But to set out proposals for a comprehending reform of our work, that will invite interest in what is engaging, constructive, promising.</p>
<p>It means understanding not only that the poor don&rsquo;t listen to us - but that they don&rsquo;t much want to talk to us.&nbsp; But, as long as we can underline and tick some &lsquo;unspoken quotes&rsquo;, we can learn to hear what they are not yet saying.</p>
<p>Is that possible?&nbsp; If so, what an agenda for careers-work innovation.</p>    </div>
