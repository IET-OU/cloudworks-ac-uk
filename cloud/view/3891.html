        <p>Reflecting dominant modernist thinking statutory services consider &lsquo;mental capacity&rsquo; (MC), &lsquo;black and minority ethnics&rsquo; (BME), &lsquo;adult&rsquo; and &lsquo;learning difficulty&rsquo; (LD) &lsquo;real&rsquo; and &lsquo;objective&rsquo; categories. Influenced by poststructuralism and intersectionality this presentation offers an alternative view. Postructuralism suggests that MC, BME, and LD are imposed through power (Agger 1991, Barvosa-Carter 2001, Denzin, 2001). Extending this thinking further, intersectionality postulates that MC, BME, and LD are social disadvantages, which interact to maintain oppression of certain social groups (Davis 2008, Anthias 2007, Phoenix and Pattynama 2006). Given these positions my research aims to explore how adult service-users simultaneously classified BME and LD come to acquire the label of (in)capacity. It also aims to explore the differences between adult service-users&rsquo; and professionals&rsquo; conception of LD, BME, and MC, and how the views of professionals prevail. Finally, my research will ascertain whether mental capacity assessments are used to deny services to BME LD&rsquo;s (Mir et al. 2004).</p>
<p>Although my views on methodology are still evolving at present, I suggest that ethnography could address the substantive issues highlighted above. With research on mental capacity currently dominated by quantitative methodology, ethnography is arguably consistent with the call for &lsquo;alternative methods&rsquo; (Berghmans et al. 2004). Some ethnographic methods also accord with the turn to subjectivity in LD and ethnicity research (Gunaratnam 2003, Walmsley 2001). Therefore methodologically my research supplements the literature on LD and ethnicity. As well as this, it addresses the substantive gap in the literature on the interplay between MC, LD, and BME.</p>

			<p>He is a social worker by training &ndash; and started in HSC in December. He wants to talk about the Mental Act which is huge and complicated so might just scratch on the surface. He&rsquo;ll want to talk about the ethics as there might be lots of implications if people are not mentally capable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;MCA (Mental Capacity Act)</p>
<p>Mental capacity is the ability to make a decision:</p>
<p>Doe the person has a condition that affects their cognitive activity &ndash; and does this condition affecting their ability to act/decide on the here and now (?). The people who will most likely be implanting the act would be social workers.</p>
<p>There are 5 key principles in the MCA</p>
<ul>
<li>Presumption that every adult is able to make a decision</li>
<li>WE have to help the people to make the decision if unable to do it</li>
<li>Act requires us to think that people have the right to make decisions even though eccentric</li>
<li>Must make decisions on their behalf for their best interests</li>
<li>It has to be least restrictive as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>There is some implications for Social Sciences research &ndash; as it is under intrusive research and needs to get ethical approval. Researchers are not decision makers but researchers may have to assess someone&rsquo;s capacity to make a decision for informed consent.</p>
<p>For some people who may lose capacity in the future, they can set down what they want now (powers of attorney etc.)</p>
<p>Tensions and Gaps</p>
<ul>
<li>The two stage model of assessing capacity and the stigmatisation i.e. not being able to make full capacity for themselves</li>
<li>Social work literature tends to describe things rather than analyse each provision &ndash; or each service user group. The literature looks at the MCA as one coherent act when it is not</li>
<li>There is a gap in literature where certain markers of social inequality interact with assessing people (?) i.e. the interplay between LD, BME and competence</li>
<li>There is an assumption of objectivity in empirical research &ndash; as it lacks serious theoretical analysis. Mental capacity is seen as something you have and can measure 
<ul>
<li>Operationalisation is difficult &ndash; and issues of reliability, validity and replicability</li>
<li>Does not account for ethnicity and culture</li>
<li>Literature focuses on older and psychiatric patients</li>
<li>Little empirical evidence from theoretical research</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If mental capacity is not an objective category but socially produced &ndash; we need to look poststructuralism and intersectionality, and we need to look at how different social groups are already disadvantaged are drawn into the confines of the act (?).</p>
<p>How does culture affect the assessment of mental capacity? Mental capacity is seen as rather benign and we need to see what influences that have.</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>He is looking at the ethical challenges such as labelling someone as having mental incapacity &ndash; and these people may be already marginalised from the society and these people may look at him as someone as helping them rather than a researcher.</p>
<p>He has to ask if the mental capacity act is such a big landmark should it be made easier for research to be conducted into the act.</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p><em>He does not think that the MCA is an all or nothing ... but it fluctuates from time to time. And you probably know this but you conveyed it that way.</em></p>
<p>I know that, but probably in my work as social work just wondering if someone has already been found as being mental incapacity, I&rsquo;m just wondering if this would influence future assessment of them.</p>
<p><em>Are you going to look at how the person has been assessed how they feel about this?</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the angle that I&rsquo;m coming from &ndash; most of the mental capacity there is a sort of power-play ... he wants to look at service-user point of view particularly from a different culture. If someone says &ldquo;we think you don&rsquo;t have capacity in this instance&rdquo;, how does that view prevail.</p>
<p><em>Is there anything in the literature or work, are there any social work culture or practices? </em></p>
<p>The MCA should be supported by social workers and starts from empowerment &ndash; i.e. demonstrate their capacity. In the day-to-day environment when you have to make quick decisions &ndash; the act is fluid etc &ndash; and he is not certain whether he has answers to that.</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m not clear whether your focus is on participant-observations and whether it will be service-users or on both the service users and the social workers? And if it is both how are you going to manage that?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent some time with the social team and see who they&rsquo;ve identified and then see it from the service-user point of view &ndash; that is why there is huge ethical implications.</p>
<p><em>She is saying the ESRC (?) sees the MCA as a very badly worded act to do ethically approved research (?) &ndash; but thinks your work would be a good research that could be illuminated and your research is commended.</em></p>			<div class="posted-by">
