                   <p>From Paul Jarman:</p>
<p>I don't know whether this is ann appropriate discussion point for Thursday, but I have one thing which I would very much like to raise, primarily because I think it has gone totally unnoticed hitherto.&nbsp; And the reason for that is quite simple: there are scarcely any visually-impaired Ph.D students.&nbsp; I stress that when I use the term visually impaired here, I don't mean individuals who, through the use of some kind of magnification, can read print.&nbsp; I mean purely those who, like myself, have no sight or insufficient ever to access printed material.&nbsp; I am fairly sure that, when I obtained my own Ph.D in January 2010, I became the first totally blind individual ever in the UK - and possibly far beyond - to obtain a doctorate in English Literature.&nbsp; Looking at developments in post-grad education over the last few years however - and I openly admit that I am primarily talking about in the Humanities here - it seems to me that all HEIs have dramatically increased the pressure upon research students to complete theses within a three-year period, or thereabouts.&nbsp; To what extent this is due to external pressure from government, I can't say, but what I do know is that absolutely no thought whatsoever has been given to students who cannot access printed material.&nbsp; I firmly believe - and this is derived both from personal experience and from other students whom I have met - that, while not being able to access print is a barrier at under-graduate level, the issue is multiplied tenfold when it comes to being a research student and - let's face it - essentially working alone.&nbsp; I actually think that this is one of the primary reasons why visually-impaired students don't tackle post-grad research.&nbsp; The sheer amount of organisation required to even gather one's material to use is just beyond anything that any sighted person can ever imagine.&nbsp; I unquestionably used up more hours in the organisation and co-ordination of my readers than I ever actually did on the thesis itself.&nbsp; I admit that I chose a rather astonishing subject for one in my situation, as it primarily involved researching eighteenth-century hand-written manuscripts, but why should a visually-impaired individual be restricted by subject area.&nbsp; It is very apparent to me that the more universities put pressure upon students to complete theses within a given period, the less encouragement there will be for totally blind individuals to even bother starting a research degree.&nbsp; I can honestly say that if any blind individual came to me now to ask for advice on whether they should or should not bother attempting a research degree in the Humanities, I would be strongly tempted to advise them against it, unless they really were prepared to give up the next six or so years of their life to little else.&nbsp; I think that this is an issue that needs tackling nationally, and not on a college by college basis.&nbsp; Somehow we need to create a real culture of understanding at the highest levels of how difficult it is to tackle research in what is still a print-dominated world, and, what's more, a world where digitisation is actually adding to the problem faster than even the printed book ever did.</p>        </div>
