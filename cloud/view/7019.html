        <h3><strong>This is my Learning Journal for OLDS MOOC</strong></h3>
<p>I will be using this space reflecting on this course</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Week 1 reflections</strong></h2>
<p><strong>My learning outcomes (before start)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>defining my personnal workspace</li>
<li>defining my learning design project</li>
<li>sharing ideas with other</li>
<li>defining a space for collaboration</li>
<li>defining 'Learning Design'</li>
</ul>
<p>Before assessing if my LO have been achieved, I would like to start first by comparing my feelings with the ones I had during a module of the MAODE (Master of Online and distance education, OU). I think it could be interesting to compare a cMOOC with an OU online course.</p>
<p>To it, i will use the<a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-tivities/5stage.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong> Salmon's 5 stage model for e-tivities</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-tivities/5stage.shtml#1" rel="nofollow">Stage 1 - Access &amp; Motivation:&nbsp; </a></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;E-tivities at this stage therefore need to provide a gentle but interesting introduction to using the technological platform and acknowledgement of the feelings surrounding using technology and meeting new people through the online environment. Even the most apparently confident individuals need support at the beginning.&gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>OU module</strong>: Usually all the information concerning the course can be found on Moodle. Everything is perfectly explained form the start (learning outcomes, ressources, 'wellcome messages from the course team', interaction modes mainly through online group forum on Moodle, wiki features, assignment, Library services, etc..) As participants, you just need to follow instructions. You work in group (about 10 people) with a tutor. Group communication and interaction are done on the tutor group's forum on Moodle. All the ressources and tools are centralised on Moodle.&nbsp; Moodle is rather user-friendly and intuitive.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>OLDS MOOC</strong>: All the needed informations can be found on the oldsmooc's website. I've found them extermely well organised and explained. Thanks to the url links and explanation, It has been easy to create my personal workplace (clouds and cloudspaces) on cloudworks and to post first messages on google forums.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-tivities/5stage.shtml#2" rel="nofollow">Stage 2 - Socialisation</a></li>
<li>&lt;&gt;
<ul>
<li><strong>OU module</strong>: An ice-breaker is usually organised on a general forum where all course's particpants can meet and on the group's forum. Both forum are on the same place on the course's space on Mood<br />Personnaly, after 2 -3 days, I usually feel reassured because I know who are the other fellow students in my group and the tutor who will support us. I know what I will have to do, how and where the interaction and activities will take place because everything is centralised on moodle, and few tools are used to interact. <strong><em>At this stage</em>,</strong> usually the tutor&nbsp;is building the bridges between the participants.</li>
<li><strong>OLDS MOOC</strong>: Once the personal workplace created, the problems have started :-( !!! I find difficult to find information on cloudworks and to follow the huge number of messages on the different threads on the google forums. Compared to the OU module where discussions occur between about 10 people, it's much more difficult to follow the discussion. Discussion appears in different places on cloudworks,&nbsp; google forums, google + , twitter. .... I think that I will take a little time to become familiar with all this. Concerning the study circle, Arthur Oglesby has taken the initiative to create a team workplace for participants interested by digital literacy.&nbsp; <em><strong>At this stage</strong></em>, the bridges are built by us (the participants) around a common topic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-tivities/5stage.shtml#3" rel="nofollow">Stage 3 - Information Exchange</a></li>
<li>&lt;&lt; At this stage, information can be exchanged and co-operative tasks can be achieved. The big advantage of asynchronicity is that everyone can explore information at their own pace and react to it before hearing the views and interpretations of others. Participants&rsquo; learning requires two kinds of interaction: interaction with the course content and interaction with people, namely the e-moderator(s) and other people.&gt;&gt;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><strong>OU module</strong>: &nbsp; <strong><em>At this stage</em>,</strong> the information exchange is done through the asynchronous group's forum on Moodleexclusively between the group members and the tutor.&nbsp; In some module, the synchronous tool Eluminate has been used one or two times for a lived session<strong><em>.&nbsp;</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>OLDS MOOC</strong>: <em><strong>At this stage</strong></em>, the interactions occur not only between participants in the study circle, with also with the course team and all the participants through twitter and the different google forums. OLDSMOOC encourage the participants to self-organised their communication tools, enhancing by then their PLE (Personal Leanring Environment). The interactions between the participants are richer.&nbsp; We can use the ones we want to communication. In our study circle, we have started to use: cloudworks, mindmeister, google forum, twitter, google docs, scoop it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-tivities/5stage.shtml#4" rel="nofollow">Stage 4 - Knowledge Construction</a> : will occur in the following weeks</li>
<li><a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-tivities/5stage.shtml#5" rel="nofollow">Stage 5 - Development</a>: will occur in the following weeks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I've learnt during w1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>defining my personnal workspace: <strong>done</strong></li>
<li>defining my learning design project : <strong>done </strong></li>
<li>sharing ideas with other: <strong>yes</strong>&nbsp; I've posted different messages on Google forum and comments on different design projects on cloudworks. I've joined a study circle On digital Literacy.</li>
<li>defining a space for collaboration:&nbsp; Thanks to Arthur Oglesby yes ! I think that we have now different tools to communicate and share our ideas and ressources. I've tried to contribute by creating a scoop it</li>
<li>defining 'Learning Design' : <strong>more or less</strong>&nbsp; :_(I've participated to the Google forum discussion, but I've to admit that I spend most of my time this week to become familiar with the OLDS learning environment than on learning design reflections and readings ....</li>

			<h2>My plan for week 2</h2>
<p>I'm interested to discover what 'learner context' means and how I could use it for learning design.</p>
<h3>Week 2 objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the concept of 'learner context' and its advantages to use it&nbsp; in learning design</li>
<li>Learn how to contextualise my project</li>
<li>Learning from others: Sharing and assessing other's scenarios</li>
<li>Reflections on how to apply this new concept to my own pratice.</li>

			<h2>Week 2 : current thought about about context learning design</h2>
<p>Contextualising my project has been an interesting task. I understand better the role of defining the context, It has helped me to assesss the&nbsp;feasibility of my project. When I've tried to write the narrative scenario by introducing actors and goals, describing the settings, puting the events in order, I've realised that my project wasn't enough defined. I have not described precisely the learning outcomes.</p>
<p>So I need to return back to my scenario&nbsp; and define better my project:-(</p>
<p>The Learning Outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate the ability to create a personal learning environment incorporating elements of OU digital study practices and external applications and environments. <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/subsites/dilframework/skill1.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Level 3 of the OU framwork, skill: 'Understand and engage in digital practices')</a></li>
<li>Demonstrate effective use of social and/or professional online networks outside the OU study community. <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/subsites/dilframework/skill1.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Level 3 of the OU framwork, skill: 'Understand and engage in digital practices')</a></li>
<li>Articulate the characteristics of digital scholarship in the relevant subject and/or professional area <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/subsites/dilframework/skill1.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Master Level of the OU framwork, skill: 'Understand and engage in digital practices')</a></li>
