        <p>A policy commitment to an all-age careers service will get a lot of favourable attention from our people.&nbsp; But there are underlying issues.&nbsp; One of the most pressing is about how any service is best located in relation to its users.&nbsp; It calls for designing a service in terms of...</p>
<p align="center"><em>how people become aware of it,<br /></em><em>how easy it is to get to,</em><em><br />how it looks-and-feels to its users,</em><em><br />how it attracts the people who most need it,<br /></em><em>how it ensures that a good start leads naturally to on-going use,<br />and how it gets located in people&rsquo;s natural networks.</em></p>
<p>These are features of accessibility and credibility.&nbsp; And most people don&rsquo;t get any kind feel for them solely on claims to operational expertise or evidence of training.&nbsp; They want to know about who they are dealing with.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why rates-of-use depend on how the service inhabits its society.&nbsp; People need to recognise it as belonging to them - linked to their lives.</p>
<p>Most people have links to schools - whether in past-experience or through current family-and-neighbourhood.&nbsp; A good many of our schools have worked hard to offer a comprehending and welcoming ambience.&nbsp; And, for a time, it looked as though guidance workers would be based in schools.&nbsp; But it's hard to see what can happen now.</p>
<p>This blog takes a look at the background dynamics of this situation.&nbsp; It considers what seems likely in restructuring schools and reforming curriculum.&nbsp; But, most importantly, it looks for consequences in the ambience of schools.&nbsp; If, because of these developments, we cannot see how innovative careers work can be located in schools, then we are not going to give up.&nbsp; We will go elsewhere. &nbsp;So we now need to stand back, and look around.</p>
<p>The government claims that it&rsquo;s restructuring of schooling will liberate us all.&nbsp; But what we know of the US and Swedish experience suggests that such reforms offer freedom only to those in a position to grasp it.&nbsp; These dynamics will exclude too many who are not in that position, and who do not see things that way.</p>
<p>However, it is not structures but curriculum which will - for good or ill - do most to re-shape life-chances.&nbsp; Ministers plainly favour a subject-based, content-driven curriculum - dedicated to rising standards.&nbsp; It accords with the use of curriculum as a means of maximising competitive advancement.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a narrow basis for working with schools.&nbsp; Any progressive idea, that curriculum is to enable people in their management of a pressurised life in a changing world, needs more - linking subject-to-subject, school-to-community, and learning-to-life. &nbsp;The organisations supporting such movement in curriculum are being dismantled.</p>
<p>And what of ambience?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too soon to say what the effects will be of the take-up on new structures and reformed curriculum.&nbsp; And, so, we can&rsquo;t yet know what that will do to management style, staff commitment and student engagement. The rhetoric of reform is for a releasing local innovation.&nbsp; But, as innovators, we are entitled to our doubts.&nbsp; Can narrowly conceived, cash-strapped and risk-averse schools be drivers of the kind reform which will welcome inventive and inclusive careers work?</p>
<p>Time to step back, and wonder &lsquo;which way is forward?&rsquo;.&nbsp; Knowing why any careers-work initiative is &lsquo;a good idea&rsquo; has never been that obvious.&nbsp; And, for more than two decades, the most pressing answers to the question have been tied to policy - its frameworks, its performance indicators and its funding streams.&nbsp; Careers work has been an enthusiastic player.</p>
<p>At the same time links to commerce have tightened.&nbsp; Schooling has long been under pressure to supply the qualities needed for &rsquo;a job of work&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, for most people, work never was a way of matching self to personal fulfillment.&nbsp; And now less than ever.&nbsp; A consequence is that we have lost chances to learn how to work with a wider range of culturally-rooted ways of seeing how life, work and self are brought together differently in different localities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, speaking of commercial pressures, education is increasingly seen as a marketable product.&nbsp; And who knows how far that trend will go?&nbsp; Or how a school-based careers service would stand in relation to it?</p>
<p>Too many open questions here.&nbsp; But underlying all of them are the dynamics of who, in the future, will have the stronger pull on schooling - national government or global commerce?&nbsp; It is certainly too soon to say how changes in structure, curriculum and ambience will manage things. &nbsp;But we would be foolish to allow ourselves to be nudged into whatever marginal space that resolution assigns us.</p>
<p>So what else is there?&nbsp; &lsquo;The big society&rsquo; is urged where individuals make government smaller - through individual volunteering, and by a responsible citizenry.&nbsp; But individuals already have roles in government - as voters and constituents.&nbsp; And in commerce - as shoppers and investors.&nbsp; The &lsquo;big society&rsquo; is a weak answer to a tendentious question.&nbsp; We may wonder whether its grand-parentage is Lady Bountiful or Reaganomics.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean that we should dispose of the case for strengthening what is much more usefully understood as &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Civil society is where a person finds life-roles outside of what markets might urge or policy might require.&nbsp; They are in family and neighborhood attachments, in cultural and working affiliations, in sporting allegiances and leisure pursuits.&nbsp; We all do it: rich and poor, tough-minded 'maximisers' and easy-going 'sufficers', the 'included' and the 'excluded'.</p>
<p>None of these commitments need call up political or commercial interests.&nbsp; And we all learn in them all.&nbsp; Indeed - before the industrial revolution, and after it - civil society was, and is, education&rsquo;s natural home.&nbsp; At the extremes it can mean &lsquo;de-schooling society&rsquo;.&nbsp; Though, more probably, it means finding too much of schooling too narrowly constrained to be useful for more than front-loading into recruitment and selection.&nbsp; Whatever we find, the greater the squeeze on natural, informal and recognisable locations for life-relevant learning, the more we should work with them.</p>
<p>The squeeze is intensifying.&nbsp; The boundaries between commerce, civil society and government have never been secure.&nbsp; Pincer-pressure from commerce and government is relentless - it&rsquo;s what they are there to do. &nbsp;But something else is happening: educationists are occupying and refurnishing a reclaimed civil-social space.&nbsp; A growing number of voluntary, social-enterprise, and charitable organisations are:</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vigorously consulting with local government - on which initiatives its neighbourhoods need to be established, protected and extended;<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; firmly voicing resurgent professional concerns for the future of education - to the point of blocking government requirements;<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authoritatively rescuing proven ideas for useful curriculum reform - in defiance of government rejection;<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; widely coordinating curriculum development - for consortiums with shared programme intentions;<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creatively setting up community-based programmes of learning, particularly in learning-for-living - moving from personal health to the protection of the environment.</p>
<p>Oh! and:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; constructively canvassing innovative ideas for careers-work action - working them into useful and effective programmes for contemporary careers work.</p>
<p>As you can see, this is no rag-bag movement.&nbsp; All are developing new lines of interactive exchange; opening up new settings for reform; and engaging helpers, learners and stakeholders in new partnerships-for-learning.&nbsp; All can work with schools and colleges - or without them.</p>
<p>Neither is this an escape into nostalgia - there is no way back.&nbsp; And - anyway - it is impossible to see how the fast-moving and adaptive exchanges we now need can be enabled except through the internet.</p>
<p>Progressive advance needs progressive energy.&nbsp; Where it can be found in schools, good.&nbsp; Where it can&rsquo;t, we must look elsewhere.</p>
