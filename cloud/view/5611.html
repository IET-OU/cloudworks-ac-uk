			<p align="center"><strong>I Have A Dream</strong></p>
<p>I have a dream that one day we will see a commitment by all service providers in health and social welfare to employ a percentage of people with a lived experience of having needed services and because the lived experience of these people is recognised to be a vital ingredient in providing effective, hopeful and connected services. It is my conviction that we will not see change that really makes a difference to the lives of people who have become stuck in the system until this situation comes about. The endless debates and initiatives promoting user involvement, user participation, Stronger in Partnership, and many others will continue to frustrate and give the illusion of progress when the reality is a failure to value diversity enough to challenge the dominant professional, evidence based, clinical, medical, socially controlling, expert, and risk-averse frameworks that currently hold sway.</p>
<p>I have worked in the mental health field over the last forty years and I am only too aware of how important it has been to begin to give a voice to people who have learnt from their personal experience. Our knowledge of voice hearing, self-harm and self-management has changed dramatically as a result of just listening to people and their stories of recovery.</p>
<p>In other fields the story is the same. A friend of mine who has been working in the disability movement since he had both his legs amputated often declares that the amputation was the best thing that ever happened to him. He likes himself as a person because of the work he does in supporting other people. This kind of connectedness did not feature in his life before the operation. Sitting next to him when he was talking to a lady whose husband faced similar operations was a revelation, the kind of support he was able to give could not be given by professionals no matter how experienced and well trained they were.</p>
<p>The other morning I was struck by a discussion about diabetes on the television. The GP had been rolled in following a report that indicated that if diabetes was not managed effectively by young people the implications for them in later life were more severe. It was not long before the GP was blaming the people diagnosed with diabetes for not listening to their GPs, albeit she did acknowledge there was some responsibility on the GP to communicate more effectively. In reality it is not appropriate to expect GPs to engage in life style issues and concerns. Being lectured to by any professional is likely to fail in most instances. What is needed are people who have learnt to make these changes for themselves to support other people tackling these very difficult challenges. Investment in lived experience could make the difference and begin to reduce the impact that neglecting these issues can have on individual people and the system.</p>
<p>If looked at from another perspective there is a certain irony and hypocrisy in the new scheme to get people on disability allowances back to work and indeed in the many schemes that predate this one. The people who could bring most to the development of a scheme that has at its core a desire to engage with every individual around their interest in restoring roles, status and connectedness in their lives are people with lived experience. Indeed how can this government, and successive governments in the past, expect general employers to value the contribution that people, who have often been out of work for many years, can bring to an industry or place of work when the organisations that are charged with supporting people into employment fail to recognise or value the strengths that people with lived experience can bring to the process?</p>
<p>It is my hope that you, along with me, can use this cloud to tell stories that give weight to the lives and potential of people who have survived whatever trauma they have been through and who have learnt lessons that can begin to make real change in a way that values the lives of ordinary people.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p align="center"><strong>What is Peer Support Anyway?</strong></p>
<p>I was talking to Helen Glover this morning about the challenges in getting support, or recruiting people, who can give support in a way that enhances personal learning and recovery. Helen put it this way:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If you go to the gym and you are offered two trainers. The first trainer is someone who has probably been quite fit in the past but who has now let it all go, is on the pies, the beer and does not like to go too long before the next fag. The second trainer is clearly very fit and has a work-out routine which they use every day as part of a personal plan.&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>Which trainer would you chose? I suspect there may be some people who read this that will chose the first trainer. You may feel that this person will give you an easy ride and will not be too bothered if you get fit or not.</p>
<p>Most people, from Helen&rsquo;s experience, chose the second trainer. This person is not just a teacher but is someone who is living the part. There is more likely to be some energy, some passion, some understanding, some personal knowledge, some commitment, some role modelling, and some hope of success in this choice.</p>
<p>So in looking for Peer Support do we chose someone who is stuck in what they see as their illness or someone who has learnt, and is continuing to learn to manage their life. Someone in fact who is learning, or has learnt, how to overcome their negative thoughts, feelings, and/or behaviours, and who is attempting to live a full life? &nbsp;</p>
<p>In making what we might see as the obvious choice we do however need to recognise that there are potential risks here too. This person may think that their personal regime, what is working for them, you should start doing right now &ndash; this is the only way! Whether it is the trainer above or someone offering peer support the consequences of engaging with someone who &lsquo;prescribes&rsquo; solutions can be equally hazardous. The Peer Supporter we are looking for is someone who listens, hears and learns from you&rsquo; and with you - someone who is a fellow traveller, who shares their lived experience, as you go on a journey of discovery together.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p align="center"><strong>Learning From the Lived Experience of Rioting</strong></p>
<p>A friend commenting on the response within our culture to the recent riots and looting on the streets of London, and many major cities around the UK, observed that in Norway where, over 70 people were killed, they were focusing on how to create a more inclusive society, whereas the dominant focus in the UK has been to suppress and criminalise the young people who have been caught up in the hysteria of the moment.</p>
<p>A great deal of attention has been given over to try and understand why such unacceptable behaviour has been released in the wave of destruction across the England. People from every political persuasion have been quick to tell us how this behaviour reinforces their political ideology, experts have given us sociological and psychological explanations for this behaviour, conspiracy theorists have already suggested that maybe the orchestration of these events has come from sources close to the Police who want to see Police numbers maintained against a background of cuts, and possibly most worryingly the media have focused on vilifying individual young people who &lsquo;should have known better&rsquo; but who have got caught up in the excitement and hysteria of the moment.</p>
<p>While all of this activity is understandable there are real dangers that it will not only be the young people who were actively involved in the riots and looting but a much wider spread of young people, who are seen as &lsquo;other&rsquo;, who become demonised and disconnected from the society as a whole.</p>
<p>Much has been said about fairness in developing policies to deal with the recession over the last few years but the impact of the policies has been disproportionately felt by a lot of young people who can see little future for themselves within our society and have become disconnected, alienated, despairing, with little sense of self-worth or hope. They see themselves, and are seen by many other people, as unworthy of a place in our society. Between young people and the wider society there has been developing a lack of mutual respect and a growing sense that many young people, particularly those wearing hoodies, are to be feared.</p>
<p>The challenge is to find ways in which these young can become &lsquo;worthy&rsquo; in their own eyes and in the eyes of others, where mutual respect can be regained against this background of fear. The culture of punishment and retribution will see many young people go to prison for the first time and, while this may act as a deterrent to some, there are dangers of increasing disconnectedness, alienation, despair and unworthiness within this group of people.</p>
<p>COLE* does not have the solution to these challenges. It is recognised that there will need to be many avenues to pursue. However COLE can begin to offer an investment in the people who were caught up in the riots and looting, recognition of their personal abilities to use sophisticated technology and social media to find, through them, solutions that they can take forward. There will be pressures, in this time of economic restraint, to find resources to reinvest in Police numbers, and the traditional roles of other agencies, rather than directing these resources to find solutions within and alongside these young people.</p>
<p>The Government may want to consult with a former Chief of Police from Los Angeles who heralds a zero tolerance approach but they might be encouraged to look at a programme from the late 1960s, run by Doug Grant and Dennie Briggs, in Vacaville Prison, where they worked directly with a group of gang leaders from Los Angeles within the prison. Many these young people went on to lead crime reduction and other initiatives in the States before the policies of subsequent political regimes went back to the &lsquo;old&rsquo; ways that have seen the gang culture of Los Angeles flourish over subsequent decades.</p>
<p>As a College, a group of like-minded people with a common purpose, COLE can offer an opportunity to bring a group of young people who were involved in the riots and/or looting and who feel they have learnt something that could open up a new way forward, for an initial seminar to explore how this learning from their lived experience can be of value to them and the way forward.</p>
<p>If you were involved, if a member of your family was involved, or if you are supporting individuals or families who were involved, and would like to bring your learning to this seminar please contact:</p>
<p>Derek Turner&nbsp; <a href="mailto:turner.derek6@gmail.com" rel="nofollow">turner.derek6@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COLE, College of Lived Experience, is a developing network of people who share the view that solutions to many persistent social, psychological and health related issues are to be found within the learning that people have gained from struggling to overcome their personal challenges.</p>
<p>The aims of COLE are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide opportunities to learn from personal stories</li>
<li>Support learning opportunities for individual people that enable them gain the range of skills needed to influence and change policies that can lead to entrapment in social, psychological and health systems of care and support.</li>
<li>Create a climate where the learning from the lived experience of overcoming becomes a vital component of the employment strategy within organisations providing care and support.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To date COLE has received no funding and is a loose association of like-minded people.</p>
<p>Cole will not accept funding from sources where the funding is outcome or target related.</p>

			<p>The Government announced today that they plan to build on the work of the Howard League for Penal Reform and to have a mentor for everyone who leaves prison. To do this they plan to draw upon the lived experience of ex-offenders.</p>
<p>There is a precedence for this work if we look back at the New Careers for the Poor programmes in USA in the 1960s. As mentioned above J. Douglas Grant and Dennie Briggs pioneered work inside Vacaville Prison that had a profound affect on many programmes outside prison. Many of these programmes were funded against a reduction in crime system as proposed by the government in this case. Follow link to explore background information to the work of Grant and Briggs.</p>
<p>Both Grant and Briggs were strongly influenced by the social learning ideas of Maxwell Jones. Perhaps there is a need to begin to re-explore social learning and the therapeutic community as ways of building upon lived experience.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
