<p><em>By Uffe Frandsen, Video Journalist at University College Sj&aelig;lland</em></p>
<p>In my conference presentation, I will look at feedback received from practitioners in different contexts in respect to Video Concept Cards. Video Concept Cards is an activity and tool, which aims to innovate videos and mixed media projects used in an educational setting. The game consists of real physical cards and is meant to be played in groups of educators in a real physical setting. It is meant to be an open resourse and is free to download, print and distribute under a Creative Commons licence. Video Concept Cards was developed in co-operation with E-learning consultant Anders Thiel from University College Sj&aelig;lland.</p>
<p><strong>What is Video Concept Cards?</strong></p>
<p>Video and media in education is nothing new. However, the evolution of new tools has brought countless options for using and mixing media in new ways to generate a better learning experience. Video can now be used both on its own and as a frame to incorporate many different types of media, creating an interactive video or mixed media project.</p>
<p>With interaction being a major focus in discussions on the future digital learning objectives, it becomes important to look at how different media types can be used and combined in a meaningful way for educators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However large the interest in the various new ways of communicating, it is can be a challenge to find new ways of communicating with these tools in an online context.</p>
<p>So how do we build concepts for these interactive videos, and how do we generate new ideas to innovate the use of media in education?</p>
<p>One can argue, that for building a concept of digital educational media the educators need a language and support, to fully be able to mediate their knowledge base through new types of media.</p>
<p>For this purpose the Video Concept card game was created. The goal of the game is &nbsp;not to supply answers or solutions as such. Instead, the focus is to facilitate collaboration and discussions towards good concepts.</p>
<p>In other words the game tries to innovate by asking the experts: The professionals directly involved with education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Short description of Video Concept Cards</strong></p>
<p>The card game is meant to be played around a table by a group of professionals involved with education. It consists of two categories of cards:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Activity cards. These are examples of activities to do in the context a video or mixed media projects.</li>
<li>Media Cards, which are different kinds of media types that are meant to be used in &nbsp;an educational context.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the game, the players combine the two categories in different ways and have an open talk or discussion about how to best use the potential in different media types to achieve the activity defined by an activity card drawn in the game. This is meant to facilitate knowledge exchange and idea generation for new concepts.</p>

                   Now that I have seen both the cards and read your abstract I can get a sense of what flexibility your game offers to a wide range of settings.  In fact I'm looking at application to my own adult learning setting which is outside the formal education system. I'm very interested to hear initial impressions from students and any adaptations you plan following these trials.        </div>

                   <p>Dear Uffe,</p>
<p>I love this idea, as it means that the 'collective' creativity can be tapped into! I am looking forward to listening to your presentation and wonder how this idea could be adapted (with permissions/accredition to you) for students in healthcare. For example: 'Nursing Activity' cards with 'Media' or 'Digital Tool/Skill'. Your Project offers my project some ideas as to how to engage students and their creative side in improving their Digital Literacy understanding.</p>
<p>What sort of answers/solutions has the game produced so far?</p>
<p>P.s. there is a spelling error on slide 9 (top left) 'AssigNment'</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sarah</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Uffe</p>
<p>Interesting project idea, has this been developed further from the original concept card design. &nbsp;How does this work with people with learning disabilities</p>        </div>

                   <p>@Sarah: Thank you for your feedback. I am not sure I can find the spelling error.&nbsp; Is it on the Prezi? The purpose of the game is to generate and to exchange ideas more than to supply answers as such. Applying it in practice is up to the practitioners using the game. I think your ideas are excellent examples.</p>        </div>

                   <p>@Stephen: As the card game is an open resource, I do not fully know to what extent people have made new versions or used ideas from the game. I do however know examples of people who have added cards to suit their context. I must admit I have not fully contemplated how the game will work in regard to people with learning disabilities. Do you have any suggestions for improvement?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Uffe hi, &nbsp;Very interested to hear about the feedback you received [at the conference] and whether there were any stand-out points. &nbsp;On the basis of what I saw, it seemed a stimulating idea and one that could be understood and used quickly. &nbsp;So little time spent on mastering process and plenty of time to actually 'play' out a scenario. &nbsp;Did you run an in house test by any chance, and did you make any significant changes as a result of that?</p>        </div>

<p>I really like the idea - as you know because I've included it as a resource within my own guidelines. Anything that helps give educators practical assistance (and suggests ways to share practice/ideas) I think can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing more at your presentation!</p>

<p>@Susan Thank you very much for your suggestion. I will definitely check out tes.com and see if this could used in relation to the project.</p>
<p>@Janet We have tried prototypes of the game at our place and will probably continue to work with it. There has been some very good ideas popping up, but at the end of the day it is up to the practitioners to decide what ideas to develop.</p>
<p>@David and Heather: Thanks. Hope you find a way to use the cards or the sort of activity they represent in one form or another.</p>        </div>

                   <p>@Andy, Paul and Sarah: Thank you very much for your comments. You mention the possibility of developing an online version. I think this could be a very interesting next version of the game and it is something that I am considering.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Uffe<br />Please find below the main questions and comments from your live presentation. It's up to you how to answer them, whether you wish to group them, or whether you wish to point to an answer already given above, for example.<br />Best wishes<br />Simon</p>
<ul>
<li>Great idea! Start with what you want to achieve and only then discuss what medium is appropriate - rather than being medium-led</li>
<li>It would work well in healthcare.</li>
<li>And in my sector too - I can see real transferability</li>
<li>I think you may find that online versions of a physical card game allows you to use each to reinforce the other - like Pokemon cards and the Pokemon games on a console.</li>
<li>I think using the cards as a way to get colleagues to support one another is great - for that I can see f2f being powerful</li>
<li>There will be others who prefer the tactile sensual experience of face-to-face with physical cards though</li>
<li>could you say a little more about the prototyping - what sorts of changes did it lead to in terms of the cards themselves?<br /><br /></li>

                   <p>Hi Uffe</p>
<p>I just watched the recording. Well done! &nbsp;I wanted to ask if the on-line version could be asynchronous, or does this process benefit from spontaneous fast interaction? If it could be done effectively over a period, fitting it around other duties, I can see that being an attraction. e.g. in working with people in different time zones.</p>        </div>

                   <p>@Pat</p>
<p>An online version is exists only in theory. I think the challenge to online learning would be copying the collaborative of the game, which works well with real time interaction. I think it is possible to achieve this online. An asynchronous version could also work, but I think it would be something different.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Here I will post replies to questions and comments from the H818 conference. Thanks for the feedback, I reallly appreciate it.</p>
<p>"Great idea! Start with what you want to achieve and only then discuss what medium is appropriate - rather than being medium-ledIt would work well in healthcare."</p>
<p>"And in my sector too - I can see real transferability"</p>
<p>Reply: I think it is great that several people see adaptability to use an activity like this in their own field. This could be really interesting to develop further.</p>
<p>"I think you may find that online versions of a physical card game allows you to use each to reinforce the other - like Pokemon cards and the Pokemon games on a console."</p>
<p>Reply: This did not cross my mind, but of course you could actually cross the two which could add up nicely. Perhaps something like having your own subject of interest outside the screen and getting some random media type and activity to mix it with online. I think this definitely has potential.</p>
<p>"I think using the cards as a way to get colleagues to support one another is great - for that I can see f2f being powerful"</p>
<p>"There will be others who prefer the tactile sensual experience of face-to-face with physical cards though"</p>
<p>Reply: f2f if possible, do give something special, I agree. Could be really interesting to make it work online though.</p>
<p>"could you say a little more about the prototyping - what sorts of changes did it lead to in terms of the cards themselves?"</p>
<p>I can say a few things. The first thing was to come up with how to put it together. We did decide from the very beginning that we wanted to make a card game. It seemed like something that would work, and we also had in mind that we had a presentation at a conference for which this would be well suited. First we tested the game with ourselves, then with practitioners at our place. &nbsp;I can say we both improved the number and types of activities, as this was a challenging part for us to work on.We tried to develop the dynamics/speed and the rounds. we were also lucky enough to have a guy from our communications department help us out with design in the end.</p>        </div>
