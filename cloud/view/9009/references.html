        <p><strong>Narrator&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I am a &lsquo;visiting&rsquo; literacy teacher to a class of 23 grade 2 students, (aged 7) working within the International&nbsp;Baccalaureate Primary Years Program (PYP). <em>I visit this class every week as the native English speaker. The class has two Indonesian homeroom teachers whom I plan with and mentor. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>The school is situated in a mining community in a remote part of Indonesia. Most students are Indonesian with English as their second or third language. The remaining (3) students come from different western countries. All families work for the mine and many children have lived in the community their entire lives.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The school has two computer 'labs' although access to them is restricted to two set lesson times per week or via a booking system when lessons aren't scheduled. Each classroom has one computer with basic 'microsoft' software and an unreliable internet connection. Most students have access to a computer at home or own personal gadgets.&nbsp;The students have access to school cameras and other recording devices as well as personal gadgets.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This activity took place during a unit of work under the transdisciplinary theme 'how we organise ourselves' with the central idea &lsquo;In a workplace people share responsibility to achieve a common purpose&rsquo; and three &lsquo;lines of inquiry&rsquo;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of a workplace</li>
<li>Roles and responsibilities within a workplace</li>
<li>The importance of a shared vision and common purposes<em>' </em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The activity ran over a 6 week period, students were placed in 7 groups of 3 and 1 group of 2. Each group chose a particular workplace, within the community, to focus their investigations.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>The aim of this learning activity was for children to use a variety of media to gather information for a presentation, using powerpoint, to an audience at the end of the unit.&nbsp;This was the student&rsquo;s first experience using powerpoint.</em></p>
<p><em>Children were given a list of information to include in their presentations based on the unit&rsquo;s central idea and lines of inquiry.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key learning outcomes were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn and use various aspects of powerpoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Work in groups to plan,&nbsp;gather information and present findings.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate their understanding of the unit&rsquo;s central idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Students would be assessed on their ability to work in a team to plan, gather then present information.</em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning&nbsp;of each week students and teacher would discuss and plan the week&rsquo;s activities including organising time in the computer lab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students were involved in English grammar lessons based around aspects of this activity however, i did not include the&nbsp;content or structure of the lessons in this narrative as the lessons were based on individual needs.&nbsp;Grammar activities are marked with an asterix in the chart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The main obstacles to this activity were the availability of resources and working around delays such as not being able to visit the workplace at their preferred times. Not always having access to computers was a problem at times, we overcame it by drawing plans of slides on paper. </em></p>
<p>Children were very enthusiastic doing this unit because they got to do a lot more planning than they had been used to. They found the added responsibility of organizing field trip both exciting and challenging (even phoning their own parents at the worksite).</p>
<p>They enjoyed going out into the community and using technology to gather information. Several students made powerpoint presentations at home on various unrelated topics which showed a element of transferrable action taking place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>Most groups were able to include most of the criteria from the checklists in their final presentations. Everyone was able to answer questions related to using features of powerpoint although this could have been improved with better access to computers. The finished presentations included most of the &lsquo;learning powerpoint&rsquo; outcomes and having given students a &lsquo;base&rsquo; for the next time it&rsquo;s used. Parents who came to the final presentations were happy with the finished products and pleased with the level of English and independence shown by the children. There were a number of issues with children (not) working together which had to be addressed throughout the unit. I was generally happy with the understanding of the unit shown by students. Our access to our chosen workplaces and how they accommodated our requests helped make this more successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The most pleasing part of this activity was the enthusiasm shown by the students. The use of different technology; working in groups for the entire unit; visiting places outside of school and being given a certain amount of creativity and freedom with their presentations and ideas helped everyone stay a lot more focused and interested in the topic. Time restrictions, availability of resources and some school policies e.g. </em><em>give a weeks&rsquo; notice for activities outside of school,</em><em> were the main hindrances. If I do this type of activity again I would try to address those aspects although by pre-planning too much I risk taking too much control from the students. </em></p>
