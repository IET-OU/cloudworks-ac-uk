        <p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>I am Curriculum Manager for English and Maths in a college of further education teaching students who are resitting GCSE English.&nbsp; Some students have failed this several times in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>Students will already have achieved a D grade in previous exams so we have to assume a certain level of knowledge.&nbsp; However, it is obvious that students do not have the level of exam technique that is necessary to successfully answer some of the questions.</p>
<p>We recently held a mock examination to gain an insight into the questions that students were finding particularly difficult.&nbsp; As this is a resit we have to assume that there is a certain amount of existing knowledge but we wanted to try and narrow this down.&nbsp; The results showed that the main issues were with questions 3 and 4.&nbsp; Question 3 is investigating a source text for language devices and question 4 is a comparison question investigating presentational features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The students have one year in which to prepare for this resit, during which time they will also be completing 4 controlled assessments.&nbsp; There isn't much time to devote to each of the individual questions.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>The task was to try and find a means to make question 4 more accessible to the students and to build their confidence.&nbsp; Previously we have used the acronym CLIF (colour, layout, image and form)&nbsp; to help students to analyse the texts. Students have to achieve a minimum of 70% in each of these questions to be within the grade boundaries expected for a grade C.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>The students were all given two source texts that I felt had sufficient contrast to give them an opportunity to compare.&nbsp; As a class we brainstormed what they already knew about presentation features and wrote these on the board.</p>
<p>Students then decided on one feature, for example images, and, as a class, we created a bullet point list of what could be seen in the images in both source texts, effects and features.&nbsp; The students then created a paragraph based on what was on the board.&nbsp; Whilst the students were writing I went round the room giving verbal feedback.&nbsp; A verbal feedback stamp is used in each of the students' books - they must then write next to the stamp what that feedback was, in their own words, and then act on that feedback.</p>
<p>Once the students had completed the paragraph we chose a different feature and followed the same process as above.&nbsp; Howevver, we didn't compile as detailed a list of the effects as I wanted the students to improve their skills by doing this themselves. Feedback was given in the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The result was that students didn't feel tied down by the CLIF acronym and felt more comfortable just analysing the texts for presentational features that stood out to them.&nbsp; Also breaking the paragraphs down and not giving the students the whole task at once meant that they could get feedback in time to improve for the next paragraph.</p>
<p>Feedback from the the students was positive as they were not overwhelmed by the task and the timely feedback enabled them to improve when writing further paragraphs.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
<p>It was easier for me to manage the students, but more labour intensive trying to see all of the students in the 15 minutes alotted for the task.&nbsp; However, it gave me a clearer idea on whether or not the students had understood the task and I could then modify my lesson.</p>
<p>I will break down question 3 in the same way.</p>
