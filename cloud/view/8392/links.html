        <h2>Title <br /> <em>Transferring knowledge of the functionality of Video Editing Software</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>I was teaching the rest of the group, transferring my skills of how to use this software, the functionality it had and limitations. Providing guidance to peers on how best to use this software effectively within the task.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>A problem was given in the form of a business scenario and students had to role-play as sellers to sell their solutions to the company. For this task, students had to communicate their ideas through the use of video, and resources available. Filming was taken place over a number of different locations, with voice and video being separately collated. The session of teaching my peers happened in a computer facilitated classroom. Both had to be collated together and by using extra functionality of the video editing software to improve communications of ideas. The key actors were me and my peers and the audience, in this case the tutor who would review and mark the work. The desire was that they wanted to learn these skills which may enable them to take up such work in the future.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>The final video created as a group was the measure of success and the outcome was incorporating the functionality used, and the ideas we collated were successfully communicated across through the video in role play and features.</em></p>
<p><em>I was teaching the peers about how to use the software, so we could collectively work on the video as a group and also they would retain those skills for the future. The measure of success of this was shown by them demonstrating their skills as we worked collectively as a group.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>Brainstormed on ideas for the video, how to film, how to role-play identified the key characters and scenario. From there we were able to look at the problem of the scenario in order to come up with innovative solutions.</em></p>
<p><em>From there we were able to create a storyboard of the video and sort out a script</em></p>
<p><em>After rehearsing we were able to start filming and we had a problem with audio recording through the camera as it was picking up noise in the background. So for this we recorded the audio separately and put it together through the software synchronising it on top of the video. After all the filming had taken place we first watched it back to see if it needed to be redone or if it was ok. From there we were able to put all of the video into the software. From here the other group member&rsquo;s hadn&rsquo;t had knowledge of video editing software so I offered to help teach them the functionality of it and how it could be used and at the same time develop the video showing them the uses for it as well as them after being able to demonstrate what they had learnt.</em></p>
<p><em>From here we created a group session which I led, first going through what the video editing software was capable of and how to import the video into the software</em></p>
<p><em>Then we looked at placing the audio into the software and from there were able to synchronise it with the video. I then took them through some of the functionality of the software and tools perhaps we could include, and other&rsquo;s not relevant to the video but that they could use in the future. I then asked them to demonstrate their skills and have a play around with it. Then answering any questions that they had, from there we were able to produce a video as a group with knowledge of what the software could do brought forward those innovative ideas of how to include that.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>The objectives were met, video was successful, and with editing and using the functionality of the editor we were able to put across our ideas to the target audience the tutor. There were some problems on the way but we were able to overcome these as a group. The successfulness of the video was evidenced by the feedback of the tutor. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Additional outcomes were that I was able to develop my teaching skills through transferring knowledge to each of the other students, and also my leadership skills in carrying out the activity.</em></p>    </div>
