        <p>This design narrative forms part of an exercise for Open University H800 module.</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>I was a school teacher responsible for teaching English.</em></p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I was a supply teacher on a long term placement in a state secondary school (over several terms). The placement happened within the last five years. &nbsp;I was covering a leave of absence and teaching English as a subject.&nbsp; &nbsp;The class in question were around twenty five twelve to thirteen year old pupils (Key Stage 3, in the UK).</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The class were variously described as &lsquo;challenging&rsquo; and &lsquo;lower ability&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the subject in the school, pupils were streamed, and this class was in the lowest mainstream.&nbsp;&nbsp; The class were described as &lsquo;challenging&rsquo; &nbsp;because a large proportion of pupils had statements of additional needs many of which related to behaviour and emotional difficulties.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Lessons for this specific class were held in various classrooms around the school throughout the week.&nbsp; I was therefore required to arrange the logistics of delivering books for every single lesson, with the aid of the pupils.&nbsp; I taught English mainly within a French classroom, thus nearly all the displays related to France and the French language.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Around ten minutes were alloted at the start of each lesson for silent reading by pupils.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>As a supply teacher, I was the pupils&rsquo; second supply teacher within that year.&nbsp; I had taught them for three months before undertaking the learning exercise described below.&nbsp; I had built up a level of trust with the pupils and understanding of their individual needs.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Pupils generally hold a negative view of transient supply teachers, even those employed on a longer-term basis.&nbsp; There is of course the issue of trust.&nbsp; Can we trust this new teacher ?&nbsp; There was the desire, on the pupils&rsquo; part and mine as a teacher, to build a good working relationship based on trust and respect.&nbsp; This took many months to achieve.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Belief : Please note that an important assumption I make as a teacher is that within every pupil is a writer and that every pupil is capable of telling a story in writing.</em></p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I was trying to get the pupils to develop their understanding of the writing process.&nbsp; I wanted the pupils to write about where they were now : this very moment, in the classroom, sitting at a desk, with their friends, in school, with a pen, their thoughts, and the sights, sounds and smells around them... describing their direct experience.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I explained to the class that they would be having a picnic in class in two days&rsquo; time.&nbsp; &nbsp;By picnic, I mean that I would allow the pupils to eat a snack and work during part of the lesson.&nbsp; I explained that they would be doing some creative writing as a lesson focus.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>(Effect &ndash; pupils were amused and surprised as they had never had a &lsquo;picnic&rsquo; in class previously, but looking forward to the experience.&nbsp; There was palpable excitement &ndash; not the fear usually associated with writing.)</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>At the start of the agreed lesson, I explained to pupils that they would be writing in their books about their experience in the classroom, describing what they saw, heard, smelled, thought etc...&nbsp; (Effect &ndash; confusion, pupils not familiar with this way of working, excitement that they could have a snack etc).</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I told the pupils that I too would be writing about my experience in the classroom... but that I would share all my writing with them immediately and live.&nbsp; Thus I used Microsoft Word and ensured it was showing on the projector screen for the whole class to see.&nbsp; The writing was enlarged to make it easily readible by the whole class.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Using my computer, I wrote freely.&nbsp;&nbsp; I described what I saw and noticed in plain language.&nbsp; I mentioned the pupil names where appropriate :</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I notice a French flag draped above the door.&nbsp; This is the first time I&rsquo;ve noticed this flag.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B looks like he&rsquo;s lost in thought, holding his hand against his forehead.&nbsp; L looks at the ceiling, looking for ideas.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>(Effect &ndash; the whiteboard writing caught the attention of pupils.&nbsp; The use of humour in the exemplary writing on the board reduced the &lsquo;fear factor&rsquo; associated with writing with this profile pupil).</em></p>
<p><em>Pupils likewise emulated this process of free writing in their writing books.<br /></em></p>
<p><em>In my writing example, I quoted speech from people in the situation, making it as realistic and lively as possible, reflecting directly on experience as it was happening.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Obstacle.&nbsp; As I was describing in writing the experience of the classroom, some of the pupils saw this as a means of &lsquo;playing up&rsquo; so that they were named in the written exemplary albeit in a humourous tone.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>After giving the example writing to pupils, I moved around the classroom, reading pupil work, encouraging, making suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the lesson, I took in pupils work for marking and for feedback during next lesson.&nbsp; </em></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>As regards pupils developing their understanding of the writing process, the expected outcome was that most of the pupils were able to describe some aspects of their direct experience.&nbsp; This was achieved as evidenced in their written work.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Unexpected outcomes :&nbsp; Describing what is happening in a live classroom, quoting people as they speak, has an engaging and humourous quality about it reducing the typical tensions associated with writing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also actively &nbsp;demonstrates the use of speech and quotation, but it can become a distraction to the learning focus, as evidenced in my post lesson reflection.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Additional outcomes : Using the whiteboard to &lsquo;live write&rsquo; as an exemplary for pupils led to much imitative writing.&nbsp; This of course is a facet of writing that could be discussed in a future lesson (how one can imitate or parody other writing, for example).</em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Using the computer and projector to model &lsquo;free writing&rsquo; in a live classroom context can be very effective as a means of encouraging the pupil/learner/writer.&nbsp; With portable display technology (eg. an iPad attached to an Apple TV device linked to a screen) one could show pupils&rsquo; work in a similar live way on the screen during the lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is much potential here for formative assessment, peer assessment etc.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Fear is a major learning obstacle in English as indeed every subject.&nbsp; Embedding this writing exercise within a picnic in a classroom may seem a little eccentric but this, along with the humour co-created in the experience, it helped make the learning much more effective because it didn&rsquo;t seem like hard &lsquo;classwork&rsquo; but instead it seemed more natural and more like &lsquo;having fun&rsquo;. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>One of the transferable metacognitive insights pupils can gain from this exercise concerns their own creative process in producing writing : recording their first draft (as in this lesson example), subsequently showing and sharing, re-drafting, developing, editing etc.&nbsp; </em></p>
