        <p><strong>Title</strong> You do the math!</p>
<p><strong>Narrator </strong></p>
<p><em>Support a pre-reg. nursing student with medication calculations who had failed an online test (a 100% pass is needed)</em></p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>Use of OU Live as students is on a distance Learning Programme: date, time and place suggested by student.&nbsp; I am the student&rsquo;s tutor and we have met face-to-face once &ndash; however I used to be her teacher in FE so knew her when she was 16 and taught her then for 16 years.&nbsp; Student has to achieve 100% in the calculations or will fail the programme: she is exceptionally anxious and I have been given one hour of support time. Therefore there were pressures of time, of situation (not face to face) and outcome!&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>I has guided student that prior to meeting she review key aspects of calculations (being able to divide and multiply decimals and convert fractions to decimals.&nbsp; Key online resources were highlighted.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Both of us were aware of the types of questions which student has got wrong in the previous test and a &lsquo;back to basics&rsquo; approach was felt to be best by students as she panics when given a &lsquo;test&rsquo;. She is also very aware that patient safety is paramount and it is a no fail test. Knowing the student I felt that it was best to show her what she can do and what she does know (rather than more questions merely highlighting the opposite).&nbsp; Via Application Sharing we visited basic numeracy skills site (BBC skilswise) and reviewed calculations.&nbsp; I shared my &lsquo;top tips&rsquo;: fail safe methods of checking answers to drug calculations and the use of mnemonics to help remember the formula needed to work out correct dosages.&nbsp; We kept it simple (in fact most ward-based drug calculations will be simple and relatively straightforward &ndash; they just have to be right.&nbsp; We reviewed how to do a &lsquo;rough estimate&rsquo; first &ndash; by knowing &lsquo;roughly&rsquo; how many tablets it must be it will also add as a &lsquo;checker&rsquo; if the answer you get deviates from these too much (if that makes sense).&nbsp; </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We chatted through her feelings about the test (embarrassment and a degree of humiliation). This was not unexpected.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Use of OU Live to help the student was not as &lsquo;good&rsquo; as working together I felt as the IT was slow and &lsquo;clunky&rsquo; so slowed us down. I indicated that I could request more time if needed (and it was).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Via Application Sharing we visited basic numeracy skills site (BBC skilswise) and reviewed calculations. There was a balance to be struck between not wishing to &lsquo;expose&rsquo; the student to what she didn&rsquo;t know and also identifying key areas for further input.&nbsp; All students are aware of patient safety comes first.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;I shared my &lsquo;top tips&rsquo;: fail safe methods of checking answers to drug calculations and the use of mnemonics to help remember the formula needed to work out correct dosages.&nbsp; We kept it simple (in fact most ward-based drug calculations will be simple and relatively straightforward &ndash; they just have to be right) and I also did this in part for the student to gain confidence</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;We reviewed how to do a &lsquo;rough estimate&rsquo; first &ndash; by knowing &lsquo;roughly&rsquo; how many tablets it must be it will also add as a &lsquo;checker&rsquo; if the answer you get deviates from these too much (if that makes sense).&nbsp; We worked through some calculations together and I gave some &lsquo;homework&rsquo; for her to review with her mentor in her workplace.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Overall I felt that the use of OU Live for this was not ideal &ndash; this was more related to the emotional aspect of the session (not sure how to explain this really &ndash; but I sensed that the student felt &lsquo;awkward&rsquo;).&nbsp; The student does not use a video and does not use a microphone &ndash; this hampered the session so I followed it up with a telephone call. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The student was able to complete some simple calculations and has additional resources to progress and develop.&nbsp; There was something lacking though and I have requested a further session which I will consider carefully how to manage and consider something more meaningful</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>Reflecting upon this situation there is no doubt that there are some very helpful resources: interactive sites where you can work out injections etc.&nbsp; I will direct the student to use those but there was a &lsquo;tension&rsquo; &ndash; possibly because of what is at stake if the student is not successful.&nbsp; This situation will happen again and in the future I will discuss further with the student ahead of the actual session </em></p>
