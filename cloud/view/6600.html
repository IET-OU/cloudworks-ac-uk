                   <h2>Review of LdShake and the &ldquo;Biologia en Context&rdquo; teacher community across high schools</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all I should like to stress that I really enjoyed reading the chapter and learning more about Ld-Shake. It really made me want to use the system, and I also registered on test site. Couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out whether it is an openly available tool, and one could have or create an instance on it &ndash; well, just to say that I think it looks really interesting, and I would like to play around with it some more :-)</p>
<p>As said &ndash; I think the chapter is very interesting and I like how it both describes a tool, but one of the communities using this tools and the co-development process initiated together with this community. I find the chapter to be well-written and also easy to read (good structure and flow). Having said that, I also have a few comments and ideas for how to further strengthen a good chapter (and also every time I say or write &lsquo;having said that&rsquo; I come to think of this scene from Larry David&rsquo;s &lsquo;Curb your enthusiasm&rsquo; :-)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHVQ2gslp8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHVQ2gslp8</a>)</p>
<p>OK &ndash; so here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You mention a number of places that teachers have given feedback, but it was not entirely clear to me how they did so or how requirements comments have been collected over time. Did it come mainly from the workshop mentioned or have you had other workshops or event where you have collected more input? Has it been more informal and along the way or a more structured, rigid development process with user workshops &ndash; a bit more about how feedback has been collected over time would maybe be good. </li>
<li>It was not quite clear to me whether LdShake is used only as a planning tool for describing and sharing among teachers or whether students used the system to access the tasks and so &ndash; maybe say a little about how the teachers adopt or use LdShake if it is also made part of the classroom activities (online or offline)</li>
<li>Another point where it was a bit unclear to me. How is the actual uptake among teachers of LD-shake? Seems a lot of schools and teachers are involved but I couldn&rsquo;t figure out whether LD-shake was broadly adopted among this group or if it is more a small group of dedicated people, who are using it (some of the concerns from teachers around &lsquo;others using&rsquo; seems to point to the latter?). E.g. For the workshop there were 13 participants and are these the main users or new users out of how many users? And as an aside and not being an expert in quantitative methods, I did however, come to think of whether notions of &lsquo;standard deviation&rsquo; make sense with small numbers of respondents &ndash; but as said &ndash; I am not very knowledgeable about quantitative methods. Does seem, however, that you learn more from the comments than the numbers maybe.</li>
<li>Somewhat related to points above I was thinking whether maybe the a bit more reflection on the &lsquo;community side&rsquo; or &lsquo;social adoption of the tools&rsquo; (i.e. teacher&rsquo;s concern whether the tools being used by others) could be made a stronger point. I think there is a lot on the functionality side and planning development of the software, but maybe, as you also write, the importance of getting the tools &lsquo;out there&rsquo; and into use through workshops could be stressed a bit more (maybe it is already there, but I just think it is an interesting point as developers are often most concerned with getting the functionality right)</li>
<li>One final point would be, that it could be nice to get a bit more introduction to the pedagogical / theoretical background to LD-shake. There are some references for this, but I think the &lsquo;granularity slider&rsquo; for instance is very, very interesting and it could maybe be good to have a little more on the pedagogical / theoretical rationale of LD-shake</li>

                   <p>Hi, I'm reading all the chapters to make my own updates and hope you don't mind me pointing out that there are some typographical errors on your updated version (apologies if these have already been dealt with)</p>
<p>P1:&nbsp;However, a problem is that the existing tools are <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">in&nbsp;</strong><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">disperse</strong> websites or product providers, and sometimes they may be easily unknown by the practitioners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume you mean 'on diverse'. I also suggest you don't need the word 'easily'</p>
<p>P3:&nbsp;The designs used were rudimentarily edited, <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">what was pointed</strong> as a limitation both by teachers and students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest 'which was indicated'</p>
<p>P4: <strong>Next</strong> section describes LdShake and how it has been extended and customized according to the needs of the <em>Biologia en Context</em> community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest 'The next'</p>
<p>P14:&nbsp;Hopefully, the incremental adoption of LdShake and the related projects will bring to light more <strong>evidences</strong> regarding the feasibility in real practice of the ultimate goal that is behind the focus of this book: teachers acting as learning designers <strong>immerse</strong> <strong>in</strong> culture of sharing and collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest 'evidence' and 'immersed in a'</p>

                   <p>Dear authors</p>
<p>Although this paper was not assigned to me, I've been reading it with attention.</p>
<p>I've seen the evolution from first LdShake textual version, I've trialed in 2011 and I'm glad to see that now WebCollage and exeLearning are included in the tool.</p>
<p>This kind of sharing tool and repository is relevant for teachers'communities&nbsp; of practice, in oarticular when operationalisation on their current LMS can be offered. It' not clear to me at this point if it's only a perspective of operationalization offered by METIS project and in what kind of platform? Another interesting perspective is the future availability of an API for other LD authoring tools that can open the sharing of LD among communities of of practice.</p>
<p>The study presented on teacher's adoption of the tool in Table 1 seems comprehensive, I was just wondering if the formulation of the question "I believe..." shows that they "think" or that "they are convinced that..." which is slightly different meaning</p>
<p>I'll conclude saying it's a rich and detailed work presented here that will be hepfull&nbsp; for our community</p>
<p>Best</p>
