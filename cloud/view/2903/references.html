			<h2>Developing the Student Experience: What&rsquo;s the deal?</h2>
<p>Reflective blog by Lawrie Phipps</p>
<p>Professor Sir David Watson (Institute of Education)</p>
<p>Professor Janet Beer (Oxford Brookes University)</p>
<p>Wes Streeting (National Union of Students)</p>
<p>In an outbreak of irony Wes, the student voice, went to the venue.</p>
<p>David Watson opened with some comments around what do students want, what do students get and what subjects do and should they chose. He also commented that perhaps &ldquo;no is point of maximum generational fracture&rdquo;. &nbsp;The average age of teaching staff in the Academy is 42.7.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What students get&rsquo; is also a political debate, with Mandelson moving it on a new plane, with each course having a set of data and some expectations about what they can do when they leave. But Students do understand that a qualification is an investment and that they have to put work in.</p>
<p>Surveys have shown that students want investment in IT, libraries and resources, teaching near the bottom of the list better pay and conditions for staff!</p>
<h2>The VC view (Janet Beer)</h2>
<p>Student experience and research and knowledge are their two main imperatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We must offer a broad set of opportunities</p>
<p>We must allow for a diversity of student experience</p>
<p>Students are not consumers or customers</p>
<p>In Brookes the consultation with students resulted in the students saying that Staff in universities must take part in CPD. This means at Brookes the staff must submit a CPD plan and commit to improve their teaching.</p>
<p>Students said that &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want more contact hours &ndash; we want better contact hours&rdquo;</p>
<p>The emphasis at Brookes will now focus on &lsquo;education so they can live lives of consequence&rsquo; &ndash; citizenship. For example a local law firm provides extra curricular training in charity law, the students who participate then volunteer for charities.</p>
<h2>Open to the floor</h2>
<p>David asked the floor for comments, and asked &ldquo;what are universities for?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><em>Tim O&rsquo;Shea (Edinburgh)</em></strong> opened by asking should all courses have a &lsquo;big issues course&rsquo; e.g climate change, poverty etc?</p>
<p>Academics seem to agree with the idea, but worry about the time it would take.</p>
<p><strong><em>Diana Burton (Liverpool JM</em></strong>), agreed, and addressed the time issue by saying there is a case to be made about it being part of the programme as extra hours. She went on to ask the delegates how specific they were about requiring feedback&nbsp; about specific lectures and lecturers.</p>
<p>Roehampton have a citizenship module &ndash; they are teetering on whether it is compulsory.</p>
<p>One of the key issues discussed was how to include officers form students unions in the decisions at senior levels in the institution. Lots of issues were raised, both negative and positive.</p>
<p>The discussion was then taken back to issues about students getting involved in an academic environment, an whether the Government agendas are driving the student as client movement and are we losing something by this.</p>
<p>A comment from the floor &ldquo;our students are surveyed to death&rdquo; &ndash; our student union is very engaged, but are we really getting a true student voice?</p>
