        <p>Today, much attention is paid to trained professionals coming immediately after high school on production. The employers evaluate their skills by company criteria, which is the &ldquo;too high&rdquo; for graduates. In fact, these criteria are tested in practice and fully characterize the necessary skills for the specialist. The facts show a large gap between theory and practice. Kazakhstan's training consists of purely theoretical course and several short and practices for 4 years. This problem should be solved in terms of the formation of competence model of education. It is this paradigm of education receives the most emphasis. To reduce the gap of the theoretical and practical competence serves to provide training in alternative periods, which constitute the chain in time with alternating types of theoretical and practical training as "flashing generated '. For starters, you can implement this approach in the final year of undergraduate diploma in engineering. It is assumed that the student of the 4th year already would have found a job and started to practice professional while still a student. Per unit alternative period can take 1 month. Then these periods will be 10: 5 5 theoretical courses and practices. Our education in Kazakhstan with such party has not yet been considered, although in some countries it is already there. It was decided to start with a list of all kinds of competencies. For a correct determination of the full list of all types of competencies, the author going to analyze Washington, Sydney, Dublin agreement GRADUATE ATTRIBUTES AND PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCIES. There will also be performed an analysis of the proposals from the Forum mobility engineers Forum mobility engineers, analysis of the UK standards of professional competence in the field of engineering and standard for Chartered Engineer. Accordingly, Kazakhstan has a lot of things are new, are not adapted. It also assumes the comparison criteria for assessing competencies and standards of the above sources with Kazakhstan criteria of competence and standards of education. Will analyze the positive and negative assessments of the criteria used. Results of the analysis will be presented in the form of tables and graphs for key industrial and competencies that should affect the structure of the curriculum for IT - specialists in the universities of Kazakhstan. Logically flows into the question of the use of international standards in Kazakhstan. Please refer to the formation of the world experience of training standards. It is precisely the formation of educational standards should be based on various competencies. At the graduation design is more important period the formation of key competencies and other students. In this alternative theoretically periods can be compressed in time and distance due to the expense of new mobile applications, for example, the application "Diploma counseling." Have its own characteristics for mastering competence in degree designing telecommunication networks. During graduation practice there is a significant evolution of competencies engineering students. But still need additional advice from the project manager. Expect to create a mobile application "Consultation with scientific adviser" to the OS IOS. Specially designed structure is the application itself. At the same time, the role of the supervisor in consultation, which should already lay in advising the formation of professional competencies, which lacks a student in a given period of time? This consultation is on-line. All application is illustrated by a concrete example. Also, it is desirable to study the issue of competency assessment before and after the graduate design. It is necessary to calculate the efficiency of the application and make a prediction on the degree of realization of future challenges engineer to assess his competency. The future of professional advice in alternative periods of study.</p>    </div>
