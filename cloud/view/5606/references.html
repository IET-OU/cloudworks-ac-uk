<h2 id="extra-content">Extra content</h2>
    		<div class="extra-content">
			<a name="content-1234"></a>
			<p>Liveblog:</p>
<p>Showed slide with logos for all of the presentations - apart from the last (!).&nbsp;Learning about games. Then iSpot, social learning analytics, multiple choice questions, Open ED, etc.</p>
<p>Review of hapTEL project presentation.</p>
<p>Jo - lack of research looking at how engagement, motivation and learning come together in practice. One caught his eye - micro-level analysis - look at a particular user, where learning is actually happening.</p>
<p>Doug - iSpot and Bioblitz.</p>
<p>Social Learning Analytics, Rebecca - five different categories. EnquiryBlogger - issue of representation, and whether people can interpret the representations that explicate user activities.</p>
<p>MCQs to Open confidence-based model, Jon. Made a big difference when presented with choices, then confidence level, rather than other way round. Made me think about the question itself, rather than the choices.</p>
<p>Open Ed - James - Very challenging project. Was interested in learning design analysis; did paper with Patrick McAndrew about how people engage with open content, trying to follow users through resources, back-and-forth behaviour.</p>
<p>Project-based learning - Tina - focus on four elements, interested in data capture using FlashMeeting.</p>
<p>Museum learning - Koula - interesting to use Twitter, in formal setting, children using social technology and see how they appropriate it. Like idea of giving preparatory activity in classrom, relate curriculum to visit, look back on it again. Think may have missed kind of learning when children use Twitter to consolidate their thinking in a small piece of text, would be interesting to see that as well.</p>
<p>Chronically ill children/science, Denise - sympathetic to challenges in working with healthcare professionals, could really relate to it. For a project to finish working with medics/dentists is a really successful one. Idea using mobile technologies, Patsy - a patient used by Richard Cox, would link well with this, see how experts play a big part in giving students/patients learning they may need. In hapTEL see a practice base.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital natives/immigrants, Anne, Chetz - age-related differences. Talking to friends, why do you still buy a newspaper when can get over Internet? As long as those preferences exist.</p>
<p>A few closing points:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Informal to formal - information to knowledge</li>
<li>Connectivity and connectedness</li>
<li>offline and online anlytics - most is based on online environment; but some analytics in face to face, may widen it</li>
<li>User-generated representations? May be a need to explore.</li>
<li>Technological innovation and pedagogical innovation - are we just reinventing the wheel? Maybe is just revisiting the pedagogy</li>
<li>ESRC strategic plan - impact is a key word. None of us has mentioned how our project impacts on health care, science and so on.</li>
</ul>
<div>Simon: By offline analytics, do you mean ones not in the digital realm, or pervasive computing lets us capture that? In digital realm, much more is digitally visible? Capture and log our conversation, our locations.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Jonathan: Are analytics, exist on paper, in graphs, were not able to be digitised before. Should be worth looking at interpreting them. Could be Excel sheet. We could learn something around those.</div>
<div></div>
<div>James: Drawing attention to representations. Many! 3D virtual/haptic head; dentist trainees given the representation. Jo and games, we give representation of a world with physics to them. Certainly with Simon &amp; Rebecca, the dashboard visualisations and graphs, know it's not the whole story, trying to understand the date. Simon with OpenEd - representing relationship between curriculum, teachers' aims, and so on. Lots of different representaitons there, mostly not user-generated. Only one was the Twitter/museum learning one. Simon BS commented don't get very deep discussions on Twitter, but can act as a trigger later in the classroom, combine with picture and can be quite rich.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Jonathan: Maybe it's user-generated models to capture the logs. Analytics are constructed on assumptions that people will interpret the model. In haptics project, trying to generate representation of haptic logs, graphs, 95% and so on - dentists said no, we want the tooth - they have a representation in their head.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Denise: James had very important point, no user-generated representations. Simon's work helps - to do it, need some meta-knowledge. Going down that route. If had to generate representation of mental knowledge, could be a route in to it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Simon BS: User-generated representations - if could design your own visual analytics, would be great - going to customise the EnquiryBlogger that way.</div>
<div></div>
<div>James: Google does that, lets you customise to some extent.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Simon: There's always a framework. Maybe say is designer's job, but give them some customisation.</div>
