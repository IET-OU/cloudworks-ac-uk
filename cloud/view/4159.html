                   <p>I enjoyed the talk yesterday.&nbsp; It was good to have a speaker who had a lot to say and has clearly thought the issues through.&nbsp; It was also good that he had so much information/links to share.&nbsp; As usual, everything was very well organised!&nbsp; <br /><br />If I can make any criticism at all, it would be to do with timekeeping:&nbsp; the presentation over-ran somewhat (though we had been warned that this was likely).</p>

                   <p>I thought this was a really interesting and useful session and something that I would have liked the Media Developers in my team all to have gone to &ndash; all LTS Media would have found this stimulating. We are often told that the policy is about re-using third party material (in the strategy etc.) but so often academics say they can&rsquo;t find anything quite right and have to write their own material. But this actually showed ways in which different bits of material from all over the place could be drawn together and made coherent.<br /><br />I know we work in a very different context than lecturers with small cohorts of students and all our materials have to be quality controlled and &copy; checked and systems need to work for large quantities of people etc. etc., but this seemed to show a way of putting together materials that was really creative. We are very hidebound by the VLE now and everything is templated and process-driven &ndash; I feel we&rsquo;re in danger of losing our edge and boring the younger students we&rsquo;re now attracting. There is so much potential to make exciting and innovative courses now but academics just don&rsquo;t keep up with the technological possibilities (and our systems probably wouldn&rsquo;t allow it).<br /><br />It was great to see this as an alternative and a very useful metaphor. I shall be following up some of the links from his talk and telling other MPMs about it.</p>
<p>Thank you very much &shy;- I don&rsquo;t manage to get to as many of these mornings as I hope to, but was really glad to have made time for this one. Brilliant.<br /><br />Best wishes,</p>
<p>Mel Bayley (LTS Media)<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />First coffee morning that I have attended.</p>
<p>Very stimulating presentation and discussion which opened my eyes to possibilities now available.<br />&nbsp;<br />Didn't arrive early enough to mingle unfortunately.</p>
<p>Gateful for coffee and biscuits.</p>
<p>Good organisation of event and reminders. Will definitely attend again for topics which interest me (although clashes with Library SD hour)<br />&nbsp;<br />Many thanks</p>
<p>Josephine Burt (Library)<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />It was an excellent and thought provoking talk with a rich range of useful resources for the open educator to investigate later.&nbsp; I will be using the link to the Prezi &lsquo;slides&rsquo; often.</p>
<p>Karen&nbsp;Cropper (IET)<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />A very good session &ndash; good speaker and well prepared. I knew of some of the tools that Scott was talking about but it was very useful seeing similar ones I&rsquo;d not met and having them placed in an interesting context.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Martin Smith (IET)<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I found it a useful and clear overview of how Scott is using web 2.0 tools and resources to create his own learning materials. I particularly liked the &lsquo;flow&rsquo; which gave a flavour of what he does at each stage and which tools / resources he uses. It made me feel &lsquo;I can do this&rsquo;, and in fact I have gone away and created an &lsquo;artefact&rsquo; in Prezi to capture the concepts and issues relating to a piece of work we are doing in our department right now. I liked the way this kind of learning is used to engage students actively and make it fun &ndash; I think we have something to learn from it at the OU. So, overall very inspiring.<br /><br />Katharine&nbsp;Reedy (Library)<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>        </div>

                   <p>This was the first of the IET coffee morning events that I have attended so I can&rsquo;t reference with previous experience.</p>
<p>My reason for attending was to get a better fix on the role of OER in the wider HE sector. Is OER a fashion wave amongst funders or will it have real impact outside the donor ( both funding and originating institutions) community.</p>
<p>Amongst the OU academic community we do not have a strong culture of reuse of materials developed outside our own depts, let alone from other institutions.&nbsp; What are the prospects of large scale use of OER by journeyman academics in say Nottingham Trent, Univ Lincoln etc?</p>
<p>Presentation was good but concentrated on tools rather than the teaching producable by them.</p>
<p>So for me it didn&rsquo;t answer the question on applicability directly but did leave the impression that currently OER sits at the edtechie rather than routine classroom teaching end of the spectrum.<br /><br />Will probably attend further events in the series now I&rsquo;ve found them.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Keith Williams (MCT)</p>        </div>

                   <p>Scott&rsquo;s presentation was inspiring and gave me confidence that I could easily &lsquo;remix&rsquo; some resources if I needed to. I appreciated the practical slant. It was really valuable to gain his knowledge of all the tools available because it can take a long time to build such knowledge from scratch.<br /><br />Having said that, I found the Q&amp;A/discussion most useful for my work as a Learning and Teaching Librarian because it explored some potential barriers to re-using existing resources. It was interesting to note the range of perspectives in the audience.<br /><br />Best Regards<br /><br />Samantha Appleyard (Library)</p>        </div>
