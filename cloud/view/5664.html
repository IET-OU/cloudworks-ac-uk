                   <p>From Bradley Allen:</p>
<p><strong>FoRC business model session 1 notes</strong><br /><br />Raw notes from today's session. Apologies for omissions, errors, typos, etc. - BPA<br /><br />Participants: David, Ed, Paul, Alessandro, Robert, Olga, Fiona, Brad, Leslie<br />David: what should we be talking about?<br />Whatever our vision is to implement it we will be operating in world governed by and in reaction to large commercial interests<br />Doing that will involve money<br />How do we fund it?<br />Ed: how to make it valuable to creator and consumer<br />One has to make case for value for either party<br />Impact is part of this discussion<br />What aspect of this will you be willing to pay for<br />Olga: who is who?<br />Who is the customer?<br />Paul: we have librarians, scientists, publiishers in room<br />See what each role would pay for<br />Leslie: we are being asked to provide business model in academic progress<br />Need a minimal definition of what a business model<br />David: Total available market<br />Determining size of market, customer segments, etc.<br />Brad: presenting business model canvas as organiization for presentation of discussion<br />What business models are we doing? One model or many?<br />Ed: I thought we were talking about publication process<br />Fiona: issue is there are many models<br />David: start from blank sheet for scholarly communication<br />We have a sort of vision<br />Include things like open access<br />Thinking through these boxes will help us<br />Paul: need to be concrete about the goal we have here<br />What do I need to do today to generate some piece of reasearch to prove that I have done something worthwhile<br />I would pay for something that would distill everything i need to know to do good research down for me<br />David: but will you pay for it<br />Paul: yes, citing services like Mendeley, evernote<br />Robert: what you are after is better discovery device<br />Paul: people are trying to talk to me and I want to know what I should be paying attention to<br />Robert: this is somewhat off point<br />Would you be happier with something like a journal but better focused<br />Paul: would be happy with something that gives me better sources and summarization<br />RDF store example<br />I don't care about info source but want it certified<br />Ed: want article of the future that would show me what I want<br />But other people ithe room want something that is finer grained<br />David: didn't hear I would pay for that either<br />Alessandro: what we want to do is come up with the model of the future<br />Paul: want certified just in time personalized information<br />Alessandro: but others would want finer grained info to build other stuff on top of that and infrastructure to support<br />Paul: talking about how that leads to value and what to pay for it<br />Alessandro: want to understand how to transform current content to something that would support model of the future<br />David: do we know what the average budget for scholarly communication at institutions is today<br />Paul: for postdocs $10k<br />Robert: what you want is library budget per individual<br />David: at Stanford $10K per head<br />Ed, Leslie: $5k-$10k<br />Olga: what about personal budget<br />David: suppose we invent whole new model and it is so attractive that it attracts whole new budget<br />Total market size? Roughly $7B per year?<br />Robert: but market is not analyzable that way<br />Paul: but librarians are very responsive<br />Leslie: issue is who pays for it<br />Grant overheads, government?<br />Ed: the future of the costs in this thing will be much less than we pay right now<br />Robert: editorial costs<br />David: highwire press makes 120M per year from journals to do production costs<br />Doesn't include bandwidth costs<br />Paul: if we are thinking about research comm of the future I think research individuals are empowered to take responsibility for communication budget and costs and university is becoming service provider for me<br />Robert: absolutely right but big issue about how this impacts existing business model<br />David: a lot of money out there flowing through the system<br />Likely that the system will be disrupted<br />Publishers know it will be disrupted<br />Open access people convinced it will<br />To do disruption it has to cost that much less<br />Have to know what that cost is to determine level of disruption<br />How to quantify this<br />Some things will cost a lot<br />Sloan sky survey example<br />Just archiving journal would be 10-15 million a year<br />Adds up quickly<br />Paul: as a scientist want access to info as quickly as possible and want to sell my research to my funders as well as possible<br />More and more trading off certification for immediacy<br />David: very pivotal point I am much better at figuring out what's worth it to me<br />Robert: thinking with editors hat on reviewers add considerable value<br />Paul: don't think papers think about research production<br />happy to pay for people to package up research and make it look nice<br />Happy to pay for someone to take my info and make a portfolio for pitching grant agencies<br />Ed: a proposal: what does new infrastructure/Internet allow us to take away from traditional process?<br />Do we need google? Do we need archive? Do we need librarians?<br />How do we reconfigure scholarly publication process to make producer and consumer costs cheaper?<br />David: google costs funded completely outside this picture<br />Archiving stuff depends again on your belief in google, Internet archive survivability<br />Robert: this will show how publishers, librarians get killed and then reinvented<br />Brad: or a model to reinvent to<br />Paul: want to show how old pieces reconfigure to new model components<br />Leslie: flip this model to make it output driven e.g. Author pays model<br />Paul: I would posit you have $10k budget for scholarly communication how do I allocate it?<br />Acm subscription very important to me right now, less money for other things<br />Researchers are producers and consumers in this model<br />Ed: what would a scientist do to allocate wisely<br />Paul: by disrupting market, we create new ways to drive revenue/create products driven by researcher needs<br />Robert: what do you need to spend to know how to get your content into the right places<br />Olga: only value prop savings costs<br />David: let's list Paul's use cases<br />This is something we are likely to happen<br />Brad: find tradeoffs to define new points in scholarly comm design space<br />Value propositions:<br />Ed: Quicker certification of paper<br />Support for paper and data integration; information integration<br />Cleansing and archiving of data<br />Data maintenance and publishing<br />Data curation<br />Robert: what about paying extra for data curation how much<br />Ed: $15k/year/researcher<br />Paul: Personal profile/portfolio update and management for selling research etc.<br />David: ORCID does this but is the wrong model<br />Alessandro: Research analytics for management<br />Brad: Tools for reputation management<br />Ed: Automatic contextualization of paper I am looking at<br />I.e., Automatic contextualization of knowledge<br />Paul: Paper to blog post to tweet tools to drive higher citation<br />Prepackaged bits for all the research that I do<br />David: RSS feed generation automatically from my research work<br />Ed: aggregate my research into personal activity stream as poster<br />The feed on which reputation management would run<br />Olga: Personal advertising of research activity<br />Packaging service for my research sensitive to publication/communication context<br />Alessandro: do once deliver many times in many forms<br />Olga: personal marketing what to say to who in what form<br />Robert: analogy with music industry: Taxi as CD pressing company with links to radio stations<br />Pau:l packaging all types of activities into this<br />David: music and book self-publishing ahead of STM publishing industry in this way<br />Amazon self publishing example<br />Paul: hard to tell when publishers add value<br />Brad: making delivery of value transparent through disintermediation<br />David: is this going well as a discussion?<br />Robert: discussion going away from where other groups will be<br />David: I think it will be grounded well<br />Alessandro: e.g. Info integration and data curation<br />Ed: worried that we are inventing things<br />Brad: but it has been phrased in a way that is customer driven<br />Ed: right drive discussion back to value flow<br />Leslie back to who pays<br />David Stanford most money driven by overhead from research grants<br />Leslie: my school driven by very different model coming from undergraduate tuition<br />David: there are a bunch of different models<br />Fiona: this is kind of hard at the moment<br />Leslie: big question for me what kind of finders in terms of kind of value proposition<br />Paul: I was assuming my university gives me some money in a pot to do whatever that gets topped off from wherever<br />In Netherlands big push for Open access has let to pot of menu to prime the pump<br />Ed: thought experiment take one or more of these things we have proposed<br />Evaluate existing process vs. Existing plus enhancement what extra money would I pay?<br />Our proposal through FoRC publish enhanced paper in parallel<br />See who double publishes and for how much<br />Paul: my boss brought Mendeley services for better presentation in parallel<br />Ed: if double process survives this will validate approach<br />Key is making barriers to entry low (?)<br />Paul: let's talk about what you're willing to pay for<br />Ed: I tell my grad students to do complete info survey search back to 1962 and read each result<br />Robert: three market segments:<br />Tools for producers<br />Enhanced products for consumer<br />Reputation management<br />Ed: I believe costs will be much lower<br />Leslie: we can document this with an experiment<br />Brad: use customer development and business model generation methodology to validate business models as forward going FoRC activity<br />Paul: what about F1000?<br />Alessandro: policy for open access drives money flow<br />Leslie: if we can have as an activity to vet business models<br />Cost modeling is not trivial<br />Hard problem underestimate given lack of awareness of physical infrastructure overhead, etc.<br />Ed: some organizations have rules of thumb for cost overhead</p>        </div>
