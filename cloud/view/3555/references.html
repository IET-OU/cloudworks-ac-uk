        <p><strong><em>Session Overview</em></strong></p>
<p>This session will explore the role of diverse communities in sustaining the outcomes of JISC projects. It will consider: what it is that gets sustained by communities &ndash; whether software, services, personnel, skills, development agendas; what kinds of communities engage with JISC outcomes; and what features of those communities provide fertile ground for the seeds of innovation to grow.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;The session will be documented and outcomes will be fed into the development of a JISC Sustainability Toolkit, allowing the outcomes from this session to be sustained!</p>
<p><strong>Session Speakers:-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Helen Beetham (Session Chair) - Independent/JISC Consultant </li>
</ul>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm"><strong>Helen Beetham</strong> is an independent consultant, researcher and author in the field of e-learning, with particular expertise in UK Higher Education. Since 2004 she has played a leading role in the JISC e-learning programme, advising on programmes in curriculum design, learning literacies, open educational resources, and learners' experiences of e-learning. She is an experienced workshop leader and a regular speaker at conferences in the UK and abroad. A jointly edited volume, <em>Rethinking Learning for a Digital Age, </em>is available from Routledge (2010) and an edited volume on <em>Knowledge, Creativity and Communication</em> is in preparation.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0cm">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Jenny Mackness - Independent Education Consultant representing ELESIG.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jenny Mackness is an Independent Education Consultant, who specialises in facilitating and authoring online courses in higher education, and supporting and enabling technology enhanced projects and communities of practice. She is currently working with the support team for the JISC Institutional Innovation programme, synthesising the outcomes and outputs of 21 university projects. Jenny is also a founder member of the ELESIG community (Evaluation of Learners' Experiences of e-learning Special Interest Group), with responsibility for evaluating the work of the community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul Walk - Deputy Director, UKOLN</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul Walk has worked predominately in Higher Education in the UK since the early nineties. Starting in the academic library service at the University of North London, he went on to develop Web and intranet systems and take the technical lead in establishing the University's VLE service in 1997. Paul has been involved in many community and standards activities, notably with JA-SIG, the International DOI Foundation and IMS Enterprise, and was one of the founders of the XCRI specification for course descriptions which has been adopted widely across Europe. Paul joined UKOLN at the University of Bath in 2006 and became Deputy Director in 2010, in which role he has oversight of research and development. He has guided the development of UKOLN as a JISC Innovation Support Centre and the founding of a sustainable community of developers in HE through the JISC-funded DevCSI project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ross Gardler - Service manager, OSSWatch</li>
</ul>
<p>Ross is Vice President of Community Development at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and manager of JISC OSS Watch. Ross is a strong believer that looking after community will result in valuable outputs. His work enables him to examine and understand approaches to sustainability through open development and open innovation in many different fields. Ross engages with and advises on community management in a wide range of projects from newly funded short term research and development projects, international educational and research collaborations such as Opencast Matterhorn and the Open Bioinformatics Foundation, open source spin outs from research projects such as Apache Wookie (Incubating) and Jena, software foundations such as the ASF and mixed closed/open source initiatives such as the Microsoft Biology Foundation. Ross is also chair of TransferSummit, an open innovation conference focussing on collaborative exploitation of intellectual property in software."</p>
<ul>
<li>John Slater - Acting Director of Development, ALT</li>
</ul>
<p>John Slater is Acting Director of Development at the Association for Learning Technology, which has a Memorandum of Understanding with JISC and is involved in the JISC STG support team. He has had posts at a number of HEIs as an academic, manager, and service provider. He led the development and piloting of the successful National Student Survey for HEFCE. He currently also works in the area of the value added from offering elective learning opportunities in some specific large organisations which are mobile and distributed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Terry McAndrew - Director, Subject Centre for Biosciences</li>
</ul>
<p>Terry McAndrew is the C&amp;IT manager for the UK Centre for Bioscience and has been project manager for their recent Open Educational resources pilot project. In this role and as an IT tutor at the University of Leeds he has worked with many IT based projects over the last 25 years and realised many of the factors which make a project sustainable. He is keen to adopt a pragmatic approach but reinforces the need for necessary preparatory steps that must be in place for a project to have momentum to continue to develop, gather further support and thereby exhibit longevity.</p>
