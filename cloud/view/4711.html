        <p>I have a group of 27 students studying Heritage and Multicultural Literature and Shakespeare in the modern world.&nbsp; A percentage of them are not happy following a referencing system and the majority of them lean on secondary criticism to formulate their thinking,&nbsp; How do I ensure confidence in writing with control over their citations? Most of all, how do I allow them to learn how to achieve this as independent learners?</p>    </div>

			<p>I used TURNITIN to allow student up to four attempts to submit their work (with the understanding that I would not have access to their submissions at this point).&nbsp; I could see if they had submitted something before the deadline, however,</p>

<p>To be answered:</p>
<p>what were the stages of instruction overall?</p>
<p>what were the learning outcomes of each stage and how collectively do these all meet the stated leanring outcome(s) on the course</p>

			<p>The philosophy behind this system is that social interaction plays a fundamental role in the development of cognition (Vygotsky).</p>
<p>I modelled an essay being submitted and showed them the results in class; this allowed them to see how TURNITIN finds online sources and gives the percentage of material used.&nbsp; The traffic light system monitors the percentage of secondary sources over the primary - websites, journals and books, Thsi fomed at point of virtual socialisation - the students were able to have a learning dialogue with the TURNITIN system, because every time they resubmitted their work they were given instant feedback, albeit virtual.</p>

			<p>Benefits and disadvantages -</p>
<p>Three students submitted their work through an Apple system.&nbsp; This was non- supported and involved IT issued to allow a correctly formatted version to reach me.&nbsp; It caused delay in marking.</p>
<p>Three students are dyslexic and the system does not show the necessary green stickers to indicate this to makers (in this case I was aware of the specific learning considerations, but an additional markers might not have been).</p>
<p>The lack of Grade Mark meant that I had to reveiw the work through Word - as the university no longer offers this additional function.</p>
<p>The positives were that students engaged with their own development and took a competitive interest in their own research,</p>
<p>The online drop meant that they had up to the last minute to revise their writing and it made a journey onto campus unnecessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ths students and I have agreed that we will offer a blend of this submission system for the next set of essays.&nbsp; They will have access to the function, but we will accept paper copies of the 'anti plagiarised' essays for submission.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

                   <p>just a few thoughts - it would be interesting to know how you scaffolded the support available to students at each stage of their writing - before, during and after submission. This turnitin activity servers a very good purpose and is probaly made up of 3-4 stage but could alos form part of linked number of interventions - traditional and blend&nbsp; i.e</p>
<ul>
<li>what were the stages of instruction overall?</li>
<li>what were the learning outcomes of each stage and how collectively do these all meet the stated leanring outcome(s) on the course</li>
<li>how did you decide these stages?</li>
<li>what resources or tools were modelled or referred to at each stage?</li>
<li>what 'blend ' was selected and why?</li>
<li>what blended options were modelled in class and which were self-access&nbsp;</li>
<li>what benefits or issues arose / how was delivery and perfomance assessef?</li>
<li>what changes are needed? More or less or different blend? </li>
</ul>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p>stage 1 - awareness raising - plagiarism, academic regulations&nbsp;&nbsp; (tools - websites, hadbook, study advice, tasks in class...)&nbsp; - assessment of outcome 1?</p>
<p>stage 2 - resouces available to deal with academic requirements and plagiarism&nbsp;&nbsp; ( study advice, anti-plagiarism advice, critique past essay task etc) assessment of outcome 2?</p>
<p>stage 3 - obtainng referencing - assessing suiitability, ref lists etc ( what online resources available - library, library self-access on Bb etc ) assessment of outcome 3?</p>
<p>STAGE 4 - Reviewing assessment criteria&nbsp; - editing checks - using turnitin reports etc (what online resources available...) assessment of outcome 4?</p>
<p>stage 5 - advice and communicaton before finl submission?&nbsp; assessment of outcome 5?</p>
<p>stage 6 - evaluation and assessment of delivery, student performance, teacher benefits etc ?</p>

<p>Following our discussion this afternoon, I have sent you&nbsp; a 'map' of the related units and general traditional and blended&nbsp; or 'e' resources adopted which taken together help to achieve the overall aims and outcomes you are seeking to address</p>
<p>(I am now trying to work out how I can attach it here! )</p>
<p>it is a first draft so please do amend!</p>
