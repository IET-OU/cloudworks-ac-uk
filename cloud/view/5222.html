<p>Research Strand led by Dr Denise Whitelock.</p>
</div>
<div>This is one of four workshop strands that relate to</div>
<div>
<p><strong>STELLAR Grand Challenge 2: Orchestrating Learners</strong><br /> Key research questions related to this challenge include:</p>
<ul>
<li> What is the role of the teacher/more knowledgeable other in orchestrating learning and how does this relate to collaboration and the knowledge of students? </li>
<li>What is the role of assessment and evaluation in learning and how can technology play a role? </li>
<li>From the point of view of the learner what is the relationship between higher-order skills and learning of a particular knowledge domain and what is the role of technology in this respect? </li>
<li>How can we identify the current learning trajectory or a person? Would it be beneficial to make them aware of trajectory switches? </li>
</ul>

<p>http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=405152&amp;c=2</p>
<p>1. Should be for learning, not simply of learning</p>
<p>2. Should be reliable, valid, fair and consistent</p>
<p>3. Should consist of effective and constructive feedback</p>
<p>4. Should be innovative and have the capacity to inspire and motivate</p>
<p>5. Should measure understanding and application, rather than technique and memory</p>
<p>6. Should be conducted throughout the course, rather than being positioned as a final event</p>
<p>7. Should develop key skills such as peer and reflective assessment</p>
<p>8. Should be central to staff development and teaching strategies, and frequently reviewed</p>
<p>9. Should be of a manageable amount for both tutors and students</p>
<p>10. Should encourage dialogue between students and their tutors and students and their peers</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<h2>The Big Challenge of e-assessment:</h2>
<p>What we have at moment is wolf in sheeps clothing. We&rsquo;re being constructivist and collaborative with all these tools, but are we really doing this in practice.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation: What counts as evidence?</li>
<li>Look for guidelines for assessment for elearning</li>
<li>How openness give challenges to how we demonstrate our credentials when assessing students performance in elearning.</li>
<li>What can we do with mobiles and assessment</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Recognize the wolves!</p>
<p>Wolves as sheep &ndash; can we get them to lie down.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Individuals' responses to assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Explored reactions to personalised and automated forms of assessment.</li>
<li>When is it best to deliver feedback?</li>
<li>Should you emphasise achievement or effort?</li>
</ul>
<p>What evidence do we require that e-assessment is worth implementing?</p>
<ul>
<li>Depends on the purpose of the asessment</li>
<li>e-assessment would make faculty members rethink their practice</li>
<li>learners would rethink their learning goals</li>
<li>Allow them to develop their reflection, their transferable skills</li>
<li>Could be used to reflect to a group what they have discussed or not discussed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Measures that can be employed</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficult to change learner views and their engagement with and enjoyment of the assessment process</li>
<li>Allow teachers to move away from marking activities on which their time is not well spent</li>
</ul>
<p>Unique features of e-assessment, that would not be possible otherwise</p>
<ul>
<li>Can measure how consistent feedback is</li>
<li>Can use student satisafaction surveys to some extent.</li>
<li>Monitor dropout rate.</li>
<li>Reduce costs of marking</li>
<li>Reduce costs of monitoring plagiarism</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps for e-assessment</p>
<ul>
<li>Could include alerts and notifications</li>
<li>Important to know when learners are ready to receive those</li>
<li>Traffic-light system alerting teachers of groups of learners to difficulties</li>
<li>Marking when knowledge is transferred to a new area</li>
<li>Allow more able others to help with your learning problems</li>
<li>Facilitate assessment for the learner by making it more convivial</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Possible grand challenge for assessment</strong></p>
<p>Development of an evidence-based assessment system for cognitive, affective and psychomotoric learning providing learners with timely feedback at the right moment that leads finally to a society-wide asssessment literacy and a changed perception of assessment.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<h2>Assessment group New Grand Challenge:</h2>
<p>Task 1: looking at individuals&rsquo; responses to assessment.</p>
<p>Is feedback personal or depersonalised? Human interface versus computer interface to feedback. Pros and cons of both. When is it best to deliver feedback. Nature of it. Emphasise achievement or effort.</p>
<p>Task 2: What counts as evidence? e-assessment would make faculty members rethink their teaching practice. E-assessment would allow learners to practice critical thinking and reflection. Transfer skills would be important. E-assessment could be used as a way to reflect to the group what topics they had discussed or not discussed.</p>
<p>Measures you could employ. Changing learner views and objectives in entering the assessment process. Engagement and enjoyment of that process that is traditionally not enjoyable. Free up lecturer time to shift attention to more important aspects to enriching teaching and learning. Moving away from marking.</p>
<p>Focusing on unique features of assessment that could not be done otherwise. What are the key features?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is feedback more consistent than before</li>
<li>Student satisfaction surveys </li>
<li>Monitoring drop-out rate</li>
<li>Reducing costs of marking or reducing costs of monitoring plagiarism and cheating. Capture this or stop it happening with eassessment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Task 3: Killer app for mobile assessment &ndash; alerts and notifications. Important to know when learners ready to receive those alerts and notifications. When they would be most receptive to getting these kinds of signals.</p>
<p>Traffic light system app alerting teachers or other learners to difficulties that learners might be experiencing.</p>
<p>Capture features of understanding or applying knowledge out in the field.</p>
<p>Applications concerned with getting more able others to help you with your learning problems.</p>
<p>Applications to facilitate assessment for the learner by making the process more visible or pleasant &ndash; such as audio recording.</p>
<h3>Grand Challenge</h3>
<p>The development of an evidence-based assessment system for cognitive, affective, psychomotoric learning providing learners with timely feedback that leads to society-wide assessement literacy and a changed perception of assessment.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
