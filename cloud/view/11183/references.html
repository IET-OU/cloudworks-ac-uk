<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[Peter Horrocks; THE; Jisc; Alice.Bucheler; University World News; BBC]</em></p>
<p>London Economics was commissioned by the OU, Birkbeck and London South Bank University to research and publish <a href="https://londoneconomics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/London-Economics-How-is-the-demand-for-part-time-education-affected-by-changing-economic-conditions-12-09-2017.pdf" rel="nofollow">How is the demand for part-time higher education affected by changing economic conditions?</a>&nbsp; This 41-page report investigates the part-time HE landscape, the significant decline in numbers over the past decade, the impact of that decline on the labour market and how the reality stacks up against economic theory.&nbsp; The authors note, &ldquo;In the light of longer working lives, multiple career paths, ever-changing technologies and projected post-Brexit skills gaps, part-time higher education will become an even more important element of the higher education and skills jigsaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hefce&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/university-financial-health-check-2017-future-prospects" rel="nofollow">annual report on university finances</a> gives a stark warning that threats from Brexit, student numbers and pensions mean that financial projections from some HEIs are &ldquo;over-confident&rdquo; and that a noticeable minority faced serious challenges (e.g. Northampton, with total borrowing at 228% of net income; OU = 12.6%).&nbsp; Tuition fees typically account for 50% of university income, but this exceeded 75% for 22 HEIs; Swansea stood out in terms of fee growth, showing an 18% rise.&nbsp; Many universities also rely heavily on EU fees and research funding, with Cranfield topping that table at 10% of income.&nbsp; A good indicator of &lsquo;health&rsquo; is reckoned to be a university&rsquo;s unrestricted reserves as these represent surplus money it has built up and is able to spend on whatever it decides. &nbsp;In this respect, the OU rates second in the UK after Southampton and ahead of Oxbridge, with the reporter noting that just 14 institutions hold half of the total reserves for the whole UK sector.</p>
<p>A new report by UK2020, <a href="http://www.uk2020.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/JRTI5635_UK_higher_education_timebomb_report_170830_WEB.pdf" rel="nofollow">Timebomb: How The University Cartel is Failing Britain&rsquo;s Students</a>, well and truly pokes a pointy stick into a higher education hornets&rsquo; nest.&nbsp; The authors report a &ldquo;cartel of established universities that charge the same fees, have failed to deliver, stand in the way of innovation, oppose reform, resent being held to account for the quality of their teaching and have actively stifled new competition.&rdquo;&nbsp; The central recommendation is to expand the provision of 2 year degrees which the authors believe will help to reduce student debt and improve student satisfaction, to which the UUK response was that demand for 2 year degrees has so far been limited.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20170823141620220" rel="nofollow">HE is the UK&rsquo;s fifth largest export sector</a> and has a target, set by the Treasury in 2015, to increase from &pound;18bn in 2012 to &pound;30bn by 2020.&nbsp; Ludovic Highman reports that the Government seems keen to capitalise on our reputation &ndash; the UK has the most productive science base of all G7 countries, the second-highest share of mobile international students in the world and around 50% of British academic papers are co-authored with an international partner &ndash; as a political bargaining chip in broader negotiations.&nbsp; However, why have no international Free Trade Agreements outside the EU ever included either education or research, and how should we regard the EU in the future &ndash; as a partner or a competitor?</p>
<p>The Government has unveiled a <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2017090904372550" rel="nofollow">post-Brexit science position paper</a> which calls for a far-reaching agreement that will, &ldquo;strengthen science and innovation collaboration with European partners post-Brexit and would prefer to design a new type of deal than build on existing precedents&rdquo;.</p>
<p>New data shows that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41030304" rel="nofollow">fears over non-EU students outstaying their welcome in the UK are unfounded</a>, with Home Office exit checks showing that, out of 181,024 expired student visas, 176,407 (97.4%) left the country in time.&nbsp; Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: &ldquo;As we argued repeatedly with Theresa May [during the coalition], overseas students bring huge economic benefits to universities and the broader economy.&nbsp; It makes no sense for students to be included in official immigration statistics.&rdquo;&nbsp; A forthcoming review by the government's Migration Advisory Committee will look at the effect EU and non-EU students have on the UK labour market while they are in the UK; it will also look at the impact of tuition fees and other spending by foreign students on the national, regional and local economies.</p>
<p>And as concerns over new &ldquo;toughened up&rdquo; A-levels persist, The Telegraph reports that Britain&rsquo;s leading universities are scrambling to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/08/19/rise-top-universities-setting-entrance-exams-cannot-rely-a-levels/" rel="nofollow">introduce their own entrance exams</a>.&nbsp; Cambridge currently has 26, Oxford has 21 and a number of medical schools have introduced the UK Clinical Aptitude Test as a prerequisite for entry to a medical/dentistry degrees.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://intranet.open.ac.uk/ouintra/story.aspx?id=31679" rel="nofollow">OU and the National Extension College</a> have agreed a memorandum of understanding to campaign jointly to reverse the fall in the number of adults entering higher education.</p>

<p>FutureLearn will host Monash University&rsquo;s first online <a href="http://edtechnology.co.uk/Article/futurelearn-and-monash-university-team-up-for-online-courses" rel="nofollow">paid-for, credit-bearing courses in Healthcare Practice</a>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Food as Medicine: Fertility and Pregnancy&rsquo; will be the first course in a professionally-endorsed programme aimed at medical specialists, general practitioners, nurses, and those in the healthcare field looking for revalidation within a specific area of nutrition.&nbsp; Subsequent courses within the programme include &lsquo;Talking about Weight&rsquo;, &lsquo;Food and our Genome&rsquo;, &lsquo;Food, Exercise and the Gut&rsquo; and &lsquo;Food and Inflammation&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open education pioneers&rdquo; George Siemens and David Wiley are teaming up to pilot a new edX course entitled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-08-23-george-siemens-and-david-wiley-join-forces-for-a-mooc-about-open-education" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Open Education</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The six-week long MOOC will touch on topics including open educational resources (OER), open pedagogy and practice, open knowledge, open research and how the field has evolved.&nbsp; According to Wiley, &ldquo;Twenty years ago, nobody believed there&rsquo;d be any kind of sizeable, sustainable movement around people sharing openly licensed, effective learning content &hellip; But, that&rsquo;s absolutely where this is all going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite occasional news items about MOOCs showing beneficial effects in Africa, uptake remains fairly low for a host of understandable reasons, not least of which is limited internet access &ndash; averaging about 9% of population across the continent.&nbsp; A recent presentation looks at the growth of more accessible <a href="http://www.downes.ca/post/67193" rel="nofollow">MOOACs</a> (&ldquo;On Air&rdquo;) which deliver instruction over the radio &ndash; something successfully implemented in remote regions (notably Australia) for many decades. &nbsp;The presentation itself lasts about 20m, followed by about 35m of discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Worrying Ignorance of Alternative Degree Options</strong></p>
<p><em>[StudentCrowd; The Guardian]</em></p>
<p>It was a small poll &ndash; around 1,000 learners who were asked just 3 questions by StudentCrowd on behalf of The Higher Education Commission &ndash; but it revealed <a href="https://www.studentcrowd.com/article/diversity-of-provision-in-higher-education" rel="nofollow">disturbing levels of ignorance about alternatives to campus based degree study</a>.&nbsp; Around half (51%) thought it was not possible study part-time for their degree and 77% did not realise they could study entirely online, perhaps because 82% reported that their careers adviser did not &ldquo;talk to you about studying with an alternative provider&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Amidst all the coverage of A-level results and university applications, the CMI&rsquo;s Petra Wilton bemoans the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/aug/18/if-degree-apprenticeships-are-to-widen-access-we-need-to-raise-awareness" rel="nofollow">lack of press coverage of degree apprenticeships</a>, citing a recent survey of 1,000 UK parents of 11- to 18-year-old children which found that just 20% were aware of degree apprenticeships. &nbsp;Amongst parents from lower socio-economic bands, this fell to just 10%.&nbsp; She notes, &ldquo;There is a certain irony to this trend. Apprenticeships have historically been viewed with a certain amount of snobbery, yet it is now middle-class parents who are more likely to weigh up the cost of university and the quality of opportunities offered by apprenticeships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And scepticism over the value of degrees is not restricted just to parents.&nbsp; Many head teachers believe that companies are starting to favour applicants with technical and business skills, which may explain why around 376,000 UK learners are enrolled in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4825394/Private-schools-urge-pupils-choose-Btecs-not-degrees.html" rel="nofollow">vocationally based BTEC courses</a>.&nbsp; The number of pupils at independent schools taking BTECs instead of A-levels has doubled since 2013, with less than half of those then going on to university.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Non-profit OpenStax has established itself in the US and its textbooks are expected to save students there more than $145m this academic year.&nbsp; Now the publisher is hoping to do the same for UK students through a partnership, funded by the Hewlett Foundation, with <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2017/09/12/openstax-takes-open-textbook-model-international.aspx" rel="nofollow">the OU's UK Open Textbooks project</a>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The data suggests there is a great and growing need in the UK for more books like those published by OpenStax,&rdquo; said the OU&rsquo;s Prof Martin Weller. &nbsp;&ldquo;We'll be exploring how textbooks are chosen by UK instructors, what kind of messages resonate with UK audiences, how faculty adapt open content to meet their needs and what parts of OpenStax's process can be generalized for initiatives in other countries.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Are We Recreating Segregated Education Online?</strong></p>

<p>John Hattie&rsquo;s book, <a href="http://mje.mcgill.ca/article/view/9475/7229" rel="nofollow">Visible Learning</a> (2008) quickly gained traction as a definitive guide to what works and what does not in education.&nbsp; Based on his own analysis of over previous 800 meta-analyses, comprising over 50,000 studies and millions of individuals, Hattie published over 135 effect sizes showing XXXXXXX.&nbsp; Now statistician Pierre-J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Bergeron revisits the data, concluding that, &ldquo;John Hattie and his team have neither the knowledge nor the competencies required to conduct valid statistical analyses.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a relatively short paper which does not pull any punches, he cautions, &ldquo;We cannot allow ourselves to simply be impressed by the quantity of numbers and the sample sizes; we must be concerned with the quality of the study plan and the validity of collected data.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beth Holland looks at the impact of such devices on learning, citing two recent studies that show a <a href="https://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/2017/08/17/digital-note-taking-strategies-that-deepen-student-thinking/" rel="nofollow">detrimental effect on assessment scores</a> for &lsquo;lecture-style courses&rsquo;.&nbsp; However, she points out that these relate to conventional teaching approaches rather than those that have been devised or adapted to take advantage of digital affordances, noting: &ldquo;If teachers recognize the power of digital tools, and their responsibility to help students learn to use them, then digital note taking isn&rsquo;t just &lsquo;one more thing to do&rsquo;. &nbsp;Instead, it becomes an important skill that could help students to engage with ideas, synthesize concepts and build the critical thinking skills that they will need to be successful learners in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile IDC looked at the <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2017/08/28/personal-computing-devices-expected-to-decline-through-2021.aspx" rel="nofollow">personal computing market</a>, predicting a slow decline with an overall five-year compound annual growth rate of -1.7% for all devices through to 2021.&nbsp; But there are variations within that broad category with, for example, detachable tablets and convertible notebooks showing a five-year CAGR of more than 14% and ultraslim notebooks not far behind at 11.8%.&nbsp; IDC also notes that things could change if applications such as VR/gaming start to take off in a big way.</p>
<p>Unusually for Apple, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/the-iphone-8-is-the-apple-phone-for-the-rest-of-us/" rel="nofollow">iPhone 8</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/apples-iphone-x-might-be-the-best-phone-money-can-buy/" rel="nofollow">iPhone X</a> features were fairly well leaked/predicted.&nbsp; Perhaps the most surprising thing was the dollar:pound parity in UK pricing, meaning a &lsquo;basic&rsquo; (sorry Apple) $999 64GB iPhone X will cost you <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-x" rel="nofollow">&pound;999</a>, despite the exchange rate currently sitting at around $1.30.</p>

<p><em>[BPS; ESPN]</em></p>
<p>Researchers in Tasmania have found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/30/coffee-cravings-can-play-havoc-with-your-memory/" rel="nofollow">skipping your morning coffee</a> before a lecture or an important meeting will not only make you less alert, but the cravings you experience will impair your ability to memorise new information. &nbsp;They also found that their participants (<em>N=</em>55) were unaware of how caffeine cravings had affected them &ndash; suggesting that if we try to learn things when desperate for a coffee we are at risk of being overconfident about what we&rsquo;ve taken in.</p>
