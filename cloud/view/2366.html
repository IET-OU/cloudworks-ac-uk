        <p>Opportunities of technologies for learning &ndash; but why have we not got real change and impact?</p>
<p>Not much evidence of a tangible gain in inclusion&hellip;&nbsp; Are we seeing real changes, dramatic changes in our students?&nbsp; Issue of conscious government neglect. Technological solutions cant be serious considered and wont work unless it occurs in an appropriate socio-cultural context. &nbsp;There is the question &ndash; how do we know its making a change? We need to rethink quality. Some of the design tools might be the solution but also wondered if they were new bottles for old wine? Morton&rsquo;s student profiling, useful but does it enhance learning? &nbsp;Still is a worthwhile innovation. Technological developments may serve a variety of needs not just enhancement for learning? What are our value positions as distance educators? We can use technologies in ways that are compatible with their value positions. We need to understand we have a value base and this is important.&nbsp; Our first commitment must always be to the values enterprise, we must not be beguiled by the technologies. Inspirational keynote by Sugata. Not what can be achieved by giving students computers, but releasing them from the constraints of formal education. Seeing learning in new ways. OERs: best idea that never worked. Who has used them? Transformative potential of OER coming out of Carnegie work, shift from teachers to learners? We have not prepared the ground for embedding OERs. Doesn&rsquo;t matter how good an idea is, if we don&rsquo;t prepare the ground for it, and support it.</p>    </div>

                   <p>Thanks for that&nbsp; - now see should have been here in plenary.</p>
<p>Nice&nbsp; addition to final key note isn't it - although we were focusing more in our group on  course providers using OERs . If they are being used by millions of learners registered or not on formal course then the library analogy is even more apposite.</p>

                   <p>The THES article is a brilliant survey of where we are now and where we are trying to get to. I wish I had read it when our home group got bogged down in a parochial discussion about Helen L's resistance strategies.</p>
<p>In fact, as Martin Bean pointed out later in the day, over 5.9 m people worldwide have registered with OpenLearn, and a huge percentage are outside the UK.</p>
<p>And we didn't even discuss iTunes U and the OU on YouTube.</p>
<p>Perhaps OERs like OpenLearn are partly a version of the Hole in the Wall approach, where the resource is just there - let's see what happens next?</p>
<p>So far, OpenLearn has led to thousands of new learners registering for new OU courses - for credit, for qualifications - that they might never have heard about.</p>
<p>Some of our home group felt that the OERs were a sort of public and ostentatious display with no one actually watching or looking. Clearly not true!</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi all</p>
<p><em>S</em><em>ome of our home group felt that the OERs were a sort of public and ostentatious display with no one actually watching or looking</em></p>
<p>Actually there was no direct information about how many people were using OERs or why they were using the OERs in the conference - if there was - &nbsp;my fault for missing it .</p>
<p>The THE article makes it clear that there is much use. It implies that it is being used for informal learning or potential students. The OERs can also&nbsp;give them the taster or the confidence they need to enroll if they wish. Good for providers as well then.</p>
<p>However our discussion focused more on the use&nbsp;by <em>course providers.</em> We discussed the issue of re-purposing and the way that quality courses are designed and written with relevancy in mind. Some people in the group were very interested in using them, and others wanted to discuss other issues round them &ndash; including re-using them. One point from Helen was that experience shows it can be as expensive to re-make/update modules/courses as starting from scratch and we discussed how useful OERs might be in terms of creating learning materials &lsquo;fit for purpose&rsquo;. I am sure we will go away and look at them from our own needs and experiences &ndash; then we can discuss more effectively!!</p>
<p>Also I do not think that the presentation of 'resistance strategies' is at&nbsp; all helpful. The word resistance implies a power relationship and a sense that 'luddites' have no legitimate point of view and are just using excuses not to &lsquo;update themselves&rsquo;. I imagine that the truth would be more interesting and more complex than that.</p>
<p>I also think that the issues of copyright and intellectual property and use of resources created for an organization and made available in other contexts are legitimate concerns.</p>
<p>One of the things I took away from the conference was the very many different <em>contexts </em>in which the delegates were delivering online/distance/open/e/blended learning. At the same time we had much in common in terms of other issues such as attitudes to distance learning etc. I think a tension between different contexts and a creative recognition of commonality was one of the things that made it such an interesting experience &ndash; and I take back some great examples to try out.</p>
<p>and finally a&nbsp;nice OER (I think) &nbsp;from someone at Aber University &ndash; Daniel Chandler who teaches semiotics</p>

                   <p>Daniel's website looks interesting, but I couldn't see the learning resources - can you give a link?</p>
<p>When you look at the OpenLearn site I hope you will find materials that are easy to reuse, because they have been designed for that purpose - and many others have adapted them and found the exercise productive. UNISUL in Brazil is one of the examples I quoted.</p>
<p>That's why there is a Learning Space and a Lab Space.</p>
<p>I don't want to open a can of worms, though. It is always going to be difficult to take what someone else has produced for their version of the world and to adapt it for one's own. Most of the time, I feel - as others said - that if you want to put across a teaching point, it's very likely someone has done it already, perhaps with more resources than you had&nbsp; available.</p>        </div>
