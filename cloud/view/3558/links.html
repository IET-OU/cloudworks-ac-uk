        <p><strong><em>Session Overview</em></strong></p>
<p>JISC projects deal with an array of issues which affect a range of different people. Yet what is relevant to one person may be insignificant to another. This session focuses on how to tailor your communications to different stakeholders in order demonstrate the relevance of your work to each audience.</p>
<p>Working collaboratively in study groups of up to 6 participants, you will discuss each of their projects in outline.&nbsp; Your group will then identify one project on which to work collaboratively.</p>
<p>Using a &ldquo;proposition template&rdquo; and to guide them, plus details of the characteristics and key concerns of different target audience groups, your group will develop and deliver a timed 5 minute presentation to your session colleagues which will communicate the key messages of their chosen project tailored to the needs, characteristics and concerns of a specific audience group.</p>
<p>By the close of the workshop, you will have gained insight into the characteristics of key audience groups and how best to target and tailor messages to respond to their stakeholders&rsquo; differing needs and concerns.</p>

			<p>Delegates have arrived to discover that there's a seating plan and they've been allocated to five different tables, which is causing some interest... And helping conversations flow already. I can hear quite a few introductions going on and connections being made.</p>
<p>It's also clear that there are more people present than there are names on the tables. But no fear. There's going to be some constructive  ad-libbing and group formation later on.</p>
<p>This is clearly a workshop where real practical things are going to be achieved as much as a straight-forward presentation.</p>
<p>The room is very full. And we're starting. "It's nice to be so popular - and so soon after lunch," says Rosemary. She tells everyone to attach themselves to a group. And tells them to choose well because "it's going to be quite a competitive session."</p>
<p>Rosemary is giving us the background ideas to the session. It's going to focus on communications and how to target specific stakeholder groups in a way that has meaning for them.</p>
<p>Rosemary is now telling us about the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/events/2010/07/jif10/virtualgoodybag" rel="nofollow">virtual goody bag</a> on the conference website to back up the session.</p>
<p>Now Jane Charlton is giving us a run through all the projects JISC runs and the need to reduce the "noise" from all the various communications from those projects. To allow for clear consistent messages that will create bigger impact - and more cost effective messages - within the community.<br /><br />She asks us to think about how messages can help solve problems with ref to long term sustainability and cost effectiveness.<br /><br />She's showing a slide of five corporate JISC messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing costs</li>
<li>Building universities for the future</li>
<li>Managing information better</li>
<li>Improving the student experience</li>
<li>Keeping leading edge research in the UK</li>
</ul>
<p>She now offers general advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Putt out clear, simple messages</li>
<li>Thinking about the purpose of each message you send out</li>
<li> Target messages (and the language within them) to your audience</li>
<li>Time the message and ask how it fits with the projects' other messages.</li>
<li>Think about impact. Demonstrate value for money and impact within the sector.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Rosemary has taken the floor again and asks us to think about why communication is so important to us.<br /><br />One of the big issues is that we think we know what we're saying - but we have to understand different audiences have different understandings.<br /><br />Communication is to inform people what you do.</p>
<p>"It matters," she emphasises.</p>
<p>Now Rosemary discusses "benefits" and that what people want to know not just what is going on, but how what is going on might help them.</p>
<p>She mentions the example of the University of The Year Award and how it would mean nothing unless people knew about the advantages it brings.</p>
<p>There's competition for attention, commitment and time, she says.</p>
<p>Rosemary now asks us to imagine the Cannes film festival and trying to get appointments with someone to produce your fantastic script... But you can't make appointments with the people with the money. So in a last ditch attempt you go to the hotel where top producers are staying and try to get their attention... You have the 500 page script... people are tying to get you out of the way... the producer is about to get into the elevator... you have two minutes to pitch the script while they're on the way to the 25th floor.</p>
<p>"So!" says Rosemary. "Who wants to stand up now and give us a two-minute elevator sell."</p>
<p>There are nervous giggles and no one gets up.</p>
<p>"Well by the end of the session that's what you'll be able to do."</p>
<p>Rosemary asks us to remember the following very important ideas; If you want to be able to communicate effectively with your stakeholders, they have to know who you are, what you are doing and where the value of your project lies."</p>
<p>There are a top five marketing rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify critical stakeholders</li>
<li>Demonstrate relevance</li>
<li>Speak their language</li>
<li>Communicate a robust and understandable project proposition</li>
<li>Market the benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we're splitting into groups and going over handouts about promoting projects and defining the project proposition.</p>
<p>There are questions relating to the objectives of the project, the market definition, the distinctive competencies of people on the team, added value that the project might bring. how does it fit with live market issues, whether it is accessible...</p>
<p>"We're tight on time so we're going to have to be fierce about getting though this," says Rosemary. She tells the groups to decide on one project to focus on - and one specific stakeholder group to target... and then come up with a four minute elevator sell based on the answers to the questions on the handout mentioned above.</p>
<p>There's going to be voting based on applause relating to the pitches at the end.</p>
<p>Rosemary notes that the audience looks "stunned" but says "don't worry, it will be fine." She and Jane Charlton and Ben Showers will also be circulating the room, answering questions and helping delegates organise...</p>
<p>There's now a thrum of activity and engagement in the room. Much chin scratching, hand gesturing, leaning forwards and discussion.</p>
<p>The group nearest to me are working out what they're going to focus on - and in the process getting to know each other and their various professional needs and concerns.</p>
<p>Quite a few people are taking notes around the room now... and Rosemary is saying that by now delgates should be thinking about which project they're going to tackle and which stakeholder group they want to address.</p>
<p>Someone's moving a flip chart around... No writing on it yet, but there's a lot going on in the room. Lots of head nodding and involved discussion.</p>
<p>And even as I typed that last entry, Jane Charlton has picked up a pen and the flipchart is in use. Looks like the project is about using the strategic ICT toolkit... We'll find out when the pitches are made in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Another chart is in action! The top line on this one is about getting access management services to a variety of applications.</p>
<p>Five minutes left, says Rosemary.</p>
<p>It's almost presentation time. It seems to have passed very quickly. I'll be very impressed if delegates have come up with solid pitches. They're certainly looking confident.</p>
<p>Rosemary says she's hoping that someone will sing... "Actually," she says, "I said that once and someone did." She gives the impression that it wasn't an entirely positive experience...</p>
<p>Delegates are at the stage of deciding who's going to present.</p>
<p>"Okay, that's it," says Rosemary. "Remember the ultimate delivery is a very short elevator sell."</p>
<p><strong>First pitch:</strong></p>
<p>Who it's for - The institutional IT director who needs to be convinced about the value of knitting to the University.</p>
<p>The delegate brings up an example of the unique collection of knitting at his university.</p>
<p>He's selling it well... says there's unviversal appeal, from a local to a global level.</p>
<p>He's talking very fast!</p>
<p>He talks about the transferrable benefits from the skills related to making 3D images of the knitting projects. There's a lot that can feed into other things... "Here's your floor, bye!"</p>
<p><strong>Next pitch</strong></p>
<p>They're going for the director of IT too.</p>
<p>The delegate is talking about the concerns the IT manager must have relating to ICT investment and institutional needs.</p>
<p>He brings up ways other universities deliver on value. He wants to find nine other organisations and use a toolkit to work out how well their investments are linked to strategies. :Plus, I can give you &pound;10,000 to put a plan together," he says. Clever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Next pitch</strong></p>
<p>Pro-vice chancellor. Talking about retention issues. The idea is to use existing tech tools to capture the student voice and use that to look at retention issues. They will publish advice from students to others arriving and help those who are there... It will help build on previous JISC projects and in the innovative use of low-level tools to support students will bring attention to the university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Next pitch</strong></p>
<p>Addressed to a Pro Vice Chancellor.</p>
<p>Addressing the problem of losing students. The solution is to help them find out enough about the courses the university is running by making it searchable on the web. Because they'll have specific information we're more likely to keep them - and it will save admin and student time. We'll also be the first uni in Wales doing this...</p>
<p><strong>Next pitch</strong></p>
<p>Addressed to a director of IT.</p>
<p>It's addressing the problem of there being huge amounts of data on the web, but users not being empowered to collaborate using it. We will provide a system to integrate in-house applications and allow ussers to use resources like youtube in a flexible way, to form dynamic groups and share resources. There will bemaintenance cost benefits. We'll be using an open protocol so we'll be able to benefit from in and out house applications. We'll give you the product for free for your department and if you like it we have flexible price plans for the entire university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phew!</p>
<p><br />That was fast and furious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm seriously impressed," says Rosemary.</p>
<p><br />We're getting feedback now. A delegate says there was no name given for the last pitch!</p>
<p>There are lots of comments on the way the pitches are structured. One delegate also picks up on the wide range of mini-business plans that can be applicable in lots of ways...</p>
<p>Rosemary now says that what the delegates have achieved in just over 20minutes can sometimes take up to two weeks to produce.</p>
<p>She has a few observations:</p>
<p>She's pleased that someone spoke about a project as an exemplar and showing a way that it could be applied to the whole institution.</p>
<p>She also likes the fact that connections and networking with other organisations were brought into the pitches. That will always bring value, she says.</p>
<p>She likes the fact that someone stressed how easily managable their project was.</p>
<p>She likes the "you've got a problem, I can solve it for you" approach that some pitches took.</p>
<p>This brings her onto the need to understand stakeholders really well - and knowing what's in it for them.</p>
<p>She also talks about how stressing the kudos a project might bring to an institution could be helpful.</p>
<p>Rosemary is now talking about the psychology of getting someone's attention and talking about how "if you do this small thing here, you'll get this result and benefit."</p>
<p>A delegate has brought up the important point that within the pitch you also need to introduce the next step... be that arranging the next meeting or communications for moving things on.</p>
<p>"We are pitching for people's attention," says Rosemary. "The thing to remember is what is the competition. It might be other projects. It might just be getting someone's attention."</p>
<p>So she stresses the need to cut to the chase and help people feel the idea and relate to it.</p>
<p>There's now a discussion about context. So, at the moment, everyone is going to be concerned that money is scarce and most projects are going to have to address that.</p>
<p>A delegate brings up the problem relating to benefits with R&amp;D projects where the benefits won't really be clear until the end...</p>
<p>Rosemary talks about the need to take ideas to people. "If you have accurate commuications it means people can make informed choices."</p>
<p>We're drawing to a close now. Rosemary acknowledges that this was a tough thing to do in a short amount of time. "It's only been an hour and a half but I feel like I've known you all my life," she says.</p>
<p>There's warm applause and the session is over. That was an intense mental workout for everyone involved!&nbsp;</p>			<div class="posted-by">
