        <p>This study is about life experiences of street children in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. The broad aim of the study is to explore and examine life experiences of street children and to capture their own perspective of life in the streets of Bulawayo presented in their own words. The study departs from what Hecht (1998) calls an obsession of many writers whose focus is on causes and what can be done to remove them from the streets.</p>
<p>Children living on and working on the streets in Bulawayo and other cities is a post-independence phenomenon which has over the three decades reached alarming rates for the residents, local authorities and central government. It is not unique to Bulawayo but a common feature in many cities in Zimbabwe and in many developed and developing countries around the world.</p>
<p>A lot has been said and written about Zimbabwe&rsquo;s political and economic problems with very little mention of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s children and more so street children. Street children are vulnerable and constitute what can be termed &lsquo;Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Forgotten Children&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Studies on street have been descriptive which has been unhelpful in improving practice and policy formulation. Methods used in many studies have surveys and interviews focusing on the life on the streets and reasons for being on the streets.</p>
<p>The study will employ a number qualitative methods for example&nbsp; ethnographic narratives (generative), semi-structured interviews, participant observations, mental and depot maps and photographs I will also discuss ethical issues such as gaining access and informed consent.</p>    </div>

			<p>His background is in Social Work for over 20 years, some in Zimbabwe and some here. His title has changed: to Life experiences of street children in Bulawayo: Developing a child centred model.</p>
<p>Every time people talk about Zimbabwe everyone wants to know about Mugabe. Bulwayo (City of Kings) is his home town. In the late 1990s, that&rsquo;s when street children started occurring (?) or when he started working there.</p>
<p>There is a new gov&rsquo;t of unity which is of hope.</p>
<p>Street children are a global phenomena. Today, in the news, the London mayor was talking about the homeless of which street children is part of that group. Most of the models of street children has been from Latin America. The image of street children is that they&rsquo;re prone to be criminals and they&rsquo;re exploited. There have been efforts to look at the background of street children,</p>
<p>His aims are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To develop and understanding of life experience of street children</li>
<li>To examine how they negotiate spaces and places that they occupy (The street is a public and private space at the same time. In the Western world there is a structure of home, school and play. But street children are different &ndash; but their access is negotiated i.e. places where they won&rsquo;t be chased away)</li>
<li>Understand how children construct and contest their identities (such as social exclusion &ndash; what is important to the children)</li>
<li>Explore development of policy responses</li>
</ul>
<p>He is talking about a task force that is defunct now in Zimbabwe and that there are only 2 NGOs that helping with the welfare of children. There is hope with the unity govt&rsquo; that things will move on.</p>
<p>There is no common definition of street children. Most common one is by UNICEF &ndash; where boys and girls use the street as their home and a source of livelihood. This model is based on Latin America. This model has been transported to Africa and wonders if you can do this since there are differences in culture and languages. In Latin America, it has been colonised with mostly people speaking with one language. In Africa, there were many colonisations, with different religions and different languages.</p>
<p>There is a wide definition since there are children from slums, children who are abandoned, children who live with their families on the street etc (?)</p>
<p>There is very little literature on Zimbabwean street children
[removed][removed]
&ndash; the major one by the UN looked at the number of the children on the streets. Another is on the child-headed households.</p>
<p>After the UN rights of the children charter, Africa developed their own since they felt it didn&rsquo;t reflect their cultures etc, but it has not been put into practice.</p>
<p>There was an operation clean-up where street children were removed from the streets.</p>
<p>Wakatama (2007) did a project on street children looking at the children&rsquo;s rights &ndash; how they&rsquo;re implementing the UN charter.</p>
<p>His methodology would be grounded throy via a child-centred method in which he hopes to use ethnographic methods. He wants the children to tell him their life stories from as far back as when they remember &ndash; these would be narratives. He wants also them to do drawings &ndash; since drawings help draw out memories.</p>
<p>He hopes to get access by through gatekeepers such as working as a volunteer or work in a drop-in centre. He hopes to get informed consent from the children and signed as well. For his safety he hopes to use the drop-in centre for the interviews.</p>
<p>He is showing an image of Bulwayo and some street children &ndash; they look desolate ... and lonely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a dog, I&rsquo;m a dog&rdquo; &ndash; quotation from a S .Africa&rsquo;s street child &ndash; as a dog lives outside and gets scraps.</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p><em>Someone is talking about a project where they observed Aylesbury over a year, where people observed spaces and allows people to say what types of people were on the streets depending on the time of day. She is saying you&rsquo;ll have to decide where in the city you&rsquo;ll want to focus on &ndash; just to make sure it is not big.</em></p>
<p>In terms of location, having lived in Bulwayo &ndash; he has a clear idea where the children are &ndash; they&rsquo;re mostly in the CDB (for activities not living) &ndash; how they are as a group changes. He will be focusing with consistency those in the centre.&nbsp; Also, using mapping he&rsquo;ll build up a mental depot (?) &ndash; i.e. understand where they&rsquo;re buying, selling and eating things. He is saying during the economic downturn the grocers were using street children as their sellers (?).</p>
<p><em>Some guy is saying that he was struck by his conclusion in saying that street children are a global phenomena when to him it is a local phenomena (??)</em></p>
<p><em>What I meant by a global phenomena is that you find them in every country. But cultural, religious differences mean that you need a child-centred model. The African child in a Muslim community would be treated differently i.e. a boy would be on the street but a girl won&rsquo;t. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;Some of the Latin American models, the street children issues arise because of economical stages. Are you looking for a model that would work in other parts of Africa or is particularly to a country, a region or economical stages. I won&rsquo;t like to apply to other countries such as in Johannesburg because of the apartheid most of the kids would be blacks on the streets. Or Angola which is ravished by war etc.</p>
<p><em>You talk about using photographs in your research which is a brilliant idea. Are you taking photographs with you or are you going to let the children to take pictures? She is also talking about an exhibition of homeless people during the Communist period in Hungary (?)</em></p>
<p>What I intend to do is to get disposable cameras and give it to street children to take places of interests and provides a way of discussion. Taking pictures in Zimbabwe is a problem as it is swarming with security cameras and would have to assess the risk &ndash; as well as, if they&rsquo;ll steal the cameras :D. I would need to talk to people in power and get permission such as if I get arrested I have people to come rescue me :) - as you&rsquo;re seen as a spy if you&rsquo;re doing research from the UK.</p>
<p><em>How are you going to manage it terms of children itself? Gender? Age? To make it a more narrowed down project?</em></p>
<p>With age I&rsquo;ve not been able to gauge how old they are. I would like to concentrate on age range from 9 to 18. There would be street children who probably have children as well. I won&rsquo;t discriminate based on gender or disability but would discriminate based on the period they are on the street &ndash; so probably at least 6 mths to 1 year.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
