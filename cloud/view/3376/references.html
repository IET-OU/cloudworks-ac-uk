<p><strong>LMS Patents</strong></p>
<p>The Blackboard dispute over LMS/VLE patents may have recently reached a conclusion, but a number of LMS companies now find they are being sued by IPLearn, a group which periodically seems to file claims under the questionable <a href="http://trends.masie.com/archives/2010/3/29/613-government-and-learning-lawsuits-hit-lms-field-again.html" rel="nofollow">Business Process Patent</a> statue, a decade ago.&nbsp; Elliott believes IPLearn may be on shaky ground.&nbsp; For example, they claim invention of this from 1999: &ldquo;A method and a system to teach a user a subject based on his questions. &nbsp;The system allows the user to control his learning process, and helps to fill in gaps of misunderstanding in the subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gasp.&nbsp; Does this mean we&rsquo;ll have to pay royalties on &lsquo;sitting with Nellie&rsquo;?</p>

<p><strong>iPad</strong></p>
<p>Parents of Year 8 pupils at Davison High School in Worthing are being asked to contribute to the costs of <a href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/5070136.Worthing_school_asks_parents_to_buy_children_iPads/" rel="nofollow">Apple iPads</a>, which the school wants every Year 9 pupil to use in lessons as part of its new eLearning project, beginning in September. &nbsp;In the letter, the school's deputy headteacher said: "As a technology college we believe in the power of electronic learning tools such as laptops, netbooks and tablet PCs and the difference they can make to achievement in school."</p>

<p>Beginning this autumn, all new undergraduate students at Seton Hill University, Pennsylvania, will receive a 13" <a href="http://www.setonhill.edu/techadvantage/" rel="nofollow">MacBook laptop and an iPad</a> for classes and personal use, with the MacBook being replaced after two years.&nbsp; So are these free?&nbsp; Only if you ignore the $500 that&rsquo;s been added to the tuition fees.</p>

<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/memeo-is-bringing-a-google-docs-reader-to-the-ipad" rel="nofollow">Memeo&rsquo;s Connect Reader</a> will allow users to download and natively view all of their Google Docs files on their iPads.&nbsp; The application allows users of any Google Docs account to automatically download and store their Docs, which they can then view using the iPad&rsquo;s document viewer that&rsquo;s been integrated into Memeo&rsquo;s app.&nbsp; The viewer supports a range of popular formats, including Office, Apple&rsquo;s iWork formats and docs created in Google&rsquo;s online editor.</p>

<p>Liza Daly reports some &lsquo;issues&rsquo; with <a href="http://blog.threepress.org/2010/04/05/ibooks-and-epub/" rel="nofollow">ePub on iPad</a> but she concludes that &ldquo;iBooks is pretty good for a first-generation ePub reader.&nbsp; The biggest concern is of course that once you purchase books from iTunes, you&rsquo;re locked in to only reading them in iBooks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Ben Hawkridge]</p>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8620195.stm" rel="nofollow">International release of the iPad</a> is being delayed until the end of May, with Apple accepting pre-orders on 10 May.&nbsp; The company blamed demand for the device in the US, where 500,000 iPads were sold in the first week of its release.</p>

<p><strong>YouTube EDU</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/25/youtube-edu-stats" rel="nofollow">YouTube EDU</a> was launched a year ago and now includes content from 300 colleges and universities (including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheOpenUniversity" rel="nofollow">OU View</a>), spanning 10 countries and seven languages.&nbsp; The collection has grown to 65,000 videos, including 350 full courses.&nbsp; Auto-captioning allows the site to automatically translate any lectures spoken in English to other languages.&nbsp; To compare with iTunes U , the Apple service has 600 university partners and &ldquo;250,000 free lectures, videos, films, and other resources&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Age Profiles of Social Network Users</strong></p>
<p>Pingdom has assembled some data on user <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2010/02/16/study-ages-of-social-network-users/" rel="nofollow">age profiles for different social networking sites</a>.&nbsp; It seems that youngsters head for Bebo, whilst the silver surfers are on classmates.com, with the rest of us hovering somewhere in between.&nbsp; George has rightly questioned the accuracy of some of the data and assumptions &ndash; surely the average age for Bebo can&rsquo;t really be 28.4, and why isn&rsquo;t the 18-24 online presence higher?</p>

<p><strong>Twitter for Learning</strong></p>
<p>Having recently admitted to George Siemens that I don&rsquo;t tweet (oh, the shame), I hope to find inspiration from Tony Karrer&rsquo;s <a href="http://elearningtech.blogspot.com/2010/03/twitter-for-learning-55-great-articles.html" rel="nofollow">Twitter for Learning: 55 Great Articles</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[Jane Hart]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Twitter has announced that 60% of its registered accounts are from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/08/twitter-60-percent-of-registered-accounts-are-from-outside-the-u-s" rel="nofollow">outside the US</a> and HubSpot has analysed 9m Twitter profiles and discovered that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/06/twitter-profile-picture" rel="nofollow">accounts with a profile picture</a> average about 10 times more followers than those without.</p>

<p>Kathy Schrock has recently conducted a short survey on <a href="http://blog.kathyschrock.net/2010/04/educators-use-of-twitter-survey-results.html" rel="nofollow">educators&rsquo; use of Twitter</a> and discovered that 38% of respondents use it every day, mainly (87%) for professional rather than personal/family reasons.</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>Twitter has also just acquired <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/09/twitter-acquires-tweetie" rel="nofollow">Tweetie</a>, a popular Twitter application for the iPhone.&nbsp; The application will now be called &ldquo;Twitter for iPhone&rdquo; and will drop from $2.99 to free.</p>

<p><strong>Common User Interface for Mobile Devices</strong></p>
<p>IBM is working with two universities to explore the creation of an <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2010/03/15/ibm-researching-mobile-device-accessibility-with-universities.aspx" rel="nofollow">open, common user interface platform for mobile devices</a>.&nbsp; The software developed by IBM, the National Institute of Design of India in Bangalore, and the University of Tokyo's RCAST, the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, will be made available as open source.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact of the Internet on Institutions in the Future</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Impact-of-the-Internet-on-Institutions-in-the-Future.aspx" rel="nofollow">Pew Internet</a> has surveyed 895 internet experts and other internet users and found that 72% agreed with the statement: &ldquo;by 2020, innovative forms of online cooperation will result in significantly more efficient and responsive governments, business, non-profits, and other mainstream institutions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many respondents also elaborated with written explanations that expressed significant concerns over organization&rsquo;s resistance to change.&nbsp; The consensus among them was that businesses will transform themselves much more quickly than public and non-profit agencies</p>

<p><strong>Links Between Internet Use and Loneliness</strong></p>
<p>A longitudinal survey of 754 people showed that, as web browsing increased from 2004 to 2005, their <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2009.11.002" rel="nofollow">loneliness also tended to increase</a>.&nbsp; Increased forms of web communication, instant messaging, chat rooms and news groups (but not email) also went hand in hand with increased loneliness.&nbsp; Finally, more web browsing over time was linked with reduced life satisfaction, whilst more non-email web communication over time was linked with reduced life satisfaction.&nbsp; However, the researchers note that increased loneliness may well encourage people to spend more time online, rather than web time causing loneliness.</p>

<p><strong>Transforming American Education</strong></p>
<p>George describes <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/os/technology/netp.pdf" rel="nofollow">Transforming American Education: Learning Powered by Technology</a> as a &ldquo;somewhat random mix of concepts that have been discussed in various blogs and forums over the last decade&rdquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s certainly scarily ambitious, with comments such as &lsquo;revolutionary transformation rather than evolutionary tinkering&rsquo; and &lsquo;we must rethink basic assumptions and redesign our education system&rsquo;.&nbsp; With less than 2 years of this presidential term left, I shan&rsquo;t hold my breath.</p>

<p><strong>eLearning in the Voluntary Sector</strong></p>
<p>Towards Maturity has released a report on <a href="http://www.elearningeuropa.info/files/media/media22288.pdf" rel="nofollow">eLearning in the Voluntary Sector</a>, based on a survey of 60 member organisations of the UK Charity Learning Consortium (CLC).&nbsp; They report the top four benefits of adopting learning technologies as: improving flexibility of learning; improving access to learning; cutting costs; and increasing reach.&nbsp; Over 60% of respondents are looking to increase their allocation of budget for eLearning.</p>

<p><strong>Moodle Developments</strong></p>
<p>Developers have released a prototype <a href="http://ignatiawebs.blogspot.com/2010/03/our-iphone-for-moodle-web-application.html" rel="nofollow">iPhone app for Moodle</a> and are looking for feedback.&nbsp; Also worth noting in this post is the description of the five steps involved in the development of the product.</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>US Moodle partner <a href="http://remote-learner.net/" rel="nofollow">Remote-Learner</a> has recently launched a number of Moodle enhancements including: a Learning Intelligence Suite for course management and reporting; integration with Adobe Connect to deliver synchronous web conferencing; open source video streaming using Kaltura; and support for the Mahara e-Portfolio system.&nbsp; Also, Microsoft has just released an <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ukschools/archive/2010/04/09/how-the-office-add-in-for-moodle-works.aspx" rel="nofollow">Office add-in</a> for Moodle.</p>

<p>Doug Hersh, Dean of educational programs and technology at Santa Barbara, has persuaded his college to move away from Blackboard to Moodle, which he has used to build a <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/03/29/lms" rel="nofollow">Human Presence Learning Environment</a>.&nbsp; Hersh believes the human touch is vital for maintaining online retention rates and he says Moodle was and is better able to support professors delivering lessons and messages using videos recorded with a Webcam.&nbsp; It also shows students who among their instructors or classmates are logged into Skype in case they want to have a live, face-to-face conversation.&nbsp; Students can also post audio responses to discussion threads.</p>

<p>Northampton College has integrated <a title="https://ouca.open.ac.uk/owa/redir.aspx?C=b6fa3d8e857b4e6fa6d6a2380b0f74b0&URL=http://www.cricksoft.com/uk/products/writeonline/casestudies.htm" href="http://www.cricksoft.com/uk/products/writeonline/casestudies.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WriteOnline</a> into its Moodle VLE. &nbsp;WriteOnline is an online word-processor that anyone can use &ndash; with added tools including speech feedback, a text predictor, and integrated word banks. &nbsp;Because it works inside the learning platform, users can also submit work directly.</p>

<p>David Jones gives the elevator pitch for a <a href="http://davidtjones.wordpress.com/2010/04/01/elevator-pitch-for-curriculum-mapping/" rel="nofollow">curriculum mapping project in Moodle</a> &ldquo;&hellip;based around the idea that having alignment between the outcomes, etc, and the learning activities, resources and assessments within a course [&hellip;] Well designed extensions to an LMS that encourage and enable improvement of course alignment will increase the quantity and quality of usage of the institutional LMS and subsequent student outcomes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Google Public Data Explorer</strong></p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s public data explorer is based on the 2009 OECD fact book, presented in a visual, dynamic and very user-friendly manner.&nbsp; For example, try the animated scatter plot of <a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ltjib1m1uf3pf_&ctype=l&met_y=hourswkd_t1&hl=en_US&dl=en_US#ctype=b&met_y=hourswkd_t1&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&met_x=lifeexpy_t1&scale_x=lin&ind_x=false&idim=country:GBR:KOR:TUR:JPN&ifdim=country&hl=en_US&dl=en_US" rel="nofollow">hours worked versus life expectancy</a>, or the bar chart of <a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ltjib1m1uf3pf_&ctype=l&met_y=hourswkd_t1&hl=en_US&dl=en_US#ctype=c&met_y=sizegdp_t2&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&idim=country:GBR:KOR:FRA:DEU:LUX:USA:AUS&ifdim=country&hl=en_US&dl=en_US" rel="nofollow">GDP per capita</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Scrolling and Attention</strong></p>
<p>Research during the early days of the web showed that many users didn&rsquo;t use <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20050711.html" rel="nofollow">vertical scroll bars</a> and so page size and content placement were critical.&nbsp; Users are now more savvy about looking for scroll bars and using them, but recent eye-tracking research from Jakob Nielsen shows that they still spend 80% of their time on a web page viewing &lsquo;<a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/scrolling-attention.html" rel="nofollow">above the fold</a>&rsquo;.&nbsp; He also found they spend twice as much time looking at the <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/horizontal-attention.html" rel="nofollow">left hand side of a page</a> than the right.</p>
