                   To kick around ideas to frame this:

1. Why are we writing this? What can we offer?

2.  Is our user experience captured in the extensive survey report by Simon Cross? 
http://oro.open.ac.uk/37836/1/EvaluationReport_OLDSMOOC_v1.0.pdf 

3.  Are there commonalities in how each of our experiences could be described?  That is, would we use the same criteria for evaluating our experience and our learning? (Note experience and learning are not being conflated)

4. Should we all describe/contribute to each aspect? Do our differing  experiences differently illustrate various issues? 

5. Isn't it ironic that we should be back in cloudworks?  ;-))        </div>

                   <p>I like the theme of "what was our experience and what have we learned?" I wonder if we could focus on "learning as change of practice", i.e. is there anything we do differnetly as a consequence of OLDS MOOC?</p>
<p>we don't have the time nor the resources to do a systematic review of all OLDS MOOC participants' experiences, so I suggest we focus on a small set of personal stories, and try to identify patterns.</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>I understand that the 'experiences' track for the EMOOC conference has left two tracks open to see 'emerging' topics.&nbsp; Great idea for a conference around MOOCs. What stream do we see emerging for our proposal? </p>
<ul>
<li>Participant Experiences</li>
</ul>
<p>I also like the learning as a change in practise.&nbsp; Oldsmooc definitely influenced how I move through and understand online learning/teaching.&nbsp; Is this focus too specific to the content of Oldsmooc?&nbsp; Or is that part of looking at the stories from the trenchs for Oldsmooc participants?</p>
<p>Here are some of the things that have changed for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>MOOC forced use/engagement in variety of spaces (Twitter, cloudworks, Bibsonomy, youtube, G+, etc; developed as a user of these tools, started to develop habits/pathways to tools for specific purposes; choices/preferences for the tools for different need/activity.&nbsp; There was alot of 'squawking' at the beginning from participants about the diversity of place but I feel as a participant VITAL skills to have.</li>
<li>global network of professionals to learn from (directionality of interaction for me is in following 'more capable' peers, experts); but I think that having these networks is growing the knowledge of those that 'follow me' (have no proof of this though:)&nbsp; However, I believe since "Living the Dream" of Oldsmooc, I am much more 'collegial' and attempt have others indulge in the learning opportunities available online.&nbsp; The Oldsmooc team in essence modeled a way of being and learning online.&nbsp; I appreciated the 'behind the scenes' revelations (on you YouTube vids).&nbsp; I&nbsp; have much more openess to opening the veil and bringing people into the discussion.&nbsp; I have regular webinars for/with other directors.&nbsp; I share all of my organizational templates in a local repository.&nbsp; I moderate a professional forum.&nbsp; etc.</li>
<li>&nbsp;renewed motivation to more closely align teaching with research/theory; implementation of personas within our organizational context; use of OULDI cards with staff (just two weeks ago) to plan for content development; more internal research on badging/establishing criteria understanding how it will work within our context; the inclusion of CC licences on materials and inclusion of OER resources; tapping into local professional expertise for OER development; reinvestigation of organization 'evaluation' of delivering outcomes (Work in Progress)</li>
<li>confidence to learn/participate in a discussion within a HE context; applied to do a Masters (yes, started this term).</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok that is the top of my head, and off the side of my desk if you will!</p>

                   <p>Hi to all of you!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to contribute to the document. I am intersted in the user experience. What happened to those who could not fisnish the course although very interested in. It is worthy to invest in this aspect of MOOCs. The big rate of dropout is clear, but is it clear why they dropout? What about thinking in stating some ideas about it?&nbsp;</p>
