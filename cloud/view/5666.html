<p><strong>Anita:&nbsp; The Past <br /></strong></p>
<p>See slides:<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/anitawaard/introduction-of-the-past-for-future-of-research-communications" rel="nofollow"> http://www.slideshare.net/anitawaard/introduction-of-the-past-for-future-of-research-communications </a></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take anything for granted - be open to new views, don&rsquo;t just push your old ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is what happens while you are waiting for something else&rdquo; - long breaks in conference for talks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Past</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Douglas Englebart, 1968: Hypertext&nbsp; &ldquo;Content represents concepts, but there is also a relation between the content of concepts, their structure, and the structure of other domains of human thought, that is too complex to investigate in linear text&rdquo;&nbsp; (echoes of Ayn Rand)</p>
<p><a href="http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite" rel="nofollow">http://sloan.stanford.edu/MouseSite</a>/1968Demo.html&plusmn;player11</p>
<p>Demo of collaborative editing across internet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hypertext: modular content components, meaningful links and claims &gt; evidence</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gives history, via ABCDE Format of modular computer science proceedings papers, ending in LiquidPub 2010 Structured Knowledge Objects, HCLS Rhet Doc - medium-grained core narrative components, and DoCO!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Argumentation relationships - Simon B-S work</p>
<p>&nbsp;&gt; claim evidence networks - Hyper, Nanopublications, SWAN</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But almost no content has been created in this way.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four periods:</p>
<p>Pre-web online databases, hypertext</p>
<p>Web 1990 - 2000 Web, preprint servers, standards</p>
<p>2000-2005 Semantic Web, open access</p>
<p>2005-2011 Social web</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1990 - 2000 standards - XML, PDF, MathML, et</p>
<p>2000- RDF</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What has stuck - Word and PIDF - coercion interests</p>
<p>XML html - shallow learning curve - high functionality</p>
<p>RDF - semantic message</p>
<p>social media - simple tools to express basic human need</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Business models</p>
<p>Up to 1980: Publishers sold to libraries</p>
<p>1990 - ArXIV,</p>
<p>2000 BioMed Central, PLoS, Creative Commons 0 author-pay</p>
<p>2005 o open data movement</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But commercial business model engrained</p>
<p>Societies and author-pays models also become publishers</p>
<p>Indignation drives Open Access - but also have a day job - just need to publish in Science and Nature</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research data</p>
<p>1990 - digital repositories, JSTOR, Cite seer</p>
<p>2000&nbsp; Workflows and Grid - Taverna and myGrid</p>
<p>2005 - Dataverse, DataCite, MyExperiment, Data journals</p>
<p>Workflow tools not yet ubiquitous - why not?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attribution and credit</p>
<p>Until 1980s - impact factor</p>
<p>Since 2000 H-Index and Google scholar, but not much has changed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Factors driving support</p>
<p>Commercial publishing</p>
<p>Community support&nbsp; LaTEX</p>
<p>OPEN ACCESS</p>
<p>Ease of use - Google Scholar,</p>
<p>Academic credit depends up t - Grant proposal forms complex and non logical, yet &ldquo;essential&rdquo; so people do it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Simon Buckingham-Shum&nbsp;&nbsp; Net-centric scholarly discourse?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We construct knowledge through language and discourse.&nbsp; How to go beyond journals?</p>
<p>Vannevar Bush 1945 &ldquo; We may some day click off arguments on a machine with the same assurance that we now enter sales on a cash register&rdquo;&nbsp; Computable arguments</p>
<p>2001: ScholOnto Project &ldquo;IN 2010 will we be publishing results primarily as prose papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scientific infrastructure would permit asking questions - what is the evidence for this claim?</p>
<p>Was this prediction accurate?</p>
<p>Who build on this idea?</p>
<p>Who challenges this idea, and with what arguments?</p>
<p>are there distinctive perspectives on this problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Systems:</p>
<p>1665 throws a long shadow - Le Journal des Scavans, Phil trans Roy Soc &gt; networks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any community of enquiry is a complex adaptive system responding to a changing environment - physarum - absorb and reorganize in response to external disturbance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IS CURRENT SYSTEM NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE?</p>
<p>HCI and sense making -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>see slides</p>
<p>Higher quality of conversation within scientific literature</p>
<p>Making formal and informal connections</p>
<p>Sense making is about plausibility, coherence and reasonableness</p>
<p>We construct meaning ins scientific discourse&nbsp; there is rarely one master world view</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tools assume a wealth of documents, plus online tools and analytics, making meaningful interpretations and connections between information elements</p>
<p>Start to tell a story linking statements / publications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Empirical studies of users, inform user interface design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example of analyzing blog on nuclear power</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collaborative web infrastructure for structured deliberation</p>
<p><strong>Cohere</strong> visualization of semantic annotations on publications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenEd Evidence Hub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agnes Sandor, Xerox - human and machine annotation of discourse</p>
<p>Cohere + Utopia&nbsp; - annotations in Utopia</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>David Rosenthal - Finance</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Follow the money. Research publication is a multi-billion dollar industry</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HighWire </strong>pioneered on-line publication</p>
<p>Libraries switched from purchase to leasing info online</p>
<p>Cancellation lost all access to past materials - post-cancellation access</p>
<p>Publisher goes out of business = Preserving the record</p>
<p>LOCSS project&nbsp; Peer to peer network for preservation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NSF funding, Mellon Foundation additional funding</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LOCSS went into production all five other archives failed</p>
<p>Negotiations time consuming and expensive</p>
<p>Concept resurrected by Phil Bowen as head of Mellon &gt; Ithaka with $55m Mellon cash</p>
<p>Portico front end</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outsourcing library collections</p>
<p>Charging foo open access content<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Close connections with Elsevier</p>
<p>&nbsp;got all Elsevier content</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portico became selected repository, but has failed to get sustainable funding</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libraries unwilling to pay enough this funded in with JSTOR</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>National libraries - legal and technological barriers have prevented them from fulfilling role, except Dutch, who have no legal mandate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Publishers set up own archive - dark archive of journals just in case &gt; CC republication</p>
<p>CLOSS&nbsp; 2007 this has been the future of LOCSS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driving costs out of system</p>
<p>Would not have survived if libraries has not found technology useful for preserving other stuff</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital copyright deposition is not required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hits to your own site have value, even if from non-subscribers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portico leaks content slowly to library = Ithaka will own all academic content which they can later monetize, as does JSTOR</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value of post-cancellation access dominates field - expensive content</p>
<p>But Elsevier is not going away</p>
<p>Stuff that is at risk is open access stuff from minor publishers - funding this preservation is much harder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lessons: Funding for long-term preservation needs to be buried in something that delivers access in short term</p>
<p>Increasing returns of network effects so that quickly become monopoly - non-profit monopolies harder to dislodge</p>
<p>Everything we are talking about is copyright</p>
<p>Copyright is totally broken 0 but control systems that publish, preserve and manipulate contend broken</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No open access publisher has sustainable business model - including PLoS</p>

<p><strong>Paul Groth : Current status</strong></p>
<p>11:10</p>
<p>Papers on paper, or online</p>
<p>Mendeley, Endnote</p>
<p>Find things on Google Scholar, digital libraries</p>
<p>Papers by email - PDFs not self citing</p>
<p>Twitter feed &gt; URL &gt; clack and download</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conferences - slides and talks, <a href="http://lanyard.com/" rel="nofollow">Lanyard.com</a>, Slideshare</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Databases - UniProt etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Informal - twitter, blogs, beyond the PDF discussion forums, mailing lists, e-mail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measurement - PMetrics - through journal articles only</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phil Bourne:&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>We have a share vision, but have we a shared goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo; A little history of the present&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Push a goal form Beyond the PDF re SMA - happening slowly - everyone doing what they have always done, not towards the shared goal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can Phil do towards the shared goal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some shifts: perception of what is scholarship is changing v slowly</p>
<p>Now a committee for how to measure scholarship at UCSD</p>
<p>But young faculty members far less focused on improving scholarship, and more on Nature papers</p>
<p>all about numbers and quality journals</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SciVerse is a game changer - iPhone changed the way we do software apps all operate off same interface</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SciVerse similar over shared content base - extend into data content world</p>
<p>PDB provides data without services, that are left to user, independently</p>
<p>Need to create app style model over data . easier to use</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data Journal?&nbsp; Workflows critical?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wellcome and Highs and Max Planck announcement about a data journal - not so dumb</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Must have more regards for publishing data - get a proper citation out of it - PROPER data citation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Institutional repositories - roach motel - data checks in but not easy to get data out!!!!&nbsp; Not v useful</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data journal - database maintainers become publishers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phil blogged this and got lots of response</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technically possible, but is it a good idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Executable paper idea on top of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use data journal to control a software environment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Workflows&nbsp; Yolanda Gill as USC asked to take info</p>
<p>Tried to create a workflow - v hard to reconstruct</p>
<p>Need tools to create and record workflows as part of scholarly record</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Publish this with the workflow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fiona Murphy Impediments to Data publication</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Impediments to integrating data:</p>
<p>Technology: people collect data ad hoc and postdocs leave - no deposit policy</p>
<p>Provenance lacking</p>
<p>Interfaces unhelpful British Atmospheric Data Centre - interface prevents people doing what they want</p>
<p>Format issues - which will survive and which will create black holes - laserdiscs</p>
<p>Funders: mandates but not incentivizing, toothless demands for compliance</p>
<p>Researchers: Suspicious of sharing their IP - keep data for reuse</p>
<p>ClimateGate people v worried and have gone underground to avoid exposure</p>
<p>Researchers lack time to do non-essential data management - at end of project looking towards the next project</p>
<p>Building research team - data scientists don&rsquo;t have career structure</p>
<p>Publishers want to help, but not clear where to go and what to do</p>
<p>Cannot see benefits of publishing data themselves</p>
<p>Tough time for library subscriptions</p>
<p>Used to deal with librarians, and have lost touch with end users</p>
<p>What do researchers need from publishers - need conversation</p>
<p>`subscription model brings in money - why change it?</p>
<p>What expertise is needed for new data products, what is business model</p>
<p>Not used to building partnerships with funders and policy makers, or even other publishers to provide industry-wide solutions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who is responsible for data&nbsp; where does it sit?&nbsp; How to link to article?&nbsp; Publishers don&rsquo;t want to clutter sites with huge amounts of data</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael Kurtz:&nbsp; 11:40</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>myADS - Collaboration with ArXiv at Cornell</p>
<p>Not refereed journal with the best paper in the field - for 10 years, 8000 subscribers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Number of articles per year 3.7% increase - not sustainable, so new tools for filtering, specializing</p>
<p>New publication models that don&rsquo;t take this into account will fail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>History:&nbsp; 1987 Astrophysics Data Systems workshop</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Urgent need for a master directory of all NASA observations linked up to ground based data</p>
<p>Still not achieved. Not easy to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of this to do with literature - all about data</p>
<p>Early work on own browser before Mosaic, query over two databases at same time</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goes through developments</p>
<p>Now integrates data and journal articles</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click through to one paper - can link to full text of paper or to data products, including archival data &gt; list of sources of data for that paper. &lsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click through to table of data</p>
<p>&gt; raw telescope images</p>
<p>&gt; dataset references to &lsquo;reduced&rsquo; data</p>

<p><strong>Todd Vision: Capturing the long tail of orphan data</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most researchers data not published in useful way that gets credit.</p>
<p>Policy effort among journals in ecology and evolutionary biology</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>technically unimpressive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No undue burden on authors or journal in terms of semantically rich metadata</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Low hanging fruit - added value</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Low barrier to submission - link with MSS processing system of journal - back passage message passing freeing researcher from metadata entry.</p>
<p>DOI assigned to data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could imaging additional layering on top of archived data</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compromise approach - red hearings: Researchers wont bother.&nbsp; 25% uptake when voluntary, 75% when mandatory</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Free themselves of burden of data archiving and management</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storage needs not overwhelming so far - on average one big spreadsheet per paper , &lt; 1 mbyte per paper</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spreadsheet will not be reused:&nbsp; several dozen data packages downloaded 100s of times.&nbsp; 1000 data sets per year</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Costs real and not overwhelming - up front payment $50 per paper for long-term storage</p>
<p>Trivial relative to supplement al material rates and cost of publication, and orders of magnitude less that cost of creating data in first place</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want data to be treated as first class objects, and be given credit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to support data citation, but mechanisms to track usage not yet created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Neylon - Research communication is different from paper publication</strong></p>
<p>The paper is not the research, but a (poor) representation of the research - we have been talking about making it a better representation</p>
<p>But can we communicate THE RESEARCH</p>
<p>Data does not spring fully formed from research = workflows required as well</p>
<p>In wet lab: mixing solutions to put into a machine in hope it will spit out a useful spectrum</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to document the early research activities, materials,</p>
<p>Process of authoring and reviewing is v expensive</p>
<p>We could publish the research object itself - could be done at lower cost</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Herbert van der Sompel</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Need framework of thinking for future discussion</p>
<p>4 functions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Registration</strong> - claim a finding - time stamping</p>
<p><strong>Certification</strong> - peer review etc.,</p>
<p><strong>Awareness</strong>&nbsp; - discovery</p>
<p><strong>Archiving</strong> - how do we hold on to all this stuff</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Derived function that drives everything,</p>
<p><strong>Reward</strong> - based on the impact factor</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Christine Borgman has written similar stuff more recently)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above is an abstraction of the journal system - do they still apply to what we are planning to create?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking at the future through the rear-view mirror&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look at network effects that were not present before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judith: Have never talked about databases, that are the primary reference points for most people. Most people&rsquo;s career are independent of journals except where necessary for their career.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phil: We need some goals:</p>
<p>1&nbsp; <strong>Intra</strong> - things we could do together, that might be unrecognized by the lab researcher</p>
<p>2 <strong>Inter</strong> - the Dryad and Utopia that can impact the external community in a huge way</p>
<p>3&nbsp; <strong>The interface</strong> between these two - influencing policy that could change the status quo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at professional science, separate from society at large</p>
<p>Royal Society investigation is about connection to society</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>David de Roure:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also bringing people together - building the social graph between scientists</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Informal communication&nbsp; - spectrum -&nbsp; formal publications.</p>
<p><strong>discussing, collaborating, reuse, reproduce</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Requirements of scientific discourse that do not apply to normal discourse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to validate scientific information to society on the Web</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Anna de</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard science concentrates on databases</p>
<p>Other approach is scientific discourse - why is A citing B?</p>

<p>Todd wants to vertically integrate over all topics for a new intervention</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Breakout group 1: topics:&nbsp; Research data and code - repositories, data papers, executable codes, workflows + New forms and tools -&nbsp; nanopublication, text components, Utopia, chemistry tools, authoring tools, How to create value chain across all these</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Paolo: How can we use this meeting to start to work together and leverage one another&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gully:&nbsp; How do we effectively collaborate. Steve makes himself available and gets it to work<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve: Just blundering around</p>
<p>Phil: Terry on the practitioner side, while Steve does the technology - starting with lack of understanding of one another&rsquo;s domain</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paolo: how to integrate across groups - Steve just &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll do it&rdquo;</p>
<p>Problem is first understanding what the different groups do, how to recognize our own boundaries,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we want:</p>
<p>Paolo: Integrate with Utopia both ways, Use gully&rsquo;s model, use Open Citations, Citation of data.&nbsp; Need citation of workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Need API over Open Citations.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judith Blake:&nbsp; Bring; works with publications Need to dig data out of publications.&nbsp; Need markup to identify bits of paper&gt;&nbsp; Utopia could do that for her and enable markup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gully:&nbsp; Do: NLP ontology systems,&nbsp; want to reason over the data.&nbsp; The act of scientific discovery is key p building a breakthrough machine.&nbsp; Text mining in progress with Judith in progress</p>
<p>Wants to do : create collaborations in which his stuff gets used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Challenges - not invented here.&nbsp; How to use other people&rsquo;s stuff more easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>David: Data management tools and SPAR applications:</p>
<p>Need open citation information, expert markup for open research reports</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Pettifer: will collaborate with everyone round table by end of year</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>David de Roure - myExperiment - workflows</p>
<p>People want to work flow bundles into packs - research objects</p>
<p>Workflows4Ever - focus on provenance of research objects</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carole Goble: Research Objects lifecycle&nbsp; not expecting all items to be in one place. - SysMO project</p>
<p>Other systems for methods, scripts, SOPs, ISA infrastructures,&nbsp; store data spreadsheets, etc. and models.</p>
<p>Need curation at data creations time</p>
<p>Built metadata index to other peoples databases</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Todd: Model for ingesting heterogeneous content.&nbsp;&nbsp; has a way to test out stuff with collaborating scientists.&nbsp;&nbsp; What would enable research if data were . . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anne: Cohere tool for allowing collaborative annotation on documents - not following a particular ontology - How to do higher level reasoning on data, using ontological markup</p>
<p>How to support open annotation - understand collaborative dynamics of human and machine annotation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to support this human_ machine collaboration and higher level reasoning about connections between concepts . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cohere imports XML or RDF - wants to suck in annotations for analysis for cognitive reasoning.&nbsp; How to improve visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phil:&nbsp; Collaboration network embarrassingly small. and don&rsquo;t produce anything anyone can use.&nbsp; Have PDB!&nbsp; Have literature = database integration in house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Todd and DataBank both accept minimal metadata.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gully: what is purpose of it all - ontologies concerned with the correctness of the representation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not creating domain ontologies - but rather generic ontologies that can be shared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Link Open Citations with e-Journal club</p>
<p>F1000 is successful</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interactive journal club is a learning procedure</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paolo: some people don&rsquo;t accept summarization of a paper</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carol: what are the bottlenecks in research:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottlenecks;&nbsp; Information overload and choice of best papers</p>
<p>Todd uses many tools for this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>?? citation numbers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gully:&nbsp; IN genetics, lots of infrastructure already in place</p>
<p>Neuroendocrinology&nbsp; no databases - have to read the papers</p>
<p>Different domains have different levels of informatics support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, everything is interdisciplinary, so domain specific is not enough</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read want to read the papers that are just at the intersections of two domains -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judith - papers not correctly tagged in PubMed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to crowd source annotations - but also issue of authority and choice of vocabularies - folksonomies must be open</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other bottlenecks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carole: Crowdsourcing only works with specific tasks, and need funding and organization</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other bottleneck - knowing what is going on in my own lab</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preserving from a multi-site multi-community project all results, so can continue after the project.&nbsp; Quite complex for multi-site - staff turnover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People happy to share point to point, or publish to the world, but not to share data to the world - no reward for this, and many potential penalties</p>
<p>Todd not using word &ldquo;sharing&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No policing and no rewards\\</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>80% of all clinical trials mandated by law to publish data do not - no one fires them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phil:&nbsp; But things are changing.&nbsp; Your papers have to be in PubMed central.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carrot: et an extra citation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma - need everyone to do it for the common good</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottleneck: Start-up time for new people in the lab - too much information to acquire - the time has not changed over time, but the pressure on productivity has increased, so hire a postdoc who will be more productive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research data management still mostly paper based and non=collaborative</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EverNote would have helped 20 yrs. ago if useful thinks built on top</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Phil had something that could digest lab notes and suggest what new papers to read in the morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tools that are too specific, never do what YOU want - cannot customize</p>

<p>Issues:&nbsp; data deluge</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>, repeatability, citability, mashability</p>
<p>algorithmic assistance to researchers</p>
<p>Web of data and web of documents</p>
<p>Walled garden</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[See slides]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 12 additional: <strong>&nbsp;Argument, terminology, claim and evidence</strong></p>
<p>Your argument is part of broader discourse - need to cite others</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background Claim Citation of evidence is citation of other paper.&nbsp; Cant get transitive closure of claim right back to evidence through papers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Results claim cites evidence in paper - figures and tables, methods</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Must be cognitive of these patterns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scientific argument is finding something de novo and fitting it to what is already known</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert Dale:&nbsp; What is it we mean by scientific communications - do blog posts may exclude evidence and just be argument!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judith: Exploratory and descriptive projects (microscopy) now don&rsquo;t get funded</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ed Hovy: What I&rsquo;d like to get from Publications in the Future</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A disruption algorithm:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vision to improve the communication of knowledge between scholars using new technology</p>
<p>Why do we publish: record new knowledge with time stamp, to communicate, to permit people to measure me</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In future, need to provide better access to knowledge,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to a=permit better knowledge communication, and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>better knowledge verification and extension</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHY DONT WE DO IT TODAY?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would our vision sick?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When PoF is easy to produce = learn and use tools quickly, capture all aspects of knowledge</p>
<p>Easy to consume - ingest results faster and deeper</p>
<p>Cheap</p>
<p>More effective - readers get more info, more accurately - ditto for reviewers and tenure evaluators</p>
<p>Cool</p>
<p>ONE REMOVE BLOCKADES AND GIVE BENEFITS, JUST DO IT</p>
<p>But we don&rsquo;t have clear vision, clear statement of why, understanding of impediments and cost, understanding of procedures</p>
<p>Goals of meeting</p>
<p>List and organize methods</p>
<p>Study impact and effects - why beneficial</p>
<p>study financial implications</p>
<p>Work on how to make it happen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Benefits</p>
<p>PoF:&nbsp; Contextualizing The Web of X</p>
<p>X = ideals, theories, papers, social network, research network</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.g. Stephen Wan&rsquo;s work</p>
<p>Reflect</p>
<p>Active pdf Greenacre and Hastie</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put non-text info into text - data movies, images, data collection software</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who will maintain, update and extend</p>
<p>Who will do this - publishers are achieves</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Different fields differ - must allow for these</p>
<p>construct paper to fit knowledge domain</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Discourage free-form argumentation and bullshit</p>
<p>Understand intellectual framework specific for discipline</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.g. KEfED model for <strong>biomedical experiments</strong> - gully Burns</p>
<p>Input and output dependent and independent variables</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can find pattern, can help people right</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ethics:</strong> balancing concerns - electricity and nuclear power = precautionary principle</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Impacts of PoFs Society</p>
<p>What are we paying for</p>
<p>Reviewing, distributing</p>
<p>Google is disruptive</p>
<p>Blogs, avoid journals</p>
<p>What next between producer and consumer?</p>
<p>What jobs remain, and who will pay for it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In long-term, will code work, data grows in incompatible ways, formats go out of date</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone has to do the work</p>
<p>It would be good if we know the individual costs, rather than bundled costs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both consumer and producer needs to pay</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where to go from here</p>
<p>Paper light (free)and paper rich (semantically enhanced, costs $$)</p>
<p>Get publishers involved - show them roles</p>
<p>Get people involved</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>= = = ==</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EXCELLENT!&nbsp; Get slides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Udo Hahn:</strong> no better system than peer review.</p>
<p><strong>Simon</strong>: Paper discussing a different type of pattern: Evaluation of software system has these points&nbsp; . . . methodology, users, etc.</p>
<p>Different disciplines use different paradigms of argument</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who can access communications - subscription barriers</p>
<p>How easy are they to use</p>
<p>What is happening - concentrating on journals, forgetting about books and monographs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Anita:</strong> Manifesto light and manifesto full!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Leslie Chan</strong>: More that just putting stuff on the Web - need to use the potential of the Web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ivan</strong>: Discussion concentrates on the journal.&nbsp; But historians write books.&nbsp; We do not have that in mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ed</strong>: Model of book + CD + web site + iPad app - book by Al Gore on environment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Judith</strong>:&nbsp; Put aside the idea of journal - the future is the internet</p>
<p>Argument structure and templates &gt; web</p>
<p>eBooks can have versioning</p>
<p>Trip Advisor &amp; Google Analytics - each book has ranking by community - measure of value</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These give value without subscription - look at different financial models for journals??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>David R:&nbsp; Concentration on journals: this world is about to get disrupted.&nbsp; University press books is much more disrupted - no one wants to pay for stuff humanities writes, since none wants to read it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Need to understand what is wrong at moment - opportunities for disruption</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peer review working worse - increased volume and workload - wrong rewards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so look at what is wrong now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert Dale:&nbsp; Need to decide what product category we want to describe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gully: get away from &ldquo;Paper&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Carole: Concentrate on long term preservation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can we read it in 40 years time - complicated on-line artifacts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ed: users will convert to modern format if important enough to read</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Majority of science not worth saving</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phil:&nbsp; NY Times - smart people could not look beyond 5 years, building on what we know</p>
<p>Totally disruptive: Knowledge is a stream &gt; river &gt; sub-disciplines to permit usefulness</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Executable papers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then strayed into science fiction of automated creation of new scientific results - machines are users too!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gully:&nbsp; How does this help knowledge synthesis - bringing stuff together into a coherent framework</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DDR:&nbsp; This is the biggest impediment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cameron:&nbsp; Cost of discovery of publications is major point -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simon: People good at argumentation reasoning - let computers get on with the simple things</p>
<p>But people suspicious of automation - is that attitude changing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people go straight to the data, rather than waiting for the publication</p>
<p>Much research is &ldquo;mundane&rdquo; discovery - hard and intellectually challenging precursor to the &ldquo;ah ha&rdquo; moment - intellectual slog</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tim: Want to be able to cite workflows as well as data</p>
<p>How to do this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extension of CiTO / FaBiO&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;fabio:Workflow exists</strong></p>
<p>PROVENANCE?&nbsp; Leave that to the Provenance vocabulary</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>fabio:ResearchObject does not - we decided it was too fluid to be defined, and that ORE covers this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ISA hierarchy - useful, and defines SPOs too - all packaged</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tim Clark: ALSO ASK PEOPLE TO PUT IN THE CONCLUSION - AS IN MIIDI</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cameron: I want to play in the lab, capture that, then point others to the data - need provenance model in retrospect, not in advance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gully: differentiate observations and interpretations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DMS: Conceptual models, presuppositions - need to be aware since these determine observations you make</p>
<p>But observations will always be true, interpretations will vary - need to distinguish, so that others can re-interpret</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changing to web of knowledge - science only part of this</p>
<p>Linked data happening right now</p>
<p>Services for search and collaboration and mining</p>
<p>Applications and commercialization</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does the real world interact with science</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where are the sweet spots between paper and web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Qrate.me - a smart way to use your smart phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scientific posters at conference - read a URL from a QR code</p>
<p>Scan the poster, tweet it, Google etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mendeley:&nbsp; video</p>
<p>How to create a QR code</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provides universal interface for everything we are talking about</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- slide presentations, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SmallWorld demo UIST 2011 presentation</p>
<p>HiVE testbed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creation of museum of world of warcraft !!&nbsp; HTML links into 3D world and vv</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>?? CLAROS virtual museum</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need clear vision of where to go</p>
<p>More in society than research - research data only part</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tourist attractions&rdquo; along the route: e.g. 3D navigation and QR codes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kinect rendering of 3d world</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phil:</p>
<p>Make solid models of virtual 3D things</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EU has brought many benefits</p>
<p>&ldquo;We threaten people with money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innovation&rdquo; is the buzz word, including innovative ways of recycling stuff we have already and of collaboration</p>
<p>Include on every page of application</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizon 2020:&nbsp; Framework program for research and innovation</p>
<p>Incorporated European Institute for INNOATION AND TECHNOLOGUY EIT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>INCREASE IN BUDGET 46%  = Euro80 billion!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excellence in the Science Base</p>
<p>Research infrastructure that other people can use - lots of solutions to many problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will finance infrastructures, more money up front</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By end of year, words in place - we need one line in place describing this area</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New member states need to catch up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lots on global cooperation , esp. developing countries, regardless of geographical location, synchronized calls with USA, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now in listening mode - now tall EU formally what comes out of this workshop</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Scientific consultation - number of questions asked but want to hear what people wish to say</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EU budget funded by VAT - so some questions designed for man in street and simplistic</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avoid taking the science out of life</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;push for <strong>improved knowledge circulation </strong>in the European Research Area&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Willing to listen to international set of opinions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now gathering opinions and formulating projects - getting language in place that defines legislation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>European Parliament increasingly interested in Science and Technology</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep your Euro MP in the look - they are very influential</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leibnitz who run Dagstuhl have office in Brussels</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Need to show evidence of benefits of research - driven by bean counters</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in touch with project officer, can adapt plans accepted&nbsp; - flexibility is OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lots of ways to fund individuals</p>
<p>IRSES international Research staff Exchange Scheme - funds for exchange visits - application</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fund 5K ph. ds per year</p>
<p>Research projects FET program</p>
<p>Marie Curie Actions are small and manageable for individuals</p>
