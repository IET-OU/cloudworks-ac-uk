        <p>This activity is a variant on the idea of a webquest, it provides a fun ways of exploring the cloudworks site and sharing findings. The aim is to explore the site, choose a cloud or cloudscape you find interesting and then collectively vote on the best example found.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you haven't already done so, create a <strong>Cloudworks account </strong>(you can view anything on the site, but to post comments or add anything you need an account)<strong><br /></strong></li>
<li>Spend a max of ten minutes <strong>exploring cloudworks </strong>(suggested stategies - browse clouds and cloudscapes, enter keywords in search, explore by tags, look at individual people's profiles </li>
<li>You may wish to open your search in a <strong>new tab or page </strong>in your browser so that you can easily navigate back to this cloud</li>
<li>Find one <strong>interesting cloud </strong></li>
<li><strong>Post a comment </strong>here with<strong> </strong>the name of the cloud with a hyperlink to it and include your reasons for why you like it</li>
<li><strong>Review </strong>other entries</li>
<li><strong>Vote</strong> for favourite entry using the <a href="http://surveys.polldaddy.com/s/4FECC2CF90277B45/" rel="nofollow">survey</a></li>

<p>This article is very interesting to me as a big supporter of social psychology and theories of learning.&nbsp; The concept that the nature of education is changing fits very well with the Web 2.0 narrative for me.&nbsp; The new generation of learners are not just sat watching the TV or teacher like I was as a youngster - they expect to engage and control part of the conversation - education has to catch up!</p>			<div class="posted-by">

<p>I have worked as an assessor/tutor for an FE college and found that it was difficult to think of activities that could be embedded in the normal class sessions. It is obviously easier with academic subjects than some vocational subjects such as plumbers, carpenters, hairdressers etc. I have taught adult learners ( mainly over 55years) Basic IT courses and many do not have the necessary literacy and numeracy skills expected, neither are they interested in gaining the qualification at their time in life. Another issue I encountered was that Assessors were also expected to deliver maths and English training as part of their job role and this is not something I was overly comfortable with! &nbsp;A database of resources tailored to specific subject areas would be a wonderful contribution for new and existing teachers.&nbsp;</p>			<div class="posted-by">

<p>This cloud is particularly intesesting as it links well to my current OU module. It also has some interesting points to think about that I am too continually evaluating my practices with, such as evaluation of learning and how technology can play a role; and the relationship to higher order skills&nbsp;and learning.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

                   <p>I found 2 clouds particularly interesting - the one on "Learn About Learning Design" and the other is on Design Tips for different elements of course design.&nbsp; The first one interested me both intrinsically and because at SAIT Polytech, our design team is currently in the 2nd year of an initiative to provide hands-on aculty development in the basic principles of design in order to facilitate&nbsp; rapid, 'mass' campus-wide curriculum re-design &amp; dev. The Design Tips drew my interest because each of a 7 person instructional design team is assigned 40+ projects to complete this year.&nbsp; All tips &amp; resources are most welcome to support holding the line on quality, despite the high production volume required in a short period of time.

                   <p>I started looking at clouds discussing Twitter - the few that I looked at in 10 minutes didn't have a lot of information on them, but I explored <a title="Twit Resources" href="/cloud/view/2393" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Twit Resources</a> for a bit.</p>
<p>I got as far a the first link, where the author provided some clear guidelines about when he thought Twitter was appropriate to use in a teaching and learning situation. While I don't know if this was the most interesting cloud, I liked the opportunity to read a bit more about the use of Twitter in teaching and learning, as I'm wondering whether it's a tool I can make use of the in the future.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I focused on "primary: DL ideas. Of course...I forgot "primary" isn't a specific enough search and I ended up finiding an excellent lesson idea from a University Course in Geography instead. I decided to "trust the process" and read the cloud and I was fascinated with thir lesson on learning about another culture virtually. This idea could be easily used in a primary student classroom.</p>

                   <p>Ive seen Cloudworks on the net but only visted it fleetingly before, this morning I signed up for it and have spent a little time looking at clouds by tag or name. As part of this quest activity I setled on the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/OLDS MOOC Launch event" rel="nofollow">OLDS MOOC</a> for 3 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>MOOCs are extremely topical and its interesting to see how this one has been supported as well as the response, which brings me to the next point...</li>
<li>There is a lot of interesting content attached to this tag in Cloudworks from a number of individuals, so rich content to dip into which also highlights how the MOOC is working</li>
<li>This particualr project is JISC funded, active now (Jan 2013 until March 2013) and therfore of particular interest to me professionally (Im a JIsc RSC eLearning Advisor)</li>
</ol>
<p>The page I have linked to is the introductory page which explains the project and how the MOOC will start but there are many more related resources building up each week, several can be accessed from this start up page.&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>I liked this cloud on focusing on quality assurance for online courses as it raises an important point. <br />See here:http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7095</p>
<p>While designing online courses, some like to focus on the importance of accessibility and this might deter others as accessibility is seen as a by product while quality assurance could be a better term - to raise the standard of the course itself which includes accessibility.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thanks Steve! I agree - that's one of my current favourites. From an evaluation of patterns of behaviour in social networking spaces these flash debates are also interesting because cloudworks appears to be working well alongside other tools like Twitter and personal blogs. It provides a conduit from short, snippets of conversation in Twitter, enabling the debate to develop and become enriched through additional links and academic references. In the sister cloud "Is twitter killing blogging?" we saw interesting patterns in terms of users going off and writing personal blog posts stimulated by the debate occurring in cloudworks. For me all of this is very exciting as it suggests cloudworks is occupying a new niche in the ecosystem of web 2.0 tools, providing something distinct and complementary.</p>        </div>

                   <p><a href="/cloud/view/2162" rel="nofollow">The VLE is Dead</a> is my choice for an interesting cloud. I attended the ALT-C conference in Manchester in September and wasn't able to attend this session. It's quite amazing just how much you can get out of a session you DIDN'T attend just by bouncing around this cloud. I like this cloud for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nice example of how f2f events can be enhanced and more inclusive. </li>
<li>The focus isn't entirely on the presenters, and artefacts are richer than the typical ppt slides</li>
<li>It's an interesting example of how we can benefit from the contributions of session participants as well as those attending from afar.&nbsp;</li>
<li>And the VLE topic itself is interesting, of course! I've yet to see a compelling argument for not using a VLE. Everyone seems to make the mistake of suggesting we can't use tools in new and different ways. </li>

                   <p><a href="/cloud/view/278" rel="nofollow">Self and peer assessment in a team</a></p>
<p>Creating an interdisciplinary collaborative teamwork environment online is essential for the College of Health Disciplines at UBC, mainly due to the insuperable problem of coordinating face-to-face scheduling across fifteen different Health and Human Service programs. Therefore any online tools that are available, which enable students to practise teamwork, or assess that practice, are very interesting for us to explore. Rationalised self-assessment and peer-assessment methods are particularly powerful, as the students are the ones most &ldquo;present&rdquo; in the collaborative process.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I've created an area in the OpenLearn's labspace which we can use if we want for sharing CompendiumLD maps and have added a link here. It not essential to use this area alternatively you can share maps by emailing the zip files or just putting them on a usb stick. If you want to use this area you will need to create an account for openlearn.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I started out looking for clouds that generated a lot of comments. The potential with a cloud of this type is that the conversation is richer if there are a lot of comments compared to if there are only a few. I also started at Z in the alphabet, partly because I like the way its pronounced in Canadian and well, sometimes I start reading magazines from the back too.<br /><br />The <a href="/cloud/view/2398" rel="nofollow">Using twitter with students</a> cloud had 39 comments so I checked it out first. Some intriguing ideas being expressed and nice dialouge happening - great to see Grainne responding to posts but would have liked to see more interchange among the postees (is that a word?)<br /><br />The <a href="/cloud/view/875" rel="nofollow">Trends in OER</a> cloud is actually a topic I have considerable interest and experience in and it had 23 comments so looked at it too. A very different kind of cloud as virtually all comments were posted by the same person. Sense this cloud was developed by someone posting real time summaries of a f2f presentation/Q&amp;A session at a conference. I liken this to sports announcers and colour commentary.</p>        </div>

                   <p>The cloud on <a href="/index.php/cloud/view/223" rel="nofollow">Transforming a Music Course</a> 'struck a chord' with me. I have watched kids get turned off by a high school music program that has no relation to the music they listen to and care about. 'Band' as it is taught in middle and high school seems to be a relic from the late 1940s with clarinets, saxophones and trombones. I followed the link to a carnegie foundation website that started with a quote: "The music I was trained to teach was not the music my students wanted to learn". That's a question worth asking yourself each time you sit down to build a course. Is what I'm preparing to teach what students want to learn?</p>        </div>

                   <p>I'm really enjoying reading these posts - amazing the variety in terms of what everyone likes and why and aslo the strategies you are using to search. Like the idea of starting with Z! Looking for what is already 'popular' - such as clouds with lots of comments is a common and natural strategy and is part of the reason for us having 'active clouds' on the home page. We have also tried to ensure that there are lots of different ways of finding things - listing clouds or cloudscapes, searching using the search box, browsing the latest activity via the activity streams or following what the system is flagging up - features cloudscapes or active clouds. We want users to find their own preferred way of navigating around AND to encourage accidental discovering.</p>        </div>

<p>Digital Ethnography - Wesch</p>
<p>This footage and the YouTube footage was a fabulous insight into how the Internet and the mediated environments in which we work, play and communicate.&nbsp; It's medium serves as a reflection of what we are, and therefore a counter-reflection of what we wish for.&nbsp; The more we seek individuality, the more we are interested in the authenticity of another&rsquo;s interaction with us.&nbsp; We demand freedom, of almost everything (speech, gender bias, etc, etc) yet we crave community; belonging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;This brilliantly edited piece by Wesch looks into people's soul bearing, 'YouTube' videos, all proudly exposed within in a mediated space.&nbsp; As a result of this raw honesty from many within the video footage, we appear almost voyeuristic in our observation of others, &nbsp;as we&nbsp; cannot ordinarily achieve this in real life. However here, quite openly, groups of Wesch&rsquo;s students do, as he, alongside his students undertakes the blogging/vblogging and discovers the experience of it and how content is lost as fear of the unknown creeps in. (so people initially are lost for words)</p>
<p>It explores watching YouTube footage, (and I guess then the likes of whose been framed and similar programs) how, as consumers others are observed, &nbsp;really watched. &nbsp;One researcher finds that it &nbsp;can lead to an interesting, unexpected emotional reaction and intimacy that was "quite overwhelming and unexpected".&nbsp; This level&nbsp; of intimate exchange, seems to be diminishing in face-to-face exchanges, if indeed it even existed before video footage &ndash; I suggest it was not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This video explores what the internet is to us, or whether it is content created by us and therefore &nbsp;is &lsquo;us&rsquo;. &nbsp;It suggests that the camera could be seen as the 'window into the soul' exploring our global native network members (rest of blogging world).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It discusses that our participation in online communication via vblogging, is undertaken with the knowledge that out there somewhere, someone is or will one day observe our blogging .&nbsp; If we wish to experience alongside our students and 'feel' their anxieties, we ought to&nbsp; participate in blogging, vblogging, MOOC's online learning ect (if we are to understand the impact properly of revealing these intimate side of ourselves to the WWW.)&nbsp; I hear Open Learning is good looking daft, too. &nbsp;It certainly is for me, without any support, limitations on my physical keyboarding due to disabilities and the need to type because my speech to text software would wake the household up! (I've managed to come back and edit this later &ndash; so initially to find time to take the badge, I&rsquo;ve had to exposed poor typing, showing to all my difficulty doing it without assistance from software that has it&rsquo;s disadvantages as well as it&rsquo;s advantages&hellip;.(I wonder if anyone thought it was disability related, or just I was poor at typing, not sure which I&rsquo;d prefer you to think!?)</p>
<p><strong><em>So was it worth your time?</em></strong></p>
<p>Enlightening, entertaining and his footage of YouTube&nbsp;evidenced the appropriate nature of this next immersive enquiry.&nbsp; We cannot possibly understand how it is to be in open learning/online/in a MOOC, unless we experience it! &nbsp;Vblogging (Video blogging) - &nbsp;I'm <strong><em>not </em></strong>quite ready for yet!</p>
<p>Take a look at this link and more from this extremely insightful fellow!&nbsp; Brilliant chap!&nbsp; I'd love to join a MOOC designed and guest lectured by him!</p>        </div>

                   <p>I couldn't possibly state a favourite at this stage, for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm new to Cloudworks and haven't quite got my feet under the table yet.</li>
<li>I've seen such variance in presentation of ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, to now, I can say I've found lots to interest me and lots more to keep my interest, amongst which were those that balanced multiple media pathways that soothed the journey through the maze of text-based sharing. I got quite carried away with an embedded link to YouTube and PechaKucha.</p>
<p>I would have to say though, that so far, the page that has intrigued me the most was found in part of the H800 quest, while visiting the 'Search by Institution' area - just realizing how wide spread CloudWorks really is; spanning the Globe and even finding colleagues I know from here, in Colombia.</p>
<p>Just loving getting to know CloudWorks.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>        </div>

<p>An interesting cloud on how theatre can be used to engage people (staff, learners?). While this particular cloud decribed a 'real world' scenario working with FE College staff members in trying to address a new performance review process, I am interested to explore how theatre &amp; performance can be translated into an online learning environment. Are there approaches, structures, forms that can translate from the engaging world of theatre and performance into a digital environment?</p>        </div>

                   "Improving the assessment options for a photography assignment" (http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8371)

Long ago I was a student in a BFA program. At the time, digital photography was an optional elective, and using education technology in the fine arts department was unheard of. We spent our days (and nights) huffing photo chemicals and perfecting our prints. Since then I have become an EFL instructor, but I do still wonder about photography education. I was curious to see how photography educators are using technology and was pleased to find this detailed account of an assessment strategy for a photography course. I'm curious to investigate this topic further.        </div>

                   <p>http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5878</p>
<p>I have an interest in Digital Storytelling from participating in H817 last year and here I found a link to DS106 Radio. &nbsp;DS106 radio forms an integral part of the DS106 open digital storytelling online course where participants contribute and participate to create their own radio shows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mikhail Gershovich &amp; Jim Groom describe digital storytelling as telling a story "in a compelling and emotionally engaging form". &nbsp;&nbsp;The way that DS106 is structured does indeed make the learning experience compelling. &nbsp;The community is solid with a strong online presence and support is plentiful. &nbsp;In order to participate in the community, individuals need to create and discuss. &nbsp;This drives the motivation for learning the underlying Digital Storytelling tools as these are our communication methods. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a background in software training within a corporate environment and experience in blended learning methods - I am very interested in how the passion and drive generated within DS106 can be used as a model to help individuals achieve flow in learning and develop communities of practice. &nbsp;The type of learning that we would do because we love it - not because we have to.</p>
<p>As a result of my Cloudquest today I think that today might just be the day I join DS106 as I have just spotted that a 7 week open online course entitled 'DS106 goes to work" has just started&nbsp;http://ds106.us/2014/02/17/ds106-and-storytelling-go-to-work/ &nbsp;and this has quite made my Monday morning :)</p>
<p>I was surprised that I didn't initially find more Digital Storytelling clouds on Cloudworks but maybe this can now be part of my personal mission whilst exploring H800 and the MAODE.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I also liked the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2162" rel="nofollow">lurking to learning link</a>&nbsp;- as it relates to my own experiences on forums, and to the H800 course I'm currently undertaking.</p>
<p>I think this is potentially a great resource, but I'm finding the site quite difficult to navigate. &nbsp;It's hard to generate accurate searches, and the majority of clouds that do turn up seem to be empty - just a placeholder. &nbsp;It would be better if search results could be ranked by cloud content, so that clouds with actual content and comments came up first - otherwise an awful lot of time is spent clicking through to empty clouds.</p>
<p>(Which sounds rather metaphysical!)</p>        </div>

<p>http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8661&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently studying H800 Technology-enhanced learning: practices and debates, and Lisa Brennan is a fellow student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am finding that the lack of a &nbsp;datestamp on the cloudscapes on the index page is annoying as I have gone to ones that are 5 years old and have no current discussions.</p>
<p>I would vote for 'the VLE id dead' cloud.</p>

                   <p>Hi</p>
<p>I really loved the New Hive inroductory video for their new presentation tool. Find it on</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8350" rel="nofollow">New Hive</a>.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;">I am at same point probably as Sandra was above in H800. I didn't mind that the one I found hadn't much if any discussion. In fact, at least it allowed me to try my voice out in what appeared (then at least) an 'empty room'. I see above Samuel O'Nord found it 2 yeards ago but&nbsp;I didn't know then it was for the Cloudquest Challenge. I still want to stick with it, because of the encouragement in the trial video to experiment across media, better I thought than the Wesch example in H800.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;">I think I'll vote for&nbsp; Catherine Dartnell's recommendation on Digital Stoty Telling:&nbsp; <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5878" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5878</a></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;">That's because I think that new ways of telling a story is the best way to begin to know why you might want to integrate different media (or send them in collision course against each other). And, what a way to teach Bruner on 'narrative'&nbsp;epistemology in Psychology classes.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;">All the best</p>

                   <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'd been having a debate on learning styles in our H800 forum so found the cloud on learning styles useful, specifically the further links.</p>
<p>http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2900</p>
<p>I'll be interested to see how this develops when we are also using the OUForum</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

                   <p>http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1244 - I liked this cloud because we are looking at Learning Design in H800 at the moment, and this cloud has a link to a nice infographic, "Visualising&nbsp;the&nbsp;process&nbsp;and&nbsp;products&nbsp;of&nbsp;learning&nbsp;design". Here's the link to the infographic.&nbsp;http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/brasherblog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/vis-process-v8-a0.pdf</p>

                   <p>I liked "Wayne's Design Narrative: The Best Laid Plans" for a variety of reasons, part of it's that it's an example of what I'm working on in H800, right now, another that it resonated a lot with me, making lesson plans and trying to get the best out of your class, that it involves improvisation and feedback too. And the title was good and the story well-written and thorough.</p>

                   I found Ruth Findlater's design narrative: teaching navigation cloudscape . As I have been studying with Ruth in H800 16B I was interested to see how she presented the material here in A Cloud.

                   <p>I found this one really interesting on essay structure:</p>
<p>http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9892</p>
<p>This is partly because I know Nicola and teach the same module as she does but also because I think it was interesting that the students did have good reasons why an intro and conclusion was needed in an essay but still many do not include them. I think we forget sometimes that helping a student recognise that something is needed does not always make it clear how to do something.</p>        </div>

<p>It's about how useful OER's can be in learning a new musical instrument - I used to be a music teacher so it's a fascinating idea to me.</p>        </div>

                   <p><strong>Supportive Automated Feedback for Short Essay Answers (SAFeSEA)</strong></p>
<p>This cloud was the most interesting one I came across during my first (short) browse of the site:&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6484" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6484</a></p>
<p>It was on the 'popular' list of clouds on the home page and it's a really interesting topic for me as I use the Moodle short answer question type in some quizzes but unfortunately the link in the cloud is broken.</p>        </div>
