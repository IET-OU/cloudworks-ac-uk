                   <p>OK here is a tentative starting point:</p>
<p>Context: Individual or team learning in design education</p>
<p>Problem: How to help design students acquire both the theoretical and practical knowledge that they need in their future careers?</p>
<p>Forces: Students need to learn theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of design and also practical implementation and skills development. Some design students are biased towards practical learning and find theoretical work difficult to understand. For theoretical learning to take place an openess is required, but this is not always present. Some students focus all their energy into their practical work and do not ground it in theory.</p>
<p>Solution: Develop theoretical and practical understanding in parallel. Set project work with clear stages that requires the application of theoretical knowledge to practical situations. Ask students to reflect on the ways in which they have married these two elements of their learning</p>
<p>Summary: Develop learning of different kinds in parallel. Use projects and reflection as a way to bring these together.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Interesting, I think a part of the problem is grounded in fact that students learn theory to do successful future practical projects (that ground in theory). The theory is explicit in the learning environment, but it becomes quite implicit in future projects.<br /><br />Many alternative questions come into my mind, while none is perfect, one would be:</p>
<p>Problem: How to help design students acquire theoretical knowledge that they need in their future careers?<br /><br />Solution: Integrate theoretical notions in project work in the learning environment. Make theoretical notions explicit in a developing project.<br /><br />Consequence: In future projects students will have made the connection between theory and practice. They will use theory more implicitly.</p>        </div>

                   <p>This is an interesting problem and one which I can identify with as being both a design student and a design practitioner.&nbsp; How designers / students&nbsp;improve&nbsp;their practice is quite complex.&nbsp; Designers are affected by a variety of influences that surround them and one of these is design theory. Other factors include the current trends, their history or design background, their design skills; even their preferences and personality can have an impact. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree...the use of theory within design practice can be both implicit and explicit.&nbsp; Sometimes design students can unaware they are being influenced and some can make a concerted effort to practice according to a certain theory. Design students also need to be 'open' to&nbsp;theory&nbsp;at the right time.&nbsp; The element of timing is quite important, which is something we discussed.&nbsp; Being open to theory 'at the right time&rsquo; within their design practice. &nbsp;Design students can be working on a project and not make a connection to a certain theory, yet later on within that project that theory it could be useful.&nbsp; So, a &lsquo;connection&rsquo; is needed at the &lsquo;right time&rsquo; in order for a &lsquo;change&rsquo; in practice to occur.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this another pattern?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Its great you bring back the discussion point of 'the right time to make connections'. In U101, the right time to make connection is in the TMA. More particularly in the compendium template that maps out the student's design process over 4 weeks. Each week is tied to a particular design phase, i.e. exploration, concept, proposal, and evaluation. And to a certain degree each phase also refers to a piece of theory. After each week, the students are asked to reflect on this particular week and phase of process. A great comment from an external evaluator was that in this reflection the link to the theory that has been introduced should be made more explicit. We all thought that was a very valuable comment. Interestingly, the connection between theory and practice is not made very explicit in the teaching elements, but in the project work!</p>        </div>

                   <p>I would have to agree completely about the timing thing - it is absolutely essential that one is presented in relation to the other in such a way as to allow the connection between them to be made by the students themselves - when they do this themselves they 'own' this new knowledge and I can honestly say it is <strong>amazing </strong>to see this actually happening.</p>
<p>Here's a real example (which I am sure some of you will recognise ...).</p>
<p>One of the big concepts (I picked up on) in Block 1 of U101 is the notion of playfullness in design. I used this as Key Concept #1 and most of the first tutorial was dedicated to playing and telling 'adults' that it was ok to play again!</p>
<p>Looking around the room there was a genuine cross section of personalities and I could clearly see those who 'got' this concept and those who were yet to be convinced (and in particular one student who was actually frowning and had their arms folded very tightly across their chest).</p>
<p>We did several&nbsp;exercises&nbsp;that day and each time the message that 'it's ok to play' (theory) and that playing actually achieved something (practice) was reinforced again and again.&nbsp;By the end of it the folded arms person was one of the most active participants - they got it, saw the practical benefit of it, and actually used it.</p>
<p>Most interestingly, it was the students who attended the tutorial that responded best to the TMA and who reinforced the theory through practice. Again, these students now 'own' this theory through having practiced it and I have no doubt will use it again and even develop it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have yet to make such great progress in my professional design environment ...</p>        </div>

                   <p>Oh, and dare I mention Martin Heidegger's Present-at-Hand (theory) and Ready-to-Hand (practice) (<em>Vorhandenheit and&nbsp;<em>Zuhandenheit</em>&nbsp;- </em>hope I got that right Nicole?).</p>
<p>Without going through the deep philosphy of it, I do think there is a real difference in one's mind before acting (theory) and after acting (practice)...</p>        </div>
