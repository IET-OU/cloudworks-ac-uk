                   <p>How long did you take to complete the Activity? probably about two and a half hours</p>
<p>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? yes; however, I was not completely sure about the intention was of the slides of what appeared to be road maps</p>
<p>Was the content of the Activity informative? yes; it might have been useful to have an example of a Module Map that represents an existing OU module</p>
<p>What did you like about the Activity? it provided me with an opportunity to identify the specific components of the OU module on which I tutor using the six elements included in the Module Map exemplar:&nbsp; Guidance and Support; Content and Activities; Communication and Collaboration; Reflection and Demonstration; Module Summary; Key Words; I suggest that this process could be an effective tool for me as an AL in: &nbsp;highlighting the structure of the module and relationships between various elements of the module design; support reflection on the learning design of the module; sharing the overall design of the module in a visual way with students; providing opportunities for student input; organising my &nbsp;thoughts; capturing a tangible record of my understanding of and response to the overall design of the module at a particular moment in time</p>
<p>What did you dislike about the Activity? &nbsp;the awkwardness of&nbsp;including graphics using&nbsp;the comment facility; the preset line spacing in the comment facility</p>
<p>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? &nbsp;yes</p>
<p>If you did post comments to the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback? &nbsp;not yet</p>
<p>How useful was the feedback? &nbsp;not&nbsp; applicable</p>
<p>Do you have any other comments you would like to make?&nbsp; I look forward to reading additional comments on this discussion site and participating in the face-to-face workshop in Milton Keynes, 10 June</p>
<p>I note here that because of other work commitments that now require my attention; I will now not be in a position to spend much time with this project.&nbsp; I will dip into the project in order to view the progress from time to time within the next week so that I am aware of subsequent additions and information relating to the face-to-face workshop on the 10<sup>th</sup> of June.</p>        </div>

                   <ol>
<li>How long did you take to complete the Activity? - about 30mins</li>
<li>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? If they weren't how could they be improved? - to be honest I was unsure as to whether we were focusing on a specific activity within a course or a whole course itself, or either. I went with a specific activity as that was easiest for me in terms of my experience with the OU.</li>
<li>Was the content of the Activity informative? If not what would you have liked to see? - agree, an example would be good.</li>
<li>What did you like about the Activity? - it gave me a small new idea (even if it was really obvious once I thought about it!) for something I'm doing now</li>
<li>What did you dislike about the Activity? - I felt rather overwhelmed at first. Probably because I don't design at the course level with the OU and on the courses I've only designed tutorial forum exercises. I feel like I'm a little ant in a very big anthill</li>
<li>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? Yes</li>
<li>If you did post comments to the Activity Cloud did you get any feedback? - too early to say</li>
<li>How useful was the feedback?</li>
<li>Do you have any other comments you would like to make? - I think Genie is much more dedicated to this than me! I seem to be taking a very quick approach to engaging with this module - in a way that is a reflection of how I engage with online stuff generally. I tend to skim read/think more than I would if I was working hard copy or face-to-face. A reminder of how some of my students might feel.</li>

Having to get it done in time, in a context when I am already quite pressed.</li>

I did, and these were very helpful.</li>

I had expressed a feeling of dauntedness when i saw how much material the first comment included, and the writer returned to reassure me, which is a nice example of 'social presence'; similarly, as I also mentioned that the slide kept being interfered with as business videos kept popping up, another comment arrived from another participant to explain why this was happening.</li>

The sense of exposure, not only to one's colleagues in this learning design training, but also the thought that anyone can view what we write: that is quite a feature, that affects what I write.</li>

                   <p>I found myself able to complete this activity [only] after the workshop and seeing the blank copy of the course map and having the opportunity to try it out there and then.</p>
<p>For me the theoretical presentation was rather overwhelming and looking through some of the comments now I can see such detailed pieces of information that in many ways I am glad that I ddin't spend much time looking before the workshop as I would have been very reticent to have said anything there.</p>
<p>so i can't specifically answer the numbered questions as I have come across this from the other end, e.g. having thought about the course map and now having the chance to specifically complete one electronically.</p>        </div>

                   <ul>
<li><strong>How long did you take to complete the Activity? </strong>About an hour but had some distractions <strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Were the instructions for the Activity clear? If they weren't how could they be improved</strong>? Appeared clear </li>
<li><strong>Was the content of the Activity informative? If not what would you have liked to see</strong>? </li>
<li><strong>What did you like about the Activity? </strong>Made me realise that<strong> </strong>visual plan written as a grid is more effective for me than how I usually develop a session plan. Also realised that I do have quite a structured approach to planning. As generally limited to discussion forum activities and face to face tutorials didn&rsquo;t &nbsp;previously consider this to be course design. </li>
<li><strong>What did you dislike about the Activity?</strong> The graphics were &nbsp;slighlty slow to load.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Did you post any comments to the Activity Cloud? If you did not post any comments can you say why you didn't? </strong>Yes but late participant so no feedback<strong></strong></li>
thanks
