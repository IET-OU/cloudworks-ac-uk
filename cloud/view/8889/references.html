<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Audrey Watters; TechCrunch; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>EdSurge reports on <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-12-26-moocs-in-2014-breaking-down-the-numbers" rel="nofollow">MOOC stats for 2014</a>, highlights of which are that, by mid-2015, over 400 universities are expected to have delivered 2400+ courses to around 17 million students.&nbsp; Coursera still offers the lion&rsquo;s share of courses (36%) but this has fallen from around 50% in 2013 as new providers emerge &ndash; including FutureLearn, in 5<sup>th</sup> place with 4.7% of courses and around 800,000 students.&nbsp; And what courses do people want?&nbsp; The top 20 search terms suggests: python, healthcare, java, finance, android, English, statistics, marketing, music, writing, psychology, accounting, design, Spanish, programming, law, photography, big data and history.&nbsp; The article also reports on four notable trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each of the Big 3 MOOC providers have introduced their own credentials (Udacity&rsquo;s Nanodegrees, Coursera&rsquo;s Specializations and edX&rsquo;s Xseries)</li>
<li>Open edX has quickly become the de facto platform for organisations and groups who are looking to host their own MOOCs</li>
<li>There is a move towards self-paced &lsquo;always on&rsquo; availability rather than fixed start/finish dates (but with the challenge of providing the social interaction and/or assistance that many MOOC-takers expect)</li>
<li>Production quality is improving, with many universities setting up centralised production studios to support academics creating MOOCs</li>
</ul>
<p>Coursera has revamped its <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/104696446187/have-a-business-idea-get-funded-with-coursera" rel="nofollow">Developing Innovative Ideas: The First Step in Entrepreneurship</a> &lsquo;Specializations&rsquo; MOOC.&nbsp; Learners completing three 4-week courses will then be able to take part in a final project, creating a business plan and pitch deck to woo investors.&nbsp; Those deemed to have a compelling product idea will be invited to interview for a 500 Startups (a Silicon Valley investment fund and business accelerator) cohort.</p>
<p>A new partnership between Amazon Web Services and edX sees the former <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/23/amazon-web-services-will-give-you-1000-in-credit-for-completing-these-edx-courses/?ncid=tcdaily" rel="nofollow">offering students $1,000 in credit</a> for completing one of two MITx courses on entrepreneurship.&nbsp; The credit can be spent on processor time and/or storage in Amazon&rsquo;s cloud.&nbsp; Recipients can also get credit for instructor-led training and web classes on using AWS, free premium support and &ldquo;office hours&rdquo; with Amazon specialists to help newbies set up their app or service for Amazon&rsquo;s instances.</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/01/12/coursera-expands-presence-in-china.aspx" rel="nofollow">Coursera is moving into China</a>, thanks to a new partnership with Hujiang which will see English language Coursera MOOCs hosted on the Hujiang education platform, giving Chinese users access to course materials, class activities and discussions in a familiar learning environment.&nbsp; Additional services will be available to help users' pronunciation, grammar and translation.&nbsp; Future plans include launching courses in Hujiang from popular Coursera instructors, as well as incorporating educational resources from Hujiang into the Coursera platform.</p>
<p>Berkeley is teaming with private partner Databricks to launch a <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/12/02/berkeley-launches-big-data-moocs.aspx" rel="nofollow">new edX MOOC focused on big data analysis</a> using the open source Apache Spark data processing engine.&nbsp; The first five-week course, Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark, will cover the application of data science techniques using parallel programming for big and small data, and will start on 23 Feb.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; Independent]</em></p>
<p>The UK's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30711724" rel="nofollow">first private medical school</a> has just opened at the University of Buckingham, with an initial intake of 67 students paying annual tuition fees of &pound;36,000.&nbsp; Contrary to expectations, 60% of applicants are from the UK, reflecting the fact that conventional medical courses are consistently over-subscribed.&nbsp; The course will last four and a half years (with a total cost of more than &pound;162,000) and will include a mix of clinical and biomedical science teaching, working with the Milton Keynes Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. &nbsp;COO, Prof John Clapham says he has been &ldquo;absolutely staggered&rdquo; by the initial interest and that demand was even higher for next year's entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new report by High Fliers Research claims the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30745839" rel="nofollow">UK graduate employment market</a> is at its most buoyant for 10 years.&nbsp; Key to success is undertaking work placements at the firm in question, with a third of jobs expected to be offered to graduates who have managed to do this.&nbsp; Conversely, those with no work experience are unlikely to be successful applicants and have &ldquo;little or no chance&rdquo; of receiving a job offer through graduate programmes, half of the recruiters said.</p>
<p>A request from HEPI for universities to provide details of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/top-universities-refuse-to-reveal-how-they-are-spending-tuition-fees-9958264.html" rel="nofollow">how they spend tuition fees</a> was met with a deafening silence from the majority, including almost all the of the country&rsquo;s most select universities.&nbsp; However, HEPI Director Nick Hillman &ndash; an adviser to the former Universities Minister David Willetts &ndash; said he believed they would be unable to convince MPs in future to lift the &pound;9,000-a-year cap on fees unless they were more open about their financing.</p>

<p><a href="http://the-digital-reader.com/2014/12/23/bn-buys-pearson-stake-nook-media-28-million/" rel="nofollow">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> has bought out Pearson&rsquo;s stake in Nook Media for $28m.&nbsp; This news comes just a couple weeks after B&amp;N announced a similar deal to buy out Microsoft's stake for $120m.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/business/media/simon-schuster-to-sell-online-courses-taught-by-popular-authors.html?_r=2" rel="nofollow">Simon &amp; Schuster</a> has launched a new website offering online courses from popular health, finance and self-help authors.&nbsp; Their first batch of online courses will cost $25&ndash;85 and include workbooks and access to live question-and-answer sessions with authors. &nbsp;Simon &amp; Schuster&rsquo;s sales fell 11% in Q3 last year and sales of digital content, which accounted for 28 percent of the company&rsquo;s business, were flat.</p>
<p>Online learning company and video library, <a href="http://www.educationdive.com/news/lyndacom-funding-round-rakes-in-186m/352433/" rel="nofollow">Lynda.com</a>, has raised $186m in a new round of funding.&nbsp; It is expected to use the funds to make more acquisitions and expand its 550 staff base.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30712762" rel="nofollow">Tesco</a> has announced that two of its businesses - Tesco Broadband and online entertainment service Blinkbox - will be sold to TalkTalk.</p>
<p>An analysis of 500 top global firms showed that only 13% of their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30815103" rel="nofollow">philanthropic and social investment budget</a> was targeted at education.&nbsp; At the top of global spending on education were: Santander, which allocates 79% of its corporate social responsibility budget to &nbsp;education, giving about $197m (&pound;129m) last year; IBM (72%/$144m/&pound;95m) and Telefonica ($130m/&pound;85m).&nbsp; In the UK, GlaxoSmithKline, Rio Tinto and HSBC were the highest ranked.</p>

<p><strong>The Future of Online Learning</strong></p>

<p><strong>Online Instruction, E-Learning, and Student Satisfaction</strong></p>
<p><em>[IRRODL]</em></p>
<p>A paper in last month&rsquo;s IRRODL presents the results of a three-year study of 553 <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1748/3123" rel="nofollow">students&rsquo; level of satisfaction with online learning</a> at one US university. &nbsp;Responses were consistent throughout the eight academic terms, showing no significant differences in the level of satisfaction according to gender, age, or level of study. &nbsp;Overall, students rated their online instruction as moderately satisfactory, with hybrid or partially online courses rated as somewhat more satisfactory than fully online courses. &nbsp;&ldquo;Convenience&rdquo; was the most cited reason for satisfaction and &ldquo;lack of interaction&rdquo; (including lack of communication with the instructor and classmates) was the most cited reason for dissatisfaction.</p>

<p><strong>Should YouTube Clips Replace Hour-Long Lessons?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Emma Piquemal]</em></p>
<p>According to Prof Sanjay Sarma, MIT&rsquo;s director of digital learning, educators should stop relying on one-hour lessons and opt instead for <a href="https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6455175" rel="nofollow">10-minute video lessons</a> to capture the &ldquo;wandering minds&rdquo; of their students.&nbsp; &ldquo;The way we teach today is based on lectures, which is still a factory-style system,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;[Young people] spend hours each week consuming 10- or 20-minute titbits about physics and history or whatever on YouTube or Khan Academy&hellip; It&rsquo;s not &lsquo;maybe this will be the future&rsquo; &ndash; it is the future. &nbsp;We just need to recognise it.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, not everyone agrees.&nbsp; Miles Berry, principal lecturer in computing education at the University of Roehampton, said that in-depth learning still had a place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Academic and professional success requires the ability to concentrate for extended periods of time and the mastery of complex ideas and arguments.&nbsp; Good schools do all they can to help their pupils develop a love of learning, whether it&rsquo;s online, from books or face-to-face.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Emerging Technologies and the Workplace </strong></p>
<p><em>[Cisco; Bentley University]</em></p>
<p>Cisco&rsquo;s 2014 <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise/connected-world-technology-report/cisco-2014-connected-world-technology-report.pdf" rel="nofollow">Connected World Technology Report</a> is based on recent surveys of 1,388 Gen Y (millennial) professionals (aged 18-30) and 1,524 Gen X professionals (aged 31-50) from 15 countries.&nbsp; Its 147 pages provide a detailed insight into attitudes to work, expectations of the workplace and preferences/use of technologies,.&nbsp; Even the <a href="http://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1528226" rel="nofollow">summary</a> is extensive, so here&rsquo;s a summary of that summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 40% of Gen X and Gen Y professionals consider themselves to be &ldquo;Supertaskers&rdquo; (able to do more than two things effectively at once)</li>
<li>60% of Gen X professionals think that Gen Y employees are able to perform tasks faster than older employees using mobile devices and apps</li>
<li>Gen X professionals are considered easier to manage than their younger counterparts; the greatest challenge when managing Gen Y employees is their &ldquo;I want it now&rdquo; ambition</li>
<li>More than half of Gen X and Gen Y professionals consider themselves accessible for work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week</li>
<li>Around half of professionals wish to work anywhere at any time.&nbsp; Most are not prepared to sacrifice salary for this but they believe organisations that offer it have a competitive advantage</li>
<li>If forced to choose, the majority of Gen Xs and Gen Ys would pick their smartphone over their television and 1 in 5 would rather be robbed of their wallet than their smartphone</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar research by Bentley University into <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/BentleyU/preparedu-the-millennial-mind-goes-to-work-41415813" rel="nofollow">millennial workplace preferences</a> tells us that, as you read this in Jan 15, one in three US employees will be a millennial.&nbsp; They are part of the always-on generation, with 77% preferring flexible working and 89% regularly checking work emails outside work; but they are not exclusively digital, with 51% preferring to communicate with others face-to-face at work.&nbsp; Nor are they job hoppers we might imagine: 80% expect to work for four or fewer organisations during their career and 16% hope to stay in their current job for life.&nbsp; But 35% admit to having a poor work ethic and 66% believe limiting social media usage at work would make workers more productive.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Aids Learning?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Faculty Focus]</em></p>
<p>As learning designers, we often assume we should be making learning as clear and painless as possible for our busy students.&nbsp; But Daniel Lemire suggests the opposite can be much more effective, and we should encourage learners to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek the most difficult problems</li>
<li>Reflect on what you have supposedly learned</li>
<li>Avoid learning from a single source</li>

<p>He believes that, &ldquo;When studying, many people do not want to mix topics &lsquo;so as not to get confused&rsquo;. &nbsp;So if they need to learn to apply one particular idea, they study to the exclusion of everything else.&rdquo;&nbsp; The structure of most books and course materials (and lectures) supports this but students are often quite passive and are learning at a fairly surface level.&nbsp; He suggests <a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/12/30/how-to-learn-efficiently/" rel="nofollow">interleaved practice</a> (intentionally mixing up topics) is more effective, even though it may feel harder and confusing (&ldquo;If some learning activity feels easy, it means that it is too easy&rdquo;).&nbsp; This approach also better mirrors real life and the workplace because &ldquo;Interleaved practice is exactly what a real project forces you to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s another counterintuitive one: John Orlando suggests that <a href="http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/educational-assessment/praise-undermining-student-motivation/" rel="nofollow">too much praise</a> could be undermining student motivation and self-esteem.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing Can Aid Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS]</em></p>
<p>Two experiments reported in Contemporary Educational Psychology showed benefits gained by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X14000496" rel="nofollow">students who were asked to make drawings</a> (using a template) whilst assimilating new textual information about the biology of influenza.&nbsp; In experiment 1 (<em>N=</em>48), those who drew scored 61% on a multi-choice comprehension test, vs 44% for a control group.&nbsp; In experiment 2 (<em>N=</em>164), the scores were 63% vs 52%.&nbsp; Experiment 2 also included two other groups: one received pre-drawn images along with the text, yielding a mean post-test score of 53%; the other also received pre-drawn images and were asked to create their own (51%).&nbsp; These latter two conditions thus showed no notable gains over plain text, but the benefits of drawing over just reading were significant in both experiments.&nbsp; The researchers believe this &ldquo;&hellip;encourages learners to engage in generative cognitive processing during learning such as organising the relevant information into a coherent structure, and integrating it with relevant prior knowledge from long-term memory.&rdquo; &nbsp;However, they acknowledge that the study material involved a causal chain of events and so it is not clear if drawing could also help people learn other kinds of content.</p>

<p><strong>US Online HE Shows Little Growth but College Debts Show Big Growth</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Higher education researchers Eduventures predict that US online learning will grow in 2015 (but only modestly); more colleges and universities will test out competency-based assessment; and education technology will continue to expand as an industry, driven by investment capital. &nbsp;Eduventures expects just <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/01/07/2015-predictions-competency-based-ed-to-grow-debt-could-topple-some-schools.aspx" rel="nofollow">2% growth in online degree programmes</a>, dampened in part by the &ldquo;uncertainty and indecision&rdquo; of adult learners, and the number of new colleges entering the online market is expected to grow &ldquo;very little, if at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The company also noted that low interest rates are causing institutions to borrow more against the expectation that revenue from tuition, endowments, etc, will cover these debts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rating agencies, however, are not being fooled. &nbsp;Between 2009 and 2013, the number of credit rating downgrades at colleges rated by Moody's Investment Services outpaced upgrades by nearly five to one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Gender Gap in STEM Online Class Discussions</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>A study of 420,000 undergraduates and graduate students enrolled in STEM classes in the US and Canada found <a href="http://blog.piazza.com/stem-confidence-gap/" rel="nofollow">notable differences in male and female behaviour in online forums</a>.&nbsp; Whilst most students enrolled in classes that use online discussion tools <em>do</em> participate, women ask 23% more questions than do their male peers, but they answer 18% fewer.&nbsp; When women do answer, they are more likely than men to answer anonymously (39% vs 28%).&nbsp; At the &lsquo;top&rsquo; STEM universities (Berkeley, Stanford, Harvard and MIT) the male:female gap was greater than the institutional average.&nbsp; However, gender differences varied greatly by subject.&nbsp; While male computer science students answer 37% more questions than women, the difference is only 7% in humanities subjects and, in business and social sciences, women actually answer more questions than men (11% and 5%).</p>
