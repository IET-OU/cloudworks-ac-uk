        <p>The cloud relating to Peter Bullen's keynote is having some interesting 'spin-out' into the labels we used to define our role. i..e Teachers, academics, facilitators, researchers?</p>
<p>I thought it would be useful to bring that discussion to a seperate cloud. So what's your label and why?</p>

                   <p>Hi Dominic, a useful thought. I wonder though, as an aid to the complexity, what would happen if we labeled ourself differently from the label that our students / learners (customers - yuk) give us?</p>

                   <p>I have a really interesting battle with 'labels', as I have at least 3 (paid) roles within my institution. My official titles (with accompanying levels of access to things, and expectations from the students) are:</p>
<p>Blended Learning Fellow (Instiutional)</p>
<p>Lecturer (0.4) History</p>
<p>Associate Lecturer, Media Studies</p>
<p>Interestingly, in feedback from the History students last week, I was told that I was too informal, and they want more clarity in the division between me as a tutor and them as a student... whilst the Media Studies students find it helps them engage!</p>
<p>(If you wonder where the link between the 3 is, my PhD was on Second World War Posters - so communication is the big link!)</p>        </div>

                   <p>Thought I would share my experience of mooting my EdD title with my EdD cohort....the small cohort aside from me mainly work in schools and are very happy with the label "teacher".</p>
<p>When I mooted my draft title, which is &ldquo;Development of teacher identity as a new academic: what shapes a successful journey?&rdquo;, I was met with incredulity that lecturers might even possibly have an identity as a teacher, and that lecturing was "totally different" to teaching.</p>
<p>Where do I sit? I would describe my style as more of a facilitator, when people ask me where I've been I might reply "I've been teaching" (never lecturing) and yet I use "lecturer" in my job title. Is it a linguistic anomaly depending on need of an&nbsp;adjective-verb-noun or something more fundamental in terms of how we like to be identified?</p>
<p>Fascinating stuff!</p>

                   <p>I think there is a real ambiguity in the way we use the terms.. I don't teach/lecture/facilitate so much nowadays.. but when I used to teach more, if I was asked what my job was, I used to reply a 'university lecturer' &nbsp;because that is the term I felt was most readily identifiable by non-academics. But if asked what I actually did at work, I would say I 'teach' physio students'... but my teaching style was defintely facilitatory wherever possible (I have never thought that teaching implies an instructional way of working - but&nbsp;some people seem to think that what it implies).</p>
<p>So I'm not uncomfortable with being a lecturer or teacher or facilitator... but I don't know if I am alone?</p>

                   <p>The job title is Lecturer but during my everyday work I am refered to as a Tutor. I think the Tutor label is closer to what I do. I find it interesting the continual search for a name for those that turn up in my classroom: Student, Learner, Client, Customer. Ithink that we should worry less about what we call ourselve and accept that in a research led environment the tasks and relationships will be continually evolving and so the definitions for the names will have to change to keep up.

                   <p>Thanks Chris - good to know I am not alone!</p>
<p>This discussion reminded me of some research I did a while back where I interviewed staff about their pedagogic pracitces and as with role titles, there was no common agreement about what constituted a lecture or seminar or tutorial etc - this is an extract from the results...&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>As with seminars and tutorials, there was not a consistent way to distinguish between a workshop, a practical and a laboratory session &ndash; what they were termed was probably due to local practices or conventions. Once again, from a students&rsquo; perspective, what is probably most important is that they understand the purpose of the session and the expectations of the contributions of all concerned are known. From the perspective of a community of practice that can extend into the workplace, using the normative descriptions of that community should take precedence over some notion of standardising the terminology across disciplines.</em></p>        </div>

                   <p>Its interesting to see UK institutions adopting, or thinking about adopting, US practice of using professor as a description (with all its variety of prefixes).&nbsp; Will be interesting to see how that plays out with both the public and the profession.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I think there's a real problem here - but it might be that we take it too seriously.</p>
<p>The problem is that the labels are so contested, so bound up with professional identities and as a consequence so political and threatening.</p>
<p>The reason we might be taking it too seriously is because we're not just labels. I'm a conference delegate at the moment, a tutor in the break later when I check my online course, a researcher if I ever get time to write... and so on. The labels describe things I'm doing (and can stop doing); they come and go. They only matter if we take them too seriously (e.g. by turning them into contracts).</p>        </div>

                   <p>Great question! I remember having a *real* identity crisis when I moved from a clear role as an academic Chemistry Lecturer to a central institutional role to doing with learning and teaching innovation. I didn't know how to describe my self and almost felt as if I was demoted although ironically it was a promotion! Now that e-learning is a more established field I have some sense of clearer belonging. I agree Martin that of course we have multiple roles - I would certainly describe myself as researcher, facilitator, teacher (to a lesser degree), learner etc. But I think roles do carry meaning/weight which has an impact so I think they are important. The problem is we are in a process of transition and hence the terms we are using dont have clear and distinct meanings anymore....</p>        </div>

                   <p>@Martin - agree totally about multiple roles.&nbsp; While I agree with Steve that what you do is in some ways more important than titles, semiotics or political correctness argue that labels are crucial in framing how people think.</p>
<p>However, @Gr&aacute;inne, I think the rise of dual professionals and portfolio working mean that a single label for a single person becomes harder.&nbsp; So to friends and acquaintances I may "work at a University" (though this doesn't say whether I am a VC or a cleaner), "teach at a university", "teach and research at a ...", "teach, research, promote good practice in teaching ..."&nbsp; and before you know hopefully you are in a conversation getting behind the label.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid prejudicing the matter, I don't have any title on my business card.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I'm not sure that this isn't an issue outside of learning and teaching too. My career route has not been a direct one and I've had several different jobs. What to call myself has always been problematic. Not sure whether this is because of blurring of job roles generally, or a more personal reluctance to be defined by a job title. I still say I'm a teacher even though I no longer have any students under my wing, just because I feel that it explains where I'm coming from best.</p>        </div>
