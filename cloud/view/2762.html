        <p><strong>Complex spaces for learning: theory and practice in design, co-design and re-design</strong></p>
<p><em>Peter Goodyear, Yael Kali and Sue Tickner</em></p>
<p>Plan is to produce a report out of the event, want people to feel free to be frank.</p>
<p><em>Peter Goodyear</em></p>
<p>A central challenge that emerges from the changing landscape is about working out how we can make pedagogical sense of these changes. Can we view design as a means of managing this change, what would this look like? Spaces for learning &ndash; physical, virtual are becoming more complex. Couple that with a notion that students will and should be more actively involved in reconfiguring their own learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience of co-design with students and also re-design</li>
<li>Design as imaging other people&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>Activity distributed in complex ways across time, space, tools and people</li>
<li>Students and teacher co-configuring activity relationships and learnplaces</li>
<li>Extended concept of self-regulation: activity relationships and tools/resources</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lassez-faire&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Instructional design</p>
<p>[loose vs. tight structures]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not just about managing activities but the social interactions., also how to make good choices about tools and resources.</p>
<p>Is design too complicated &ndash; should we just let students get on with it??? Some argue from the position of students as experts anyway, aligning with Prensky&rsquo;s notions, whereas now most don&rsquo;t subscribe to that position. In reality students&rsquo; digital habits are very varied, they may not know how to use these technologies for learning</p>
<p>Alternative approach to help students find their way through this space, need classic application of instructional design and more rigour, discipline, etc.</p>
<p>In reality it&rsquo;s probably somewhere in between.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Teaching as design</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diversifying student needs and expectations</li>
<li>Rising expectations abut graduate capabilities</li>
<li>Intensification of pressures on teaching staff</li>
<li>Accelerating technological change</li>
</ul>
<p>Increasing stress on traditional teaching processes</p>
<p>Accumulating research evidence about learning and teaching</p>
<p>Activity-centred design &ndash; design cannot be content focussed, must be on what the student does. It&rsquo;s the alignment between the desired learning outcomes and the activities we want the students to engage with. A key element of the design challenge is designing the student tasks. Of course students will interpret what we ask them to do (for good or bad). There is a gap between the tasks we set and the activities the students do.</p>
<p>We must remember that learning is physically situated &ndash; there are multiple learnplaces and this is fundamentally important and shapes the quality of the activities the students do.</p>
<p>Also learning is socially situated, groups, teams and communities + virtual teams, groups, and communities</p>
<p>Accelerating interpenetration of the digital and material worlds</p>
<p>Ubiquitous computing/ambient intelligence</p>
<p>Rise and rise of personal technologies</p>
<p><strong>Three inter-related components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Outcomes</li>
<li>Activity &ndash; place is a part of this, as is community. We must remember we don&rsquo;t control these spaces </li>
<li>Task</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need to think about scale &ndash; macro, meso and micro. For each we can think about tasks, tools and people. A lot of what we do as teachers is at the meso level. Design of a single task, mapped to a single coherent activity. Timeframe days or weeks. The set of tools, spaces and other resource needed for the learners works on a specific activity. Usually the concern of a teacher or programme team, may be co-configured by the learner(s). People: arrangement into working groups that persist for the length of the activity.</p>
<p>Teaching as design is indirect because of</p>
<ul>
<li>The legitimate and unavoidable gap between tasks and activity</li>
<li>Co-configuration of the complex mix</li>
<li>Autonomy exercised by students in making choice about who to work with and how but needs careful scaffolding</li>
<li>Plus alignment up and down the system macro &ndash; to micro-</li>
<li>Against this can we support teachers design work?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sue Tickner</em></p>
<p>Imaging learning: enabling design</p>
<p>Design/learning</p>
<p>Action (Revised design) &ndash; feedback &ndash; opportunity to respond (feed forward)</p>
<p>Dialogic process to reach a mutual understanding &ndash; when design is collaborative there are more opportunities for feedback and so learning</p>
<p>Levels of collaborative design?</p>
<ol>
<li>Reacting to feedback on existing design &ndash; adaptive</li>
<li>Designing for student contributions to and flexible use of environment we provide tools and resources and opportunities</li>
<li>Handing over (parts of) the design to the learners</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>On the fly, rapid changes according to feedback. In the moment imaging the immediate learning needs, they need new space for this, just in time, highly responsive contextual, at extreme, similar to formative testing, rapid prototyping, labs observation, on going support. Examples &ndash; one-click surveys within a course, watching their intros in labs, group discussions need to come back together, add a new whole class one. Also process &ndash; design stems from philosophy and values, reflected in methods, the &lsquo;teachable moment&rsquo;</li>
<li>Negotiated marking criteria/assessment rubrics. Co-constructed bibliographies and resource banks. Evaluation criteria for group processes. Spaces for students to create/share their own resources. Examples role play scenarios, resource bank wiki. Educ 230 Wikis, blogs, negotiated assessment criteria, self-assessment, group process critique. Self and peer assessment, criteria and review. Orientation course &ndash; chat, RSS feeds, practice wikis. Self, group, lecturer-reflection. As locus of control shifts during the shared assessment process, there is also a greater appreciation that all learners are teachers and teachers continue to be learners.</li>
<li>Students co-construct teaching resources in groups using whatever of the available technologies/resources they choose. Then create teaching spaces and co-teach. Students create resource banks and presentations to share. TLT group smart classrooms. Communication and making connections, sharing resources, encourage learners to interact spontaneously. Wheatley and Frieze *2006 using emergence to take social innovation to scale </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Yael Kali</em></p>
<p><strong>Redesign as a strategy to create, refine and share design knowledge gained in an iterative design process</strong></p>
<p>Approach to design &ndash; methodological approach &ndash; design-based research and strategic approach the use of the design principles and the design principles database (DPD)</p>
<p>Methodological approach &ndash; Barab and Squire 2004, Collins, Joseph and Bielaczyc 2004, The design-based research collective 2003</p>
<ul>
<li>Iteration 1</li>
<li>Iteration 2 Enactment of the revised version of the features, data gathering, data analysis and conclusions</li>
<li>Iteration 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Design Principles Database</p>
<p>Edu-design-principles.org Create an infrastructure for the community of educational technology designers and learning scientists to capture synthesise and discuss design knowledge</p>
<p>Structure is hierarchical have over 100 examples. Features then pragmatic principles (general guidelines about design, but also connected to learning theory) and then meta-principles</p>
<p>Example: web-based jigsaw activity: philosophical perspectives</p>
<p>Specialization groups in online discussions (progressivism, existentialism, essentialism), the knowledge sharing in home groups, then individual application of the knowledge in a new context (using perspective to analyse a school)</p>
<p>DP1: engage learners in peer instruction. Rationale &ndash; taking the role of instructor can encourage sutdents to depend understaning of content, increase motivation etc Topping 1996 Linn and His 2000 But trade off main contribution to those who instruct and less to those who learn</p>
<p>DP2: reuse students artefacts as resource for further learning</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iteration 1 &ndash; First version was unstructured discussion, found very low application of the knowledge in a new context, Students focussed on the perspective they had specialised in.</p>
<p>Iteration 2: Provided them with a tool. Collaboratively constructed table as attachment in the forum. Found application of knowledge was even lower!!!</p>
<p>Iteration 3: Used the same table, but this time students didn&rsquo;t download, it was in a wiki format. This made a big difference, because when they completed their rows they could see what others had contributed and could compare and contrast. Also enabled them to edit each others&rsquo; contributions. So a better application of DP3 and DP4</p>
<p>DP3: provide knowledge representation and organisation tools</p>
<p>DP4: Employ multiple social activity structures</p>
<p>Lessons learned &ndash; redesign as a strategy to create, refine and share design knowledge gained in an iterative design process. Design based research approach provides insights about the use of technology to apply design principles</p>
<p>Design knowledge gained in this process can become part of the design principles (tips: tradeoffs, pitfalls, limitations)</p>
<p>Comments on the presentation</p>
<ul>
<li>Small tweaks in redesign can have a huge impact on the success of the activity.</li>
<li>Interesting that between iteration 2 and 3 the major change was in the tool rather than the tasks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Learners can be initially quite reluctant to edit their co-learners contributions, need to encourage and support that</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>What do you do when people don&rsquo;t agree about the edits in the wiki, one delegate has a forum alongside the wiki so there can be a negotiation about how the wiki is edited</p>
<p><em>Issues </em></p>
<p>Co-design: Think about situations where you have handed over to the students, so there is considerable autonomy given over to the students. Think around tasks, tools, or how they work with others. Wants us to concentrate on the latter two rather than tasks.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>One example with masters&rsquo; students. Give flexibility to choose their research questions and focus and which databases to use, but they wanted to be guided more.</li>
<li>Cancelled all lectures once and told students to go and look at the materials online.</li>
<li>Students working in a global context and had to negotiate a project. They all abandoned the learner management space and took their discussion to a private space.</li>
<li>P/g e-learning course, last year moved to more flexible approach, allowed them to take over certain parts of the course and they choose the tools they wanted to use and moderated the space.</li>
<li>Put students into a public social networking site and asked them to share they professional practice and some interesting debates occurred in the communities.</li>
<li>Another example got the students to write a chapter around their subject area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Re-design: Has anyone got examples they can share of good re-designs? It's not just about re-designs which are based on solid data but also scholarly practice - teachers often have a natural, intuitive understanding of what works and what doesn't. Iterative re-design is surely an inherent part of teacher practice.</p>    </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>In terms of a good example where co-design and re-design have figured prominently, the project I am currently engaged with as multimedia designer i.e the <a href="http://www.animations.physics.unsw.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Physclips</a> project has evolved largely by these means.</p>
<p>The project, essentially a co-design between a content expert and a multimedia designer, has been responsive to user feedback from both students and the general public in terms of adjusting it's design layout.</p>
<p>The iterative process has entailed changes emanating from the content expert (increasing level of expertise due to growing level of knowledge with regards to the authoring software(epistemic fluency?)), the multimedia designer (applying and extending research-based cognitive design principles) and the user (requests relating to user-control and accessibility to learning objects). The final product has been successful in terms of dissemination and uptake (determined through tracing back stats and by direct correspondence) whilst also fortunate enought to win some international awards. (<a href="http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/ascilite/hatsidimitris.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ascilite paper</a>)</p>
<p>My conclusion is that the intution and mastery of the content expert forms the key ingredient in the construction of educational multimedia to the extent whereby a working knowledge of the authoring software (i.e.understanding its capabilities and limitations) also needs to be attained as it allows them to participate in critical decisions relating to content-specific presentation techniques and related design considerations. Time well spent for an academic dealing with complex subject matter, more so than being sidetracked by other techno-centric challenges that do little to capitalise on, and develop,&nbsp;their discipline-specific expertise.</p>
