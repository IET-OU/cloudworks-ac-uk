<p><strong>Young Students Flock to OU</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/jun/29/open-university-young-students?&CMP=EMCEDUEML1210" rel="nofollow">A quarter of new OU students are aged 17-25</a>, a 36% increase on last year, according to this very positive article in The Guardian.&nbsp; Tuition and accommodation fees plus the shortage of campus-based university places are regarded as significant factors in this trend.</p>
<p>[Pete Mitton]</p>
<p>Donald Clark picks up on this and weighs in with some <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2010/06/ou-key-to-future-of-he.html" rel="nofollow">passionate support for the OU</a> and how it operates (&ldquo;the single greatest education institution in the UK&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s shameful is that other universities haven&rsquo;t taken the model more seriously&rdquo;). &nbsp;Also interesting is some of the discussion that follows Donald&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>[JE]</p>
<p>Further positive commentary from the BBC on the OU being the first to reach <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10446141.stm" rel="nofollow">20 million downloads from iTunesU</a> &ndash; that&rsquo;s 8% of the 250 million worldwide total from all educational providers.&nbsp; George Siemens wonders, &ldquo;Does OU see a return on its investment in creating and sharing resources via iTunes?&rdquo;&nbsp; Answers on a postcard&hellip;</p>
<p>[Pete Mitton]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Blackboard Buys Elluminate</strong></p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t sue them, buy them?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/07/08/blackboard" rel="nofollow">Blackboard</a> has announced that &ldquo;Elluminate, Wimba, and Blackboard will join forces to bring together the leading technology products for synchronous learning and collaboration.&rdquo;&nbsp; The takeover cost Blackboard $116m and the new company will be called Blackboard Collaborate.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s the OU roadmap looking, Niall?</p>
<p>[Ross MacKenzie]</p>

<p><strong>UK Public Lukewarm on e-Readers</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to urge caution over educational technology without appearing to be a Luddite.&nbsp; For that reason, I&rsquo;ve been quietly questioning whether we&rsquo;re all getting a bit carried away with iPhones, Kindles, iPads and other cool devices.&nbsp; Yes of course we have to investigate the possibilities and how we could deliver and support them at scale &ndash; but what does the typical student on the Clapham omnibus really want?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/in-depth/feature/119078-reading-the-future-2010.html" rel="nofollow">The Bookseller</a> recently worked with consultancy The Next Big Thing to investigate how 3,000 British book-buying consumers engage with books.&nbsp; Highlights include: only 26% of respondents had ever heard of a Kindle and only 41% knew what a Sony Reader was, although 60% had heard of the iPad.&nbsp; A combined 70% said they were &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; (36.8%) or would &ldquo;definitely not&rdquo; (32.3%) buy an e-reader in the coming year.</p>
<p>[Giles Clark]</p>
<p>On a similar theme, even if students are happy to use new technologies, there is a limit to their enthusiasm.&nbsp; <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Reflections-on-Teaching-with/24556/?sid=wc" rel="nofollow">Brian Croxall</a> reflects on his experiences of getting students to use Web 2.0 gizmos such as Google Docs, Twitter, Wave, Wikis and Zotero: mainly positive but beware of &lsquo;tool fatigue&rsquo;.&nbsp; And, as Stephen notes, &ldquo;you can't just take these new technologies and cram them into an old-word course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>Perhaps <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2010/06/22/kno-to-launch-higher-ed-specific-e-reader.aspx" rel="nofollow">Kno</a> is the answer: an e-Reader developed specifically for the HE market.&nbsp; An autumn release is planned and the twin-colour-screen wi-fi device will support Flash, HTML5, PDF and ePub formats.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.kno.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">promo video</a> suggests it&rsquo;s worth looking out for, although no mention yet of price or battery life.</p>
<p>[Campus Technology]</p>
<p><a href="http://worldebookfair.org/" rel="nofollow">WorldeBookFair.com</a> claims to hold 3.5m eBooks that can be read or downloaded. &nbsp;This is free until 4 Aug and then $8.95 per year thereafter.</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>But where would any eBook be without its animated &lsquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/08/microsoft-tries-to-patent-virtual-page-turning-technique–should-apple-be-worried/" rel="nofollow">page-turn</a>&rsquo;?&nbsp; Standby for pistols at dawn as Microsoft claims to own the patent.</p>
<p>[TechCrunch]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Tablets to Become Dominant</strong></p>
<p>Forecaster, Forrester Research, is predicting that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/17/forrester-tablets-outsell-netbooks" rel="nofollow">tablet sales</a> in the US will overtake netbook sales by 2012, and desktops by 2015.&nbsp; They expect 3.5m tablets to be sold this year (although I note that iPad sales have already topped 2m), growing to 20.4m in 2015.&nbsp; The predicted shape of the 2015 market is: 17% netbooks, 18% desktops, 23% tablets and 42% laptops.&nbsp; No mention of e-Readers, so perhaps Forrester thinks they&rsquo;ll have come and gone by 2015&hellip;?</p>
<p>[TechCrunch]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Bezos's mission</strong></p>
<p>Much like the OU of a few years ago, Amazon is discovering it&rsquo;s no longer the only game in town.&nbsp; They reported profits of $299m in the last quarter but the threat from Barnes &amp; Noble and others has seen them reduce Kindle prices from $259 to $189.&nbsp; Despite this, founder Jeff Bezos remain upbeat about new markets and different devices, as this <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/06/29/jeff-bezos’s-mission-compelling-small-publishers-to-think-big/" rel="nofollow">CNN/Fortune interview</a> shows.</p>
<p>[Giles Clark]</p>
<p>Amazon is to start selling new e-books that come embedded with audio and video.&nbsp; &nbsp;It will also shortly offer a product called <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/amazon-to-launch-web-based-book-previews/" rel="nofollow">Kindle Previewer for HTML 5</a> that will allow readers to view samples of books directly from within a Web browser.</p>
<p>[Giles Clark]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Digital Objects</strong></p>
<p>The latest issue of Chicago&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/issue/view/315" rel="nofollow">First Monday</a> journal is devoted to digital objects.&nbsp; This includes a paper from LSE which seeks to, &ldquo;&hellip;develop <a href="http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3033/2564" rel="nofollow">a theory of digital artefacts</a>.&nbsp; The venture assumes that digital technologies of all varieties and breeds share a limited set of qualities that places them apart from other non&ndash;digital devices and systems (paper&ndash;based) for managing information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Google Maps</strong></p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s a thing.&nbsp; A group of programmers have written a program that takes London Underground source data to display animated real time (more or less) <a href="http://traintimes.org.uk/map/tube/" rel="nofollow">Underground train positions overlaid on a Google map</a>, and then they give the code away.&nbsp; Whatever happened to capitalism?</p>
<p>[Jonathan Fine]</p>
<p>Take a Google map and let people pin their historic photos to it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where <a href="http://www.historypin.com/" rel="nofollow">Historypin</a> comes in.&nbsp; The site is still in beta but it&rsquo;s a nice idea, currently let down only by the lack of photos &ndash; but I guess that&rsquo;s where we come in&hellip;</p>
<p>[George Siemens]</p>
<p>Or, if you&rsquo;re more into charts than maps, Tony reports that Google has been busy with those too, with additional support for <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/docs/gallery/compound_charts.html#embeddedcharts" rel="nofollow">compound and embedded charts</a>, plus an API to render <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/docs/gallery/formulas.html" rel="nofollow">TeX formulae into web images</a>.</p>
<p>[Tony Hirst]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Google Guides</strong></p>
<p>Richard Byrne has published a second edition of his <a href="http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1oai5/GoogleforTeachersII/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2010/07/google-for-teachers-ii-free-33-page.html" rel="nofollow">Google Guide for Educators</a> - 33 pages freely available online as a Flash book and covering topics such as Google custom search, bookmarks, sites, alerts, groups and calendars.</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>An Introduction to Social Media</strong></p>
<p>If you thought Ning, Jing and Dimdim were characters from the Mikado, you really need Jane Hart&rsquo;s excellent <a href="http://c4lpt.co.uk/academy/ism/index.html" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Social Media</a>.&nbsp; It not only explains and gives examples of numerous different tools but, being social, it also allows you to record your own experiences and ideas.</p>
<p>[Jane Hart]</p>
<p>Nobody does lists of lists quite like Jeff Cobb, and that includes his recent guest post from Karen Schweitzer, <a href="http://www.missiontolearn.com/2010/06/lifelong-learning-social-networks/" rel="nofollow">20 Social Networks for Lifelong Learners</a>.</p>
<p>[JE]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>RSAnimate</strong></p>
<p>RSA has come up with a compelling series of animated videos.&nbsp; Take some presentations by notable thought leaders &ndash; such as Dan Pink talking about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc" rel="nofollow">drive, motivation and reward</a>; or Prof Philip Zimbardo on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3oIiH7BLmg" rel="nofollow">the secret powers of time</a> &ndash; and play the audio over a time-lapsed sequence of animated text and imagery of the key points.&nbsp; Very well done and quite compelling.</p>
<p>[Chris Hough]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>US Online Study </strong></p>
<p>A recent US study found that <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2010/06/blackboard_online_learning_rep.html" rel="nofollow">27% of high school students</a> were enrolled in at least one online course in 2009, up from 14% enrolled in 2008.&nbsp; Online learning also appears to run in the family: students with a parent who had taken an online course were twice as likely to take or explore taking their own virtual course. And more parents than ever &ndash; 33% &ndash; reported having enrolled in an online course for work or pleasure.</p>
<p>[Education Week]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Online University Data</strong></p>
<p>The Online University Data site claims: &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t find fluff here: just quantitative data, facts, statistics, and information you need to choose the online college that&rsquo;s right for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; That includes <a href="http://onlineuniversitydata.com/2010/17-eye-popping-infographics-on-e-learning-and-online-education/" rel="nofollow">17 Eye-popping Infographics on e-Learning and Online Education</a>, <a href="http://onlineuniversitydata.com/2010/50-online-university-professors-on-twitter-worth-following/" rel="nofollow">50 Online University Professors on Twitter Worth Following</a> and an <a href="http://onlineuniversitydata.com/2010/open-courseware/" rel="nofollow">Open courseware: stats &amp; facts visualization</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What Research has to Say for Practice</strong></p>
<p>This ALT wiki page contains <a href="http://wiki.alt.ac.uk/index.php/What_research_has_to_say_for_practice" rel="nofollow">nine guides that relate e-learning research to practice</a>.&nbsp; Some familiar names here including Allison Littlejohn (learning objects), Agnes Kukuluska-Hulme (mobile devices), Gilly Salmon (online tutoring) and the sadly missed Robin Mason (web based course design).</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>HTML5</strong></p>
<p>Interest in HTML5 is now extending well beyond the programmer community.&nbsp; For those newbies amongst you, it&rsquo;s not just a newer version of current HTML &ndash; it will allow multimedia and greater interactivity to be built into sites without the need for separate apps and plugins.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a simple <a href="http://www.focus.com/images/view/11905/" rel="nofollow">graphical summary</a> (including a comparison with Flash), Microsoft has some demos on their <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/" rel="nofollow">IE9 test drive site</a> and there&rsquo;s a 50 min <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdDc7sWjCL4&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">video overview</a> from Google&rsquo;s Brad Neuberg.</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>Google also offers its <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/" rel="nofollow">HTML5ROCKS</a> site as the starting point for those seeking HTML5 information, tutorials and support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Jonathan Fine]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Sixty Symbols</strong></p>
<p>The University of Nottingham&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.sixtysymbols.com/" rel="nofollow">sixty symbols</a> site contains &lsquo;videos about the symbols of physics and astronomy&rsquo;, including a fascinating description of how to filter out the sound of vuvuzelas from our world cup commentary.&nbsp; But if you also want to know about Hanny's Voorwerp or Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat, these short videos are quite compelling.</p>
<p>[Chris Hough]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Office 2010</strong></p>
<p>There were over 9m downloads of the MS Office 2010 beta, but the full suite is now available, comprising: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Publisher, Access and OneNote.&nbsp; OU staff and students can buy it via the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/student/office/en-gb/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">ultimate steal</a> for &pound;49.99.&nbsp; MS is also offering some free &lsquo;how to&hellip;&rsquo; <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">self-paced e-learning</a>.</p>

<p><strong>eLearning Journals</strong></p>
<p>e-Taalim is an Arabic site (in English) which aims to spread information and awareness about using ICT and Media for lifelong learning in African and Arab countries.&nbsp; One useful page contains an alphabetical list of (mostly free) <a href="http://www.e-taalim.com/resources/e-learning-journals.html" rel="nofollow">eLearning journals</a>.</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>The latest issue of <a href="http://ineducation.ca/issue-2" rel="nofollow">in education</a> is available online and includes inputs from George Siemens (Systemic changes in higher education) and an OU-foursome (How New Technologies Could Transform Academic Work).</p>
<p>[George Siemens]</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g922547134~tab=toc" rel="nofollow">Open Learning</a> celebrates its 25<sup>th</sup> birthday with a freely available issue including papers by John Richardson (disabled student course completion) and Gr&aacute;inne Conole (Web 2.0 for learning and teaching).</p>
<p>[OU Intranet]</p>
<p>Finally, via Stephen, an excellent list of educational technology, learning and psychology journals from <a href="http://edtechdev.wordpress.com/journals/" rel="nofollow">Doug Holton&rsquo;s EdTechDev blog</a>.</p>

<p><strong>University of California vs Nature Magazine</strong></p>
<p>The University of California has called time on its subscription to <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/U-of-California-Tries-Just/65823/" rel="nofollow">Nature magazine</a> (and 66 others from the same stable) after its publisher announced plans to raise the cost of California's license for its journals by 400 percent next year.&nbsp; The university is also encouraging academics to refrain from submitting or reviewing further papers and to resign from editorial boards.</p>
