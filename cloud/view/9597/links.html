        <p><strong>Date:</strong>&nbsp;Tuesday 09 February 2016</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong>&nbsp;11:00-13.00</p>
<p><strong>Venue:</strong>&nbsp;Library Seminar Rooms 1&amp;2</p>
<h3>Programme</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>11.00-11.20 - Citizen science and learning - the iSpotnature.org experience - Janice Ansine, Citizen Science Project Manager, Faculty of Science</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Janice manages projects that use innovative, easily accessible web-based tools and other resources that help the public engage with and learn about science (e.g. <a href="http://www.iSpotnature.org" rel="nofollow">www.iSpotnature.org</a> and <a href="http://www.treezilla.org" rel="nofollow">www.treezilla.org </a>). She holds qualifications in environmental management, media and science communication; with a comprehensive background managing public engagement, outreach and behaviour change projects around sustainability, biodiversity and the environment. She is the OU membership representative for the European Citizen Science Association (ECSA) and is also a member of the international Citizen Science Association (CSA).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><a href="http://www.iSpotnature.org" rel="nofollow">iSpot </a>&nbsp;is the OU&rsquo;s award winning flagship citizen science project which engages the public through their interest in wildlife by crowdsourcing names to species. Since its launch in 2009 millions of people have been engaged participating in scientific research while on a unique learning journey around biodiversity. It is currently integrated into modules, a MOOCs and OpenLearn resources, with plans for further integration in future modules but its potential for teaching and learning is not yet fully exploited. Janice will share the iSpotnature approach, impact so far and highlight opportunities for the future of citizen science in learning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>11.20-11.40 - Citizen science in teaching and learning enhancing graduate employability skills -&nbsp;Dr Alice Mauchline, Research Fellow, School of Agriculture, Policy &amp; Development, University of Reading&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Alice is a member of the multi-disciplinary Enhancing Fieldwork Learning (EFL) team. The EFL group engage with HE practitioners to share ideas of innovative field teaching and promote ways to enhance student learning during fieldwork through the use of technology. Alice also led a staff-student partnership project at Reading to develop a bespoke app, KiteSite, for campus biodiversity recording on mobile devices. This has led to a research interest in establishing ways to integrate citizen science approaches into Teaching &amp; Learning curricula in HE.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Alice will talk about the EFL project, the development of KiteSite and is interested to discuss how citizen science can be used in T&amp;L to enhance graduate employability skills. For more info on both projects please visit: <a href="http://www.enhancingfieldwork.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.enhancingfieldwork.org.uk/ </a>and <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/herbarium/kitesite" rel="nofollow">http://www.reading.ac.uk/herbarium/kitesite</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">11.40-12.00 - Citizen Science, technology and inquiry based learning -&nbsp;Dr Christothea Herodotou, Lecturer in Lecturer in Innovating Pedagogy, IET</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Thea&rsquo;s research interests evolve around the use of innovative technologies, in particular web-based technologies, digital games and mobile devices for learning and their relationship to human motivation and cognition. She is also involved in learning analytics in particular the evaluation of learning analytics interventions and their impact on students' performance and retention. Her work in IET relates to running a number of research and teaching-related projects as principal and collaborating investigator including the use of touchscreens and mobile games by young children, the evaluation of the effectiveness of digital learning applications (virtual microscope) in higher education, and tutors' perspectives on MOOCs.<br />She will talk about the design and evaluation of a citizen inquiry web-based platform (<a href="http://www.nQuire-it.org" rel="nofollow">www.nQuire-it.org</a>). nQuire-it combines the strengths of citizen science and inquiry learning in order to engage large numbers of people with inquiry learning. It enables the creation of personally meaningful investigations and participation to investigations proposed by others. The platform makes use of mobile technologies and has been recently translated to Spanish and Greek.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>12:15 &ndash; 12:35 p.m. &ndash;Q&amp;A and Coffee</strong></li>
<li><strong>12.35-13.00 - Citizen Science and educational technology, scope for the future -&nbsp;Prof. Eileen Scanlon, Associate Director (Research &amp; Innovation), IET</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Eileen Scanlon is Regius Professor of Open Education, an award she received for her exceptional contributions to the fields of educational technology and public engagement with the sciences. Eileen has a background in science communication teaching and research, and educational technology. As Associate Director of Research and Innovation in the Institute of Educational Technology, she has institutional responsibility for developing research strategy in educational technology.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Citizen Science is seen as playing an important role in both informal and formal learning and the use of ICT enhances this further widening access and increasing the scope for participation. Eileen will speak from her vast background and experience and facilitate the closing discussion around the potential for citizen science in e-learning at Open University and science teaching learning in the HE sector.</p>
