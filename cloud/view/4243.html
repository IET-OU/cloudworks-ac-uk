        <p>A demonstration of the pilot name authority system that is being developed by the Names Project. The project is aiming to unambiguously identify UK research institutions and their staff. The demo will given an update on progress, with plenty of time for discussion.&nbsp; <a href="http://names.mimas.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://names.mimas.ac.uk/</a></p>    </div>

			<p><strong>Live blog of the session</strong></p>
<p><br />A couple of links before we begin: <a href="http://mimas.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">Mimas</a></p>
<p>And <a href="http://names.mimas.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">The Names Project</a></p>
<p><br />Amanda Hill will be leading this session.</p>
<p>Amanda tells us she lives in Canada so is interested in differences between UK and North American English. She was reading a blog by&nbsp; M. Lynne Murphy about the subject - and there was a post about her slightly complicated name, and linking her work up to it.</p>
<p>The issue is going to grow. Especially since there isn't consistency in the way names are inputted into repositories.</p>
<p>We're now looking at a list of the different permutations of M Lynne Murphy&hellip; There are about a dozen. Not easy! <br />There's also the problems of having a common name. "Like A. Hill", says Amanda Hill.<br /><br />It was a two year project, looking at the potential need for a service that can look at the problem.<br /><br />They are now running a pilot scheme looking at potential future business models for the project.</p>
<p>They've been using data from Zetoc to populate the Names system, identifying unique indivudals and assigning identifiers.</p>
<p>They then enhance the data with information from other sources, such as the UKPMC grants database.</p>
<p>Now they are testing matching alogrithms, reviewing the data structure, updating data mappings for revised and new standards.</p>
<p>And we're going to have a demo:</p>
<p>- Oh and do look at the <a href="http://www.survey.bris.ac.uk/mimas/names" rel="nofollow">survey</a> on the Names website, says Amanda. It ends tomorrow at 10am...</p>
<p>The programme will show you fields of interest of authors in the  database, collaborations, articles they've written. Looks helpful.</p>
<p>There are various formatting methods for viewing the data.</p>
<p>There's also an API to get the data back.</p>
<p>We're drilling down into names data now.&nbsp; It all looks quite impressive. I'd recommend having a play on the <a href="http://names.mimas.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">site</a>. Alarmingly there's no Jordison on the database. Must be because it's still in the beta stages, or something...</p>
<p>Amanda;s now talking about the broader context. There's lots of activity in the area now, she says. Like ORCID (Open Researcher Contrubtor Identifier), VIAF (OCLC), ISNI (International Standard Name Identifier)... People are tackling the issue in other countries like Australia, Japan and New Zealand too.</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong><br />What sort of stuff are you doing with repositories? I know some have been working out name protocols&hellip;<br /><br />Amanda - One of the reasons we've been doing the survey is to find out what's out there&hellip;</p>
<p>There's now a discussion about how some repositories allow you to indicate whether attributions allow you to say "this isn't me"</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> I've heard that this is a big problem in China where people often have the same name.<br /><br />Amanda - Yes, Korea too.</p>
<p>The discussion has moved onto other possible indentifiers like national insurance numbers - but of course those present potential problems.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> - What about someone who gets married and changed their name?</p>
<p>Amanda - We'd need to have input from the person if they want to change their name. It's up to the individual - many want to keep their original name as a professional pseudonym and etc.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How does this relate to things people post about themselves on personal web pages.</p>
<p>Amanda - Hmmm. It's not supposed to be a white pages. At the moment we're only worried about identifiying people, not their whole CV and co. But again it's down to what the individual wants.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> But aren't web pages a good source of information about what people have written.</p>
<p>The discussion has moved on to the difficulty of "reading" such data. Sometimes Amanda says they have manually looked at individual web pages to distinguish people - but mining them would be very hard. "We prefer to go to institutions."</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Just a question about the API. Does it do content negotiation?</p>
<p>Amanda: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>It would be interesting to put that data into the <a href="http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ajp3g08/mosaicbookgalaxy/" rel="nofollow">book galaxy</a></p>
<p>Amanda - Yes it would! Those kind of visualisations would be really interesting.</p>
<p>Well, that was another interesting session. Delegates got very involved with the Q&amp;A there. On with the next one!</p>			<div class="posted-by">
