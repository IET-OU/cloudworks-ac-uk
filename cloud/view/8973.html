        <h2>Title <em>H800 Learning How to Use Clouscape</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>What was your role in the story?</em></p>
<p>A member of staff attending training.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>Describe the physical, social and intentional factors that define the design space, e.g. where and when did this occur? In what kind of space? Who were the key actors, and what were the relations between them? What were the beliefs and desires that shaped their interaction?</em></p>
<p>An instructional designer was hired to give a demonstration of using Articulate Storyline2 to alter a typical class based lecture for online delivery. There was one instructor for a 4 hours demonstration and about 14 members of staff. The overall aim was a demonstration of software and methods to engage students more for online class delivery.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>What were you trying to achieve? What was your measure of success?</em></p>
<p>The aim was for the employer of the staff attending the training to show how user friendly and easy it is to prepare material for online courses. Feedback sheets were sent to staff and general discussion during, at the end and in the days after the training. All the feedback demonstrated the usefulness of the day training how good the software is and how varied methods are to make courses engaging for students. But it also highlighted a skills shortage among staff for preparing these type of lectures.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>List the actions you took in chronological order. Note their effects &ndash; both expected and unexpected. Highlight any obstacles you encountered, and explain how you tried to overcome them.</em></p>
<p>Not sure this is really applicable to me as a complete novice and I&rsquo;m only now learning about instructional design. But I wasn&rsquo;t sure if this section title was talking about actions for if you were preparing a class or for after a class if it hadn&rsquo;t engaging for people attending the class. Having looked at a few other peoples design narratives though, I saw it was possibly more for preparing a class. The days training I recently attended and outlined above had many examples of how to make a course engaging and I really enjoyed all of it.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>List the expected and unexpected outcomes of your actions. To what degree did you meet your objectives? What additional outcomes did you engender? Provide evidence to back your claims.</em></p>
<p>Again not sure how to apply this as no prior experience as an instructor/lecturer, I trialled some of the software to feedback to managers and heads of department in the college, with a view to buying software licences for lecturers to be able to use. The long term view is to train a few staff and to help others and have mentors or educational development staff within the college to help others on a rolling basis and provide training in house. More sessions will be booked with the same external instructional designer again to.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>Reflect on your experience. What transferable insights did you gain?</em></p>
<p>Again is not sure how this section is meant to be applied it&rsquo;s for reflections on the day of training or how this template is meant to work with Cloudworks. The training day was good for staff where I work, and Cloudworks is a great idea and will develop a lot more contributions and outlines on what people are doing. In posting this template on Cloudworks it probably won&rsquo;t be of use to anyone information wise, but H800 is for future elearning professionals so I&rsquo;m not sure how this task could fully be applied as someone looking to develop skills in this area and haven&rsquo;t given a class as an instructor so far.</p>    </div>
