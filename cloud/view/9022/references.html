        <p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>I was the co-ordinator of training for radio producers in RT&Eacute; in 2008. A group of twenty producers being trained at different times and in different groups in one, two and three week modules,&nbsp;total training of 6 weeks spread&nbsp;over a three month period.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;task was to&nbsp;communicate&nbsp;learning assignments and notes with the trainees over that three month period, to maintain their focus on training while they were&nbsp;back working in&nbsp;their previous jobs&nbsp;and to build support and team spirit among the group.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>i created the forum which was only accessible by password, gave each trainee a password and had a guest password for speakers and&nbsp;other trainers. The main&nbsp;obstacle was making sure that the trainee producers used the online space, so I had a number of exercises early on in their training for them to familiarise themselves with it. Then I made&nbsp;sure that regular and important information was&nbsp;exclusively posted on the online space. I also made sure that they&nbsp;were each asked to answer&nbsp;a few questions or give a short description of&nbsp;themselves by&nbsp;most of the guest speakers/trainers, so it became a very active space for their learning. The speakers were initially reluctant to use the space as well but after they saw activity&nbsp;they could see the benefits of&nbsp;engaging with the trainees before they met them.&nbsp;An&nbsp;unexpected outcome was that they often looked at what&nbsp;the other&nbsp;speakers/trainers were asking and used that in their training. Also I hadn't anticipated that the trainees would similarly be interested in what&nbsp;the other trainees in other modules were doing as well so it broadened the&nbsp;learning experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trainees stayed focused for the three months, engaged with the speakers/trainers and other trainees through the online space. The trainers learnt more about the&nbsp;trainees they were teaching and the&nbsp;radio programmes were posted on the online space and so had a wider audience for feedback. The community was far bigger than i expected and the trainees used the forums more when they were back at&nbsp;work and not in training. I had anticipated that they would used it most when they were in full time training but they wanted the online contact most and contributed most&nbsp;the times when they weren't traning but in full time work. The opposite of what i expected.&nbsp;The evidence&nbsp;of that was in the postings but here I become&nbsp;an&nbsp;unreliable witness because the site was deleted after three months.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>As this was 2008 I learnt a lot of insights into how people&nbsp;engage with forums, the dynamics of support that&nbsp;grow and how trainers are often mining the forums to improve the way they teach. So now when I'm in H800 forums I will say honestly what I think of the course because I know it's being viewed by the tutor/s who are looking for my feedback, I will also try to support others or look for support. It also gave me a good insight into how when&nbsp;people are teaching a group a lot of ground work can be done&nbsp;before the teaching begins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    </div>
