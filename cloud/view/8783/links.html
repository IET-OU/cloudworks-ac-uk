<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bill Law<br /> <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" rel="nofollow">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog gets it start from a detailed account of <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf" rel="nofollow">change, politics &amp; education</a>.&nbsp; It's a long account because there's a lot going on - the account speaks for people establishing movements, posing questions and taking stands.&nbsp; It finds a lot of ways to value learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog looks to a future where, world-wide, cities are taking on education reform - and its shock that proves to be the driver.&nbsp; It examines...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; politicos - what are politicians trying to do and why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; motives - are we entirely fair to politicians?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tests - how do we know what is fact, pretense, or authentic?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perspectives - in such complexity can we find a political focus?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; narrative - what are the stories and what is there meaning?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shock - why would educators sieze on what is shocking?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; city - what cities have that nations lack and reform needs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is for educators looking for how reactionary shock-jocks don't have all the good moves.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub">the politicos</p>
<p>A globally influential account of how politics works, and fail to work, is set out by Brazilian politician and philosopher <a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/807-politics" rel="nofollow">Roberto Mangabeira Unger</a>.&nbsp; He argues that the failure of politics, is a failure to 'provoke the imagining and realisation of new possibilities'.&nbsp; He rejects obstruction by political small-mindedness, looking for immediate answers to run-of-the-mill questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is strong stuff: reform, h e says, is what we do about shock.&nbsp; We need politicians vigorous enough to live dangerously.&nbsp; And that means their stepping far enough back from the routine to be able see around conventionally shallow-and-narrow thinking. &nbsp;This sounds to me like a conversation for students and their educators to get involved in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the fusion of political experience and philosophical challenge explains a world-wide rejection of politicians.&nbsp; They are increasingly held in contempt.&nbsp; <a href="http://theconversation.com/the-politics-of-disillusionment-can-democracy-survive-6073" rel="nofollow">The surveys</a> vary only on the strength of that disillusionment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the reality is complicated.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true, there are politicos who are merely angling for next-election success.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;d be surprised if you&rsquo;ve not found any trying to get something worthwhile done.&nbsp; Politicos are not all the same.&nbsp; You may even be able to think of some who come across most immediately as razzle-dazzle-&lsquo;em performers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So should we be reframing politicos in at least three groups? - there are politicians, there are policy makers and there are performers.&nbsp; Students and their educators would need to tell when they are dealing with...</p>
<p class="dent">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dent">...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electioneering?</p>
<p class="dent">...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; policy making?</p>
<p class="dent">...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show-biz?</p>
<p class="dent">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="dent">You may well know more than three ways of doing politics.&nbsp; But you get the point - it's not one thing.</p>
<p class="dent" align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub">their motives</p>
<p>So that educators, like the disillusioned, dump politics?&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe, but not before we've take on-board more of what we would be turning our backs on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more complicated reality is that no politico is so narrow-and-shallow never to be able to rise above mere electioneering.&nbsp; Unless you know one.&nbsp; Politicos have it in themselves at times to be electioneers, at times reformers and at times performers?&nbsp; Their politics move back-and-forth across a spectrum.&nbsp; And over time - then that, now this, later something else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It makes political action varying episodes rather than categories on a list.&nbsp; It would be a mistake to categorise them in type-by-type analyses. &nbsp;They are characters in episode-by-episode narratives.&nbsp; Though, let's face it, some don&rsquo;t vary that much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A serious policy-maker, of any political colour, can shelve electioneering in the interests of doing something worthwhile.&nbsp; Some of these are working on education.&nbsp; It is good when educators and their students are in a position to converse with them.&nbsp; They deserve to be heeded, they also need to be questioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That conversation needs a congenial space, not overlooked by political and lobbying interests.&nbsp; Claims are made for the big society.&nbsp; They are false - this is small government reducing expenditure by unloading onto volunteers.&nbsp; Education's congenial home is in civil society - a locally-supported mutuality free of political and commercial control.&nbsp; It makes curriculum community property. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story moves on.&nbsp; Some UK politicians are learning to manoeuver <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/29/nhs-hospitals-hand-over-mutuals-francis-maude" rel="nofollow">mutuality into privatisation</a>. &nbsp;While a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/01/new-breed-shareholder-activists" rel="nofollow">new breed of shareholder</a> is bravely positioning itself to protect civil rights. &nbsp;There's no shortage of what to hear, to probe and to narrate.&nbsp; The challenge for educators and their students is find the questions that test for what to heed.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub">the tests</p>
<p>Politicians are displaying an interest in raising working-class aspirations.&nbsp; It's in day-by-day press-releases.&nbsp; What egalitarian could be against that?&nbsp; But, before the cheering starts, we might ask about the politics.&nbsp; I find that 'who?' and 'why?' often set off useful questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're talking about an economy where growth does not mean more jobs?&nbsp; And that can mean that a gain for a bright working-class family means a loss for a less-bright middle-class family.&nbsp; So here are the questions: who would want the brightest to be made ready for work? - and why would they want that?&nbsp; The 'who?' could be business, rather than a middle-class electorate.&nbsp; The 'why?' could be &nbsp;for economic, rather than egalitarian gains. &nbsp;The meaning could be <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776" rel="nofollow">curriculum capture</a>, rather than community property.&nbsp; And the aspirational press-releases could be handy bits of news management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, it's possible - though you'd have to stand back a bit to see it.&nbsp; If I've stood back too far it will come out when the politicians are found to be rooting for a person's aspirations to be a good out-of-work dad?&nbsp; I'm in more trouble more trouble when policy accepts that aspirations can include quitting work to put an end to stress.&nbsp; And I will have have fatally failed when politics accepts aspirations to oppose the economic growth that damages the planet, ruins neighbourhoods and humiliates its work force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A politician can win applause for promising &lsquo;justice available to all&rsquo;.&nbsp; And there are some politicians who have earned it.&nbsp; But there are more than enough conflicting interests in politics to allow the suspicion that &lsquo;justice&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t always mean what you think it means.&nbsp; Neither does &lsquo;available&lsquo;.&nbsp; Nor does &lsquo;to all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aspiration is about chances in life - in the economy yes, but also protecting the family, nurturing the neighbourhood, supporting colleagues and respecting the planet.&nbsp; Some politicians live dangerously by acknowledging all of this, but some put on a performance to disguise other priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Politics is not show business and its consequences are not a lot of laughs, not in Sunderland, anyway.&nbsp; So, if anything can bring credible hope to Alice in Sunderland, it will be interrogated policy - &lsquo;heeding whose voices?&rsquo; - &lsquo;recognised by what stakeholders?&rsquo; and &lsquo;acting in whose interests?&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was there ever a time when such an interrogation of politics was more of a concern of how students learn and how educators enable them? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub">the perspectives</p>
<p>The contradicting, overlapping, and unresolved perspectives featuring in the political discourse might be called 'argy-bargy'. The term 'complexity' does it all less than justice.&nbsp; Some punters take cover under a claim that they have found a resolution which is 'as simple as that'.&nbsp; But it never is. &nbsp;I think we need argy-bargy as a piece of sociological jargon.&nbsp; I've heard worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contrary to the assertions of narrow-and-shallow politics, there are rarely simple solutions to complex problems - have you looked under the bonnet of your car lately?&nbsp; The twenty-first century needs better than the simple-minded politics of something-must-be-done.&nbsp; It's the equivalent of hitting the engine with a hammer - which, once-upon-a-time, occasionally worked.&nbsp; The political version is 'say anything'.&nbsp; Its press release concludes with vacuous variations on 'and this is why the government is doing what we just said we would be doing'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On-line life further complicates the complicated - making social-networking politicos much more visible - but not always more accessible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do citizens know what to heed as reliable fact, what to ignore as electioneering pretense, and what to respect as authentic perspective?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <em>Prospect Magazine</em> publication, <a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/free-download-poverty-in-the-uk/" rel="nofollow">Poverty in the UK</a>, makes a start on mapping what all this is doing for aspiration.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how seventy pages could have packed in more argy-bargy. &nbsp;They reveal how what is supported by one constituency is opposed by another.&nbsp; They find no bases for disentangling that complexity. &nbsp;They reveal no clearly agreed action.&nbsp; In argy-bargy-land all the targets are moving targets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A significant feature of contemporary policy is speed of change.&nbsp; Things changed before <em>Prospect&rsquo;s</em> ink was dry.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s out-of-date on bishops and popes; and on what people do in the name of religion.&nbsp; Neither has it caught up with the economics of debt, or on-line predators, or economic myths.&nbsp; And, perhaps because Roberto Mangabeira Unger has not yet come into view it&rsquo;s well behind the curve on the philosophy of recognising a fact, uncovering a pretense, and respecting the authentic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education needs to deal with such complexity because the curriculum is not government&rsquo;s property, nor shareholders&rsquo;, nor educators&rsquo; nor even students&rsquo;.&nbsp; It is managed by stakeholders on behalf of communities.&nbsp; And it must be returned it to its owners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, so, publications like the <em>Prospect</em> publication will always be longer on opinion than on evidence.&nbsp; It is enough, for now, that it bumps into most of the perspectives that Alice-in-Sunderland needs to probe when she's navigating her journey through that complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub">the narrative</p>
<p>A journey is a narrative.&nbsp; Narratives assemble facts, pretensions and perspectives into sequences.&nbsp; They speak of one thing leading to another.&nbsp; And so a sequence has opening scenes, leading to turning points and towards closures. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" rel="nofollow">Narrative</a> is our species' most-used way of making sense of experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Career narratives are populated by acquaintances, are set in locations and express interpersonal exchanges.&nbsp; But there are also meta-narratives - backstories with enough breadth to speak of national participation, in global settings, and telling of long-term causes and consequences. &nbsp;Meta-narratives stand back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Few better understand the learning usefulness of narrative than educators. &nbsp;I'd urge every education outfit to work on its meta-narrative.&nbsp; The sequence tells all. &nbsp;Here's one...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="denthead">an education meta-narrative</p>
<p class="denthead">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unfettered growth driven by accelerating technology damages lives in ways ranging from the personal to the planetary</p>
<p class="box">â¨</p>
<p class="box">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while on-line off-shoots of these technologies strengthen global commerce &amp; weaken national governments</p>
<p class="box">â¨</p>
<p class="box">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's true that commerce and its technologies can both help and hinder access to opportunity and the personal fulfillment it offers</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while on-line &amp; social life can persuade people that they are free of control and living according to how they make sense of things</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but these attitudes work out differently in different backgrounds enough to make neighbours strangers to each other</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so group &amp; family allegiances fragment society so that what is favourable to some is unfavourable to others</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and that shapes aspiration differently in different settings so that what is welcomed by some is rejected by others</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but nothing is inevitable because all of this comes with people's consent and withdrawn consent changes everything</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A meta-narrative does for an organisation what a narrative does for a student - it sets out a reason to be.&nbsp; I'd say it's of more practical use to an education outfit than a mission statement, a vision, or a list of targets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So where do students figure in meta-analyses.&nbsp; A meta-analysis is not Alice's story, it's everybody's story. &nbsp;But it speaks of where she will make her sense of how things are.&nbsp; And she will do that by assembling the story of her part in it.&nbsp; What the meta-analysis is finding in her Sunderland is as much Alice's business as it is anybody's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Alice and her educators need to hear from each other on this.&nbsp; All education outfits have enough people and material to help her figure how her story and all the stories belong to each other. &nbsp;It's where she makes her claim on her membership of that society. &nbsp;It my even enable some families to take an interest in other people's children.&nbsp; Would that be an aspiration?</p>
<p class="box"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class="box">There's no disguising the complexity, contradiction and confusion in all of this - the term 'chaos' crops up.&nbsp; But the term is of no use to a sense-making processes embedded in shared and personal narratives. &nbsp;Indeed, seemingly chaotic complexity, contradiction and confusion are the stuff of that process - there is no useful learning that has not worked its way through that kind of questioning. &nbsp;Enabling such <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf" rel="nofollow">critical thinking</a> is what education is for - enabling Alice in her society to deal with what's going on, and not to be dealt with by others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A narrow-and-shallow search for simplicity ducks all this.&nbsp; It is also ducks surprise.&nbsp; And it is surprise that brings Alice to her turning points.&nbsp; All that is creative, reforming and progressive in learning comes from welcoming surprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there is shock, which is more than surprise.&nbsp; And, according to Roberto Mangabeira Unger, no surprise provokes more that is creative, reforming and progressive than shock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub">the shock</p>
<p>I suppose there are professionals so committed to public service-education that they believe they can count on government support - if not now, some time and forever.&nbsp; Defenders of careers work have believed that strong argument will bring government riding to its rescue.&nbsp; But hope that a neo-liberal government will forever defend public-services is turning out to be the latest scene in a sad saga of professionals being stood up by politicians.&nbsp; It must come as a shock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the more shocking because there is, world wide, no shortage of <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf" rel="nofollow">evidence on public service education (p.16)</a> making the professionals' case.&nbsp; Public-service education helps to maintain social stability.&nbsp; The more open and responsive its institutions the greater their value to society.&nbsp; The imposition of ready-made ideas for structure, curriculum and method narrows perspectives and causes able people reluctantly to give up on public services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are profits to be made from what most people think of as public services.&nbsp; And, world-wide, national governments are not resisting privatising interests moving in on public-service institutions.&nbsp; The career-coaching industry is taking over from public-service careers work.&nbsp; In the UK education front-benchers are openly urging infusing fee-paying practices into public-service education.&nbsp; And compliant educators are taking the bait.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not always clear whether government cannot resist global economic pressures, or whether it just won't.&nbsp; Either way we are entitled wonder whether the curriculum, which is community property, is safe in any government's hands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this shocking enough to provoke &lsquo;the imagination of new possibilities'?&nbsp; And what possibilities could there be for finding more reliable support? &nbsp;The Royal Society of Arts has a long-standing interest in education reform.&nbsp; And it is now coming up with seriously radical proposals.&nbsp; They are that city governments are better placed than national governments to offer reliable support to education.&nbsp; Is it possible that Sunderland can do more than Westminster for Alice and her journey?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She may see the point.&nbsp; National governments are too big to really understand local damage, and too small to resist global trends.&nbsp; Would educators ever agree that a city can be more alert to that reality, and more agile in that response?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub">the city</p>
<p>The RSA is looking for what it calls <a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal" rel="nofollow">The Power of Cities</a> (journal #3).&nbsp; Its argument starts from the fact that around half the world&rsquo;s population lives in metropolitan areas.&nbsp; The numbers are increasing &ndash; Alice&rsquo;s Sunderland is among them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cities people learn to live with other people - all kinds of other people.&nbsp; City dwellers are visible to each other - less likely to be strangers.&nbsp; Cities each have their own account of how things are changing.&nbsp; People can grasp what&rsquo;s going on well enough to suggest realistic responses.&nbsp; And a city can readily canvass more than one way of responding to those voices.&nbsp; All of this is why RSA-chief Matthew Taylor (p.5) recognises cities as a promising new setting for reforming education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not flaky thinking.&nbsp; Political scientists (pp.20ff) find four kinds of gain.&nbsp; Cities have (1) a wide-enough range of sources to draw on, (2) a great-enough range of ideas to engage with, (3) a willingness to let go of what no longer works, and (4) an ability to make sense of what is up-close but fragmented experience.&nbsp; Cities thrive on each their own version of these complexities, potentialities, priorities, and personal-but-shared sense-making.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf" rel="nofollow">evidence on reform (pp. 21-25)</a> includes accounts of how, in cities, centralised uniformity is replaced by creative and reforming progression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is bigger than local government.&nbsp; Every city has a hinterland of neighbourhoods, suburbs, outlying villages and settlements.&nbsp; As populations migrate towards cities few out-lying locations are left out of urban reach.&nbsp; Most cities can develop networks of local and scattered stakeholder groups, each identifying needs, proposing action and receiving support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The independence of cities can be sustained by their freedom to look outside of central government for funding.&nbsp; Economists (pp.10ff) have tracked city use of alternative funding from charitable agencies, which make grants with no arbitrary strings attached.&nbsp; Some business-world voices (pp.32ff) welcome this trend as independent of commerce and state and fostering change which is both owned by communities and developed on a human scale.&nbsp; This is civil society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSA reports positive results.&nbsp; Cities move quickly into locally-relevant crime-control measures, traffic-management schemes and health-and-safety programmes.&nbsp; They develop rapid responses on climate change.&nbsp; They are well placed to undermine international trafficking of both people and of drugs.&nbsp; And short lines of communication get rapid responses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any policy sphere needed this kind of grasp and flexibility it is policy for education.&nbsp; Metropolitan smarts hold out hope of replacing national politicking and outflanking global power.&nbsp; But Matthew Taylor advises patience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is right - this is a long-term trend and vulnerable to capture by market players.&nbsp; There are <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/03/british-developers-new-york-manhattan" rel="nofollow">city governments already in the hands of commercial interests</a>.&nbsp; But there are also <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/aug/03/rochdale-economic-recovery-challenge-hi-tech" rel="nofollow">cities whose best hope is to take control of their own future</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSA&rsquo;s proposals succeed if they liberate education reform from both global and central control.&nbsp; And that would require the consent and support of educators - well, maybe all educators is too much to hope for, but the consent and support of enough educators.&nbsp; You?&nbsp; You'd need to be shocked enough?</p>

<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">Before you make your move understand that I am not impartial about this.&nbsp; Is anybody?&nbsp; Better to declare the favouring of critical enlightenment above arbitrary power.&nbsp; That may not be impartial but neither is it arbitrary.&nbsp; It opposes regimes, the world over, which control populations with ready-made beliefs, which drive disapproving wedges between the accepted and the excluded, which use the resulting conflicts as opportunities for take-over, which put the biosphere at risk, and which demand their positions are transmitted by education - dismissing the rest as irrelevant or controlling.</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">And there are no clearly identifiable opposing protagonists and antagonists here.&nbsp; What we are facing is a criss-cross of causes and effects driven by conflicting interests and shifting alliances. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">And it is not to say that, in the midst of all this, an enlightenment-driven politics has made no mistakes or committed no transgressions.&nbsp; But it is to say that there is hope in learning from both.&nbsp; You find out most about how your car works when it breaks down.</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">The issue is imperative, because the criss-cross of global change is not cyclic.&nbsp; There's will be no recovery to restore a temporarily lost normality.&nbsp; What we are facing has been characterised as <a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/blogs/jonathan-derbyshire/crisis-without-end-a-conversation-with-andrew-gamble" rel="nofollow">crises without end</a> - because it's hard to see how they will be resolved. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">Educators must be involved because the crisis is anti-educational.&nbsp; So what are they dealing with?...</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; politicos - what are politicians trying to do and why?</p>
<p>educators need to find the other-than self-interested</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; motives - are we entirely fair to politicians?</p>
<p>they need to scan political narrative for episodes revealing authentic voices</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tests - how do we know what is fact, pretense, or authentic?</p>
<p>they'll find talk of raising aspirations a particularly telling test of authenticity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perspectives - in such complexity can we find a political focus?</p>
<p>they see curriculum as community property not government's or commerce's</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; narrative - what are the stories and what is there meaning?</p>
<p class="box">they develop their locality's backstory so that their students can extend it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shock - why would educators sieze on what is shocking?</p>
<p>they join students in moving from shock to the imagination of new possibilities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; city - what do cities have that nations lack and reform needs?</p>
<p class="box">they work with cities on complex, potential, prioritised sense-making</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">That reform can be implemented with or without government support.&nbsp; And there different national histories of monarchy have shaped different attitudes to centralisation.&nbsp; Some can see central government as protector.&nbsp; The Anglo-American history of monarchy has provoked distrust of government.</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">This call for reforming research-and-development on education calls for more than educators' abilities, it needs their time and their courage.&nbsp; Because nothing is inevitable - not for governments and cities and not for for reactionaries and progressives.&nbsp; However, in all political systems, the withdrawal of consent changes everything.</p>
<p class="box">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="box">I find it hard to think a more important social policy reform.&nbsp; And there is no outfit better placed to take it on than educators.&nbsp; But what part can the likes of Alice in Sunderland have in this reform, if her educators take no part at all?</p>
