        <p>Bill Law<br />The Career-learning Caf&eacute;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dynamics<br /></strong>There's a lot of referendum talk to take on board before the deadline - but the talk won't stop then.&nbsp; And the consequences are as much for work-life as for any aspect of our shared experience. &nbsp;But a person can get tired of the back-and-forth tussle in defence of economy and the threat of migration.&nbsp; I say that the performance on economy is a pantomime and the tussle on migration a smokescreen.</p>
<p>The complexities of migration can be made to conjure images which divert attention from hidden interest.&nbsp; The perpetrators grab attention by claiming to be heroic defenders of our borders.&nbsp; The hidden issue is about how wheel-and-deal commerce is to be unhampered - liberated from 'red tape'?&nbsp; It's bait-and-switch - damaging the interests that it claims to defend. &nbsp;That damage is to our workers, our women and our poor.&nbsp; And those interests have been well served by the EU.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>questions<br /></strong>Some questions are answered with facts, some with opinions and all to target votes.&nbsp; The answers equip the electorate to shape and reshape how things come out.&nbsp; We get the Members of European Parliament that we elect; so it's a matter of trust.&nbsp; We can wonder whether that trust should go to Westminster's winners - but it needn't, it can go to the MEP's we've got... and the one's we can elect?&nbsp; Some politicos see Westminster as the greasy-pole, beckoning the politically ambitious.&nbsp; And it seems that the 'heroic' politicos tried, as MEPs, to get what they wanted from the EU, but failed.&nbsp; There are other future possibilities: Brussels can be a location for reform - flawed but adaptable.&nbsp; Indeed the EU may be the only platform which can support large-scale reform.</p>
<p>And there are bigger questions. &nbsp;They need to deal with climate change, with global conflicts of interest, and with the digital transmission of threats - now and in the future. &nbsp;The increasing economic strength of the eastern hemisphere is a factor - we need to know what is our nation's record in dealing with that leverage.&nbsp; We need also to find the scientific, historical and cultural bases for framing useful answers.&nbsp; Can we believe that all this can depend on the brits alone, or must it depend on off-shore Britain working with continental Europe? &nbsp;After all, each has been the making of the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>processes<br /></strong>This kind of complexity does not easily feed into any fact-opinion-vote conversation.&nbsp; Television is good at highlighting juicy drama and soap-opera, both of them loaded with 'he-said-but-she-did-and-they-do clutter.&nbsp; Newspapers must look good to their subscribers and sometimes to their owners.&nbsp; Expert think-tank's science discovers enough to confuse; it being full of probabilities, contingencies and hypothesis - hard to hold in sustained concentration.&nbsp; Some politicos make that tough job tougher by accusing experts of being agents of an aloof &eacute;lite.&nbsp; And, on the fringes of all this, there is a politics which can't buy attention, and only gets noticed when there is an argument, a contradiction, a drama - or a tragedy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can't know what it's like to quit the EU - nobody's done it.&nbsp; But there is living memory of what it's like to be excluded.&nbsp; The 1970s saw the UK as the 'sick man of Europe'.&nbsp; Actually we were good at invention and design; but much was lost by poor external marketing, weak infrastructural investment and bad work-life relationships.&nbsp; Ironically an earlier UK government had designed a post-war German system for the joint management of production; and it has worn well.&nbsp; And it's true that some brits flourished - a smirking self-congratulation claimed 'the harder I work the luckier I get'. &nbsp;But luck was not like that for a marginalised, neglected and angry workforce.&nbsp; Only their neighbours and their trade unions understood how hard work guarantees nothing.&nbsp; So what brits designed for themselves was a disjointed management of divided system; and their offspring are still around. &nbsp;And trade unions are still said to be the causes of failure.&nbsp; It was entry into the European Economic Community that moved things foward, by establishing and maintaining working rights, and in ways which need not damage productivity. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>futures<br /></strong>In sifting for facts, opinions and votes we're all engaged in figuring who is manoeuvring, what is camouflage, and is there deceit.&nbsp; It clears the decks for finding what facts, opinions and votes are in touch, who is authentic and what must not be neglected.&nbsp; Good thinking, gathered from real-life experience, gets lost in manoeuvring, camouflage and deceit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's doubly and trebly hard to know what consequences any of this will bring.&nbsp; But those consequences are less for you and me than they are for our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. &nbsp;So the referendum will not end the debate.&nbsp; And, that in mind, there will be consequence which protagonists on all sides are overlooking.&nbsp; Predictions made before the event will, sooner or later, be greeted by observations made after the event - people will see for themselves. &nbsp;Where promises are not realised credibility will be lost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, in the UK and in the EU, who will get heard, how much of that will be fact, will anybody be in a position to recognise what is opinion and spin, will electorates notice when significant information is suppressed or distorted, and what will any outfit be in a position usefully to do? &nbsp;&nbsp;And the Future for Europe will continue to change.</p>
