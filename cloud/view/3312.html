                   <p>Susan Patrick: Question for everybody - how many of you have worked with Federal/State Advocacy in last 12/6/3 months. [Quite a few people in the audience are working in this way now.] One person can make a difference! But many different views of what OER exist and that reduces the impact overall. Move fromr "free" to transforming education.</p>
<p>Three points about OER: "Learning materials, unobstructed access, shared access and collaboration". Get across unobstructed licence. And the way in which this needs to be a commitment when public funding involved.</p>
<p>Uncomfortable about sharing and adapting in K-12 (not so much in Higher Education.</p>
<p>Unique, unprecedented and *short* opportunity to get message across. OER google group to bring together advocacy - focus on K-12 and common content. Move to learning beyond textbooks.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Reg Leichty: works with governement. Need to use data more effectively to improve student. How can we improve the lowest performing schools. Develop common core of state standards.</p>
<p>"Race to the Top" money to support states that are prepared to innovate in these areas. Include the commitment to be open as part of application. Need to be creative.</p>
<p>Revising K-12 through "No child left behind" act. Need to see how OER investment feeds in.</p>
<p>"America competes" act to improve STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). Not funded but ideas are influencing other actions.</p>
<p>Dire financial situation - but OER makes particular sense in this case.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hal: - what are we not doing?</p>
<p>Dysfunctional approach to learning materials is a big business that is heavily entrenched. Includes an alliance between textbook publishers and Democratic Party - built on academic freedoms but can limit options.</p>
<p>Opportuniities also from Jim Shelton - Innovation in Education fund. So OER not just isolated can be seen as part of many other things. Including Fund for Iprovement of Post Secondary Education.</p>
<p>Identifies himself as a "turtle on a fence post" - i.e. didn't get here by himself.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Linda Wallinger - Virgnia Dept. of Education. Only three K-12 teachers in the room. Need to involve teachers. Now facing parents that have encouraged children to use online resoures - but not having it recognised in anyway. Need to link to end of course assessments - mandated by "no child left behind" - leads to high stake exams.</p>
<p>Legislation being passed to encourage open approaches to K-12. Board to review this (1 of whom is a K-12 educator). Also legislating for a virtual schools system. Hard for schools to judge quality of online provision from the many providers across the globe. Putting in place approval processes.</p>

                   <p>JIm Fruchterman - Route66 literature trying to make a sustainable approach to helping teenager reading. And Bookshare providing shared scanning of books for those who have problems accessing content - e.g. text-to-speech. Raises issues of piracy - but legislation allows making accessible versions of copyright materials. Bookshare breakthrough was to win a $32m competition to give students access - now serving &gt;90,000 students and hope to reach 200,000. Looking at making fulling accessible K-12 textbooks. Working on image accessibility. Working with Flatworld Knowledge to make them accessible. New R&amp;D Centre with WGBH Boston to look at conversion.</p>
<p>Problem is that OER are not standardised - need to pay more attention to the publishers approach.</p>        </div>

                   <p>DAve Zook - need to distill messages and develop a communication plan. Three key themes from consulting with stakeholders and legislators.</p>
<p>1. Important to focus on outcomes that OER provides</p>
<p>2. Be negative about the current system - know hte problem</p>
<p>3. Position OER as a solution - in concrete and discrete ways</p>
<p>Access is a particularly good argument to make - access to better outcomes matched to community needs. Message is "Learning beyond textbooks" that transforms. Orient discussion towards the future. Leading with K-12 but also addressing Higher Education. Will establish "Learning beyond textbooks" as a brand to promote.</p>
<p>Need - evidence! For messaging need better examples - experience within States and law. One or two critical examples may well be influential. Backed up with hard core evidence. Evidence driven advocacy needs supporting data!</p>
<p>Need to operate on the same page - with a coherent message.</p>        </div>
