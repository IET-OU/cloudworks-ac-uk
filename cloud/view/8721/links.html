        <p>Healthy Eating</p>
<p>4Ts model v E-design model</p>
<p>4Ts</p>
<p>I found this model highly readable. Although diagrammatic I found it rather linear still with the various columns and this appeals to me &ndash; I found it instantly decipherable. I feel that this links well with the approach which I currently take to my session design. In the same way that I currently keep my lesson plan to hand during a session, I could see that this could be a useful additional document to have available during the delivery of a session to keep things on track. I found this contained most aspects which are needed to be captured in a standard session such as I deliver on my module eg content, timings, resources etc&hellip; I did find it rather tutor-led and I am keen to move away from this to more student-centred learning.</p>
<p>E-design</p>
<p>I also found this perfectly readable with its simple, tabular and linear layout. This I found to have limitations in terms of some of the detail which I would expect to see in a session design document and it is not the sort of document I could see myself relying on during an actual session as I could a traditional lesson plan or 4Ts document. However I can see a real benefit in spending time completing something like this in advance of the session, at the planning stage, to focus my mind on proper scaffolding and moving learners through activities to become more independent learners. &nbsp;I could see me using something like this in conjunction with the 4Ts model. It may be that there is more suited to scheme of work considerations rather than individual session matters as some of the development from phase 1 to phase 4 could take some time and more time than you have in an individual session, as is perhaps indicated by the transition in the example document from phase 1 to phase 2 only.</p>
<p>Consider these representations from the perspective of the learning design you documented in Activity 1b.</p>
<p>1.Are they adequate for expressing your design?</p>
<p>I could see benefit in using both of the above design models for expressing my design. The 4Ts model could be used, for example, to show the actual proposed delivery of the session, substituting technology for resources more generally in my chosen example. The e-design model could be used to show the development of the learner from directed to self-directed and in this respect I would make changes to my chosen activity in that I would incorporate at the outset a tutor-led element, a scaffolded exercise whereby I highlight on the whiteboard or projector screen an example of a poorly referenced section in the essay extracts and demonstrate how to reference this appropriately before starting the students on the exercise whereby they need to undertake this task for themselves.</p>
<p>2.What would be the benefits of using these representations for your design? Please explain your views.</p>
<p>The benefits of using the 4Ts model would be similar to the benefits of using a traditional lesson plan in that I could ensure appropriate timings and I could ensure things such as appropriate resources selected for the activity. The benefits of using the e-design model would be to focus my mind on ensuring that the learner is moved from directed to self-directed learner through the completion of the various tasks.</p>    </div>
