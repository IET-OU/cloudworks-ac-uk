<p class="c0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c2">Actors: (who is involved?) Margaret, 35 year old&nbsp;single parent with two children aged 15 and and 11, working part-time as a receptionist in a local community centre but also reliant on benefits.</p>
<p class="c0">&nbsp;Goals: (why?) Margaret has always regretted that she did not do better at school. She left at 16 to work in a shop.&nbsp;Adult educators&nbsp;want to encourage adult learners like Margaret to return to learning. The&nbsp;funders (probably government or lottery)&nbsp;want to get more people back into work with skills in order to reduce dependency on benefits.</p>
<p class="c0">&nbsp;Settings: (where &amp; when?) Most of the action happens in Margaret's home and at the community centre which is used by adult education providers to offer classes.</p>
<p class="c0">&nbsp;Objects: (what things are involved?) Smart&nbsp;phone, children's&nbsp;laptop</p>
<p class="c0">&nbsp;Actions:&nbsp; (what do actors do?)&nbsp;Margaret notices a poster in the community centre advertising a free online course from the local adult education provider for people who want to return to learning after a break. It says you don't need any qualifications to joing in and only access to a smart phone and/or a laptop for a few hours a week.</p>
<p class="c0">&nbsp;Events: (what happens to actors?)&nbsp;Margaret signs up for the course which&nbsp;starts with her posting a message in a forum introducing herself to the other students. She is helped with e-mails from her tutor.</p>
<p class="c0">&nbsp;Results: (what is achieved?) Jane slowly gets involved with the course and gets a certificate to show her success. She gained in self-confidence and esteem so that when the tutor recommended to continue on another online course she quickly agreed.</p>
<p class="c0">&nbsp;our design: (what role does your design play?)&nbsp;The design supported Margaret to overcome her doubts and build confidence and study skills.</p>
<p class="c0">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="c0">&nbsp;2) Develop a narrative scenario/s</p>
<p class="c2">Introduce actors and goals, describe the settings, put the events in order...</p>
<hr />
<p class="c0">&nbsp;Margaret notices a poster advertising an online course to help people return to learning. There is a website mentioned for further information so she visits it and it interests her but she has doubts she caould cope. She talks to people in the community centre and her daughters who offer to help witht he computer aspects. Margaret enrols on the website and recieves an e-mail message welcoming her and giving her details of when the course will start.</p>
<p class="c0">A week or two later she gets an e-mail telling her that the course is starting and that her tutor is Linda who will contact her. Linda sends a friendly message explaining her role and what she needs to do first - introduce herself. Linda provides examples and encourages her to have a go. Margaret posts her introduction.</p>
<p class="c0">Margaret notices that many of the other students are like her - nervous and left school at 16 without any qualifications. The first task is to read a document and write a short piece giving her views which she posts on the forum so that they can all discuss it.</p>
<p class="c0">She is then asked to work with some of the others to learn about how government spend&nbsp;the taxes they collect and to jointly produce a list of key points that everyone should know before they vote in the next election. This is quite difficult and not everyone contributes but Linda, the tutor keeps helping with suggestions until they succeed. Each group share their work and Margaret is plaesed to relaise that her work is as good if not better than the others.</p>
<p class="c0">Margaret is keen to try the next activity.</p>
<p class="c0">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="c0">&nbsp;3) Scrutinize your scenario &amp; revise as necessary</p>
<p class="c2">I am&nbsp;claiming that:</p>
<p class="c2">1. That a learner with limited self-confidence will participate with only e-mail support</p>
<p class="c2">2. That learners will be able to discuss in a forum for the first time</p>
<p class="c2">3. That learners will be able to take part in a group activity early in the course</p>
<p class="c2">4. A simple group activity will motivate learners to join in&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c2">I suspect that I am under-estimating the challenge to motivate returning learners to participate. The nature of the activities will be vital to motivate the learners - not too simple or too challenging and interesting to the group.</p>
<p class="c2">The&nbsp;design will support and motivate learners while not assuming IT or study skills. It will asist them to develop IT and study skills.</p>
<p class="c2">The important features of context in our scenario are:</p>
<p class="c2">1. Returning to learning after a long interval</p>
<p class="c2">2. Limited self-confidence and self-esteem</p>
<p class="c2">3. Limited IT skills but possible support from children</p>
<p class="c2">4. Need for support at all stages</p>
<p class="c0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c0">&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p class="c0">&nbsp;4) Invite others to comment on your scenarios</p>
<p class="c2">Please feel free to comment on the scenario</p>

			<p>Another student..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actor: Ram is a 55 year old married man with no children.</p>
<p>Goals: Ram saw the advert when visiting the local library. &nbsp;&nbsp;He had no qualifications and few IT skills.&nbsp; So far, he&rsquo;s had manual work in a variety of factories but was recently laid off.&nbsp; Factory jobs were getting hard to come by and in any case, his health meant he could no longer hack the manual labour.&nbsp; Office jobs always seem to ask for computer skills. He thought this course would be a good way to start to learn IT skills but he was scared as his written English was not that good, he could get along fine talking to people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Objects: He did have a smartphone although he didn&rsquo;t know how to use all the functions &ndash; he&rsquo;d bought it off a friend because he loved gadgets.&nbsp; His friend helped him set it up and showed him a few things. He could now use it to call and was finding his way round sending emails and texts.&nbsp; He thought his friend might be able to get him a cheap laptop &ndash; it would have to be cheap as he didn&rsquo;t have that much spare cash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Events: He talked to the librarian about the course who encouraged him to join up and said he could use the computers at the library.&nbsp; The librarian spent a long time helping him sign up and contact the tutor.</p>
<p>He went back to the library when the tutor, Linda, emailed him because he didn&rsquo;t understand the forum thing.&nbsp; The librarian showed him how to use the forum, then left him to it for a while.&nbsp; It took him a long time to write the message about himself that he felt happy with and finally post it. It was only a couple of sentences and although he was pleased with himself, &nbsp;it exhausted him.&nbsp; He thought he might quit but Linda emailed him again, thanking him for his posting and welcoming him to the course again so he didn&rsquo;t want to let her down.&nbsp; In any case, he felt he was being a bit of wimp and told himself to get a grip.</p>
<p>However, the next task really threw him.&nbsp; Read a document and add his views to the forum &ndash; how long was that going to take him!&nbsp; And he couldn&rsquo;t keep asking the librarian. Linda was trying to be very helpful though he felt pressurised under the constant stream of emails saying he needed to get the task done by the following week.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d managed to read the document and had a few thoughts but wasn&rsquo;t confident to post them for others to read.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
