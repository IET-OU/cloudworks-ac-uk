        <p><strong>Design Narrative.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title: </strong><strong>&nbsp;<em>Grade Six Presentation</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>I was asked to do a presentation to Grade Six students from several primary schools. This was a unique situation, since the schools were in different islands of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). This request came from the branch of Eastern Caribbean Bank (ECCB) in Grenada.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>The classes from the various schools were adopted by the branches of the bank in each of those islands, to provide support for their learning needs outside of the classroom. The aim was to motivate the students while enhancing their learning. The branch of the Eastern Caribbean Bank which is located in St. Georges Grenada was responsible for facilitating my presentation. The medium to be used was video conferencing technology. The theme for my presentation was &ldquo;Emerging careers within the Caribbean based on trends in technology&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This was going to be my first opportunity to use this type of technology to share and facilitate a discussion for learning. I had done many presentations island wide to students. However, those presentations related to available scholarships and career planning, which was within my responsibility as a Human Resource Development professional. They also were specifically for students who were planning to study at the tertiary level, since it was my main area of job focus.</p>
<p>This presentation was different. It involved younger students in a setting which was different than I was used to. Additionally, my presentation was one of several which was supposed to take place on the day, capping of all the other presentations. This was a learning opportunity for the students and also a great learning opportunity for me, since I had not experiences the use of this type of technology outside of participating in Skype meetings.</p>
<p>The location for my presentation was the large boardroom of the bank. The thirty plus students were going to be seated there. The setting was going to be similar for the other six islands.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>My aim was to provide and facilitate a discussion of the varying careers in order to allow the students to engage in further discussion. It was also to engage them in looking beyond the present careers and to demonstrate that even though some of the same careers we have today may exist, that they would have morphed into something different based on the use of technology.</p>
<p>In order for this to happen, the presentation was to be interactive as possible, since all classes were expected to participate during the discussions.</p>
<p>The questions that I wanted to answer at the end of the presentation in order to gauge success was first, did they participate through questions or contributions?&nbsp; Second, did they engage by asking follow-up questions? Third, were my examples clear and useful?&nbsp; Fourth, how comfortable were the students in discussing with me through the use of this medium.</p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>In preparing for this presentation, I engaged in further research which was outside of the normal research for my previous presentations. My research was focused not solely on the material to be discussed, since I had a lot of material which was relevant and which could be used, but more so on delivery, since I was dealing with an audience, which I was not familiar with.&nbsp; First, I had a discussion with a grade six teacher as a resource person. Then, I started putting my material together. This included pictures which demonstrated the various careers which I had targeted. These were chosen to create the greatest contrast in order to peak their interest and curiosity. Finally, I finally prepared the PowerPoint slides for my presentation.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>I was now sufficiently armed. Laptop in hand I went to the branch, ready at the appointed time to deliver the presentation. Only to realize, that the other presenters had gone way above their time limits. I now had to wait. The students were becoming restless and it was now approaching their normal lunch /break period.</p>
<p>I sat through two presentations before the students went off to lunch, observing their behavior as it related to the technology and its use. I was learning some dos and don&rsquo;ts in the process. I then began to modify my PowerPoint presentation, changing some of the text and eliminating some of the slides and was now even more equipped to deliver to those students after they had finished their lunch.</p>
<p>The outcome was as expected. Most of the students were engaged. By this point, they were past the stage of being curios about the technology, since it was also new to them. I was also very comfortable with the use of the technology. This was because I had the opportunity to learn informally about the technology while waiting, and was able to modify the design of my presentation, due to that opportunity. The question and answer period after the presentation was the most telling. Many questions were asked during the discussion. The split screens made it possible for all the students to see each other and to see me. I was able to ask questions and receive answers in real time from students from the six different countries. It also demonstrated to the students in a true practical sense how technology can transform a career such as teaching.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>It was a great experience for me. It demonstrated the importance of having a deeper appreciation of technology in as a tool for learning. It brought to the fore even more, that teachers and individual should attain to a certain expertise in the understanding the use of technology for delivery of learning, in order to be effective. I had an advantage, which some of those who presented before me probably did not. I had the benefit of learning from observing and therefore adapted the design of my presentation based upon what I observed. Had I been the first presenter I would have been in their situation and not be in tune with the new medium. Without this benefit, the degree of success might have been compromised.</p>    </div>
