        <p>As one of the hottest Information Technology trends around, numerous companies have now embarked on the idea of using Big Data (BD) system in collating and managing their corporate files and operational archives. Not to be confused with the Cloud Data, Big Data is characterized as a proxy or server that contains a massive volume of both organized and unorganized large file that are difficult to process using small scale software systems and traditional databases. They can be derived from almost every source available to human - web, social media, mobile data, sales, customer contact center, and even hard copies of archived files. Although large in capacity, BD also poses problems when applied in an organization. For this entry, we&rsquo;ll enumerate the possible issues that businesses commonly encounter and ways on how to approach them effectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Problem Associated With File Centralizing <br /></strong></p>
<p>So your company will collect various information -- from web sources, old paper-based records, mobile activities, social popularity, and online backup systems --then, what&rsquo;s next? Your initial problem would be the classification of the collated BD.It&rsquo;s not like using the antiquated spreadsheets and logbooks that you can easily collate and arrange on a physical cabinet. With BD, we are talking about a very large virtual cabinet filled with digital files ranging from 1 petabyte (1024 terabyte) to even thousands of petabytes. According to <a href="http://spotfire.tibco.com/blog/?p=10941" rel="nofollow">Spotfire</a>, the most comprehensive approach is by using &ldquo;the right analytics tools [that] can definitely help streamline and make sense of all these data and a well-conceived strategy for collating data sources.&rdquo; Luckily, there are multiple IT firms out there that are specialized in this kind of service.</p>
<p>Big companies like Apple have its own comprehensive strategy in approaching BD.&nbsp; The Cupertino camp collate users&rsquo; data through the iCloud system. As highlighted on the&nbsp; iPhone 5C on O2 page, it serves as an online backup for &ldquo;music, photos, calendars, contacts, documents and more;&rdquo; which are all stored in the company&rsquo;s central server. Imagine how many Apple users are there on the planet that backs up their iDevice and Mac contents into the iCloud?The company&rsquo;s BD isn&rsquo;t difficult to handle because they&rsquo;ve embarked on using a system that centralizes all these files, providing web and mobile applications for easier file management and retrieval. </p>
<p><strong>Variety of Data Creates System Instability <br /></strong></p>
<p>In the past, we defined data as those that can store and relate file tables of rows and columns. Since BD is digitized, its variety &ldquo;ignores those boundaries, and is instead full of both structured and unstructured data,&rdquo; wrote <a href="http://www.wired.com/insights/2013/08/three-enormous-problems-big-data-tech-solves/" rel="nofollow">Wired</a>. This is arguably a big dilemma because files may end up in formats and places that are unreachable and unreadable by older systems. Yes, it won&rsquo;t be deleted permanently, but managing the data can be challenging and may require additional manpower such as Data Scientists and IT specialists. </p>
<p><strong>It Brings Privacy Concerns And Internal Confusions <br /></strong></p>
<p>Privacy is one of the major issues associated with BD. Yes, it helps enterprises work as one functional unit with one central filing system to access and work on. But, your corporate files could freely flow into the hands of everyone in the organization. Unless you secure its perimeter (restricting access to authorized individuals), there can be a possible file leakage in your company. </p>
<p>It can also lead to numerous internal confusions. Since you will probably entrust them to your IT department or an outside IT service providers, &ldquo;the data generated by the functional area ends up being the property of that group,&rdquo; wrote <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/12/04/the-3-big-problems-in-big-data-hint-theyre-all-about-people/" rel="nofollow">Gurjeet Singh</a>, co-founder of Palo Alto-based big data analytics company Ayasdi in his Venture Beat post. For the executives and key people of the company, they&rsquo;ll end up not having a complete view of the data. The group, who controls the storage tower, will be even more power than anyone in the department. To avoid this incident, you and your service provider must have an agreement containing certain boundaries to be observed. </p>
