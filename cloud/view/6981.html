        <p><strong>Context: </strong>I work with university teachers who want to create online learning activities for their students (blended and distance learning etc). They are busy and don't want to become digital pedagogy experts, but do want to create effective online learning experiences for their students.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> How can we teach teachers about good learning design for online learning? What is the most effective way for teachers to learn so that they can quickly create, deliver and evaluate online learning?</p>
<p><strong>Proposal: </strong>Create a learning design for learning design. This might be a 'runable' tool, or a guidance template. It might be a series of learning activities, or it might be a tool to create learning designs for teachers based on their requirements</p>

<p>Would you be interested om teaming up?</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

                   <p>Hi Tracy,</p>
<p>Yes, looks like we are thinking of a similar thing! That's great! I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the MOOC stuff so far, so it's really nice to start making connections!</p>

                   <p>Hi Both</p>
<p>This is kind of what I was thinking about too. I haven't put my ideas up yet, just have a look first. I was aksed to contribute to one of the PG Cert modules here at Strathclyde - basically to led a 2 hour session on learning design, which tbh was pretty straightforward lecture.&nbsp; I came away thinking wouldn't it be great to have some kind of online coures (or even session ) to allow new teachers to get some more hands on/ pragmatic experience to sit alongside the more theorhetical readings supplied on the course. The assessment for this course is a traditional essay, so I also thought having a lesson plan from a tool like LAMS, or LDSE would be an really nice contribution and allow people to start exploring from theory to tools and their own practice.</p>
<p>Is there room in your team for another?</p>

                   <p>I deal with these challenges too. Is there a way for novices to learn from more experienced colleagues without actually getting the experienced to formally train the novices (which they don't want to do) ?&nbsp; May be peer advice and evaluation in a MOOC?

                   <p>Hi all</p>
<p><strong>"Context:&nbsp;</strong>I work with university teachers who want to create online learning activities for their students (blended and distance learning etc). They are busy and don't want to become digital pedagogy experts, but do want to create effective online learning experiences for their students."</p>
<p>That's very similar to my work situation. I'd like to keep an eye on this project and possibly get involved, if I may? I'd like to have a look at some other projects first but I have followed this cloud and look forward to developments with interest.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Helen,</p>
<p>I think we might be grappling with the same issues - the context and challenges you and other commenters/team mates have outlined sound very familiar! Here's my project proposal also:&nbsp;http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7009, in case it's of interest. See what you think..</p>
<p>If you are interested, would there be space on the team for another?</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Clare</p>

                   <p>Hi Helen,</p>
<p>This also sounds familiar from my work as a tutor on the OU&rsquo;s MAODE (MA in Online and Distance Education) modules where many students (as elearning professionals) grapple with these issues in their everyday work contexts eg. working with teachers to produce material for online or blended courses, sometimes producing material directly themselves.</p>
<p>Students come from a variety of work contexts eg. HE or elsewhere in Education, Training Departments in a wide variety of occupational areas, including the NHS; self-employed consultancy. There are also &lsquo;aspiring&rsquo; elearning professionals who are interested in working in elearning in the future but have limited current experience.</p>
<p>So, a broad field of interest and experience/competency and a general guide covering both practical and pedagogical aspects would be valuable, I think.</p>
<p>Am interested in keeping in touch with this project, at least, if that&rsquo;s OK?</p>

                   <p>Helen,</p>
<p>I am glad I'm not the only one trying to figure out the MOOC stuff! My institution is beginning two new online programs (in education and nursing). &nbsp;I need to be able to help them design their courses. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to team up also.</p>

                   <p>Perhaps start with creating a repository of activities for instructors to choose from.&nbsp; Ask the instructors what are their favorite face-to-face activities and looks to ways to convert to an online or virtual environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give tags to the activities so that they can easily be found (memorization, decision-making, problem solving, reverse engineering).&nbsp; Create an environment where insturctors can add information about how it was used or how they modfied it for thier own use.</p>        </div>

                   <p>I would be interested in doing something very similar, but for a slightly different audience...or perhaps one of two different audiences. 1) Middle and high school teachers &nbsp;2) Trainers of teachers. &nbsp;I am also very nterested in keeping up with your peoject... if that is okay... and exploring the possibility of somehow working together.</p>

                   If you  are going to create a design for learning design - the notation / representation issues raised in the Lacarna Declaration becomes a challenge. How are you going to talk about Learning Design? What metaphors do you use? Are the play / actor metaphors of IMS Learning Design the best ones to use - if you want to encourage 21st century skills, like creativity?         </div>

<p>There seem to be quite a number of people interested in this topic, myself included! (See my <a title="Deborah Arnold's projects for OLDSMOOC" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7226" target="_self" rel="nofollow">dream n&deg;2</a> in the dreambazaar). If the team gets too big, maybe there's scope for a number of parallel teams, as this is quite a transversal topic.</p>        </div>

                   Study  circle sounds good Juliana. I was wondering if anyone fancied trying out a google hangout either today or tomorrow night.

                   <p>Hi Sheila,</p>
<p>I would indeed be interested in trying a Google hangout - I'm feeling a &nbsp;bit unsure about next steps here so even bouncing around some ideas on how to proceed with the project would be most welcome!</p>
<p>Any other takers or suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

                   <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I can see some similarities with my idea here too. Ann - I can see parallels with what I have in my idea - http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7065. I think a Google Hangout Study Circle would good (not used myself, so would be good try it).</p>

                   Hi Helen, I'm a late starter (still holiday time in Oz) and this group resonates with me too. 

I work in academic development and conduct a fair bit of PD for teaching staff as well as helping out on a range of projects. The teachers I work with all complain of lack of time so certainly having some easy solutions for them would be most advantageous. 

Am I too late to join? I'm also looking at Tracey Johnson's group too which is similar and would like to learn from both groups. Cheers Pauline        </div>

<p>Ok how about 8pm tonight? (GMT) If you can give me your google account names I'll add you to my account and I'll start the hang out. I think there might be a limit on numbers - but will check think we can get up to 10.</p>

                   Hi Eveyone

I'm running a bit late but will do my best to get the hangout start in the next 15 mins.

Apologies but "stuff" just happened this afternoon/ evening

                   <p>No worries, Sheila, thanks, talk shortly.</p>
<p>Daniel, to answer your question, if everyone can't join in tonight, I think there should be some way to help people participate &amp; communicate (eg I'm pretty sure we will need to set up some sort of Project Team page on Cloudworks soon.) Hopefully there'll be enough space on the Hangout, though...</p>        </div>

                   <p>No problems Sheila. We could create a cloud on cloudworks for a study circle, as mentioned in the Week 1 tasks (after team up) - http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2451</p>
<p>Shall I create a cloud and put it under: http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2456. Just a name - 'Learning Development / Staff Development Study Circle' ? </p>        </div>

                   <p>Notes from Hangout 15 January 20:00 - 20:40</p>
<p>Present:&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/user/view/108" rel="nofollow">Sheila MacNeill</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/user/view/5681" rel="nofollow">Clare Gormley</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/user/view/1498" rel="nofollow">Helen Walmsley</a></p>
<p>We discussed the project proposal and all the ideas that had been contributed above - this seems a very popular idea, no doubt because there are a lot of learning designers on this course! To make the project manageable, we agreed to set very specific boundaries on our project so that it could be achieved in the time available!</p>
<p>Our plan, therefore, is to create a short online learning activity (30 mins) &nbsp;that engages university teachers (who are inexperienced in online teaching) in learning about online learning. Suggestions for specific topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using learning design toolkits (eg Compedium)</li>
<li>Introduction to models of learning and online learning</li>
<li>Introduction to online socialisation and, in particular, online icebreakers</li>
</ul>
<p>Our plan is to decide on one (or possibly 2) topics and then to create the learning designs.</p>
<p>There are 3 of us in the project at the moment, and there is probably room for 1-2 others. However, there are lots of other ideas for topics in this group, so perhaps a number of other project groups could set up similar projects on different topics? The learning designs could then be linked together.</p>

                   <p>Sheila, no worries re connection fail - the joys of technology, eh! Helen's done a great job of summarizing the discussion above.</p>
<p>Santanu, I'm wondering if it's a <strong>Team </strong>Cloudscape (rather than a <strong>Study Circle</strong>) that we need to create on CloudWorks first? (See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course/week-1/team-up" rel="nofollow">Team Up</a>)&nbsp;As far as I can gather, the Study Circle is more for the broader connections (eg geographical or institutional) we can choose to make. (But I could be wrong... I'm no expert on Cloudworks! And maybe it is a Study Circle you are interested in after all??).</p>

                   <p>Clare - yes,&nbsp; you are right, team up first - 3-5 people in a team and then the study circle is a collection of 2-3 teams of similar interest. As Helen says there's a number of us with similar interests - so we can be in the same study circle, but we'd have to split into teams first and post our project to the team up cloudscape.&nbsp;</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hello all</p>
<p>I'm a little confused by the difference between project team and/or study circle business and your comments above have helped clarify things. But more clarity would be welcome.</p>
<p>I haven't yet joined a study circle but would like to. As I said in the comments much earlier in this cloud, my job involves helping university lecturers to use learning technologies, so your project ["to create a short online learning activity (30 mins) &nbsp;that engages university teachers (who are inexperienced in online teaching) in learning about online learning"] looks interesting to me and is directly relevant to my daily work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've collected a team (well almost) to do a project on a rather different topic, however [<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2785" rel="nofollow">A collaborative 'gamified simulation' environment</a>] not directly related to yours.</p>
<p>My question is, if there is room, might I be able to join your study circle even though our projects probably don't overlap much? (unless, of course, you wanted to do an authentic simulation of what it's like to be a novice teacher having to teach online for the first time! :-) )&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there isn't room I won't be offended!</p>

                   <p>Hi Helen,</p>
<p>I've just dicovered your cloud and have yet to read all the comments others have made. Will try to find the time tomorrow. &nbsp;Your idea sounds very much like mine and also like something I am working on at Newman, though I have been describing it as Quality Assurance and thinking about Quality or Standards checklists. I hope to have time tomorrow to engage a little more with your , and your other followers', idea.</p>
<p>All the best,<br />Bob Ridge-Stearn.</p>        </div>

To hopefully clarify things a little, &nbsp;I've taken the liberty of setting up a Cloudscape for the "Learning Design for Learning Design (HE)" project team at&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2811" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2811</a></p>
<p>To keep numbers manageable and because many people will already have joined/set up other teams, I've based this particular team on those of us who joined (or expressed interest in joining) the Hangout on tues night. That brings us to 5 which I think is around the recommended number of participants. As suggested earlier, maybe some additional teams could be formed on related aspects of this topic (if this isn't happening already)?</p>
<p>Oli, to answer your question, you are very welcome to join in our Study Circle once I get my head around what that actually is:) Just trying to get the Team bit sorted first...</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Clare</p>

                   <p>Hi all</p>
<p>I and my team are interested in joining your wider study circle, if that would be OK.</p>
<p>Although not exactly LD about LD, we are designing a course about teaching in HE which includes much about designing for learning.</p>        </div>

                   Clare - the study circle is a groups of similar teams who can share ideas, I think. I would also like to join this 'study circle' with myself, my brain and I, a typically academic approach to learning design, even though I am not an academic :)!         </div>

                   <p>Thanks Clare for setting up the project cloudscape http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2811&nbsp;&nbsp;:) I've added a project team cloud so that those interested in joining the team can add themselves.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone could set up a wider 'study circle' cloud to link the related projects together?</p>        </div>
