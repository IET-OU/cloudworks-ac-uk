<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" rel="nofollow">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Critical issues are being raised for how people are enabled to manage their careers.&nbsp; Some of the most influential voices speak for the Network for Innovation in Careers Guidance and Counselling in Europe (NICE).&nbsp; How the issues are resolved will affect how your students are placed for claiming their rightful place in their societies. &nbsp;No mainstream educator can afford to ignore this.</p>
<p>These are critical times: global commerce is strengthening; politicians are besieged; neighbours become strangers to each other; growth has reached the limits of planetary safety; work-life is riven by opposing interests. &nbsp;Careers work inhabits a changing world, posing make-or-break issues for both careers work and education.</p>
<p>The issues are set out in a <a href="http://www.nice-network.eu/fileadmin/erasmus/inhalte/dokumente/NICE_Summit_Canterbury/NICE_Summit_Materials_Onlineversion.pdf" rel="nofollow">NICE Summit</a> held in Canterbury Christchurch University (NICE, 2014). &nbsp;Its forecasts are not downbeat: they list the strength, coverage and international membership of a movement focused on career guidance and counselling.&nbsp; NICE speaks of citizens, educators and employer as its stakeholders.&nbsp; An organisation's stakeholders are people whose lives are affected by what the organisation does.&nbsp; I'm arguing for a strengthening in the stakeholder position of mainstream educators ready to work on career-management thinking with their students, their families and their communities.</p>
<p>Viable partnerships rely on each understanding what the other can do.&nbsp; A couple of the summit's opening keynotes help.&nbsp; The first sets out a well-documented case for breadth of thinking on 'the story behind work'.&nbsp; The second autobiographically recounts events that shape a professional's informed understanding of career. &nbsp;They both call for wider and deeper career-management thinking.</p>
<p>I'm using the terms 'careers-work' and 'career-management'.&nbsp; The terms 'guidance', 'counselling', 'careers education' and 'guidance' may be more familiar.&nbsp; But they are unreliable: they overlap, shift in definition and are overtaken by new terms - such as 'career coaching'.&nbsp; The field needs more reliable, inclusive and flexible terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>careers-work is what professionals and others do to enable students and clients for what they need to do about working-life</li>
<li>career-management is the sense and use that students and clients are able to find in what careers work does</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot assume that what a career manager does will recognisably play out as careers work suggests.&nbsp; Different people facing the same facts attribute to them different meanings.&nbsp; And the argument here is that testable facts can inform, but it's experienced meaning that gives action its dynamic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So what meaning do NICE careers workers bring to NICE facts? &nbsp;A full-sized lecture theatre is filled with people ready with probing questions.&nbsp; This blog takes a close look at the answers.</p>
<p>It poses five questions...</p>
<ol>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">what can guidance claim?<br /><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">what roles does it consider?<br /><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">how does background culture figure?<br /><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">what thinking most influences its action?<br /><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">what future possibilities does any of this open up?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" align="center">_____________________________&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">CLAIMS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>NICE is a network organisation.&nbsp; It argues for Europe-wide competencies for guidance professionals. &nbsp;They are to be measurable, based on academic training, and drawing on inter-disciplinary thinking.&nbsp; That thinking is claimed to be distinct, unique and research-based.&nbsp; All are argued to be requirements for the protection of student well-being.&nbsp; The aim is, then, to link research, theory, practice and policy into a unified foundation for professional effectiveness.</p>
<p>There's room for a deeper and wider conversation - questions for an alert educator to pose...</p>
<ul>
<li>is it possible for careers-work thinking to be absolutely distinct? - Isn't much of it imported from economics, psychology and sociology? - and isn't some of that of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator" rel="nofollow">doubtful validit</a>y?</li>
<li>isn't it true that <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf" rel="nofollow">labour-market experience</a> is as much a problem as a solution? - what about the need to examine the markets for the way they damage life chances? - don't students need to be enabled to examine, probe and scrutinise them?</li>
<li>isn't it true that any commercial commitment to growth breeds both <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/03/food-shortages-everyones-responsibility" rel="nofollow">hope and fear</a>? - don't both need an understanding of its historical backstory? - and doesn't the breadth and depth of hope and fear range from the personal to the planetary?</li>
<li>surely a full account of research, theory, practice and policy needs students engaged in <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf" rel="nofollow">critical questioning</a>? - and isn't creativity also an unwillingness to settle for the way things are? - is commerce open enough to people's unwillingness to settle for the way labour markets are?</li>
<li>don't all stakeholders need to know <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/CPIpdfs/cafcpiz.pdf" rel="nofollow">whose interests are being served</a>? - does careers work know what alert educators learn from students and their family-and-neighbourhood communities? - and what if the volunteers and activists of civil society also claim a stake?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions depends on understandings rooted in the sciences, the humanities and probabilistic mathematics - which are all part of mainstream curriculum.&nbsp; And they raise issues which students also need to engage.&nbsp; They push aims beyond learning-for-assessment; they reach for learning which is useful in students' lives - learning-for-living. &nbsp;I know of no deeper or wider education.</p>
<p>So, what are the possibilities for a careers-work partnership with mainstream education?&nbsp; I don't think it matters what subjects educators bring to it.&nbsp; Whatever their discipline, nobody does better what a good teacher can do about finding a point for learning. &nbsp;And learning for effective career management moves beyond acquiring facts it reaches for future possibilities.&nbsp; And that means asking probing questions and checking the answers.&nbsp; And it moves on by figuring out what causes in people's lives bring about what effects.&nbsp; What in-touch educator wants no part of that?</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">ROLES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Over the hundred-or-so years of its development careers work has diversified.&nbsp; From time to time attention shifts on what careers workers do - their roles.&nbsp; The vocabulary shifts.&nbsp; Terms like, 'guidance', 'counselling' and 'coaching' are variously associated with the need for 'empathy' 'information' and 'advice'.&nbsp; Roles can be 'non-directive', 'student-centred', 'infused' or 'integrated' and located in an organisation which is 'public service', 'private enterprise' or 'civil society'.&nbsp; The pursuit of any of this may be towards 'employability', 'competitiveness', 'fairness', 'happiness', 'well-being' or 'fulfillment'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These are not lists of what can be clearly defined, they are features in the comings-and-goings of unfolding narratives.&nbsp; The sociology of careers work has imported features of such <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" rel="nofollow">narrative thinking</a> - the term 'role' is taken by sociology from the theatre. &nbsp;And, in both the theatre and sociology, a role need not be contained by any ready-made script.&nbsp; In sociology role speaks of an actor positioned for taking on a task arising from a relationship - it speaks of 'being here, getting on with this, together'.&nbsp; And, although sometimes scripted, a role can also be questioned. &nbsp;So in careers work we can think of roles as being ready-made and as being newly-made - <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafsor1.pdf" rel="nofollow">roles as assigned and achieved</a>.&nbsp; A changing world needs such critical creativity.</p>
<p>NICE has variously mapped 'types of career professionals'&nbsp;(NICE, 2014, pp. 19-20 and 27-29). &nbsp;I think this use of 'types' corresponds with what a sociologist calls 'roles'. &nbsp;The simplest analysis finds three broadly-distinguishable positions...&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>...careers advisers have a basic competence - with a 'level-6' grasp of theories and principles</li>
<li>...careers guidance counsellors have 'level-7' competence - able to work with the more complex, uncertain and multifaceted situations</li>
<li>...career experts have level-8 expertise - in addition to guidance and counselling skills this brings scholarship, integrity, autonomy and inventiveness to the work - it is held by service managers, high-order counsellors and researchers capable of grasping the complexity of the whole field</li>
</ol>
<p>NICE is right to point to the limitations of careers advisers. &nbsp;But I doubt that much of that can be attributed to 'level-6' qualifications. &nbsp;My own experience in education tells me that careers advisers, however able and committed, are limited by institutional mismanagement. &nbsp;The ways careers advisers are casually enlisted, marginally positioned and poorly resourced has doubly damaging effects.&nbsp; They limit what the overloaded can do, and they deter other teachers from getting involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three-fold role analysis is challenged from the summit-conference floor. &nbsp;A good many participants see the three positions as ordered hierarchically - and they don't like that. &nbsp;NICE will sort this out. &nbsp;But NICE can't sort out institutional mismanagement. &nbsp;And so it's unlikely that mainstream educators are dreaming of becoming careers advisers. &nbsp;But that does not mean they have nothing to say...</p>
<ul>
<li>educators make week-on-week relationships with students - not just in classrooms but in the yard, during excursions, at sports events - and over several years &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>every school or college has people that students trust - relationships with professionals and community contacts - ready to work with hopes and fears - about school and about life&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>somebody in a school and its network knows about families who get disconnected from education - the institution feels unfamiliar,&nbsp;remote, daunting - they need somebody to reach out</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking account of these roles needs analysis in more than one dimension.&nbsp; There's a lot to know - where are helpers best located? - how can they be usefully supported in getting on with things? - how does anybody know what help different students and which families need? &nbsp;The answers are as likely to come from up-close experience as from ready-made expertise - whether educator's or careers-worker's.&nbsp; And so, although a good many roles are assigned, this kind of work needs role creation - less waiting for an assignment more volunteering for something more. &nbsp;It works where there's open institutional management. &nbsp;And the role-achievement of staff, by both careers workers and educators, contributes to the making of that openness.</p>
<p>There's a lot for both sides to learn about why careers work and mainstream education need each other. &nbsp;Each needs to know what the other can offer.&nbsp; It requires two-way flexibly, because there's no ready-made way of heeding student- and stakeholder-voice.</p>
<p>It's true that lists and definitions have their attractions.&nbsp; They offer what looks like clarity and feels like solidity. &nbsp;But are careers-work roles best understood as features in ready-made structures, or as elements in steerable dynamics?&nbsp; Should a partnership be dropping a heavy anchor or navigating an energising flow?</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">CULTURE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Talk of what stakeholders need from careers work, and of the roles careers work develops, and of the institutional support those roles get - such talk will, sooner or later, mention culture.&nbsp; It comes up in the first NICE group session I attend. &nbsp;Somebody says that the proposals for reform must not leave out 'the cultural dimension'.&nbsp; She has quite a point: careers work's own thinking understands culturally-rooted <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf" rel="nofollow">community-interaction</a>&nbsp;to have added a sociological dimension to its psychology-based matching methods.</p>
<p>A culture reflects group assumptions.&nbsp; They convey the way group members tend to agree with each other about the way things are.&nbsp; Its conversations may bring up something about who or what is worth bothering with.&nbsp; And there may be talk of what work prospects there are for people like them.&nbsp; A culture is an assembling of such beliefs, values and expectations.&nbsp; It's rooted in the shared experience, memories and allegiances of the group - and so it is a social phenomenon (Bourdieu, 1991).&nbsp; Whether seen by others as 'posh' or 'common', a culture becomes what the group takes to be 'proper', 'cool', &nbsp;'normal' - or '<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/reallives/cafjoey.html" rel="nofollow">for the-likes-of-us</a>'.&nbsp; Cultures can inspire, encourage and carry people to doing great things.&nbsp; But, 'posh' or 'common', they can lead bright people into doing something silly, and good people into something bad. &nbsp;The curriculum has examples. &nbsp;So does the daily news. &nbsp;So does the schoolyard.</p>
<p>Cultures are nurtured in both communities and institutions.&nbsp; That summit group-member is right, culture frames and shapes the way organisations and their communities both understand and misunderstand each other. &nbsp;Some social theory rejects the possibility of a shared understanding between the one and the other. &nbsp;But the major premise of reform is that past facts need not predict future possibilities. &nbsp;Partnership work with cultural influences needs shared understandings between helpers in their institutions and stakeholder in their communities. &nbsp;It is not that any reformer can assume first-attempt success - misunderstanding is possible, so is a failure to try to understand, but so is creative persistence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>An analysis of how different nations nurture different cultures is possible. &nbsp;Might it be true that German careers work is more thorough? &nbsp;Brit more direct? &nbsp;American more flexible?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; But the evidence is that there is as much cultural variability within nations as between them. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/nicecspace&place.pdf" rel="nofollow">differences between cultures are local</a>.&nbsp; In some neighbourhoods a person can notice evidence of different communities while taking a short walk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An authoritative source on school-community cooperation sets out a range of what are cultural assumptions (Munn, 1993).&nbsp; Compiled by educationists, it permits an account of the links between educators and stakeholders - the former in their institutions, the latter in their communities. &nbsp;The study sets out a base-line platform for cooperation, but it also allows for different starting points for action.&nbsp; The base line assumes cultural assonance - it sets out what stakeholders will readily agree.&nbsp; But the study also invites a questioning dissonance - and that allows for reform possibilities that some may not yet have recognised...</p>
<ul>
<li>... there can be agreement about student and family self interests</li>
<li>... but what about interests in the well-being of other people's children?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... there can be agreement about education in familiar settings</li>
<li>... but what about emerging voluntary and community organisations?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... there can be agreement about partnership as a well-established process</li>
<li>... but what about the disturbances by minority points-of-view?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... there can be agreement that 'happiness' is a principal family concern</li>
<li>... but what about the value of competitiveness? or fulfillment? or even resistance?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Munn base-line looks to the future, and is prescient in recognising that institutions may assign to stakeholders roles as 'customers' rather than 'partners'.&nbsp; But stakeholders can resist what institutions assign. &nbsp;It is culture which explains why a programme is welcomed in one community and rejected in another.&nbsp; Institutionalised careers work can usually come up with an account of any programme it propose.&nbsp; And that proposal may well come from what a national government expects.&nbsp; But the evidence (Law, 2013) is that remote expectation is less important than local response.&nbsp; It is more important to appreciate the sense and use that local people are able make of any proposal...<br />if any.</p>
<p>And that needs up-close contact, which is in touch with local stakeholder beliefs, values and expectations.&nbsp; The evidence is sociological; it is that cultures live in 'social enclaves' which are located in neighbourhoods.&nbsp; Different enclaves cultivate different cultures. &nbsp;And the evidence shows that it is <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8787" rel="nofollow">locally-based networks</a> which are more likely to be understood and acted upon. &nbsp;That evidence is that city-and-regional institutions of work-life and citizenship forge strong links with stakeholders.</p>
<p>Any partnership between careers-work and education rests on two-way trust.&nbsp; Educators can count on careers-workers' understanding of local cultures and their allegiances - in up-close contact careers workers engage with the sense that experience makes of working life. &nbsp;And careers workers can know that educators enable local people to voice that cultural experience and to question it - in stage-by-stage exploration educators enable student recognition of unforeseen possibilities.</p>
<p>Educators are aware that doctrinaire assumptions assign a bad press to cultural studies.&nbsp; I'm not qualified to say much about that.&nbsp; But, until you show me better, I'll stand by this.&nbsp; Students have a right to see beyond their culturally-acquired experiences and memories.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.katsandogz.com/onchildren.html" rel="nofollow">Upbringing is a beginning not an end</a>.&nbsp; Career management then becomes students settling on what, in upbringing, they will hold onto - but, also, what they will let go.&nbsp; Then they are ready to say how they shape their beliefs, values and expectations.&nbsp; It needs rehearsing with families - both now and one day.&nbsp; Because it is how they, life-long, see how the culture they embrace connects to the institutions they inhabit.&nbsp; And it equips them to act when there is no connection.&nbsp; Cultural studies extend the reach of what we call careers work and citizenship.&nbsp; It opens up the shaping of who gets to do what in society. &nbsp;I can think of no more important task for educators and their partners.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">THINKING</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 240px;"><strong>credibility</strong></p>
<p>An influential voice at the NICE Summit calls on medicine as a professional model for the future of careers work.&nbsp; Can careers work aspire to a status like that of doctors?&nbsp; There are parallels - both deal in consultations, diagnoses and cures.&nbsp; But much is changing, and medicine is developing new and far-reaching repertoires for help.</p>
<p>Part of the trend rests on a well established understanding that prevention is better than cure.&nbsp; And, now, the accessibility of on-line diagnosis is changing the GP conversation.&nbsp; There is also some market manipulation by pharmaceuticals, which can distort doctor-patients relations. &nbsp;But medicine is a resilient profession, and it's finding ways of dealing constructively with change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The trend makes status less of a concern than credibility.&nbsp; And the most adaptive and useful responses to people's needs are not prescriptions but explanations. &nbsp;When compared with treatment, health professionals are recognising the greater usefulness of education.</p>
<p>Why would careers workers imagine that that they are exceptions to such trends?&nbsp; The underlying changes have invaded careers work as much as they have invaded any profession.&nbsp; The trends assemble into an economic, technological and cultural backstory.&nbsp; And that narrative is changing attitudes to all professions - from the media to the clerical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we can't rely on the backstory getting the air-time that it deserves - and the electorate needs.&nbsp; It is curtailed by time-limited broadcasting, flabby news management and camouflaged priorities.&nbsp; There is also a careers-work backstory for NICE to develop.&nbsp; It manifests the background ways in which economics, technology and culture are framing and shaping the possibilities for future careers work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As every historian knows finding and narrating what goes on has never been easy. &nbsp;And the modern apparatus of economics, technology and culture can be used to massage any backstory into a preferred but misleading account. &nbsp;We must hope that neither careers work nor educators are among the culprits.&nbsp; But well-funded and skillfully-managed outfits can re-write, and even eliminate, any backstory that damages their interests. &nbsp;Educators and their students can find examples on a daily basis in news bulletins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of such techniques is unfairly damaging the credibility of public-sector careers workers. &nbsp;Examples appear as unwarranted enthusiasm for private-sector provision and belief in business people as the most effective sources for careers work in schools. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A person might well be able to hunch what interests are most served by such claims. &nbsp;But why should a person have to probe so hard to find and decisively verify the backstory? &nbsp;And, even if a person had the time and made the find, what hope is there in trying to influence hidden interests with&nbsp;rational argument? - the careers-work leadership has tried it to destruction. &nbsp;</p>
<p>None of this argues for backing away. &nbsp;Hiding realities is anti-educational. &nbsp;And is such camouflaged maneuvering&nbsp;impenetrable? &nbsp;We know that independently-minded students learn how to probe distorted backstories. &nbsp;We know that medicos are quick learners. &nbsp;Can we find careers workers and educators who can deal with this? &nbsp;Are they NICE?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 240px;">&nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">research</strong></p>
<p>The NICE position is that professional credibility comes from a valid research base. &nbsp;At its best research finds what's going on, shows how it gets this way, and identifies what causes bring about what effects.&nbsp; These are the facts belonging to the descriptions, explanations, and anticipations which make effective careers-work possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But research outfits are juggling in an increasingly politicised arena.&nbsp; What politicos seek from research, and the action they take in response, may well demonstrably overlook what is known about how people actually live their lives. &nbsp;I've sat in careers-work research meetings considering invitations to tender for research whose findings are specified in the invitation - 'we want evidence to show that...'.&nbsp; In such a climate winning contracts and reporting results can be opportunistic, or arbitrary or inventive - or all three.&nbsp; That research can obscure more that it illuminates. &nbsp;The obfuscation can be deliberate.</p>
<p>Economics is a noticeable example.&nbsp; It is a core concern of careers work because it researches the labour-market information which underpins careers work.&nbsp; But what if there were evidence of <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/57ba23f8-23a0-11e4-8e29-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3HzpbVdUJ" rel="nofollow">economists deliberately massaging</a> their findings in order to camouflage the political or commercial interests they see themselves as serving?&nbsp; What would that do to credibility?</p>
<p>So this can't be what NICE is signing up to. &nbsp;Its refusal to do so finds support among professional groups now arguing for <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7540.html" rel="nofollow">practitioner control of research</a>.&nbsp; They see angling academics as distorting any conversation between policy, profession and research. &nbsp;Careers work and education need research which informs useful action.&nbsp; And that needs researchers who are in ground-level contact with career-management experience, and who are able to formulate proposals that are recognisably practical.&nbsp; Some education professionals are calling for a tightening of the links between research and development. &nbsp;The call speaks of research-and-development in one breath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It needs <a href="http://news.tes.co.uk/b/tes-professional/2014/09/04/take-control-of-your-teaching-by-embracing-research.aspx" rel="nofollow">research-savvy</a> practitioners.&nbsp; I doubt that careers work needs much of the number-crunching for epidemiological 'big data&rsquo; favoured by politicians.&nbsp; Where causes and effects work out differently in different locations it is ethnographies that promise to be useful.&nbsp; Ethnography is open to all the variability and variation of up-close-and-immediate experience.&nbsp; Educators and careers workers have proven themselves capable of producing such exact accounts.&nbsp; They have a precise kind of validity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But no research has any practical validity until it is tested in use.&nbsp; That test is called 'catalytic validity' (Cohen and others, 2000).&nbsp; It asks whether what the findings anticipate in theory correspond with what happens in reality. &nbsp;Practicality needs that kind of research.&nbsp; It is information which can be grasped, probed and made to work by professionals in conversation with their stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are neglected issues here.&nbsp; They are for how research findings are worded, packaged and made available.&nbsp; Managed well catalytic validity can open up partnerships' r&amp;d conversations. &nbsp;It brings professionals and their stakeholders into shared conversations concerning what's going on, how it gets this way, and what anybody can do about it. &nbsp;It makes research community property.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 180px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 240px;"><strong>qualifications</strong></p>
<p>The NICE conference is part of an on-going on-line <a href="http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/nice/article/view/16726/10556" rel="nofollow">consultation on competency standards</a> (Katsarov, 2014). &nbsp;Its argument is that careers work needs to provide accounts of qualification so that politicos can understand what policy is being asked to support.&nbsp; The NICE versions of qualifications for careers work list levels of quantifiable competencies. &nbsp;There are other versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A host at the university's welcoming of NICE is the Dean of Education.&nbsp; He remarks that education is more than imparting measureable competencies.&nbsp; He refers to the unquantifiable attitudes which, in any worthwhile learning programme, foster the development of 'creativity' and 'critical thinking'.&nbsp; The two phrases have long-since been linked together as key elements for qualifying as an educator.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/thinking-skills-and-creativity" rel="nofollow">Anna Craft</a> is the trail blazer (Wegeraf, 2014).</p>
<p>Creativity is more than innovation - 'what's new?' need not be such a big deal.&nbsp; Creativity's bigger deal makes a difference to how things are - a cause with a bigger effect. &nbsp;It has been said &nbsp;(Hyde, 1983) to offer a gift and promise a surprise. &nbsp;And that is a disturbance provoking a special kind of excitement.&nbsp; The effect ranges from remapping the solar system to getting more suck from vacuum cleaners. &nbsp;Both change lives, each in its own way.</p>
<p>And then there is critical thinking, which also makes a difference. &nbsp;But it's more deliberative - a learning process driven by interrogating, probing and scrutinising what's going on.&nbsp; It asks awkward questions. &nbsp;And,&nbsp;when it would be a bad mistake to allow the past to predict the future,&nbsp;that counts for a lot. &nbsp;But it also means that it comes across as disturbing how things are, and that causes discomfort.</p>
<p>Both creativity and critical thinking are an unwillingness to settle for how things are.&nbsp; People may be grateful for the gift, but they won't thank you for being taken out of their comfort zone.&nbsp; And either may be more welcomed by reformers than by the defenders.&nbsp; But, in their different ways, both are necessary responses to change - and when mere innovation won't do.</p>
<p>If he needs it the Dean will find support in the case for <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/partnership-agreements-worthy-pact-or-childrens-charter/2016066.article" rel="nofollow">authentic learning</a>.&nbsp; This is not compliance with ready-made lists or measurable competencies.&nbsp; Indeed, it sees that as a form of institutional control.&nbsp; Authentic learning lifts candidates above trying to look good enough to comfortably and safely secure an award. &nbsp;Comfort and safety do not work for creativity, they work as marketing ploys.&nbsp; Mere novelty can figure, and that might attract some students and educators.&nbsp; But the movement for authentic learning argues that comfortable and safe breeds dependency, infantilises candidates and undermines any useful understanding of how things are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Significant learning takes risks, it does not play safe; it excites, it does not calm; it works through discomfort, it does not evade.&nbsp; A <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf" rel="nofollow">meta-analysis of career learning</a> tracks what this means for careers work. &nbsp;More recent neurological evidence speaks of how <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pzr00" rel="nofollow">learning thrives</a> (podcast). &nbsp;The researcher (Karmiloff-Smith, 1992) shows that useful learning needs unfamiliar, surprising and disturbing experiences - so that learners don't switch off, or doze off.&nbsp; And, against the conventional grain, she especially recommends all of this wake-up stuff for watching tv.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;qualifications&nbsp;indicated by such thinking&nbsp;record evidence of ready-for-change independence-of-mind.&nbsp; Playing safe and comfortable would be the most dangerous thing that any learning partnership could do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's true that a person wanting to look good and avoid risk would not immediately be bowled over by what that qualification invites. &nbsp;We are on a journey here, and so an institution's need for reform, fired-up by creativity, informed by critical thinking and leading to authentic learning may not get its first nod before Friday. &nbsp;But the need for all this will become more compelling as change gathers momentum.&nbsp; And it will.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 180px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 240px;"><strong>promotion</strong></p>
<p>Future possibilities for careers work and education must deal with commercial and political interests in careers work. &nbsp;The most influential of them work on a global scale.&nbsp; The backstory is not good news; the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13632434.2013.856294" rel="nofollow">politicisation of helping agencies</a> has never resulted in reliable support.&nbsp; And, now, careers work is being overtaken by a global <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/how public-sector careers work thrives alongside private-sector career coaching" rel="nofollow">career-coaching</a> industry, while education is faced by attempts at <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776" rel="nofollow">curriculum capture</a> by commercial interests. &nbsp;The trends put public-sector careers work and education under existential threat.</p>
<p>It's difficult to know how to promote careers work in these conditions. &nbsp;An example not to follow is set out in an <a href="http://adventuresincareerdevelopment.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/was-there-ever-a-golden-age-for-careers-education-and-guidance/" rel="nofollow">account </a>of careers work's success.&nbsp; It likens being an instrument of government policy as living in a 'golden age'. &nbsp;But that golden memory is not entirely happy.&nbsp; At the time commercial pressure on government is strong; social fragmentation is accelerating; and education is under arbitrary inspectorial attack.&nbsp; And yet the <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf" rel="nofollow">careers-work response</a> (pp.1-4) shows no interest in mainstream curriculum; has little to say about learning processes; and worries that measures to integrate the excluded will dilute careers-work professionalism. &nbsp;This promotion of a golden age is neither miserably failing&nbsp;nor&nbsp;impressively successful.</p>
<p>Promotion - in advertising, marketing and canvassing - urges success in the past, promise in the present, and trust in the future. &nbsp;There's room for doubt about whether all that jam-tomorrow positivity works. &nbsp;It might impress people who've never had the time, opportunity or inclination to think otherwise. &nbsp;But the evidence is that dedicated positivity&nbsp;ioses opportunities to improve - there is more to gain from diagnosing failure than from promoting success. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be argued that the promotion is for outsiders and the bad news for insiders. &nbsp;But surely we've been talking about bringing outsiders in? &nbsp;And&nbsp;lifting the lid&nbsp;is a lot more interesting than&nbsp;banging the drum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no shortage of evidence on the <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8787" rel="nofollow">usefulness of bad-news shock</a>. &nbsp;And the reflective wing of the business world has developed various formats for such '<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/12/testing-or-checking/" rel="nofollow">checking and testing</a>'.&nbsp; It acknowledges the inter-dependence of failure and progress. &nbsp;Critically understanding why the breakdown broke down tells a professional more about how the system and its programmes work; cheering from the rooftops tells the provider nothing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That's for the provider, but self-congratulatory applause holds back user learning by smothering critical voices. &nbsp;Is that what happens in this NICE group session on innovation? &nbsp;A chair-person opens it by listing NICE achievements. &nbsp;But, on closing, the chair's 'summary' pretty-well ignores the group's probing for how to make headway.&nbsp; Instead it repeats the up-beat listing already made. &nbsp;The smothering suffocates when the chair thanks the group for its positive thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education is not exempt.&nbsp; A&nbsp;<em>Times Education Supplement</em>&nbsp;ad (TES, 2014) features two agencies close to government - Pearsons Education publishing and the Confederation of British Industry.&nbsp; In an upbeat opening session business people identify the value of curriculum to commerce.&nbsp; But a downbeat follow-on has many educators countering by pointing to the risks to student well-being.&nbsp; So how is it that the chair feels able to claim inspiration from the resulting consensus?&nbsp; Could it be that promotion needs ready-made applause for ready-made intentions?</p>
<p>From selfies to corporate videos self-promotion is rampant. &nbsp;But the reality is that there is more hope in facing bad news than in faking good. &nbsp;Stepping out of the self-promotional trend may seem like too much of a risk.&nbsp; But <a href="http://www.gertbiesta.com" rel="nofollow">Gert Biesta</a> (2014) is prominent among the many cited here who show that that facing risk is the immeasurable foundation of all worthwhile learning. &nbsp;Neither careers-work nor education can afford to be distracted by strategies that won't work. &nbsp;And there's little to gain by patting each other on the back.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">POSSIBILITIES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Careers work and education share a concern for people's chances in life.&nbsp; The imagery is compelling when it portrays elbowing for an 'inside track' to 'get ahead' by 'overtaking' the 'competition' and being a 'winner'.&nbsp; Such wants are liable to be manipulated by self-serving interests.&nbsp; Students and their educators need to recognise that - whether from politics, commerce, culture, or professions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apparatus of manipulation captures how people think and talk about their concerns.&nbsp; Its imagery erects a boundary around how people see things.&nbsp; A philosophical collation of decades of research into this kind of control has coined the term <a href="http://stephenlaw.blogspot.co.uk" rel="nofollow">'intellectual black hole'</a> (Law, 2011).&nbsp; At the extreme it sweeps people into wanting what is contrary to their needs. &nbsp;Where 'what I want' is mistaken for 'what I need' then education is failing.</p>
<p>The retort is to demand 'says who!' - who has any right to tell anybody what they need. &nbsp;Getting control means capturing what people sense is worth saying - the language. &nbsp;So should we worry when an interested group pushes terms like 'guidance' and 'career'? &nbsp;We should if it holds back the dynamics of how meanings change as events unfold.&nbsp; And we should worry when the powerful forbid the use of terms like 'guidance' and 'career'. &nbsp;Up-front definitions are at least transparent. &nbsp;But informal reports of elimination are hard to verify - unless you know more than I do.</p>
<p>All such capture pushes unwanted language and probing questions out of reach. &nbsp;The unwary are not bothered.&nbsp; The encircled space can feel safe, and the talk can feel free.&nbsp; Both feelings are deceptive - language, thinking and action have been curtailed.&nbsp; People have been deceived.&nbsp; There is nothing more anti-educational.</p>
<p>And neither is there is anything unfamiliar about this.&nbsp; It features in cleverly constructed press-releases, news separated from its backstory, superficial interviewing, and the terms inserted into commissions-of-enquiry.&nbsp; It's also the scenario for a fair few dystopias - where debate is curtailed, history is re-written, language is manipulated, doubt is punished, questioning ignored.&nbsp; And possibilities fall out of sight. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this is relevant to any outfit which might be a target for capture, or be an inadvertent perpetrator, or be both.&nbsp; The range of outfits which look to the future of careers work include some that lean toward reform, and others toward the promotion of success. &nbsp;Some show controlling tendencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, a resource kit for life-long guidance (ELGPN, 2012) takes a reforming position on enabling career management for a changing labour market.&nbsp; Elsewhere a <a href="http://www.derby.ac.uk/research/icegs/news/2014/icegs-launch-a-beacon-for-guidance.html" rel="nofollow">'beacon for guidance'</a> (Hyde, 2014) relies on the celebration of past success.&nbsp; Alongside both is a generalised claim to <a href="http://www.suttontrust.com/researcharchive/advancing-ambitions" rel="nofollow">advance ambitions</a> in an opportunistic attempt to attract favourable government attention. &nbsp;From what we know we can expect signs of control to curtail research.&nbsp; And so it proves. &nbsp;The claim to be advancing ambition by-passes earlier work examining <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5322" rel="nofollow">careers work's failures on aspiration</a>.</p>
<p>Education is no more immune to attempted capture than careers work.&nbsp; A much-canvassed attempt (Christodoulou, 2014) re-defines and dismisses the underpinning for progressive education.&nbsp; This circling of the semantic wagons pushes 'mythical beliefs' out of sight. &nbsp;But, as independent minds step outside the controlling circle its defences crumble...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>1: the claim is that education should be fact based...</li>
<li>but aren't all facts selected and none of them value free?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>2: the claim is that education should be teacher led...</li>
<li>but who then listens to the sense that students make of learning?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>3. the claim is that education should be traditionally delivered...</li>
<li>but what tradition is that and isn't it better for students to examine any inside rather than outside school?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>4: the claim is that education should direct students to sources...</li>
<li>so where do students usefully learn to find and probe their own sources?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;5: the claim is that education should be prescribed by authorities...</li>
<li>but are not the authorities too high-up and too far-away to understand any lives but their own?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>6: the claim is that education should command attention...</li>
<li>but how does anybody stop students learning what they find interesting and worthwhile?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>7: the claim is that education must meet targets and deliver outcomes...</li>
<li>but when do students learn about who the outcomes most benefit?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daisy Christodoulou's seven headlines signpost dead ends.&nbsp; She's right to raise the issues. &nbsp;They are genuine - anybody with any sustained contact in education has come across head-bangers arguing that all facts are opinions.&nbsp; But we have more than enough careers workers and teachers who know the difference between a fact (like gravity) and a construct (like daleks).</p>
<p>At any rate, students should be giving teachers a run for their money on the issues.&nbsp; And that conversation needs to appreciate that students have many ways to learn, and a fair-few needs for learning. &nbsp;For some it won't be an asked-for 'want'. &nbsp;For some it will feel uncomfortable - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29518319#?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter" rel="nofollow">more like anarchy than education</a>. &nbsp;But it's learning for work-life and citizenship, and poses a crop of questions - the prevailing answers to which shape young lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blandly asking 'how do you feel?' mustn't get in the way of uncomfortably asking 'how do know?' (Williams, 2014).&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>So, is there anything here of any use to reforming careers-work partnerships?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">on expanding claims</strong> - careers work needs to be informed by an inclusive range of stakeholders - their interests extend beyond labour-market concerns - partnerships can realise, support and learn from these wider links</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">on refining roles</strong> - roles need to be acknowledged in both institutional expertise and community experience - sustained conversations are crucial for connecting professional expertise to student, family and community experience</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">on working with culture</strong> - local beliefs, values and expectations influence life chances - careers work is necessary to understanding these cultural influences - learning-for-living needs stage-by-stage work in mainstream curriculum</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">on developing thinking -</strong> credibility is more important than status - it needs reliable research with recognisable applications - and to be accessible to stakeholders - research-and-development can then be brought into community ownership</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">on realising possibilities </strong>- effective and sustainable change needs an account of observable causes and effects - stakeholders and professionals can then work together on how the one brings about the other - questioning failure is more useful than promoting success</li>
</ol>
<p>Education has a distinctive voice on the possibilities.&nbsp; The Royal Society of Arts (RSA) is an agency for mainstream education reform.&nbsp; It has published an <a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal" rel="nofollow">educator's account of working life</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of it holds no surprises for experienced careers workers.&nbsp; But a 'big-data' report (pp.10-15) goes into some detail on the 'hollowing out' of labour markets, both for the&nbsp;recruitment consequences in the mid-range, and for the rewards of top-range self employment.&nbsp; It welcomes global companies looking to educators to rebalance labour supply.&nbsp; It doesn't say how welcoming educators might be about being assigned that role.</p>
<p>A similarly unsurprising report (pp.16-24) examines the robustness of the demand for interpersonal, creative and digital abilities. &nbsp;And it examines some anticipations concerning the future relationship between automation and recruitment.&nbsp; It also points to how digital technologies may be good news for rich consumers but bad news for less well-off producers.</p>
<p>There are more surprises in a report (pp.21-25) of how people are moving into self-employment.&nbsp; It explains why this is not just a behavioural adjustment by people desperate for any work.&nbsp; It is a structural labour-market change, driven by able people seeking congenial settings for the fulfilment of high-level abilities. &nbsp;But there are issues: capitalising small businesses takes on financial risks.&nbsp; This is not what educators mean by 'learning is risky'- it has consequences for family and community well-being. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the RSA material it is an academic historian (pp.30-35) who gets close to the experience of change in working-life. &nbsp;It illustrates ways in which people are becoming increasingly curious and critical about 'what's going on'.&nbsp; Yet work-life has not adjusted to the way in which that hope is becoming expectation.&nbsp; The author's historical tracking sets out how work connects people to a credible, experimental, conversational and intellectually-engaging experience.&nbsp; The problem is that labour markets cannot accommodate the demand for work offering that kind of fulfillment. &nbsp;Indeed, it finds that work-life routines are too often futile, and sometimes traumatic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Big data rarely reflect enough of what the RSA reports.&nbsp; Alert and trusted helpers might. &nbsp;The historian is most interested in catalysing a congenial conversation. &nbsp;The less congenial scenarios are of low-paid, zero-hours and benefit-dependent working lives. &nbsp;That needs a more fully-equipped partnership response.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p>I leave it to others to detect any shift in some paradigm. &nbsp;Some dust has to settle, some issues revisited. &nbsp;The range of thinking might be something like a copy-and-paste of this scattergram.&nbsp; Some of its terms crop up again and again in earlier pages...&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's a programme-development tool here.&nbsp; It can engage students, their communities and professionals in a search for agreement and disagreement. &nbsp;Colour coding can identify....</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;no better than feel-good? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the ideas disturb the relationship between careers work and policy.&nbsp; But they improve the relationship with stakeholders - and stakeholders elect politicians. &nbsp;But this is not arguing for severing relationships with politics.&nbsp; It's arguing for an interactive rather than a dependent relationship. &nbsp;Interactive is more dignified.</p>
<p>I doubt that there's any one place to start. &nbsp;And no sane partnership would try swallow all in one gulp. &nbsp;But, wherever the starting point, it's for educators to fire-up the action.&nbsp; NICE has mapped what careers work can do.&nbsp; It's time for mainstream educators to recognise what they bring to the partnership. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Registering and contributing to this blog would declare that intention - and open the conversation.</p>
