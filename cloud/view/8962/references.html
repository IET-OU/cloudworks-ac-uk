    <div class="user-entry">

        <p dir="ltr"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Narrator</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Newly employed at a high school I was asked to design and run a 4 day masterclass for year 9 gifted and talented students in the easter holidays. &nbsp;I was employed as an ICT teacher but the school were aware my degree was in business studies and the business studies teacher was not someone they wanted to teach a masterclass</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The class was to take place in school, during the holidays. &nbsp;We were allocated a large open plan humanities area equipped with desks, chairs, flipcharts and a trolley full of laptops. &nbsp;Students expected were desginated as &ldquo;gifted and talented&rdquo; but unknown to me, I had only a list of names to go by.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The goal of the 4 days was to have groups of students ready to start a school based enterprise project in the summer term. &nbsp;This was designed to be a competition with groups raising money for charity during charities week at school and prizes for the top group. &nbsp;My personal measure of success was to have all students being engaged and willing to further their enterprise.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I created a wiki with complete lesson plans for the 4 days. &nbsp;I split the days as follows</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Business Day - Establishing company, name, skills audit, product choices, roles, SWOT</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Marketing Day - Understand branding, create company logo, corporate identity, marketing plan/materials</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Product Showcase - Demo product, create financial forecast, posters, social media plan</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Dragons Den - prepare a presentation to give to visiting &ldquo;dragons&rdquo; to secure &pound;10 funding per team as start up funds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">Next I used my own contacts to secure some local businessmen to visit for presentation day, these were members of a very active local Rotary club and familiar faces to the students. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As day 1 progressed I became acutely aware that the students were not gifted and talented as I had been given to understand, in fact they were a mixed bunch which largely consisted of underperforming and behaviourally challenged students. &nbsp;I also became aware that the schools policy of not teaching ICT at KS3 had left them with inadequate computing skills. &nbsp;To overcome this obstacle I quickly scaled down some the work I had included so that they would not have to upload everything to the group wiki each night and they would work in groups I allocated rather than choosing friendship groups. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I also changed the fourth day so that rather than Dragons Den it was Sharing forum, our &ldquo;dragons&rdquo; would each talk for 10 minutes first about their own experiences in business and the student groups would each have 15 minutes afterwards to share their ideas.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I expected all the groups to come up with a viable enterprise idea, with the exception of one group they did, the last group never demonstrated how their idea would be viable with a start up funding of &pound;10.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I expected all the groups to produce a wiki - outlining all of their ideas, work, marketing. &nbsp;These were dropped due to time constraints with the students being at a lower than expected level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I expected all of the groups to present their enterprise projects as complete business plans with financial projections, marketing plans/materials and a brand identity to our dragons. &nbsp;This was largely a met objective with all of the groups presenting brilliantly but with only 2 groups including financial objectives.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The &ldquo;dragons&rdquo; on the day pledged to add &pound;100 to the charity funds raised.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The final objective was to raise money through the enterprise projects after the Easter holidays. &nbsp;This objective was not met at all, I was given a heavy teaching workload and spent many morning trying to round up the groups to get them ready to sell their products during charities week but I never managed to get more than one or two students to each meeting. &nbsp;Eventually I donated the &pound;50 which had been meant to fund the groups to the two local charities the groups had originally nominated.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I would say always get a clear idea of your students ability, I should have insisted on seeing their recent levels/reports or even their &ldquo;gifted and talented&rdquo; paperwork. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If a project is to be on-going at a later date a fixed weekly meeting should be set and agreed with all participants/stakeholders. &nbsp;If I were to do this again I would have a letter ready to go home to parents before the week was over.</p>
<p>In order to make a succesful enterprise project on such a smalll budget I would introduce a vote for the best two projects at the end of the week and then move all the participants into those two teams to compete for the prize. &nbsp;&pound;10 for 5 teams was unrealistic to get a product ready for sale only in a specific week, even the cheapest products would have such a limited supply that there would not have been time to re-stock and sell again the same week. &nbsp;Also having only one teacher to supervise 5 groups selling products in school could have proved a logistical nightmare as students had identified different places to target their product within the school building.</p>    </div>
