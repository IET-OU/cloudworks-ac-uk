        <p>this is part five of a five-part keynote presentation to the 2011 annual conference of the ICG<br />the series starts at <a title="part one" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5868" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5868</a></p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; pushing the boundary -&nbsp; managing control and finding space </strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that boundary setting can be a covert form of control.&nbsp; It is true that setting limits on what we do is a practical necessity, but it is also true that the way those limits are set can circumscribe our independence.&nbsp; It curtails our basis for knowing what to support - and what to oppose.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>the personal and the planetary:&nbsp;</strong> If students-and-clients are to narrate what they learn from experience, should there be limits to what they relate?&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp; But what links are appropriate and what are not?&nbsp; Everybody links working to shopping - the one permits the other.&nbsp; And the work that a person takes up is linked, not just to their own life chances, but the lives of any dependents they have - or ever will have.&nbsp; And people increasingly voice concerns for work-life balance.&nbsp; They also see the impact of work on quality-of-life as it links both to local neighbourhoods - even to African villages.&nbsp; Indeed, those impacts are seen as linking to the survival of species and the habitability of the biosphere - work has a carbon footprint.&nbsp; The links that people make to working life extend between <em>the personal and the planetary</em>.</p>
<p>They extend well beyond limits set by recruitment-and-selection interests.&nbsp; And also beyond the market thinking of neo-liberal policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>students and clients pushing back boundaries:</strong>&nbsp; Influential interests set limits on career talk.&nbsp; And that goes against wide-spread contemporary personal-to-planetary interests.&nbsp; The trends are well-documented by political commentators, sociologists, counselling-advocates, labour economists and behavioural psychologists.&nbsp; And our own research accords with the trends, it finds <em>students and clients pushing back boundaries</em>. &nbsp;It also finds people who see child care as a form of work, and who are wondering about work that endangers the planet.</p>
<p>None of this means that careers are boundaryless - if &lsquo;career&rsquo; means everything then it means nothing.&nbsp; But that is not what happens: people directly relate their concerns to labour-market experience.&nbsp; To pre-empt the expression of these concerns would limit the disclosure&rsquo;s they make, the extent of what we learn from each other, and the help we are - therefore - able to offer.&nbsp; They would also curtail the interests we feel able to support - and resist.&nbsp; It would diminish us</p>
<p><strong>whether the big society is big enough:&nbsp;</strong> Such thinking re-locates careers work in other-than-commerce and other-than-government alliances.&nbsp; Does that leave anywhere worth going?&nbsp; The big society is urged as a way of taking on group action which government is not able, or not willing, to take on.&nbsp; The idea is much derided; but there is a more robust concept - &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;.&nbsp; Civil society is characterised as social action which is neither commercial nor political.&nbsp; Voluntary agencies, charities and bona fide non-government organisations are - in varying degrees - examples.&nbsp; So are family, local, social and religious affiliations.&nbsp; There are tensions, take-overs and changing alignments: association football was once part of civil society.&nbsp; Professional associations still may be.&nbsp; Together the agencies and affiliations of civil society weave a social fabric which supports the way we live together - locally and on the planet.&nbsp; And so, it should be possible to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to a question about <em>whether the big society is big enough.</em>&nbsp; Is it a natural position for careers-work professionalism?&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are called &lsquo;bottom-line&rsquo; interest in careers work are actually commercial interests of shareholder.&nbsp; Civil society represents stakeholder interests.&nbsp; And all of the agencies and affiliations concerned with the social fabric have a natural interest in what careers workers do.&nbsp; It calls for multilateral, rather than bilateral, partnership agreements.&nbsp; Multi-laterality comes as no surprise to committed careers advisers and socially alert educators.&nbsp; The mapping of their links is as diverse as any in civil society.&nbsp; We need that independent positioning institutionalised.&nbsp; And a natural home for the institution is not the employer of careers workers - who may well defer powerful policy and commercial interests.&nbsp; The natural home for the institution of careers work is in civil society.&nbsp; Because the future is multilateral.</p>
<p>Practical questions for that reality are...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;who has a stake in careers work?&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;which of their interests should be our interests?&lsquo;<br />&lsquo;how do we manage those boundaries on what we do?&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p>Late twentieth-century careers-work has been a story of repeated crisis.&nbsp; The crises have usually been on the back of head-lined events.&nbsp; And the events have usually been outside our control.&nbsp; Headlines aside - the hyper-active manipulation of how we live together by commerce and policy is becoming widely suspect.</p>
<p>Along with many others, in all kinds of societies across the globe, we can think of re-positioning ourselves in relation to policy and commerce.&nbsp; The careers profession alliance is well placed to work on this.&nbsp; If not through the alliance, then I believe we will do it - belatedly - in some in some other way.</p>
<p>We need to do things differently.&nbsp; And it will take time.&nbsp; The task is innovation deeper and wider than careers work has ever taken on.&nbsp; It is for careers workers to take charge of their own future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who better?</p>
