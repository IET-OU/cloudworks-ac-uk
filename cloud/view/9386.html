<p>The evidence is that more is <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094" rel="nofollow">learned from failure</a> than from success.&nbsp; That learning requires the acknowledgement of failure.&nbsp; But a well-documented tendency is to <a href="http://assets.sfzc.org/cms1/sp_download/Mistakes Were Made.pdf" rel="nofollow">off-load blame</a> onto other people.&nbsp; The consequence is embedded in regressive reforms.&nbsp; But contemporary conditions call for progressive reforms.</p>
<p>Two questions for educators...</p>
<p align="center"><em>is there any </em><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf" rel="nofollow"><em>reason to exempt careers work</em></a><em> from regressive tendencies?</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">and&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>how much of a</em><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8787" rel="nofollow"><em> shock is needed to galvanise</em></a><em> a progressive wake-up?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">uses of history</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Timothy Snyder's <a href="http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/black-earth/9781847923493" rel="nofollow">compelling history</a> of European societies and their cultures is shocking. &nbsp;It uncovers parallels between twentieth- and twenty-first-century politics. &nbsp;You'll recognise the villain. &nbsp;The report carries an urgent warning for education - and especially for careers work. &nbsp;It's important because it calls on previously disregarded evidence and neglected testimony. &nbsp;Its analysis includes a probing account of the influence of policy on professions. &nbsp;Although you'll recognise the villain - his followers and his victims - reading it as a generality, involving us all, invites you to see you and your students as <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9272" rel="nofollow">agents of history</a>. &nbsp;Which you are.</p>
<p>The account is timely on politics because <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/25/jeremy-corbyn-earthquake-labour-party" rel="nofollow">electoral opinion is shifting</a> in ways that conventional politicians find it hard to understand. &nbsp;And this researcher is especially useful in his call for constructive movements which are local, independent and creative. &nbsp;This is not Westminster's strongest suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">causes and effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Timothy Snyder&nbsp;sets out a sequence of historical causes and effects. &nbsp;They describe a nation-state claiming that its reforms are necessary, inevitable and rational. &nbsp;The trigger is a changing world and its consequences for national survival. &nbsp;But the movement has no evidence to supports its claim. &nbsp;What it has instead is a preference which suits ready-made interests.&nbsp; And that fit renders evidence redundant.&nbsp; Sound familiar?</p>
<p>The resulting movement has existential consequences for the people who become its victims.&nbsp; They are judged to be contaminating the nation, and are therefore deemed unworthy of survival. &nbsp;At the same time the movement is positioning itself for more territory.&nbsp; So there is, at the same time, more ground to be occupied and more conformity to be required. &nbsp;That claim, on space and expectation, gathers its own dynamics. &nbsp;So much so that it persuades malleable professionals to embrace theories and methods which, in their former work, they would have given no room at all. &nbsp;So cultures are transformed - their memories, their beliefs and their expectations are overturned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regime maintains control and silences opposition with its imposition of power - 'might is right'. &nbsp;But, as it eventually turns out, the regime's warnings - of dire economic consequences for non-compliance with its plan - are never actually fulfilled. &nbsp;Might turned out to be powerfully wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The research points to then-and-now similarities.&nbsp; It raises questions - incuding some about whether there could be teachers maintaining a finger-hold on order by imposing similar 'pay-attention-and-do-as-you're-told' demands. &nbsp;Any progressive movement understands that control and subordination are not education.&nbsp; And, where the value of learning is shared with students, no such regime is needed.&nbsp; So Timothy Snyder opens the door to the possibility that contemporary change does not need to require ready-made prescriptions, but to galvanise something more like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/15550214/Learning_through_the_soles_of_our_feet_unschooling_anarchism_and_the_geography_of_childhood?auto=download&campaign=weekly_digest" rel="nofollow">the inventive anarchy of creativity</a>.&nbsp; In a tightly controlled regime it would need a not-so-malleable courage in educators.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">risk and comfort</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Timothy Snyder finds courage on the margins of all this.&nbsp; There are groups running terrifying risks by setting up rescue organisations. &nbsp;Those risk-takers are themselves victims who have escaped capture.&nbsp; There are also non-compliant helpers setting up resistant outfits.&nbsp; They prove to be most successful when they get a foot in the door of unvisited corners of local state apparatus. &nbsp;It's a stupendously dramatic example of the effectiveness of <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/nicecspace&place.pdf" rel="nofollow">local understanding for local action</a> - using local resources to find local solutions for local people.</p>
<p>Alongside all that, poorly-informed citizens inhabit a comfortably familiar space with exclusively controlled boundaries. &nbsp;The imperatives feed into popular politics.&nbsp; Their curtailed ideas and theorising over-control the professions. &nbsp;The culmination of that colonisation is the destruction of neighbouring states. &nbsp;And that is how unhampered action crystallises justifications for the rejection of the unwanted. &nbsp;Existential threats can then be immediately murderous.&nbsp; These extremities have passed into history.&nbsp; But the dynamics persist.&nbsp; They can't fairly be condemned as attempts to <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_332904.pdf" rel="nofollow">eliminate the unwanted</a>, though that is an effect - on a longer time-scale but with no less a finality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">turning points</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So what has Timothy Snyder got? &nbsp;He identifies features in a perennial struggle between constructive and destructive movements. &nbsp;Significant in the latter is a confusion between what is desired and what is justified. &nbsp;It allows people to claim what they want as an entitlement. &nbsp;Meanwhile the more critical the threat of change the more intense the manoeuvring. &nbsp;Where localities are robbed of responsibility the nation-state is dealing with unmanageable levels of complexity. &nbsp;In global movements the complexity is exponentially greater. &nbsp;The greater the resulting discomfort the greater the state is urged to find readily-recognisable simplicity. &nbsp;But the more short cuts in that thinking the greater the regression and the more serious its collateral damage. &nbsp;Then blame for the damage must be offloaded onto outsiders - people who are not one of us. &nbsp;Insiders are then able to invite their supporters to celebrate the comfort of an uncomplicated way of living. &nbsp;And that simple-mindedness does not ask for more government control, it demands less. &nbsp;Sound familiar?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Timothy Snyder's then-and-now comparison exposes what, in the contemporary world,&nbsp;has become the neo-liberal political economy.&nbsp; And there are attempts at a <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776" rel="nofollow">neo-liberal capture of education</a> - in particular of careers work.&nbsp; The same evidence suggests that careers work leaders are ready to comply.&nbsp; In the resulting debate speaking of predatory commerce is to be accused of being unfairly 'anti-business'.&nbsp; But the evidence is of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23120225-the-establishment" rel="nofollow">global business routinely positioning itself for unearned advantage</a> - and that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/27/volkswagen-capitalism-morality" rel="nofollow">evidence is accumulating</a> on a daily basis. &nbsp;Its activity includes firms&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/23/uk-wage-growth-stifled-by-tepid-investment-and-low-skilled-migration" rel="nofollow">off-loading responsibility</a> for investment, while manipulating markets, distorting evidence, avoiding tax and manoeuvring governments.&nbsp; Global technologies locate all of this beyond the reach of democracy, of its representatives and of their constituents.&nbsp; In view of the fact that the clients and students of careers work are on the receiving end of this treatment its <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8844" rel="nofollow">professionalism is unaccountably quiet</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">finding hope</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a story of historical and repeated failure.&nbsp; Is anything changing? &nbsp;Timothy Snyder finds little sign of any slowdown in regressive tendencies. &nbsp;Prevailing ideas still favour small-government. &nbsp;They advocate an economics simple enough to be contained by talk of targets, markets and bottom-lines. &nbsp;The interests of insiders can then be thought to be blameless. &nbsp;Wherever there is blame to be assign it's attributed to outsiders claimed to be blameworthy. &nbsp;Whistle-blowing educators feature on the list of culprits. &nbsp;Though some adjust stance to gain status. &nbsp;There is a shocking irony in the way even educators will do this, despite how insider alliances dismiss authoritative cultural commentaries and deny reliable scientific findings.</p>
<p>This search digs deep, and what it finds ain't pretty. &nbsp;It probes exposed societies and compliant cultures. &nbsp;It finds politics unable to deal with a shift in electoral priorities. &nbsp;It is not the first to expose helping professionals <a href="http://www.propel.stir.ac.uk/downloads/JuliaEvetts-FullPaper.pdf" rel="nofollow">unable to sustain a reliable independence</a> of power. &nbsp;Neither is it the first to identify <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf" rel="nofollow">claims to righteousness</a> in movements which damage the interests they say they are defending.</p>
<p>So what have we got to go on? &nbsp;The evidence points to the power of the margins - local groups running the risks of opposition in small-scale outfits plugged into local apparatus. &nbsp;This is not big-society do-gooding, neither is it local-authority politicking. &nbsp;It's <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf" rel="nofollow">civil society and its stakeholders</a> working independently of out-of-touch politics and its well-healed sponsors.</p>
<p>And it's where Timothy Snyder finds hope - in the establishment of institutions each capable of independent thought and each open to a plurality of view-points. &nbsp;That movement engages creativity rather than control. &nbsp;We should also consider putting his work on the curriculum. &nbsp;It's sound history. &nbsp;I think it would count as education for citizenship. &nbsp;And, Adolf aside, was there ever a time when such&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9272" rel="nofollow">independence of mind, critical thinking and discontented creativity</a> were ever more needed?</p>
