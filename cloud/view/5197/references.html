    <div class="user-entry">

        <p>I'm working on a set of guidelines for programme and course designers on how to make their design as flexible as possible.&nbsp; To a large extent so far I'm relying on generalising from issues with a particularly large and complex programme I'm familiar with, so I'd welcome other experiences and points of view.</p>
<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, my starting point is that the essential characteristic of a flexible curriculum is that it is designed and managed.&nbsp; Without design, it is just a collection of weakly-related elements which don't fit well together.&nbsp; Without strong direction, it fragments into discrete elements and it is difficult to balance competing interests, or co-operate where interests overlap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My guidelines so far seem to fall into two main categories; organisational and infrastructural.&nbsp; The organisational group is about how to manage a programme effectively.&nbsp; The infrastructural group is about how to make it easy to manage - change is costly both in time and money, so this group can be thought of as ways to reduce the cost of change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to set them out as a sequence of decisions I think will help anyone interested in designing a flexible programme or module.&nbsp; In practice, the necessity of trading off modularity, choice, workload, and so on is likely to involve iterating to and fro through the sequence to try out different decisions.<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>Will your students be full-time or part-time? Regular weekly teaching patterns for extended periods work well for full-time students. Part-time students are likely to need lectures outside their working day, or delivered in short intense courses, or offered in a choice of presentations. The pattern and pace of delivery has a big influence on how much flexibility is subsequently available in the timetable - low intensity courses have more room for change.</li>
<li>Decide what kind of module choice you are going to offer your students. If you want your students to be able to take all modules, or any combination of <em>n</em> modules, none of your modules can clash in the timetable. They will need to run in different time slots or different date blocks.&nbsp; If you don't mind if some students have to accept second choices, or you are happy to make some combinations impossible, you will have more flexibility.</li>
<li>When do you need your timetable, before or after students make their option choices?&nbsp; How long before or after?&nbsp; You may be able to consider constructing a timetable specifically to satisfy student choices.</li>
<li>What style of course will this be?&nbsp; Low lecture load and high self-study style is likely to give you a sparsely-populated timetable which consequently won't be the main change-impeding factor.</li>
<li>Define your pattern of time slots. Unless you offer multiple presentations your number of simultaneous modules will be limited to the number of time slots in your weekly (or fortnightly) teaching pattern. With two or three timetabled contact hours a week you will usually find between 8 and 20 time slots. If you want to offer more courses than this some will have to share time slots and you will have to choose which courses to make mutually exclusive. </li>
<li>Decide on number of presentations. Will students get just one chance to take a module, or will they get other opportunities?&nbsp; If you are using more than one kind of teaching activity you may find that appropriate rooms have significantly different capacities - lecture theatres and seminar rooms, for instance. Your choices are to limit the course size to the capacity of the smallest room, or to offer multiple presentations of the smaller activity. Multiple presentations usually makes most sense.&nbsp; Another common solution is to offer the same module in different date blocks in the same programme stage, e.g. in both semesters 1 and 2, or in years 1 and 2 in a two-year Part.</li>
<li>Codify your curriculum structure.&nbsp; Define a hierarchy of teaching units, with guidelines on number of contact and study hours. Your institution may have defined them already. &nbsp;Basing them on existing unit types will make it easier to re-use teaching material. Deriving them from your institution's term or semester structure will give structure to the academic year. It will also give your units natural start and end points, creating 'slip planes' across the programme which add flexibility. </li>
<li>Agree standard delivery date blocks to deliver these teaching units, within your academic year or semester.&nbsp; This plus time slots will give you a maximum possible number of non-clashing units.</li>
<li>Decide whether automated timetabling makes sense for your programme.&nbsp; It makes most sense where you are struggling to provide the choice you want within your available timeslots and academic time periods (e.g. terms, semesters), where it can often find better solutions more quickly than a human.&nbsp; It can also take care of timetable publishing and student enrolment, and it frees you from maintaining a time slot system.&nbsp; There is a cost in maintenance and potentially licensing.</li>
<li>Agree what size learning unit summative assessment will operate at, and the forms and grading scheme of that assessment.&nbsp; Different assessment practice can be a major barrier to flexibility and a degree of commonality will help greatly. Different material may require different kinds of assessment, and different kinds of assessment will have to be conducted separately, but at least the grading schemes can be made compatible.</li>
<li>Agree a common format for describing courses.&nbsp; Make it as structured as possible so it can be reformatted and re-used wherever needed. This will help students use the curriculum and save staff a lot of time. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Construct your programme using this agreed framework.</li>
<li>Make allowance for special cases, but try to localise and minimise them.&nbsp; Interstices in the timetable should be used only on sufferance - allowing them to become entrenched messes up the timeslot system and drastically reduces your ability to respond to change.</li>
