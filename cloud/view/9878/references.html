        <p><strong>Narrator </strong></p>
<p>I worked with another associate lecturer on level 1 module to facilitate an OU Live session. I developed the learning activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The learning event took place online and time was limited to one hour as from previous experience this is a good duration in terms of time students able to concentrate in an evening. Students were at the beginning of a level 1 model and many were back in education after a long break and have not studied at university level or for some &nbsp;at A level. The session focused on developing the writing skills to support them to be successful in their second assignment.</p>
<p>In reflecting on this activity I will focus on a specific part of the learning event.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The assignment task students were working on was to summarise a specific section of information from the module material. We had delivered a similar session to a previous cohort however a good proportion of that group in completing their assignment demonstrated they had not fully understood the concept of summarising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Challenges</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Short time span available for this specific activity within the whole learning event &ndash; approximately 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Many students were unfamiliar with the online classroom so gradually introducing the available tools to build their confidence.</li>
<li>Many students participate through text chat rather than using the microphone</li>
<li>Number of participants is usually unknown until the session is underway.</li>
<li>From previous experience learning activities should not involve reading chunks of text as this isolates students in an online environment which made it harder to look at completion a summarising activity.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I reviewed the OU live session for the previous cohort accessing both the PowerPoint notes and the session recording to clarify how the discussion had been structured.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>I reviewed the assignments of the 4 students from the previous cohort who had achieved the lowest marks to identify what the challenges had been.</li>
<li>I reviewed what the key elements are to making an accurate summary and pondered how this could be discussed in a low key manner without using the module materials for examples.</li>
<li>The ice breaker to the session asked students to summarise their day into one word.</li>
<li>I developed 3 sliders within the PowerPoint; &nbsp;the first focused on students having the opportunity to speak or write their definitions of what summarising meant and the second reviewed definitions from dictionaries and the Assessment Guide. The third slide aimed to provide discussion by giving 3 phrases which students were asked to summarise initially into 2 words and then into the smallest number of words to ensure the meaning of the original phrase was not changed.</li>
<li>The 3 phrases used were</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>After Lincoln scored an own goal in the last 2 minutes of the game the final score was Walsall 3, Lincoln 2.</li>
<li>I met my best friend Shannon in town on Saturday. We went for coffee and cake - it was delicious.</li>
<li>Some students feel the most challenging thing about writing an essay is referencing</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>I anticipated that by making the phrases based in a social context students would feel less concerned about participating and this did appear to be the case with most students offering answers.</li>
<li>I expected the students to focus on different aspects of the phrase to put into 2 words and this worked really effectively &ndash; in fact no student came up with exactly the same wording and mine was different too. This was great as it enabled us to discuss how when we read information we may identify key points differently and that the wording we choose is really important to maintaining the sense of the original information and therefore achieving an accurate summary.</li>
<li>The second part of the activity enabled us to discuss using alternative wording whilst retaining the meaning, &nbsp;use of tools such as a thesaurus and the importance of note taking in your own words so that you do not inadvertently use the original wording &nbsp;and when the original wording is difficult to avoid such as names.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>Students actively participated in the activity and appeared able to identify how their original 2 word summary may be limited in meaning. They were able to discuss alternative wording and reducing the number of words used whilst still being accurate to the original meaning. This specific part of the learning event appeared to not only aid understanding of the concept but also to build confidence in participation and using the OU live tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Reflection with the other tutor at the end of the session identified that we both felt that students understanding of summarising was increased compared to the session with &nbsp;the previous cohort however when I have marked the assignments I will be able to reflect further on whether participants were able to summarise effectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I think the effectiveness of the discussion reinforced the need to be more creative in planning on line learning activities as requirements are different to face to face sessions.</p>
