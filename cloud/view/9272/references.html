        <p>Bill Law<br /><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" rel="nofollow">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>People are changing the way they manage their lives.&nbsp; Careers work cannot afford to neglect the news.&nbsp; But it comes with a <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/nicecspace&place.pdf" rel="nofollow">warning about priorities</a>&nbsp;- should careers work embed prevailing expertise, or rebuild it in response to change?&nbsp; It's a balancing of convention and reform - guess which is a way foward and which a blind alley?</p>
<p>Reform needs new ideas.&nbsp; The new idea here understands contemporary career management as a process of 'holding on' and 'letting go'. &nbsp;The idea cropped up first in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbnarrative.pdf" rel="nofollow">narrative thinking</a>.&nbsp; It can connect to policy, professionalism and practice.&nbsp; It would expand the careers-work repertoire. &nbsp;More importantly, it can position clients and students as agents of change.</p>
<p>To get anywhere with this means documenting how a person <em>holds on</em> to friends that matter, to assumptions that feel right, and to privileges that stand a person in good stead.&nbsp; But people might instead&nbsp;<em>let go</em> of friends, or assumptions or privileges if they are found to obstruct what that person finds important.</p>
<p>Navigating the pushes and pulls of these dynamics is among the most significant features of contemporary career management. &nbsp;Knowing when to hold-on and when to let-go enables people for ready-for-anything flexibility. &nbsp;Was there ever a time when that was more needed?</p>
<p>Much of the evidence and analysis here is heavy-duty - with occasional tongues-in-cheek. &nbsp;It will stand some back-and-forth revisiting. &nbsp;The analysis is illustrated with examples of useful encounters, materials and practice. &nbsp;The evidence uncovers five dimensions...</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1: &nbsp;<strong>connection</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; finding links to what's happening and with whom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2: &nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">reach</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;developing ready-for-anything flexibility<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3: &nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">buoyancy</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; making good use of bad news<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4: &nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">grasp</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;establishing learning for life-long living<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5: &nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">direction</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; realising independent critical-thinking and creativity</p>

<p><strong>1: &nbsp;CONNECTIONS</strong></p>
<p>There are causes-and-effects, there are meanings a person attributes to those events, and there are purposes set in motion by those atrributions. &nbsp;Defnding convention or pursuing reform, careers work needs to <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf" rel="nofollow">track those links</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The possibilities are varied, dynamic and expanding.&nbsp; In one way or another people are connected to family, friends and school-or-college contacts.&nbsp; There are neighbourhoods, where communities can link to locally-based agencies. &nbsp;Links to shops, bars, advertisers, stylists and media are constantly appearing - both off-line and on.&nbsp; Connections to politics, campaigns and demonstrations are being forged and broken as you read this. &nbsp;All raise question about what's worth holding-onto and what can be waved goodbye.&nbsp; People&nbsp;act on and&nbsp;live by their answers - they move and shake.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>move or shake</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" rel="nofollow"><strong>professional thinking</strong></a> has a spectrum of links that clients and students deal with. How much of it can you and your colleagues recognise as significant in their lives?...</p>
<p><strong>there's what everybody seems to know...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>people act on <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">instinct</strong>&nbsp;- impulsively looking for immediate pay-offs</li>
<li>they are most aware of their <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">individuality</strong>&nbsp;- at the extreme as though in a social vacuum</li>
<li>but lives are also&nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">situated</strong>&nbsp;- what people do reflects where they live</li>
<li>and there is&nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">background</strong>&nbsp;- where people learn how people-like-us manage all this&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;no big surprises so far, but more to say about social settings</strong>...</p>
<ul>
<li>individuals are located as a members of a <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">community</strong>&nbsp;- with its agreed way of doing things</li>
<li>it is also where <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">attachments</strong>&nbsp;are forged - shaping give-and-take relationships,&nbsp;loyalties and aspirations</li>
<li>and each locality nurtures a <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">culture</strong>&nbsp;- with its shared beliefs, values and expectations</li>
<li>social <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">enclaves</strong>&nbsp;are formed - each with its own set of&nbsp;sympathies, tolerances and hostilities</li>
<li>the dynamic of such social life is <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">habitus</strong>&nbsp;- where the inhabited culture shapes habits-of-mind</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;political influences rate more attention...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>social <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">polarisation&nbsp;</strong>builds over time - separating into 'like or not like us', valued or disdained, becoming strangers to each other</li>
<li>by contrast a <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">nudge</strong>&nbsp;is immediate - reinforcing behaviour which serves such interests as market, profession and business</li>
<li>while <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">stakeholding</strong> is deeper - more than shareholding, it represents the interests of customer, citizen and worker</li>
<li>among those&nbsp;<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">interests</strong>&nbsp;- are some people's beliefs in the certain deserving of one's own success, and the probable deserving of other people's failure</li>
<li>more inclusive interests voice <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">identity politics</strong>&nbsp;- opposing discrimination on&nbsp;gender, race and sexuality although, though less on class &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;change provokes fast-developing accounts of career influences.</strong>..</p>
<ul>
<li>influences are defended in <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">political theory</strong>&nbsp;- voicing beliefs, interests and evidence ranging from economic necessity to planetary survival</li>
<li>people are increasingly asked to show <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">resilience</strong>&nbsp;- seen as a 'good' upbringing for building character</li>
<li>and <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">intuitions </strong>are not lightly to be dismissed - our brains know more than we know they know and that insight can be worth heeding</li>
<li>but ideas of <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">enlightenment</strong>&nbsp;oppose entrenched interests - urging independence-of-mind, and expecting to be taken seriously in education</li>
<li>enlightenment also signposts <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">critical thinking</strong>&nbsp;- which undermines arbitrary controls by developing reliably-informed progression</li>
<li>and <strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">creativity</strong>&nbsp;takes a similar stance - refusing to settle for how things are with an&nbsp;inventiveness which reconnects how &nbsp;life is experienced</li>
</ul>
<p>Reality&nbsp;is muddier than analysis. &nbsp;Instinct and intuition are not easy to tell appart. &nbsp;Impulse can both trap and liberate. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/review-how-good-we-can-be-by-will-hutton" rel="nofollow">claims of stakeholders</a>&nbsp;are contested. &nbsp;But what are their drivers? - different <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5322" rel="nofollow">interests</a> (pragmatically served) or different <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/enlightened_citizens_vs._moral_sheep/" rel="nofollow">philosophies</a> (epistemologically&nbsp;scrutinised)? &nbsp;Some interests are rooted in the memories of a <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/opinion/can-higher-educations-golden-age-of-plenty-continue" rel="nofollow">privileged</a> and&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/review-baby-boomers-and-generational-conflict-jennie-bristow" rel="nofollow">ageing generation</a>.&nbsp; And the&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/journals/rsa-journal-issue-4-2014/" rel="nofollow">polarisation</a>&nbsp;of interests&nbsp;can thwart reforming zeal in all but the bravest (pp.20ff). &nbsp;So independence-of-mind calls on <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/CCREAD/etscc/kant.html" rel="nofollow">courage</a>.&nbsp; And, full circle, some of the <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=7Ze0ohBVFY0C&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=samual+oliner+pearl+oliner+altruistic+personality&ots=wo1b6PwfL2&sig=6ZyWjC2DJtr4ZMD65_zGQDp9nLY#v=onepage&q=samual oliner pearl oliner altruistic personality&f=false" rel="nofollow">bravest political action</a> is rooted in upbringing.</p>
<p>Links in all directions - and few certainties. &nbsp;There's no straightforward conversation to be had about holding-on-and-letting-go. &nbsp;But how refreshing to find <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2015/02/17/martin-sheen-tells-pupils-to-walk-with-him-to-social-activism.aspx" rel="nofollow">a celebrity</a>&nbsp;recognising students changing the world. &nbsp;And what more-important education agenda could there be?</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>who shaking what</strong></p>
<p>It's an education agenda, but it's also political - about who who gets to do what in society. &nbsp;Politics is <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094" rel="nofollow">getting clever</a>&nbsp;about this - enough to lead and mislead. &nbsp;A&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n20/owen-hatherley/who-will-stop-them" rel="nofollow">framework for action</a> is based on three elements. &nbsp;Firstly, any dominant group is an 'establishment'.&nbsp; It is supported, secondly, by 'outriders' - research-and-development outfits capturing connections for the establishment. &nbsp;Some of these are&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8875" rel="nofollow">careers outfits</a>. &nbsp;Thirdly, all politicking needs to persuade people about 'what everybody knows', and that frames an 'overton window'.&nbsp; Named for its inventor, it contains what people can be persuaded to believe - and that need not be truthful. &nbsp;The products appear daily in the media. &nbsp;And students who know how politics works can outflank it.&nbsp; There is such&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/04/russell-brand-changes-mind-about-voting-and-urges-support-for-labour" rel="nofollow">student politics</a>. &nbsp;Does it count as education for citizenship?</p>
<p>Students and their helpers never more needed to engage politics.&nbsp; There's no shortage of&nbsp;<a href="http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/" rel="nofollow">myths and findings</a>&nbsp;to probe. &nbsp;The evidence is that however much <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview" rel="nofollow">a politico thinks he knows</a> he&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/31/finnish-teachers-special-train-teach" rel="nofollow">probably doesn't</a>.&nbsp; So there is a <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1014635203149#page-1" rel="nofollow">world-wide search</a>&nbsp;for people ready to deal with politics in their own terms.&nbsp; But how many regimes can you list where the population is schooled in superstition, myth and compliance, rather than educated for independent and critical creativity? &nbsp;I can't help wondering whether you listed any part of the UK.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p><strong>2: &nbsp;REACH</strong></p>
<p>People are developing their own ways of dealing with work-life. &nbsp;They reach beyond career development and its&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.teachingtimes.com/articles/iag-strategy-question-answer.htm" rel="nofollow">information, advice and guidance</a>&nbsp;(IAG). &nbsp;They reach towards career management - which is&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUW8V7Jupns&feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">not the same thing</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time political interests are becoming more of a problem. &nbsp;They talk of individuals making economic decisions based on <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8509" rel="nofollow">impartial information</a>. &nbsp;It's narrow thinking, fitting into an overton window framing business interests, political time-lines and habits-of-mind.</p>
<p>Time is up on both IAG and impartiality.&nbsp; Neither deal with the accelerating&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf" rel="nofollow">change and complexity</a>&nbsp;of contemporary lives. &nbsp;Research into <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf" rel="nofollow">work-life experience</a> speaks of a search for work-life balance and a rejection of arbitrary demands. &nbsp;It intensifies pressure on education, looking beyond self-advancement and towards <a href="http://eax.sagepub.com/content/2/1/63.full" rel="nofollow">finding meaning</a> in their lives. &nbsp;It calls for a hold-on-let-go career conversation - and bigger windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>career conversations</strong></p>
<p>Talk of IAG&nbsp;conjures&nbsp;two favourite words: 'choice' and 'decision'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Choice speaks of acting on 'this-or-that?', decision on now-or-when?'.&nbsp; Both lurk in this conversation between questions and answers...<em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">'does it have to be sciences or arts?'<br /><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'no, you can get a better deal from the college'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">'suppose I just can't face any more exams'<br /><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'there are jobs where your personality will take you a long way'</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">'if I don't grab it now do I lose the chance?'<br /><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'not necessarily, the firm might respect you asking for time to think'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">'I thought you were supposed to tell me what to do'<br /><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'I can't do that, but your test and inventory scores are very promising'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">_______________________________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>this and similar inserts are illustrative</em><br /><em>of possible conversations<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">based on what I remember and can imagine<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">you have more recent memory and imagining</em></p>
<p align="center">_______________________________________________</p>
<p>Such conversations go down well with some interests. &nbsp;They attend to what evaluators need. &nbsp;They get frequent airings in the literature. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/moving on/cafcurriculum.pdf" rel="nofollow">influential approve</a> - including politicians, employers and conventional leaders. &nbsp;But something gets lost in the applause...&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>'you can get a better deal from the college'<br /></em>'so what makes it better?'<em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'there are jobs where your personality will take you a long way'<br /></em>'but all my mates are leaving now'<em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'a firm like that might respect you asking for time to think'<br /></em>'will the firm want to listen to me talking about my baby?'</p>

<p>There's surprise, puzzlement and <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20159814?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" rel="nofollow">ambivalence</a>&nbsp;here. &nbsp;Research suggests it's what drives creative change. &nbsp;But convention has little to say about change-of-mind. &nbsp;So reform needs a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" rel="nofollow">counter-narrative</a> featuring departures, turning-points and new-horizons. &nbsp;Reform calls for an expanding dynamic of change rather than a narrowing settlement of choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wide-ranging talk like this can shake confidence - conventionally upheld as a condition for success.&nbsp; It's true that positive&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview" rel="nofollow">talk of confidence</a>&nbsp;comes across well. &nbsp;But <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.tesdigital.com/magazine" rel="nofollow">evidence suggests</a> that the habitual use of rewarding talk can hold back learning (17/07/2015 pp.12-13).&nbsp; And there are&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/people-are-overly-optimistic-about.html?m=1" rel="nofollow">well-documented</a> accounts of over-confidence, misleading confidence and deluded confidence. &nbsp;They identify&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/NICECSbEnlarge.pdf" rel="nofollow">self-contradicting</a> and <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" rel="nofollow">self-serving</a> beliefs.</p>
<p>These exchanges feature conflicting interests. &nbsp;Some attempt to&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776" rel="nofollow">capture education</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Stakeholders&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/30/ofsted-learn-instead-alternative-inspections-headteachers-schools-naht" rel="nofollow">reach for release</a>. &nbsp;Either way, they raise hold-and-let issues - with degrees of not necessarily helpful confidence. &nbsp;Somebody once mentioned how a <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.tes.co.uk/teaching-resource/the-beatitudes-cartoon-6070434" rel="nofollow">reach for the meek</a> will get things right.&nbsp; The evidence on confidence suggests that he had a point - or she.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>affect and effect</strong></p>
<p>A long-standing account of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf" rel="nofollow">learning from experience</a>&nbsp;illustrates the affective dynamics of conflicting interests. &nbsp;And, on top of everything, career management is a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf" rel="nofollow">response to change</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;charged with affect. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcegs.pdf" rel="nofollow">Clinical evidence</a> sets out a spectrum of affect.&nbsp; It starts from fight-or-flight instinct.&nbsp; It moves into an account of approach-or-avoid emotion.&nbsp; It settles on a sustained feeling about how things are. &nbsp;But it has all has been lumped togather as 'emotional intelligence' - said to be good for personal development. &nbsp;And, while that supplies a conventional account of what works well or needs help, reform needs an account of what transforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" rel="nofollow">professional thinking</a>&nbsp;</strong>sets out a three-fold spectrum of career-management affect. &nbsp;What sense do your students make of it?&nbsp; And recognise in their experience?...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;thinking on feeling-good in upbeat experience...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">self-esteem</strong> - widely thought to be necessary to achievement</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">confidence</strong> - said to be needed for risk-taking</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">ambition</strong> - held to be made possible by both</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;thinking on demanding attention is less upbeat than astringent...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">self-regulation</strong> - appeals for a disciplined state-of-mind</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">character</strong> - deals with difficulties and obstacles</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">resilience</strong> - is a bouncing-back response to loss or failure</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">mindfulness</strong> - a special focus on here-and-now reality</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;thinking on transformation engages the excitement of change...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">independence of mind - i</strong>nterrogating and confronting arbitrary influences</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">critical-thinking -</strong> an unwillingness to settle for the way things are</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">creativity&nbsp;</strong>- transforming how people see reality and how they will now live in it</li>
</ul>
<p>There's <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497" rel="nofollow">no consensus</a> here. &nbsp;There are view-points reflecting mixed feelings, different interests, and conflicting priorities.&nbsp; It is a narrative. &nbsp;And in a narrative nothing need be unchallenged, or under control, or believed without doubt. &nbsp;The thinking speaks of a <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/sbjournalarticle.pdf" rel="nofollow">rounded story</a>&nbsp;which has&nbsp;muddles to unpick, bad news to confront and minds to change. &nbsp;Nothing is taken for granted.</p>
<p>Careers work has plenty to consider - ranging from <a href="http://www.hse.ru/data/2013/01/28/1304836059/Standing. The_Precariat__The_New_Dangerous_Class__-Bloomsbury_USA(2011).pdf" rel="nofollow">precarious employment</a>, through&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21648627-controversial-new-book-says-islam-must-change-five-important-areas-thoughts-its" rel="nofollow">arbitrary religious demands</a>,&nbsp;to <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/12/sure-start-childrens-centres-face-worst-year-of-budget-cuts" rel="nofollow">neglected child care</a>.&nbsp; It brings&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.localschoolsnetwork.org.uk/2015/04/time-to-put-an-end-to-excessive-testing-of-our-children/" rel="nofollow">stress-related anxiety</a>&nbsp;where bad feelings can bury everything.&nbsp; It's hard to know where 'passion' belongs on this spectrum. &nbsp;But suppose it were a willingness to risk, endure, and suffer for something <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.allaboutjesuschrist.org/the-passion-of-jesus-faq.htm" rel="nofollow">bigger than self</a>? &nbsp;Wouldn't that change some minds? &nbsp;</p>
<p>And there's no ready-made script here.&nbsp; It's a hold-and-let-go process reaching beyond feel-good, and beyond demanding-attention, and leading to start-again transformation. &nbsp;Ready-for-anything flexibility is attainable when nothing is thought inevitable.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p><strong>3: &nbsp;BUOYANCY</strong></p>
<p>The idea of self-regulating character has a tough 'get-over-it' tone.&nbsp; As a teacher and lecturer I never found such 'pull-yourself-together' talk doing much to help angry or panicky students.&nbsp; And, these days, there's plenty to be angry and panicky&nbsp;about. &nbsp;There are also ways of making&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776" rel="nofollow">good use of bad news</a>, and that's part of what I'm calling&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf" rel="nofollow">buoyancy</a> - staying afloat in turbulent conditions. &nbsp;It's learned in day-by-day encounters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" rel="nofollow"><strong>professional thinking</strong></a>&nbsp;takes account of such encounters. &nbsp;Your colleagues will recognise them. &nbsp;But which do they think it worth strenthening as links?...</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;the most basic learning encounters are inter-personal...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">families facing tough times</strong> - for whom coping is a priority and who may prioritise a shared sense of what's right-and-proper</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">privileged families</strong> - whose wealth and contacts mean that they can expect success, protect these advantages and share them with chosen beneficiaries</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">neighbourhoods</strong> - where shared&nbsp;experience unites people, but when little is shared people become strangers to each other</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;locally-learned like-mindedness forms groups...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">gangs</strong> - where insiders display loyalty and allegiance, and outsiders are treated with hostility</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">devout</strong> - valuing what is thought of as spiritual and sometimes looking for religious obedience</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">associations</strong> - loosely organised clubs, societies and websites where people follow shared interests</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;institutions shape and frame resources for learning...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">organisations</strong> - with rules and roles like those of sport, clubs, cadets, leisure centres and scouts</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">schools and colleges</strong> - valued for what is examinable, but also for meeting your mates</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">businesses</strong> - where learning needs to be about customers, effort, costs and supply-and-demand</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">services&nbsp;</strong>- such, as careers and youth work, where people learn to deal with what's going on in neighbourhood and officialdom</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">officialdom</strong> - both nationally and locally shaping who gets access to what learning services and opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>Conventional thinking has developed&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hecsu.ac.uk/current_projects_graduate_market_trends.htm" rel="nofollow">a lot to say</a>&nbsp;iabout 'me-and-my-plan'. &nbsp;But wondering about which these locations are serving whose interests is a reforming conversation. &nbsp;Different locations, differently understood, make different sense of that.&nbsp; And&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf" rel="nofollow">community-interactive</a> talk signposts its possible breadth.&nbsp; While other evidence speaks of students&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30210514?SThisFB" rel="nofollow">learning from each other</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And so reform talk is shared, exploratory and releasing. &nbsp;It includes explaining to herself how she manages her life, or why his children are so precious, or how they feel about the invasion of change.&nbsp; And an employer at the civilised end of the commercial spectrum can recognise the value of that learning. &nbsp;So there can be plenty of hold-and-let&nbsp;reform talk. &nbsp;Conversation is buoyant when it lifts people, to where they can see how things are, and what needs changing, and where to make a start.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>education for a change</strong></p>
<p>Dealing with change can be thought to depend on character.&nbsp; Causes and effects then tidily fall into place: character comes from 'good' upbringing, and 'bad' upbringing causes failure. &nbsp;Research&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/psychological-perspectives-poverty" rel="nofollow">probes the thinking</a>,&nbsp;exposing it's self-serving unfairness. &nbsp;The poor are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/rethinking-unemployment-and-the-work-ethic-beyond-the-quasi-titmuss-paradigm-by-andrew-dunn/2017770.article" rel="nofollow">deprived</a>&nbsp;by an officialdom which chooses to see them as authors of their plight. &nbsp;While educators are vulnerable to attempted capture as <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=2017752" rel="nofollow">agents of control</a>. &nbsp;Snobbery is a prototype of such discrimination, laying blame where no blame belongs. &nbsp;The damage is at its greatest when provoking anger about who is worth holding onto and who can go and fuck themselves. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever those feelings are, that is an educator's starting point - the opening of a conversation.&nbsp; Educators need to hear talk of 'where we live', 'what it's like' and 'how we feel about it'. &nbsp;They also need to hear about 'who we know', 'how they are respected', and 'why they can be trusted'. &nbsp;So how do educators rate in this exchange? &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's worth asking what teacher-talk gets as much as a nod...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'learning gets you ready to claim your place in society'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'that means your work-life and citizenship'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'there's no hope in giving up on either'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'not for you and not for anybody you care about'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'a free society means people have the right to live by their beliefs'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;'but nobody has a right to impose their beliefs on you'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'not the people who treat you badly'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'not the people who are close to you'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>'we all need each other's help in finding how things can be better'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'not forgetting the past but not living in obedience to it'&nbsp;<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'you and your people can be bigger than that'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'learning how big you can be is what education is for'</em></p>
<p>Would they know what this teacher is talking about? &nbsp;Anything to say to each other? &nbsp;Worth setting down? &nbsp;Suppose they come up with another version - by making a movie, showing others and hatching a plan? &nbsp;So they are revisiting remembered experience, but attributing new meaning, and finding reformed purpose. &nbsp;That can become self-propelled hold-and-let. &nbsp;Then it's buoyancy.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>what's left of rights</strong></p>
<p>Not everybody sees education that way; and it really is vulnerable to <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776" rel="nofollow">capture</a> by dominant interests.&nbsp; A much-canvassed interest in education is for employability. &nbsp;But employability is a moving target - not a cause of anything, but a wavering effect of recruitment rates. &nbsp;Nonetheless it's pushed by commerce, majorities and convention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's put to a test by the idea of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/RARDM2ETwdWn9euNSmdV/full#.VNC8R0Ik-JU" rel="nofollow">career image</a>&nbsp;- looking good to recruiters in...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'appearance' --- 'attractiveness' --- 'self-presentation'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call it the cosmetic curriculum. &nbsp;And the best career work in the world can't jig it to create jobs or improve conditions. &nbsp;What it can do is change the pecking order for available work.&nbsp; But that doesn't favour ability, it favours people&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/128348-sincerity---if-you-can-fake-that-you-ve-got-it" rel="nofollow">who can fake</a> it, because recruiters are <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jasp.12157/abstract" rel="nofollow">not hard to deceive</a>. &nbsp;Is this what convention means by employability: business assigning success to image? faces-that-don't-fit discarded? myth excluding reality?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are faces-that-don't-fit all over:&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/02/many-pupils-are-expelled-illegally-and-not-as-a-last-resort-charity-alleges" rel="nofollow">students who kick over tracers</a>, <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/comment/opinion/the-big-grants-the-big-papers-are-we-missing-something/2017894.article" rel="nofollow">independent researchers held back</a>,&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.socialsciencespace.com/2014/12/ref-an-idea-whose-time-never-came/" rel="nofollow">dissenting educators supressed</a>, <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/10/what-would-you-pay-to-be-happy" rel="nofollow">compliance commodified</a>,&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=11006155" rel="nofollow">the erosion of student rights</a>. &nbsp;At the same time the idea of <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/mkngtwork/cafimages.pdf" rel="nofollow">competitive employability</a>&nbsp;fails to understand work-life motivation.&nbsp; Workers in demanding jobs find <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0511.pdf" rel="nofollow">monetary rewards a disincentive</a>.&nbsp; They look for <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://deliveringhappiness.com/the-motivation-trifecta-autonomy-mastery-and-purpose" rel="nofollow">meaningful work satisfactions</a>,&nbsp;which - as it turns out - prove impossible to fake.</p>
<p>The cosmetic curriculum will collapse - it loses its edge when everybody learns to do it. &nbsp;It's a product of playground economics and will be displaced by a&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.neweconomics.org/blog/entry/labours-living-standards-index-does-it-go-far-enough?&utm_medium=email&utm_source=nefoundation&utm_content=3+-+Labours+living+standards+index++and+our+&utm_campaign=Feb-eletter-2015&source=Feb-eletter-2015" rel="nofollow">reliable account</a>&nbsp;of how things are. &nbsp;It has nothing to say about issues ranging from work-place well-being to planetary survival. &nbsp;&nbsp;But suppose it survives? &nbsp;You'll notice compliant workers, uniform in 'appearance, attractiveness and self-presentation'. &nbsp;While reforming independence-of-mind, creativity and critical thinking will have their unfit faces excluded. &nbsp;Try to imagine that.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p><strong>4: &nbsp;GRASP</strong></p>
<p>Dealing with the realities of career management calls for what I'm calling reach and grasp. &nbsp;I mentioned reach earlier - learning that helps here-and-now action. &nbsp;But reach needs grasp - carrying learning to some there-and-then action. &nbsp;Any hold-and-let process needs breadth in reach and strength in grasp. &nbsp;And in any collection of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30210514?SThisFB" rel="nofollow">education aims</a>&nbsp;that grasp is part of meta-learning - learning to learn. &nbsp;It is knowing what to do in who-knows-what futures. &nbsp;It is not learn-and-score now, it's learn-as-needed later. &nbsp;The more unexpected the later the greater the need for grasp. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's no quick-fix. &nbsp;Meta-learning's grasp is engaged stage-by-stage: from getting a sense of what's going on, through sifting that into useful order, onto focusing what matters, to getting an understanding of the causes-and-effects to be managed. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf" rel="nofollow">career learning</a>&nbsp;research sets out how to practice the process so that it becomes second nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But most learning is forgotten - because it's disposable, out-of-date, not used or inconvenient. &nbsp;Meta-learning thrives when it reminds students of their lives so that their lives remind them of their learning. &nbsp;This learning is then transferred from where it's gained to where it's used. &nbsp;It's&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf" rel="nofollow">learning for living</a>, it's&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf" rel="nofollow">infinitely reusable</a>, and it's ready for anything.</p>
<p>Enabling grasp is no pushover.&nbsp; Few are in a better position than <a href="https://www.tesdigital.com/magazine" rel="nofollow">educators to do it</a> (23/01/2015 pp. 26-29).&nbsp; But convention pushes them for prescribed performance, and meta-learning doesn't lead to ready-made prescriptions. &nbsp;Indeed, students - having learned hold-and-let processes - might let convention go.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>meta conversation</strong></p>
<p>So - with no ready-made answers, to unforeseen futures, in ready-for-anything flexibility -&nbsp;how can the conversation go? &nbsp;A conversationally-worded version of <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf" rel="nofollow">career-learning</a> opens up some wondering...</p>
<p>in <strong>finding out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what's going on?'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'am I being pushed?'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'held back?'</em></p>
<p>in <strong>sorting out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'why does it matter?'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'what can I be sure of?'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'who's involved?'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in <strong>checking out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'who and what is important?'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'why?'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'what can anybody say and do about this?'</em></p>
<p>in <strong>figuring out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what will I say and do about it?'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'with who and about what?'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'how will that work out?'<br /></em></p>
<p>There's no prescripted endpoint here. &nbsp;But that doesn't exclude evidence of outcomes. &nbsp;A feature of <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8844" rel="nofollow">creativity</a>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;unwillingness to allow the past to control the future. &nbsp;And some versions of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/01/long-term-thinking-investment-internet-age" rel="nofollow">resilience</a>&nbsp;thinking show how impatience damages the process. &nbsp;Similar losses are found in work-life where there is&nbsp;<a href="http://asq.sagepub.com/content/60/2/189.full" rel="nofollow">unresisted control</a>. &nbsp;And creativity is found to depend on the very ambiguity that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20159814?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" rel="nofollow">impatience represses</a>.&nbsp; In positive terms this means that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-organized-mind-by-daniel-j-levitin-1408137852" rel="nofollow">new thnking is enjoyable</a>.&nbsp; So, could joyousness be an <a href="http://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/2014/06/24/ctq_faridi_finland.html" rel="nofollow">outcome of education</a>? &nbsp;The question is worth asking because teachers are reported to find the curriculum '<a href="https://www.tesdigital.com/magazine" rel="nofollow">staggeringly dull</a>'&nbsp;(17/07/2015 pp. 6-7). &nbsp;I wonder whether Ofsted knows about this. &nbsp;Or whether a conversation about grasping uncertain futures with no prescribed anchorages calls for a greater breadth of mind.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>grouded help</strong></p>
<p>And having no ready-made endpoint does not consign grasp to a social vacuum. &nbsp;Meta-learning works in social settings - agency, church, museum and more. &nbsp;It is a grounded network where people apply grasp to life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" rel="nofollow"><strong>professional thinking</strong></a> can here re-examine the help it offers as part of a range. &nbsp;But what most count are students' ideas about who in that range is worth calling on - or not...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;there are formal outfits claiming trained expertise...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">careers services </strong>- often what people first think of, but seriously under-resourced, providing information to identify work-life possibilities</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">careers education </strong>- delivered as 'lessons' in schools and colleges, though variable in materials and in designated staff</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">mainstream education</strong> - where educators get to know students over a prolonged period, including the few who can link learning to experience</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">colleges, apprenticeships and universities</strong> - offering opportunities to compete for improved life chances, and for adventures with new people</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;in some outfits the offer is supplementary to core commitments...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">churches, mosques, synagogues and temples</strong> - based on deeply-held and detailed principles, and sometimes more diffusely spiritual</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">community agencies</strong> - often with links to education and sometimes voluntary, with an understanding of local conditions and experience</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">libraries, museums, galleries and collections</strong> - where visitors gaze at what fascinates, look for more, find surprises and buy reminders</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;some <strong>on-line outfits are&nbsp;</strong>professional, some fun, some irresponsible...&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">career websites</strong> - often careers-education-based and digitising its material, some of it interactively diagnostic</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">dedicated websites </strong>- setting out specific aspects of career experience, usually in narrative form and for interactive use</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">social media</strong> - on-line exchange of impressions and advice, including career concerns, which may be poorly informed</li>
</ul>
<p>Different sources are familiar to different people.&nbsp; But each is <a href="https://berarespectingchildren.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/bera-fair-equal-final.pdf" rel="nofollow">designed to help</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;formally or informally. &nbsp;Some do more harm than good. &nbsp;Some are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/jul/23/museums-should-charge-entrance-fees" rel="nofollow">under threat</a>. &nbsp;So students need to be savvy in their use.</p>
<p>This is not comfort-zone stuff. &nbsp;Nothing moves until students find help worth holding onto or contacts needing to be let go. &nbsp;And that's&nbsp;troublesome, because it turns things on their head - whatever information, advice and guidance there may be is conceived by students and offered to helpers.&nbsp; This is not convention: meta-learning enables students in a life-long grasp of agency - and that agency can be for reform. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5: &nbsp;DIRECTION</strong></p>
<p>Change is not what it used to be. &nbsp;Once upon a time humanity learned to live with change brought about by such innovations as migration,&nbsp;cities, telescopes, print and industry. &nbsp;Each brings crisis, and we deal with it by seeing things differently - and doing accordingly. &nbsp;But that <em style="line-height: 1.5em;">was</em> change-after-change, this <em style="line-height: 1.5em;">is</em> change-upon-change. &nbsp;Today's crises simultaneously ride on massive increases in commercial leverage, dizzying technological advance, and constantly repositioning cultures. &nbsp;It's been called a '<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/03/britain-economic-crisis-public" rel="nofollow">crisis like no other</a>'. &nbsp;Sociology characterises it as <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/cafculture.pdf" rel="nofollow">liquid modernity</a>&nbsp;- the imagery is of evidence drowned by celebrity, reflection sinking in impatience, and producing a pathetic splash compared with consuming. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The imagery of clinging on was never more apposite. &nbsp;It's true that we&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094" rel="nofollow">mostly learn from failure</a>, and that now means learning to stay afloat in the backwash of change. &nbsp;Careers work cannot, so to speak, duck this. &nbsp;And in the resulting conversation convention will find few twentieth-century answers to twenty-first-century questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>finding chaos</strong></p>
<p>There's no shortage of career conversations - lots of talk. &nbsp;Conventional wisdom positions walking-the-walk ahead of talking-the-talk. &nbsp;It's wrong - we need the talk to signpost the walk. &nbsp;So what might students find worth talking about? &nbsp;Careers work has a good lead on this; looking for student's signposts by inviting them to talk about...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'...songs, movies and stories - I'll never forget'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'...memories - that bother me'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'...dreams - that keep coming back'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'...experiences - that surprise and excite me'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'...what somebody said - that makes me think again'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'...surprises - I find hard to forget'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'...people I've met - like I've never met before'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'...new possibilities - that have just come into view'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'...pressures - that are hard to resist'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'...people - that I could never let down'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'...relationships - that I'm beginning to question'<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'...promises - that I won't break'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until such talk been heeded the conversation has no starting point.&nbsp; Listening to <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/JVB Feb 11 YJVBE2475.pdf" rel="nofollow">what is going on in a life</a> belongs to thoughtful careers work.&nbsp; But not to all of it - and there is some jostling for position. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/07/eyond-mindfulness-horse-riding-eating-greens-walk-depression-anxiety-cbt" rel="nofollow">Cognitive behaviour therapy</a> and its variations pursue one-off mind control rather than enduring understanding. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/NICECCoach.pdf" rel="nofollow">Career coaching</a>&nbsp;speaks only of individuals and winning.&nbsp; <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000187910900058X" rel="nofollow">Psychological constructs</a>&nbsp;use expert insights to shape individual memories. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://careersintheory.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/applied-chaos/" rel="nofollow">Chaos theory</a>&nbsp;is a newcomer, boldly taking on change, but bolstering practice in an alliance with psychological constructivism. &nbsp;The publication of that chaos-alliance has been welcomed as&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H6NP9v6KNVIC&pg=PR2&lpg=PR2&dq=savikas+chaos+the+theory+we've+been+waiting+for&source=bl&ots=_CXIerGtix&sig=YSo7qFAnL9hFqqXs7zVHMT2MWyk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GzsRVfzqJ5OP7AbohoCYCA&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=savikas chaos the theory we've been waiting for&f=false" rel="nofollow">'the book we've all been waiting for'</a>. &nbsp;Not by me.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>managing chaos</strong></p>
<p>When psychologists run out of things to say about career they'd do better turning to sociology than to chaos theory.&nbsp; Physics increasingly sees <a href="http://gu.com/p/49mht" rel="nofollow">chaos theory as a fad</a>. &nbsp;And, anyway, the unpredictable is not necessarily chaotic and feeling chaotic is not the same as being chaotic. &nbsp;But the chaos-alliance plot-line wins converts - chaos feels like hell and psychological constructs look like salvation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But it ain't necessarily so. &nbsp;There's no case for upgrading chaotic feelings to chaos theory. &nbsp;The alliance is right to acknowledge chaotic feelings.&nbsp; But the narrative needs more than psychological constructs offer.&nbsp; A <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" rel="nofollow">convincing narrative</a> speaks of both individual and shared experience. &nbsp;Chaotic feelings stem from a spectrum of the who-what-how-when-and-why of what's going on. &nbsp;And there are people in there, doing their thing. &nbsp;So both psychological and social constructs must feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But social constructs can't count on a good press - identity politics don't like them.&nbsp; Anyone defending the rights of gender, race and sexuality see social influences as <a href="http://oakes.ucsc.edu/academics/Core Course/oakes-core-awards-2012/laura-flores.html" rel="nofollow">entrapment</a>. &nbsp;Actually the evidence is better balanced -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf" rel="nofollow">socially acquired beliefs</a> are not bound to mislead, and <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/careerlearning.html" rel="nofollow">individually held beliefs</a> are not bound to be reliable. &nbsp;Emerging&nbsp;evidence shows how we need to be clearer about race and <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1111/hequ.12074?r3_referer=wol&tracking_action=preview_click&show_checkout=1&purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED" rel="nofollow">class interaction</a>. &nbsp;Some&nbsp;dangerously&nbsp;dare to confront the confusion of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://vimeo.com/79811169" rel="nofollow">race and class</a>. &nbsp;Too dangerously? &nbsp;Worth talking about? &nbsp;Because any conversation coming out of this spectrum must face the pushes and pulls of all its dynamics. &nbsp;</p>
<p>None of this can bring a halt to change-upon-change or dissolve chaotic feelings. &nbsp;But it can release the depth and breadth of an independently-minded, critically-thinking and creatively-engaged humanity. &nbsp;And that will call on both psychological and <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://thegreatrefusal.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/bourdieu-deviance-from-constructionism/" rel="nofollow">social constructs</a>. &nbsp;The conversation then becomes less about experts developing career, and more about&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUW8V7Jupns&feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">students managing career</a>.&nbsp; The insights that count speak of the feelings they start from, the hope they look for, and the purposes they find.&nbsp; Their management of these let-go-hold-on processes transforms entrapment into release. &nbsp;Students become their own life-enhancing&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www2.mmu.ac.uk/mcys/" rel="nofollow">researchers</a>&nbsp;- as well as&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2015/02/17/martin-sheen-tells-pupils-to-walk-with-him-to-social-activism.aspx" rel="nofollow">agents of change</a>.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>space and credibility</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is no hit-and-run agenda. &nbsp;It expands the reach and grasp&nbsp;of career learning. &nbsp;It confronts chaotic feelings, bad news and deception. &nbsp;It enables the transforming use of all such confusion. &nbsp;It releases independent, creative and critical thinking into a change-upon-changing world.&nbsp; And it processes a troublesome but necessary hold-and-let process. &nbsp;It overtakes convention and engages reform.</p>
<p>This is learning that can only be acquired <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf" rel="nofollow">stage-by-stage</a>.&nbsp; Students trial methods, gaining a tangible sense for what needs to be done.&nbsp; Real-time practice connects learning to living.&nbsp; Rehearsed tactics gather feedback to sharpen ready-for-anything flexibility. &nbsp;These are heavy-duty demands on educators, who need to be in position to design programmes and make them happen.&nbsp; It means establishing credibility with colleagues and students, and alertness to the significance of students claiming their rights and finding fulfillment.&nbsp; Not every teacher is like that.&nbsp; But this work doesn't need a recruited many, it's looking for a committed few - with their expanding repertoire for action.</p>
<p>This reform is widely applicable. &nbsp;The hold-and-let process may be most engaged by the <a href="http://shop.niace.org.uk" rel="nofollow">decade-upon-decade experience</a> of older people.&nbsp; And it is particularly applicable to people for whom&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/cafBuonfino.pdf" rel="nofollow">blame-upon-blame</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2195" rel="nofollow">squeezed out all ambition</a>. &nbsp;But we must fully round out the range of applications. &nbsp;And that means calling on the future altruism of the self-excluding, whose past engineering has given them&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/31/inheritance-britain-wealthy-study-surnames-social-mobility" rel="nofollow">minority advantage at majority expense</a>. &nbsp;I think that would count as reform.</p>
<p>This work needs more time and space than convention, from&nbsp;its marginal position, has been able to find. &nbsp;It needs the&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8844" rel="nofollow">knowledge, commitment and credibility</a> that can only come from mainstream <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/moving on/cafcurriculum.pdf" rel="nofollow">curriculum</a>.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>sensibility and sense</strong></p>
<p>It's no doddle - this kind of bothersome thinking is best&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" rel="nofollow">set out as narrative</a>. &nbsp;And educators can find any number of images.&nbsp; The well-written ones intrigue: like the&nbsp;<a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2015/03/cinderella-â-disneyâs-newest-âellaâ-both-courageous-and-kind" rel="nofollow">pretty as courageous</a>; the victim who&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392170/" rel="nofollow">changes everything</a>;&nbsp;bad news as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/24/migrants-leave-home-future-past-borders" rel="nofollow">loss and gain</a>; entrapment that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.psychotherapy.com.au/fileadmin/site_files/pdfs/TheDoubleBindTheory.pdf" rel="nofollow">brings release</a>. &nbsp;These are stories that rise above clich&eacute; and engage year-on-year questioning. &nbsp;They belong to a curriculum for reformed careers education. &nbsp;But where in curriculum?&nbsp; Conventional thinking looks for links with science, technology engineering and maths (STEM).&nbsp; But narrative thinking links to&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/cafbiog.pdf" rel="nofollow">history and literature</a> - history for its cultural perspectives, literature for its personal proximities, both asking...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'...what sense are these people making of their lives?'</em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;<br /></em><em style="line-height: 1.5em;">'...what sense am I making of these people?'</em></p>
<p>Few storytellers better pose such questions than the creator of <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/sense-and-sensibility/" rel="nofollow">Elinor Dashwood</a>. &nbsp;Her narratives recount cultural and personal sensibilities - telling of a culture that can't let go of gentility, and a gentility that can't take hold of opportunity.&nbsp; For Elinor hope needs unforeseen chance to realise a longed-for-life. &nbsp;The story still works because, in both yesterday's and today's <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf" rel="nofollow">cultural enclaves</a>, there are hold-and-let entanglements. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My early-life theological training drew heavily on history and literature. &nbsp;It persuades me that these two disciplines&nbsp;might be where light is most usefully thrown on what can be learned from religion - and what can't. &nbsp;In all events, history and literature is where curriculum pushes at conventional boundaries, welcomes surprises and risks offence. &nbsp;It's where well-written accounts illuminate experience. &nbsp;And if, for some, it points to STEM then that will be a more reiable signpost - not bowled over by persuasion but realised by discovery.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>which way forward</strong></p>
<p>The chances of <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf" rel="nofollow">survival</a> rest on two make-or-break questions.&nbsp; From a long-ago savanna to a barely-recognisable high-street people need to know...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what's going on?' ... </em>and&nbsp;<em>... 'what can anybody do about it?'</em></p>
<p>Survival is more likely when causes are identified earlier, so that effects can be based on them later. &nbsp;This is horse-and-cart thinking. - things work out better that way round. &nbsp;But not everybody sees things that way round.&nbsp; People who <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview" rel="nofollow">think they already know</a> what to do harness their horses to jump the causes and gallop in pursuit of effects. &nbsp;The trouble is that it's the causes that are present realities; the effects are&nbsp;merely future constructs.&nbsp; Any other talk is evasion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And evasion need to be managed - which, the evidence shows, entails <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094" rel="nofollow">maneuvering</a>.&nbsp; That evidence is of obfuscating facts, capturing support and - if all else fails - telling lies. &nbsp;Part of it recounts devious <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/cafetzioni.docx" rel="nofollow">economics-politics collusion</a>. &nbsp;Conventional thinking has found <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8875" rel="nofollow">no way out</a>&nbsp;of the mess. &nbsp;Its allies in commerce and politics trot out answers to questions they've never bothered to ask. &nbsp;This is obstructive and needs to be let go.</p>
<p>Establishments position their influential windows over decades - in the UK the 80's saw a massive and sustained re-alignment of priorities. &nbsp;But there is no correct alignment. &nbsp;The window outlines the sort of society that the politics needs the electorate to favour. &nbsp;This is not rectitude, it's&nbsp;maneuvering.</p>
<p>Reform looks elsewhere - among agencies which are neither politics nor commerce but&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf" rel="nofollow">civil society</a>. &nbsp;Those interests are best represented by locally-rooted and in-touch <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" rel="nofollow">stakeholders</a>. &nbsp;And contemporary stakeholders speak of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/mkngtwork/caffrmwrk.pdf" rel="nofollow">changing expectations</a>&nbsp;concerning what can and should happen. &nbsp;People are learning to see things differently, triggering new <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf" rel="nofollow">ways of managing change</a>. &nbsp;And in contemporary change-conditions - needing ready-for-anything flexibility - independence-of mind, critical-thinking and creativity are essential to reform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The argument is an extension of decade-by-decade thought-and-action. &nbsp;A version begins with <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/CPIpdfs/cafcpiz.pdf" rel="nofollow">matching</a> people to destinations. &nbsp;Its listing of information allows the assignment of an individual to what is judged suitable work.&nbsp; But, early on, thinking acknowledges the dynamics of social groups engaged in <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf" rel="nofollow">community-interaction</a>.&nbsp; And that calls for an understanding of how social links, set up in families and neighbourhoods, feature in what people do. &nbsp;That thinking then calls for an understanding which can deal with growing complexities, triggering <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnoriginal.pdf" rel="nofollow">learning theory</a>&nbsp;as a progressive thought-and-feeling process.&nbsp; It enables people for self-propelled career management in finding and negotiating fulfillment in life. &nbsp;But both community interaction and learning theory are most convincingly expressed in <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbnarrative.pdf" rel="nofollow">narrative</a> terms. &nbsp;People find more sense in recounted stories than in collated lists. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Research-and-development is unstoppable. &nbsp;So we should not be surprised to find a process for interrogated what, in all this, is worth holding onto and what must be let go. &nbsp;Reform is an assembly of thought-and-action in support of ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; And that calls for more than a single test of validity. &nbsp;But, whatever the test, it can only be administered by stakeholders. &nbsp;It's a local call, because the curriculum is community property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thinking poses two supplementary questions concerning community realities and possibilities...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'...what works for how things are?...'<br /></em><em>'...and what does not?'</em></p>
<p>They are hold-on-or-letting-go questions.</p>
