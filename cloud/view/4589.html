			<h3>Feedback from the Cyprus workshop Sept 10</h3>
<h3>Q1. Have your objectives for the workshop been met (what were these?)</h3>
<p>&nbsp;Learning design &ndash; We got some innovative ideas about designing and organising lessons with the implementation of new technology</p>
<p>Yes, though we would like to have further time to explore the tools used in the workshop. The aim: to see how ICT comes into the lesson through a design model</p>
<p>Obj: How to design courses using ICT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met: Yes to a high degree</p>
<p>Not sure, not very clear</p>
<p>Partly, yes. Using learning design theory to create technology-infused lessons</p>

<p>Communication - sharing &ndash; community</p>
<p>Interesting &ndash; collaborative - engaging</p>
<h3>Q3. What 3 words would you use to describe the CompendiumLD notation?</h3>

<p>Hands-on, collaboration, interaction</p>
<p>Interaction with team members</p>
<p>Information about new tools (tools that we didn&rsquo;t know)</p>
<p>Heard about the current state of learning design</p>
<p>Heard about the current state of the educational system</p>
<p>Flexibility</p>
<p>Diversity of opinions</p>
<h3>Q5. What didn&rsquo;t you like or could be improved?</h3>
<p>Each group could present their learning design procedure more systematically to all other groups (e.g. jigsaw groups formed at the end)</p>
<p>Knowing the tools before</p>
<p>Nothing</p>
<p>There was not enough time to become familiar with the tools</p>
<p>We did not announce group&rsquo;s results</p>
<p>Lack of feedback after each activity (need to share as a whole after each activity)</p>
<p>Instructions for some activities were not very clear</p>
<p>Hands on practice with the web 2.0 tools or demonstration of the basic features of the 4 web 2.0 tools&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Q6. What action points have you identified as a result of this workshop?</h3>
<p>A new process of lesson planning</p>
<p>Macro- and meso- level</p>
<p>Communication vs interactivity</p>
<p>Better course planning which will include the web 2.0 tools</p>
<p>Planning in a new format</p>
<p>Reconceptualisation&nbsp; of the way technology is to be used in each of the lesson plan phases</p>			<div class="posted-by">
