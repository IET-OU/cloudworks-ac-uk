        <h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>Where are you coming from? What is the context in which you are working and participating in OLDS MOOC?</em></p>
<p>I have been a instructional designer for 11 years in a corporate environment.&nbsp; This class was brought to my attention by a co-worker.&nbsp; I had heard abouts MOOCs and thought that this would be an interesting expereince.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>What did you hope to achieve? What were your goals in joining OLDS MOOC? </em></p>
<p>My hope for joining this MOOC was to find out how other designers looked at projects, get tips on ways to present information, and get to meet new people from other countries.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>What did you do? What were the main events, interactions, practices and activities in which you participated? <em>What were the obstacles - and how did you tackle them?</em></em></p>
<p>Going into the class, I didn't have a particular project in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;I quickly came up with an idea, but in the end I adopted the one that had been suggested by my co-worker.&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew going in that I would mainly be working on class on Saturday mornings while my husband was at work, so I was aware that some weeks, I might start off a bit behind, but I was also trying to work on some of the tasks ahead of time as well.&nbsp; Being across the pond in many ways helped a bit because I could see other people's posts before I made mine to get an idea of how people were tackling each activity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>What were the outcomes of your participation? Did you meet your goals? What went well, what didn't? What unexpected outcomes did you notice?</em></p>
<p>I very much enjoyed participating.&nbsp; Some subjects were more interesting to me than others, but I was determined to participate every week.&nbsp; I very much enjoyed reading and commenting on the design ideas.&nbsp; I was happy how I was able to contribute suggestions on some of the topics that I read.&nbsp; One of my favorites was a collaborative writing project for year 3 students <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7166" rel="nofollow">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7166</a>. I hope that the project went well for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to keep in mind some of the projects when looking for tools and sites that would be helpful (OER sites) in hoping that those who may still be following the MOOC might see the listing and be able to take advantage of the sites for their own work.</p>
<p>My biggest challenge was working with the various tools.&nbsp; Intially, I felt too many sites and tools introduced too quickly (especially the map), I think that might have put many people off.&nbsp; Also, I didn't like how the open discussion site was set up on Google - the threads were not cleanly set up and the page appeared to get messy quite quickly.&nbsp; In the end I did not end up going there vey often.&nbsp; Even wtih the challenges,&nbsp;I was determined to continue.</p>
<p>I made an effort each week to read the posts and add comments.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>What did you learn? What advice could you give others?</em></p>
<p>I did pick up on some new tools that I did not have before and it allowed me to think of ways that I and others could take advantage of them.</p>
<p>Since most of the class was focused on academic learning, I hope I was able to bring a different perspective to others in my posts and comments.</p>
<p>For someone new - I would suggest getting familiar with all of the tools being used starting two weeks in advance of the course.&nbsp;</p>    </div>
