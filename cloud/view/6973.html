        <p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>This paper tracks the development of a career-management narrative technique called &lsquo;three-scene storyboarding&rsquo; <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Law, 2012)</a>.&nbsp; The method invites the recounting of significant events - things happening, involving other people, displaying points-of-view and calling up personal thoughts and feelings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An important side-effect of this work is for finding the dissonances, and they have compelling research implications.&nbsp; The dissonances are between the different ways in which career management is spoken of by government, among professionals and in this narrated experience.&nbsp; The uses of narrative help us better to understand the reciprocal positioning of business interests, policy imperatives and professional expertise.&nbsp; They also help us to understand the disconnection of all of that from day-to-day realities of personal and community living <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/http;/www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Law, 2013)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>decision making and moving on</strong></p>
<p>The aim of storyboarding is to enable people to find meaning and establish purpose for moving on in life. &nbsp;The person is invited to set down a words-and-images account of an episode in which there is a turning-point - a scene where things can be changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The appeal to narrated episodes and scenes is distinctive in careers work.&nbsp; It allows for a more progressive and less stark engagement than does matching a person to an opportunity. &nbsp;The uses of storyboarding are less about decision-making for immediate action.&nbsp; They are also less about choice between a range of options.&nbsp; Instead storyboarding sets down a scene-by-scene narrative of moving on - from a remembered past to an anticipated future.&nbsp; And, in that process, a person works on what from the past to hold onto, and what to let go.&nbsp; Decision and choices are made, but they are contained within a broader and deeper account of how a person is moving on in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>expertise and experience</strong></p>
<p>The development of storyboarding is a response to changing economic and cultural conditions - where, increasingly, career options are constrained, persuasive pressures are intensified, and work-life flexibility is required <a title="professionalism.pdf" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Law, 2011)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The uses of narrative shifts focus - away from what professional helpers know, and towards what people do.&nbsp; It repositions careers work - less on expertise, more on experience.&nbsp; The appropriate terms are, then, not of professional knowledge of &lsquo;career development&rsquo;, but of people's experience in &lsquo;career management&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the UK that experience is rapidly changing, increasingly disturbing and seemingly chaotic.&nbsp; <a title="Baumann" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Liquid-Modernity-Zygmunt-Bauman/dp/0745624103/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1357896745&sr=1-6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zygmunt Baumann (2000)</a>&nbsp; calls that perpetual re-shaping 'liquid modernity'.&nbsp; Storyboarding is designed to enable people - in that apparent chaos - to attribute meaning, to arrive at purposes, and to interrogate that narrative to where it becomes appropriate and sustainable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process calls up visualisations of personal flexibility - and, therefore, of social mobility.&nbsp; An underlying philosophical assumption is that nothing that anybody does about anything need be inevitable.&nbsp; <a title="Dennett" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias=stripbooks&field-keywords=daniel+dennett+freedom+evolves" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Daniel Dennett (2003) </a>refers to such freedoms as 'evitability'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>analysis and narrative<br /></strong></p>
<p>For the first hundred years of careers work its processes and materials were designed for expanding economies - which they have best served. &nbsp; A persistent aim has been to enable client employability.&nbsp; A greater part of the process is to diagnose by psychological assessments, and these are framed by labour-market requirements.&nbsp; A major task is to match that psychology to that economics.&nbsp; Much of UK careers-work expertise is currently defined, trained and credited in such terms <a title="CDI" href="http://www.careermark.co.uk/news/career-development-institute-and-careers-profession-register" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(CDI, undated)</a>.</p>
<p>But employability is not a reliable concept: a single diagnosis produces variable results.&nbsp; That one person, on that single occasion, is shown to have more and less employability as the economy expands and contracts.&nbsp; Employability is less in the characteristics of the person, and more in the availability of the work.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are cultural shifts undermining the usefulness of the term employability.&nbsp; Trail-blazing signals are fired up in a commentary on contemporary career management <a title="Bunting" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Willing-Slaves-Overwork-Culture-Ruling/dp/000716372X/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1357898306&sr=1-1-spell" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Madeleine Bunting, 2004)</a>.&nbsp; It describes working life as having causes and consequences for well-being, for relationships and for health.&nbsp; These concerns do not feature in a tightly-focussed consideration of matched employability.&nbsp; Madeleine Bunting redirects attention to social settings and wider experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She attracted little attention in the careers-work field.&nbsp; But her analysis suggested a monograph <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/http;/www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Law, 2006a)</a> which contrasts the much-used term &lsquo;labour-market information&rsquo; with the newly-coined term &lsquo;labour-market experience&rsquo;.&nbsp; It argues that people are at least as responsive to their own experience as they are to professional help, to political urging or to commercial invitations.</p>
<p>There are closely-parallel calls in Greece for a repositioning of careers work (Chrysoula Kosmidou-Hardy, 1990 &amp; 2006).&nbsp; Such arguments respond to career-management concerns which take into account how working life affects all life - from personal well-being, through social congeniality to planetary survival <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/http;/www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Law, 2013)</a>.&nbsp; Careers workers live with a perpetual clamour - dominant interest groups claiming careers-work support for different positions on any of these concerns.&nbsp; Any headline can increase the volume.</p>
<p>A critical feature of all learning is how it is framed.&nbsp; Much of matching processes are expressed as lists - such as appear in worksheets, inventories, psychometrics and data-bases.&nbsp; But experience is best set down as a narrative - telling of how one thing leads to another.&nbsp; Lists cannot adequately represent such sequences.&nbsp; The distinction is developed in the monograph <em>Fewer Lists - More Stories</em> <a href="http://www.hihohiho/underpinning/cafbiog.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Law, 2006b)</a> which examines how career-management experience usefully can be set down in narrative forms.&nbsp; Three-scene storyboarding is a product of that thinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>possibility and pragmatism</strong></p>
<p>Daniel Dennett <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias=stripbooks&field-keywords=daniel+dennett+freedom+evolves" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(<em>op. cit.</em>)</a>, drawing on a range of evidence, develops modelling to illustrate an ontology of how people understand the way things are.&nbsp; He characterises <em>homo-sapiens </em>as having evolved to be able to identity a repertoire of possible meanings for any experience.&nbsp; He claims that we are, in that sense, free - all is 'evitable'.&nbsp; That multiple grasp on reality has survival value.&nbsp; And careers work needs a way of seeing how what has evolved on the savannah becomes useful in contemporary experience.&nbsp; Nothing need be inevitable.</p>
<p>Peter Sloterdijk <a title="Sloterdijk " href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Philosophy-Wisdom-Practice/dp/0231158718/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1357899280&sr=1-5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(2012)</a> moves the philosophy forward.&nbsp; He closely examines the epistemology of how we come to believe what is going on, and the ethics of how we find it worthwhile.&nbsp; Both are pragmatic questions.&nbsp; And Peter Sloterdijk&rsquo;s pragmatism is particularly useful to professional engagement with career-management narratives.&nbsp; He argues for connectedness to every-day experience, and for independence-of-mind in dealing with the clamour-for-attention surrounding careers-work professionals.</p>
<p>Calling on philosophical roots, especially Socrates and Plato, Peter Sloterdijk documents an age-by-age account of clamour and entrapment.&nbsp; He points to how, in each age - or 'epoch&eacute;' - prevailing academic abstractions allow social &eacute;lites to take over cultural beliefs.&nbsp; He illustrates how the resulting confusions distract people from the realities of every-day experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The analysis resonates with contemporary conditions: disconnection from experts is an escape from information overload, it prefers what plainly seems up-to-date, and that can mean pursuing the fashionable and the celebrated.&nbsp; All of this is, in part, dues to an educational failure to enable people to seek out multiple - and therefore conflicting - perspectives.&nbsp; Peter Sloterdijk refers to that education as acting like a sedative.&nbsp; Disconnection from expertise is reinforced by cultural persuaders who flatter, entice, bribe and threaten people into compliance.&nbsp; Each new epoch&eacute; cultivates its own manoeuvring culture.&nbsp; And if people are not confused by that, then they are simply not paying enough attention.&nbsp; As, Peter Sloterdijk fears, too many do not.</p>
<p>The coming-and-going of these successive epoch&eacute;s is accelerating, and some people wax &lsquo;nostalgic&rsquo; for what, to others, belongs to the relatively recent past.&nbsp; But nostalgia, which is reflected in various &lsquo;inheritance&rsquo; interests, is largely about seeing how a failing past contrasts with a succeeding present.&nbsp; Each epoch&eacute;&rsquo;s &eacute;lites persuade people to believe that &lsquo;there has been little of any truth or value here, until we arrived&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, despite the efforts of the persuaders, some people&rsquo;s direct-and-personal experience teaches them that the claims of the &eacute;lites are false.&nbsp; They disconnect from that way-of-seeing things.&nbsp; It can reach a point of cultivating contemptuous distrust of all &eacute;lites, and turning to each other for trusted support.&nbsp; That isolation makes it easy for dominant interests to blame marginalised victims for the damage done to them.&nbsp; It is a dynamic that can cause deep and dangerous fragmentations in society.</p>
<p>Peter Sloterdijk&rsquo;s underpinning for this account is well-grounded, multilayered, subtle and recursive.&nbsp; But that tightly-interwoven discourse is tied to three themes - each of them critically important to careers-work professionalism...</p>
<ul>
<li>how influential &eacute;lites are formed</li>
<li>how people comply with &eacute;litist persuasion</li>
<li>how all can be reconnected to authentic experience</li>
</ul>
<p>The argument is set out in pragmatically philosophical terms, expanding the dominantly psychological and economic thinking of conventional careers work.&nbsp; Peter Sloterdijk&rsquo;s work demands that we understand careers-work in relation to the society it inhabits and to the culture which that society cultivates.&nbsp; A corollary is that connectedness needs to be predicated - to what is it to be connected?&nbsp; There are far-reaching implications for the purposes of education - and for the repositioning of careers work research-and-development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>shareholding and stakeholding</strong></p>
<p>The features of narrative - its moving through a before-during-and-after sequence, the way points-of-view move it on, how different social settings set up different expectations - all of this responds to Peter Sloterdijk's thinking.&nbsp; The only way in which such experience can be set down is through narrative.&nbsp; And all narration speaks of expectation, meaning and purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each narrative is also widely connected in its society.&nbsp; It means that its uses can be realised in a range of social settings, and can call on many different partners.&nbsp; And so the uses of narrative connect to voluntary and professional activity, engaging both face-to-face work and learning programmes, and in both the public and private sectors.&nbsp; Storyboarding is a careers-work research-and-development tool best engaged in multi-agency partnerships.</p>
<p>But connected to what?&nbsp; All interests claim that careers work is in the interests of clients.&nbsp; Peter Sloterdijk points how to critically interrogate that claim.&nbsp; He asks what &eacute;lite professional, commercial and policy interests are also at stake.&nbsp; In the business-world and in neo-liberal thinking these are shareholder interests.&nbsp; A more comprehensive connectedness would link not just to shareholders but also to stakeholders.&nbsp; These are the people and groups - most of them far from dominantly influential - all with an interest in how careers work works.&nbsp; The research-and-development agenda would then be predicated on...</p>
<ul>
<li>clients and students - their families - their neighbourhoods - and community groups</li>
<li>local business - national economy - global business</li>
<li>local planning - national and European policy - global trends</li>
<li>the employed - under-employed - exploited - unemployed - and enterprising</li>
<li>professional helpers - voluntary organisations - socially enterprising outfits</li>
</ul>
<p>Research is only as good as the questions it poses.&nbsp; The repositioning of careers work raises issues for the research questions posed and the methodologies engaged by its professionalism.&nbsp; It also calls for new thinking on who, and in what situations, careers workers are able usefully to shape the questions and design the methodologies.&nbsp; But, most comprehensively, it opens a research-and-development agenda in which no voice is allowed to dominate, and none goes unheard.</p>
