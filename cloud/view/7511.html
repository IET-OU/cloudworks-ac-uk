        <p>I work in the University of Sheffield School of Clinical Dentistry, we have a programme called <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/schools/outreach-programmes/adopt" rel="nofollow">ADOPT</a> to help students from under-represented backgrounds with applying to dental schools. It is a fantastic and very successful programme.&nbsp;<br /><br />We would like to create an open course so that students from outside our area can benefit from the expertise we have developed with regards to what applicants to study dentistry need to do to be successful with regards to getting experience, understanding the different branches of dentistry and what is required of a dentistry undergraduate. This would also create a networking opportunity for Y12 students to support and encourage each other. <br /><br />We need to find a platform to do this and decide on scalable, useful modes of interaction for students. </p>    </div>

                   <p>Hi Paul, I picked up on you through Team Lost and wanted to say how valuable your proposal sounds. I have a widening particpation background of using virtual learning environments to link with the university's partner schools and colleges, working with schools to raise aspirations and bringing sutdents onto campus for taster days. &nbsp;The funding for this all ran out some time ago but I still manage the university's programme of transition support - offering new students access to our VLE prior to enrolment. Your project sounds great, good luck!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here on OLDsMOOC I've set up a Google Group&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia</a> looking at supporting staff taking a DIY approach to Multimedia for teaching and learning. I don't know if there may be any crossovers but please feel free to wander over, have a look and maybe join in.</p>

                   <p>Hi Sue</p>
<p>Thanks for commenting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WP is such valuable work and I'm really pleased to be able to contribute to it. I was lucky to be able to work with some of the ADOPT students earlier this year, giving them mock interviews, and they were really inspiring individuals as are the people who run the programme. <br /><br />We are using a Moodle installation to support the face to face sessions, but we're looking for something more visually appealing for an entirely online affair (I know Moodle can be styled nicely, but too often the navigation is painful). Getting non-students into the University VLE is not easy and certainly not something we could do quickly for large numbers. We're looking at using Canvas or maybe Google Sites. Launch is 12 months away, so we have a reasonable lead-in time for a modest project (famous last words!). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Will take a look at the DIY media group. I feel like I've lost touch with wherever we're supposed to be on the course, but at least I've figured out cloudspace (kinda) and I'm having interesting conversations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Paul</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi Joshua</p>
<p>Thanks for the link. I'd never heard of that project.. I live in a bit of a online masters bubble. It's what pays for my post, so I can't really complain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've had a couple of haptic simulators to test from commercial producers. One in particular was so realistic that you worried about injuring yourself with the drill. It was the only one that used a headset, which may be significant in creating an immersive environment.</p>
<p>There is a lot of potential there for sure, &nbsp;being able to replay procedures, compare work with other students, carry on where you left off, adaptive learning and so on. It also means students can practice without needing a clinician to supervise.</p>        </div>
