        <p>Mary Upton</p>
<p>Tuesday 23 March, 2.45pm-3.45pm<br /> Workshop 3D</p>
<p>Central Meeting Room 15</p>
<p>This session will examine some of the issues and challenges in doing fieldwork with people (in any setting). In particular it will look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>The place of fieldwork in research</li>
<li>Setting up and doing fieldwork</li>
<li>Collecting, recording and analysing data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mary Upton&rsquo;s </strong>first degree<strong> </strong>was in Sociology with Research Training at the University of Bath and her MPhil is in Politics from the University of Bristol.&nbsp; She began her academic career teaching Sociology and Health and Social Care, moving on to teach Social Science at the Open University as an Associate Lecturer.&nbsp; Before resuming her studies, she gained a Masters in Research Training in International Development at the University of Bath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her research interests are in global health governance, social justice, citizenship and participatory development.&nbsp; Before beginning her PhD at the Open University she contributed a case study to the Masters course TU870, &lsquo;Capacities for Managing Development&rsquo;, entitled &lsquo;The Summertown HIV prevention Project&rsquo;.&nbsp; Currently, she is writing up her thesis focusing on community engagement in local health initiatives.&nbsp; Her field work was undertaken in South Africa in two HIV vaccine clinical trial sites in Cape Town and Soweto.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>    </div>

			<p><strong>Mary Upton (Session 3D)</strong></p>
<p>Fieldwork with people (Tuesday, 23<sup>rd</sup> March, 2010; 2:45 pm)</p>
<p>Fairly large room with about 18 people. Mary has just asked for a volunteer to write on the flip-chart.</p>
<p>Mary is talking about her fieldwork in South Africa and she is saying that when she started she was very nervous and then she loved it.</p>
<p>The students are going around saying what their research is about and what their concerns are about.</p>
<p><strong>Students&rsquo; concerns:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>No knowledge of interviews and case studies but these are the techniques going to use</li>
<li>Self-funded and hence money is limited for the interviews</li>
<li>Positioning herself (the researcher) in a group/project that she created. She is comparing the group she created with other groups.</li>
<li>Uncertain whether focus groups would work in the country that he is going to do his research in. His alternative is to run a workshop instead</li>
<li>Concerns about access in a Muslim society/ country &ndash; probably as she is a female? Also there may be censorship if what she is investigating is not positive towards the country</li>
<li>Concerns whether going into ethical communities as an outsider would cause any problems (?)</li>
<li>Issues of access and whether it would be difficult to get access as his area is controversial</li>
<li>How to adapt methods from social sciences into computing and how to blend technical artefacts with people</li>
<li>Wants to ensure she is not intrusive in the lives of her participants</li>
<li>Getting ethical approval &ndash; clarity to the participants what is happening. Needing the time</li>
<li>Getting people to interact or engage with the &lsquo;product&rsquo; (e.g. art performance) they have (Mary suggests showing enthusiasm)</li>
</ol>
<p>Indicates that John Oates is a useful person to contact for the ethical approval.</p>
<p><strong>Methods </strong></p>
<p>Have contingency plans just in case your methods don&rsquo;t work. You have to decide if your decisions are feasible.</p>
<p>Key issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consent</li>
<li>Confidentiality</li>
<li>Anonymity </li>
<li>Protection of respondents and researchers from harm e.g. personal safety in dangerous countries</li>
</ul>
<p>You have to show respect as you have to remember that you&rsquo;re being hosted by busy people. You should dress appropriately.</p>
<p>Particularly in a developing country, be careful of what you promise and what you&rsquo;re planning on giving back.</p>
<p>You need to think about the boundaries of your research i.e. where are you going to stop</p>
<p>You need to fit the sample size appropriate to the method.</p>
<p>Clarify the key characteristics of age, gender and ethnicity.</p>
<p><strong>Contact and Access Issues</strong></p>
<p>You would need to build relationships &ndash; either by letters of introductions, emails and phone calls. You should make it short and direct. You can send a longer bit on the proposal goals to them as an attachment.</p>
<p>In some countries, there may not be good internet or the timings might be completely off. You may need to use texts and phone calls instead.</p>
<p>You have to decide whether you&rsquo;re going to continue building up the contact even after you leave.</p>
<p>People sometime value having someone listen to their issues.</p>
<p><strong>The procedures</strong></p>
<p>It is recommended that you do a pilot study so you can come up with all the mistakes that can happen.</p>
<p>Practical issues</p>
<p>Budgets e.g. phone calls might cost a lot. Overestimate rather than underestimate.</p>
<p>Visas etc.</p>
<p>One student is saying when the interview is over then the people actually started talking to you. The interview is not only when the recorder is on &ndash; it includes your reflection afterwards.</p>
<p>A student said based on her interviews if someone is feeling uncomfortable about answering some questions, don&rsquo;t push it &ndash; because they won&rsquo;t answer it.</p>
<p><strong>Unexpected Events</strong></p>
<p>Holidays and absence &ndash; you probably can&rsquo;t interview the people you want to when you want to</p>
<p>Things always don&rsquo;t go the way you organised or you may not get the people you wanted to interview. You may find new people to interview which might change the direction of your research.</p>
<p>Be organise, do it right but also be flexible.</p>			<div class="posted-by">
