        <p>The 4SPPIces model sets out a model for the development eLearning materials which concentrates on four factors invloved in the design of courses: Space, Pedological Method, Participants and History.&nbsp;The four elements are represented by four quadrants in a circle. The model is integrated into a tool called LdShake which is designed provide a virtual space in which practitioners&nbsp;&nbsp;(Instructional Designers or experts in education) and technicians&nbsp;(i.e.those&nbsp;knowledgable about available technologies)&nbsp;can jointly work togetherin developing blended learning.</p>
<p>The eDesign Template is a pedagogical model which focuses on four key best practice principles of eLearning design. The four principles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active Induction</li>
<li>Guided exploration</li>
<li>Facilitated Investigation</li>
<li>Self-organised learner</li>
</ul>
<p>The&nbsp;four principles,&nbsp;applied to an eLearning course&nbsp;are&nbsp;incrementally&nbsp;supposed to &nbsp;increaseand scaffold&nbsp;the diversity of interaction and assessment. The eLearning activities are then set out in a matrix, against the four principles, in order to show to what extent the course activities fulfill the four principles.</p>
<p>In terms of readability of the two representations, both were reasonably easy to understand within &nbsp;the Rashomon article. Both used the Healthy Eating activities to illustrate the representations. Both also included Figures and Tables to help to illustrate the collection of data and the interelated best practice principles of eLearning. It is worthwhile pointing out that the text of represenation was written by different people i.e. experts in that representation.</p>
<p>In terms of their expressivenes of the two representations,&nbsp;I find this an unusual facet to try to assess. Does this mean to what extent does the narrative stray from being&nbsp;a purely analytical text to including more opinion and conjecture? Neither text seems to contain unnecessary unsubstantiated text. Its worth noting though that each representation in the Rashomon article wait until their final sentence to describe a succinct explanation as to the purpose of the representations i.e. the 4SPPices model is a virtual space in which stakeholders can have discussions about the design whist the eDesign Template offers a quick and easy reminder of key features of quality learning.</p>
<p>In terms of their utlity, I feel that both representations provide a good overview and explanation of the most important aspects of the design.</p>
<p>In terms of the activity carried out in <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9890" rel="nofollow">Activity 1b</a>&nbsp;using the two representations would not have been sufficient to express the design of the course. Though the 4SPPices represention is for the development of blended learning and Activity 1b is a mix of individual research, classroom activities and remote support for participants and therefore could be useful. However there was no collaboration between instructional designers and 'techies` as this was all done by a single person (i.e. me).</p>
<p>The eDesign template may have been useful if I had decided that the overarching aim of the course was to instil the four principles. However Activitiy 1b was not&nbsp;a purely eLearning activity. Nevertheless, it would still be interesting to assess the course against the four principles.</p>    </div>
