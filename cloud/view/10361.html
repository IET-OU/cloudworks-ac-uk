        <p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p><em>What was your role in the story?</em></p>
<p>I was the tutor</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>Describe the physical, social and intentional factors that define the design space, e.g. where and when did this occur? In what kind of space? Who were the key actors, and what were the relations between them? What were the beliefs and desires that shaped their interaction?</em></p>
<p>The physical, social and intentional factors:</p>
<p>Classroom based learning of Computer Aided Design for adults (key actors) of varied abilities (from beginner to intermediate). Intention was to create more inclusive learning for such differentiation more effectively, thus allow learners to learn at their own pace and achieve their own varying outcomes. The beliefs and desires that shaped them were to perceive them as a community of practice to enable them to participate in activities together in addition to individual task based learning.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>What were you trying to achieve? What was your measure of success?</em></p>
<p>I was trying to achieve more inclusivity by offering further and varying resources on Moodle to enable learners to practice beyond the classroom and choose activities that were of specific interest to scaffold learning that had taken place in class.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>List the actions you took in chronological order. Note their effects &ndash; both expected and unexpected. Highlight any obstacles you encountered, and explain how you tried to overcome them.</em></p>
<p>Re-devise current scheme of work and learning activities &ndash; very time consuming, expected</p>
<p>Transfer bulk of printed materials to Moodle &ndash; learners initially still wanted these, (unexpected) but could demonstrate further agency (unexpected) in choosing which and when to print. Most kept the digital formats.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><em>List the expected and unexpected outcomes of your actions. To what degree did you meet your objectives? What additional outcomes did you engender? Provide evidence to back your claims.</em></p>
<p>Students had more agency, could come into class and access their materials start their session and chosen activities at their own pace.</p>
<p>Activities and tasks available on Moodle created more accessibility and alleviated stress for me of having to print materials and get learners who had missed a session up to speed whilst move on to the next task, freeing up class time to spend with learners on a one to one basis.</p>
<p>I was able to direct learners to relevant week they had missed and follow tasks whilst focus on the current session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Whilst I met some of my objectives the challenge of differentiation in Adult education remains. This was only a five-week short course and required a lot of planning, updating and light revision after each term to refine.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>Reflect on your experience. What transferable insights did you gain?</em></p>
<p>The implementation of digital resources to a traditional teaching context is complex and additional activities and resources were needed to support the classroom activities; bridge learning achieved in the class with activities intended beyond.</p>
