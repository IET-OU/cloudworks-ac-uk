He amazes &nbsp;everyone with the amount of communication devices that he has and he always seems to be connected with his friends on social networks. He is someone that reacts quickly to changes and can quickly organize&nbsp;people to performing different tasks. He hangs around the office after work and seems to have a lot of spare time on his hands. He always takes pamphlets or reading material that he emails to his personal account to study them and gain more knowledge that way.</p>

Of all the people in the office he is the one that knows the company's system the best and have even connected his iPad and iPhone to the network for him to be able to work remotely. He always seems to have a lot of time on his hands and are even willing to work after hours if he can see the benefit&nbsp;in it.

He seems to know everything about over the counter sales and is always willing to share his experiences with anyone who wants to listen. Everyone in the office likes him because he seems to take a personal interest in each person. He is tech savvy and the go-to-guy when something strange happens&nbsp;with a computer. He seems to be busy all the time and leaves the office directly after work because of other commitments. He does not seem interested in decisions&nbsp;regarding the group and is happy to go along with the majority. George does not like to spend his personal time on things regarding the company.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p><strong>Tom</strong>&nbsp;Is 21 years old and very energetic and very chatty. He is single and stays with some of his friends who all pay rent for the apartment they live in. He has many friends and spends his available time socializing. He is outgoing and believes that life is what you make of it. It always seems as if he is having fun wherever he goes not taking life's strains too seriously. After Tom left school he started his career as a journalist at a local newspaper where he did quite well for himself. He supplemented his income with the commission&nbsp;he received from selling advertisements. His success with sales motivated his decision&nbsp;to get involved with over the counter sales where the commission, if he was successful, stands to be quite a sizable amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He started new in the company as a sales consultant and it is his first experience with over the counter sales. He is a very sociable at work and quickly creates relationships with his fellow employees. Everyone seems to like him as he is always there to help when it is needed. Mostly it is with menial office tasks as he does not have a lot of on the job knowledge. He seems to be very clued up regarding anything technological and could navigate the company's system in no time at all. He likes to learn and seems to have a lot of time to do so. He amazes &nbsp;everyone with the amount of communication devices that he has and he always seems to be connected with his friends on social networks. When the manager asked for someone to organize the Christmas&nbsp;party he volunteered immediately. He was quite successful in organizing&nbsp;everything assigning small tasks to his fellow employees, even the manager. He sometimes hangs around the office after work to chat with people or to read some of the communications the company sends out. He always takes pamphlets or reading material that he emails to his personal account to study them and gain more knowledge that way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the learning intervention that his manager enrolled all the employees in he was the first one to access the new website. He created his own profile and played with the system so after not long he was able to help others do the same. He came in one morning boasting that he has already completed the first exercise on his iPad while he was lying in bed. He was quick to create connections or links to each one of his colleagues. He was even able to tell his colleagues about interesting features of the system. In the group exercises he was keen on exploring the new approaches to learning and posted a lot of his ideas on the system. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><em><br /></em><strong>James </strong>is 42 and lives in a house that he and his wife&nbsp;had bought&nbsp;soon after their marriage. James has worked for the company all his life. The company went through&nbsp;a restructuring process&nbsp;about a year ago where he was moved from his old job as a data analyst to an unfamiliar field of over the counter sales. It was a stressful period for him but after the process he was just too lucky to have a job, even if it meant doing something he does not really like. He has lost faith in the company being true to its promises and only invest as much energy as is necessary&nbsp;to get him through the day.</p>
<p>He does not seem to be one of the companies'&nbsp;best sales people but he is not one of the top performers even. He knows everyone in the office but does not regard them as friends. It generally takes a long time for him to be comfortable in a new crowd&nbsp;of people and he took some time before he started feeling relaxed amongst his new colleagues. Of all the people in the office he is the one that knows the company's Computer system the best and have even connected his iPad and iPhone to the network for him to be able to work remotely. He always seems to have a lot of time on his hands and but he is not willing to work after hours even if he could see the benefit&nbsp;in it. He always seems happy&nbsp;to go along with what the rest of the group decides but never provide any suggestions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His manager signed&nbsp;him up for a new learning solution&nbsp;that forces him to work with his colleagues in virtual groups. Although he understands the technology behind it he had always found the world of "social Interaction" over a network to be superflicient. He would rather talk to people than send them messages and he is not one of the most talkative people in the company. He sees this new training intervention as something that he is forced to deal with and only engages in it as much energy as possible to get by. His supervisor&nbsp;once remarked that he could contribute more to the topics under discussion on the learning system.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

                   <p>It is interesting that you have characterised so many personas with different goals and I can see how these might help each other in some kind of social learning as you suggest but I'm not very familiar with the settings and practice of OCS. It would help me understand that if you can illustrate how this might play out with these personas by telling some short stories: e.g. how might new sales guy gain some of the terminology with the help of one or more of the other personas and the tools you mention? How might this happen in the office in work hours and how might it extend to out of office hours?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Joshua&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for the feedback, I&nbsp;really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Please help me to understand this better. A persona will be more a combination of the&nbsp;factors that I mentioned for example <em>Old hand-Tech last-Sit in - Not now - Fast one </em>would be:</p>
<p>A person that has been with the company for over a year and is not very technologically minded and does not like to be part of group activities. He does not like technology and only work on computers when he has to. He owns a cell phone but he only uses it to make phone calls. He does not have a computer at home and does not have access to the internet after hours. He can barely surf the internet when he is at work but does not understand this social networking thing.(From this description I can add a few more components to the list)</p>
<p>I&nbsp;can see that the above is more in line with the personas we are discussing. But by breaking the personas down in persona components can make it easier&nbsp;for me as a developer to work with than the plethora&nbsp;of personas when they are combined like:</p>
<p><em>Old hand-Tech dude- Sit in -&nbsp;<em>Not now - Fast one</em></em><br /><em>Old hand-Tech last - Grouper-&nbsp;<em>Not now - Fast one</em></em><br /><em>Old hand-Tech last - Reactor -&nbsp;<em>Not now - Fast one</em></em><br /><em>Old hand - Tech dude - Reactor -&nbsp;<em>Not now - Fast one</em></em></p>
<p>Does this make sense or am I completely missing the point?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for the assistance I&nbsp;appreciate it.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Josh or anyone</p>
<p>I have created a few personas under extra content and i&nbsp;can see the benefit&nbsp;of typing out a persona. I do not think it is necessary&nbsp;to write&nbsp;down each variation of the persona for each changing factor but I&nbsp;do find it a very good guideline for creating different personas.</p>
<p>Please give me your feedback.</p>

                   <p>I think you are being a little bit too removed from your personas.&nbsp; Rather than <em>Old hand-Tech last-Sit in - Not now - Fast one, </em>give him or her a name and think of them as a human being not a type.<em><br /></em></p>
<p>This is nearer but is still not someone you can imagine as your student while you are designing:</p>
<p>A person that has been with the company for over a year and is not very  technologically minded and does not like to be part of group activities.  He does not like technology and only work on computers when he has to.  He owns a cell phone but he only uses it to make phone calls. He does  not have a computer at home and does not have access to the internet  after hours. He can barely surf the internet when he is at work but does  not understand this social networking thing.(From this description I  can add a few more components to the list)</p>
<p>What about:</p>
<p>John has been with the company for 15 months, and is known as a bit of a loner and not very happy with technology. He reluctantly turns up to meetings and doesn't talk much, and only works on computer when he has to. He is slow at this and does not ask enough questions to enable him to improve. He has a Nokia phone that makes calls but is not a smartphone.&nbsp; He was asked to contribute to a mailing list at work but never contributed. He runs a youth football team and wonders if it would be handy if it had a webpage or something to do with this Facebook thing so he can communicate with the youngsters and organise practice times.</p>
<p>Does this flesh him out and give you a way to reach him?</p>
<p>Hope this hekps and you din't think it's completely rubbish!</p>

                   Hi  Chris,

The way I read it, your personas are Tom, James and George (no girls?).
The phrases at the top are closer to what I would call "intentional factors". So, George being an olds-hand will modulate his concerns, and shape the way he engages in the learning experience you design.
Try to give these personas a bit more volume - why is George so quick to go home, what other commitments? How old is Tom?
Most important: what do they expect to get out of the designed experience? What do they see as barriers to their success?         </div>

                   <p>Thank you so much for the feedback, I have taken a second look at the personas and elaborated more on James and Tom as personas in the latter part of the comment. I understand the power of a more elaborate persona.</p>
<p>Any more feedback would be appreciated.</p>        </div>
