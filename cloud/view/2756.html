<ul>
<li>New way of thinking about e-learning, challenge the assumptions we make, expose the things we take for granted.</li>
<li>No powerpoint, no slideshare, no handouts &ndash; just have to concentrate on what I am talking about</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Focus of the talk is on the dangers of group thinking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Marc Prenskys work &ndash; digital natives and immigrants, cited over 15000 times!</li>
<li>Disproves a tenant of web 2.0 wisdom of the crowd &ndash; can be dangerously wrong. The combine opinion is more valuable than the expertise of one. Connect to others</li>
<li>Prensky was wrong and we as the wisdom of the crowds bought it</li>
<li>We need to ask serious questions for what we are taking for granted &ndash; we are suckers for bright lights, free and easy learners</li>
<li>Prensky became true because we all thought it was true</li>
<li>There are so many sources of information we tend to take shortcuts, we go with our comfort zone, our paradigm</li>
<li>Many of our shared values as e-learning researchers may well be wrong &ndash; we never serious challenge our beliefs, our online connectivity only exacerbate this problem Clay Shirky &ndash; we tend to link with people who are just like us</li>
<li>The narrowing of opinions &ndash; web 2.0 narrows our thinking</li>
<li>We cling to ideas and maxums without ever challenging them, we choose who we listen to and also who we don&rsquo;t listen</li>
<li>Those who question the value of e-learning are not here.</li>
<li>We uncritically accept evidence that agrees with our beliefs</li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t adequately read anymore, we read the exec summary and assume we have what the whole report is about. We don&rsquo;t look at the deeper context.</li>
<li>Evaluation of evidence-based online learning report, from US came out earlier this year. Based on in-depth analysis. Exec summary online learning better than face to face blended is better again. But more deep reading is contrary to this, very little difference. Actually the difference appears to be more to do with the fact that online courses require students to spend more time on task than the technological dimension. Latest report from educause also indicates that faculty need to work harder online as well.</li>
<li>Little evidence that e-learning is better at the meta-level, reality is that students and faculty have to work harder, have higher drop out and is expensive.</li>
<li>A lot of the rhetoric of e-learning is little more than a dream.</li>
<li>Public libraries have been available for centuries but in reality students go to universities.&nbsp; So what&rsquo;s new?</li>
<li>Laurillard</li>
<li>Everyday knowledge is based on experience, serve our immediate needs</li>
<li>Academic knowledge is different, more complex &ndash; relating to descriptions of the world, its about paradigm construction and criticisms. Its knowledge about everyday knowledge, its based on our reflection of everyday knowledge and the search for hard evidence, serve society needs</li>
<li>This distinction is essential, universities are about dealing with academic knowledge</li>
<li>&nbsp;We need to beware of group thinking, we need to be more critically aware of our area and the wisdom of the crowds discourse associated with it.</li>

			<p>If "academic knowledge" is special, and I don't buy this argument on first principles, then what's to keep it from being marginalized? &nbsp;The phrase " oh, that's just academic" is a dismissive swipe at academics who make unnecessarily obtuse arguments for the sake of hearing themselves pontificate. But it's entered out culture to the detriment of all of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is 'academic' knowledge different from any carefully constructed evidence-based argument that follows good scientific principles (for the natural sciences) or good &nbsp;"rejectable" hypotheses for any discipline area?</p>

                   <p>Hi Philip</p>
<p>I thik there is something distinct about academic knowledge although I don't like the term for it. For me it's about evidence as you say but also abstracting and theorising, shedding a light on something in a different way, providing a new explanation/insight into what is happening around us.</p>        </div>

                    <br />

                   <p>I think we need to be very careful here. If we make this distinction, we accept that academic knowledge is different from other types of knowledge. I'd strongly prefer that the baseline definition for knowledge is evidence-based, derived from a theoretical framework that generates testable hypotheses for which data can be collected, analyzed and objectively assessed. Of course we live in social networks and our worldviews are inescapably tied to current paradigms, but &nbsp;that influences the kinds of hypotheses we formulate and the questions we ask, not the methods by which we ask them.</p>
<p>Danger comes when we make academic knowledge special.</p>

                   <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Great to see the provocation has been worthwhile! Philip, you say that "If we make this distinction, we accept that academic knowledge is different from other types of knowledge". Yep, I contend that it is. There is a different genre to academic knowledge. It is written about and spoken about differently. It is 'special', but it is not self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Take a look at Diana Laurillard's distinction in <em>Rethinking university teaching</em>... even if you don't end up agreeing with the distinction, it's a great read.</p>
<p>Do say 'hi' if you see me Wednesday... happy to talk f2f. I'll bring my copy of Laurillard's book, which you're welcome to borrow.</p>
<p>Mark.</p>        </div>

Still, this definition of academic knowledge troubles me. &nbsp;Academic knowledge Diana describes as&nbsp;a kind of learning that is distinctly different from "everyday knowledge." &nbsp;Lori Breslow from the Teaching and Learning Lab at MIT wrote at the time the first edition was published that everyday knowledge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"contextualized, meaning it cannot be separated from the situations in which it is used. Academic knowledge, on the other hand, has a second-order character; it is knowledge about knowledge."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Diana introduced the instructor as an intermediary agent, Academic knowledge is different because it is mediated by the instructor,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"undergraduates are not learning about the world directly, but about others' descriptions of the world," Laurillard explains. (p. 5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And therein lies my difficulty. At what point is the instructor interpreting knowledge vs. providing a framework around it so the student can effectively construct their own understanding of it? &nbsp;It also worries me that knowledge that has other forms, the study of dance, theatre or art, for example, &nbsp;may take a legitimate alternate path that isn't best interpreted by an instructor, as Laurillard describes her experience teaching maths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This kind of intermediation can actually lead to the unintentional but nevertheless real stifling of creativity. It is what Sir Ken Robinson asserts to be the consequence of an over emphasis on one way of knowing the world - the utter annihilation of creativity by modern formal 'education'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree that there is an important part of learning that recognizes the 'meta' in theoretical constructs`. Laurillard wrote in Rethinking University Teaching,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We have to help students not just to perform the procedure, but also to stand back from that and see why it is necessary, where it fits and does not fit, distinguish situations where it is needed from those where it is not, i.e., carry out the authentic activities of the subject expert. (p. 18)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hard part about teaching anywhere, but especially in higher ed I think is when you have to teach the boring stuff that students don't want to learn, don't see the need for learning, and which are primarily stepping stones to other things. &nbsp;Randy Bass, (Georgetown University, Exec. Dir. of CNDLS) makes a a good case I think that we have been trapped in a paradigm based on content. &nbsp;Now , he writes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>.&rdquo;Instead of moving from content to practice, people begin in practice and it is practice that drives them to content."&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a shift marked by social pedagogies that redefines the instructor's role. I think this forces us to reconsider the idea of 'academic knowledge'.&nbsp;</p>

<p>P.S. I'm vicariously enjoying the conference through peripheral "twitter-pation" (is that a new word?) from the warmth of Queensland. I hope to see you sometime in the future. Cheers mate.</p>        </div>

                   <p>Hi there Philip,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the stimulation! We are, after all, in agreement. I don't think Diana's distinction is ultimately definitive, but it is useful shorthand - which is the context in which I used it. There IS something different and removed about University education, and the sorts of ideas Universities are concerned with. And, this difference is well worth preserving.</p>
<p>I agree with you, of course, that we cannot neatly separate everyday from academic knowledge. The two are very intertwined, the latter very much dependent on the former (and the Bass quote is very helpful here). I agree, too, that Diana's integration of 'academic knowledge' into her teaching and learning framework adds an implicit mediation... I think that we could discuss further nuance here though, in that all academic ideas in books, journals etc are mediated - but that fine level of nuance is not really necessary for our purposes I think!</p>
<p>Where Diana's distinction becomes very useful is when considering quotes like this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During his junior year, my son started making videos with a digital video camera &hellip; he was not merely taking video with his camera and then editing sequence. He was mixing in audio from the Internet, CDs and DVDs, video clips collected from his friends, still images he had taken and downloaded from the net, and even staged video from online video games, where players followed direction and acted out scenes on a virtual stage from their homes across the globe. I did not teach him how to do this &hellip; his high school teachers &hellip; did not teach him how to do this. He taught himself, with the help of his social network of people,<br />&nbsp;with whom he IMs, text messages, shares MySpace pages, plays in the metaverse of video games, and through venues I am sure I do not even understand yet. He knows how to use this new read/write web to learn what he needs to know, in order to do what he needs to do, now! It&rsquo;s how this generation learns. It&rsquo;s how they use information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the argument goes, education must change... The example, I would maintain, is evidence of independence with <em>everyday </em>knowledge - and so not an argument against how education is brought about in University contexts. The quote is from Warlick's <em>Classroom blogging</em>, in <a href="http://akoaotearoa.ac.nz/projects/eprimer-series" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">E-Primer 5</a> p.13. I contend that much of our insistence on 'just-in-time' learning is actually targeted at <em>everyday</em> knowledge rather than <em>academic </em>knowledge (using the distinction broadly), which, in turn, challenges the concept of 'j-i-t's fit in many aspects of higher education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your part "At what point is the instructor interpreting knowledge vs. providing a framework around it so the student can effectively construct their own understanding of it?" is a legitimate tension in HE. Naturally there are elements of both... which is why you ultimately need instructors of good academic integrity. Some studies I have read about students' perceptions of higher education suggest that students WANT the instructor to interpret (as a part of their role; none, I would suggest, want to just become regurgitators of their instructors knowledge). Of course instructors are interpreting knowledge; the good ones realise that and the honest ones know that their word cannot be the last. I don't think there is a 'vs' as you have put it - but that opens up another whole area of discussion relating to level of study and cognitive progression. Needless to say I don't think a viable solution to didactic teaching is some naive notion of educational emancipation (with apologies for falling back on a very unhelpful dichotomy!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for your response, which is clear, informed and indicative of the kind of thinking that ultimately benefits all. I'll take Diana's book out of my conference bag. In the words of Pink Floyd, "Wish you were here"!</p>
