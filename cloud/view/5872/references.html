<p><strong>3.&nbsp; enlarging the role - integrating learning for integrated lives?</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that careers-worker professionals know more than they are in a position to use.&nbsp; Enlarged career studies means that careers workers are constantly becoming more able to help.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s good; what is not good is that time- and target-constraints give them little opportunity and freedom to the put that ability to good use.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong><strong>earning space for useful action:&nbsp;</strong> Career studies is applied learning - what is learned is intended to be used in people&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; It requires transfer-of-learning - acquired in one setting, used in another.&nbsp; And that means that people&rsquo;s learning reminds them of their lives, so that their lives remind them of their learning.</p>
<p>But it does not come easily.&nbsp; It needs <em>learning space for useful action</em> - big-enough that learning can be probed, tried out, adapted and embedded.&nbsp; Applied learning is not like academic learning - useful transfer-of-learning needs more than acquisition, record-making and assessment.&nbsp; And it will not fit into the marginal slots that an academic curriculum reluctantly concedes to &lsquo;careers education and guidance&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>finding meaning and purpose:</strong>&nbsp; As a species we look for meaning: long ago, when the leaves rustled, we wondered &lsquo;what&rsquo;s that - predator or prey?... mate or competitor?... us or them?&rsquo;.&nbsp; It ascribes meaning, and an ascribed meaning is a basis for purpose.&nbsp; We wonder &lsquo;... so, what shall I do - move or be still?... run or hide?... approach or avoid?&rsquo;.&nbsp; There have always been versions of this in career-management: what-to-do? and why-bother? - a purpose, and an underlying meaning, giving the purpose its point.&nbsp; Learning-for-living is <em>finding meaning and purpose</em>, &nbsp;</p>
<p>And what people informally find may not be misleading - even gossip can offer useful and authentic exchanges of experience.&nbsp; But not all of informal learning is like that - some borders on superstition.&nbsp; There is nothing that professionals can do - or should do - to displace such experience-based learning.&nbsp; But they can help in two ways.&nbsp; They can expand the experience to make more comparisons possible.&nbsp; That means making new contacts - we could call that thinking &lsquo;community-interaction theory&rsquo;.&nbsp; And they can enable the probing, scrutinising and interrogation of what people find.&nbsp; That means engaging people in critical thinking - we could call that thinking &lsquo;career-learning theory&rsquo;.&nbsp; Those two activities - widening the perspectives on meaning, and enabling the interrogation of purpose - are what careers workers do best.</p>
<p><strong>employability a by-product: </strong>&nbsp;Both activities are process driven - not so much about what people learn, more about how they learn it.&nbsp; But there is no process without content.&nbsp; And keeping up with content is becoming a serious problem: the understanding of facts and factors influencing career has expanded beyond our reach.&nbsp; We need, more than ever, to turn elsewhere for reliable and up-to-date content.&nbsp; And there is no part of any curriculum which is incapable of finding that content and applying it to life.&nbsp; There are educators who know more than we can know - ranging from the dynamics of encounter to the reliability of probabilities.&nbsp; It needs teachers - for example in drama or maths - who are ready to start a scheme with &lsquo;this will be useful in your life when...&rsquo;, and to wind up with &lsquo;...let&rsquo;s go over life situations where you can use this learning&rsquo;.&nbsp; Transfer-of-learning needs that kind of embedding.&nbsp; And, so embedded, it is a life-wide and life-long gain.</p>
<p>It is integrated learning for integrated lives.&nbsp; It is not cross-curriculum infusion: it does not seek a lot of, often half-hearted, curriculum links.&nbsp; Instead it looks for a few able partners - maybe in drama, and - if not welcome there - maybe in maths.&nbsp; What we most need is not comprehensive coverage, which is unattainable anyway.&nbsp; We need to find genuine expertise and experience which can deal with any question, from whatever direction it comes, and who can fire up curiosity - developing the habit of seeing learning as a map, not a hurdle.&nbsp; We need those people to understand the importance of enabling ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; To enable learning in these terms makes <em>employability a by-product</em>.&nbsp; An able educator, helping students to find meaning and purpose in life, does not need to see this in any other way.&nbsp; The best of educators do not care to see themselves as setting in motion a procedure to be completed by recruitment and selection.&nbsp; Education is intrinsically valuable - it is not an agent for other people&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p>Practical questions include...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;is a what-to-do gain all that is asked for - or needed?&rsquo;<br /></em><em>&lsquo;how do we best help with seeking meaning and purpose?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;what can we do about negotiating an integrated curriculum?</em></p>
