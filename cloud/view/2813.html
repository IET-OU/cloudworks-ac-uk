        <p><strong>Building Intelligent Interactive Tutors: Student-centered strategies for revolutionizing e-learning</strong>&nbsp;by Beverly Park Woolf, published by Morgan Kaufmann in August 2008,&nbsp;(http://bit.ly/BIITbyBPW) is a valuable resource for anyone developing on-line learning systems. It covers the significant differences between computer aided instruction and the newer <em>intelligent</em>&nbsp;systems:</p>
<p>1/ generativity -- "articulate expertise" in the form of customized problems, hints or help based on subject matter/student knowledge and tutor capabilities<br style="font-size: small; font-family: tahoma, arial, 'nimbus sans l', sans-serif;" />2/ knowledge about the student -- dynamically recording learned tasks<br style="font-size: small; font-family: tahoma, arial, 'nimbus sans l', sans-serif;" />3/ expert knowledge -- representation of the knowledge domain<br style="font-size: small; font-family: tahoma, arial, 'nimbus sans l', sans-serif;" />4/ mixed-initiative -- the system is capable of both posing and responding to posed questions<br style="font-size: small; font-family: tahoma, arial, 'nimbus sans l', sans-serif;" />5/ interactive learning -- being responsive to students' learning needs<br style="font-size: small; font-family: tahoma, arial, 'nimbus sans l', sans-serif;" />6/ instructional modeling -- the way to take the information in #2 and use it to guide #5<br style="font-size: small; font-family: tahoma, arial, 'nimbus sans l', sans-serif;" />7/ self-improving -- the system's "experience" aids in working with subsequent students</p>
<p>Achieving the goal of developing systems with all of these features will take time and thought and in put from many people including students, teachers and software developers. How will this type of system be designed and built?</p>
<p>One approach is open source. The project is given a name and a place on the internet for the code and documentation to be stored. &nbsp;Interested parties find it, test it and (if they have the skills needed) improve upon it. &nbsp;Often this process begins with a software developer who has a need, who writes some workable code to meet that need and who shares it in the hope that it will help others and possibly be improved by them. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Perhaps this same approach could be used in the design phase as well. &nbsp;</em>What if we began a collaborative design discussion here on Cloudworks? &nbsp;To kick things off, a short video describing the basic elements of a proposed system &#40;with the catchy name of "Open Allure Dialog System"&#41; can be viewed at:</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps you have, or know of, ready-to-share designs for portions of this system?</p>
<p>What features would you put into your ideal e-learning system?</p><p>Contact details: john.graves@aut.ac.nz</p>    </div>

                   <p>Neil Fleming's 64-page book <em>55 Strategies for Teaching </em>gives some specific tips which could be helpful in the design of an intelligent tutor. For example, using the wording</p>
<p>"What are your questions?"</p>
<p>rather than alternatives which lack the presumption that questions are out there and need to be stated.</p>
<p>Fleming maintains that teachers can't be sure learning has happened until the student makes and uses their own 'script' with others--in other words, a complete round-trip that includes self expression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these points suggest an intelligent tutor should be prepared to LISTEN.</p>
<p>Fleming is best known for the VARK questionnaire. VARK&nbsp;stands for the Visual, Aural, Read/write, and Kinesthetic sensory modalities used for learning:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=categories" rel="nofollow">http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=categories</a></p>
<p>What VARK-modality does a computer have? Computers with microphones and webcams can capture aural and visual/kinesthetic (gesture) inputs. &nbsp;What if an e-Learning system included such voice-and-vision inputs to address these additional modalities?</p>

                   <p>Perhaps Dave Snowden's message about innovation (Longitude http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2AijRoXnvE) applies to aspects of educational technology: some of today's experts may be missing/dismissing solutions due to blinders built into their expertise.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Reading Snowdon, one finds a call for a kind of un-design "allowing systems to emerge through the interaction of people with software, rather than designing that use in advance" (from The core principles -- Distributed cognition, Finely granulated objects and Disintermediation at http://bit.ly/60DZ5L) which rather flies in the face of designs which control and direct the interaction.<br /><br /><br />The ASHEN model (Artefacts, Skills, Heuristics, Experience, Natural Talent) used at Cognitive Edge (http://www.cognitive-edge.com/wiki/index.php/ASHEN) aims to capture tacit "know-how" which comes from experience.&nbsp; Here is where the blinders come in: other educational technology designs may get lost in the "know-what/when/why/who" of explicit content and (conveniently) skip over the KDPs (Knowledge Disclosure Points) where knowledge is used. Certainly know-how is harder to assess.<br /><br /><br />What, then, are the design parameters for an emergent system?&nbsp; Something like Wikipedia?</p>        </div>

                   <p>Now comes&nbsp;Stephanie Pace Marshall (founding President and President Emerita, Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy and the founding President of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology) to say&nbsp;</p>
<p>"[T]he learning environment and curriculum must engage students in the modes of inquiry, problem-solving, knowledge generation and application that distinguish three fundamental STEM learning communities and ways of thinking:</p>
<p>[1] Disciplinary and Interdisciplinary Inquiry and Research, which develops disciplinary, interdisciplinary and inquiry-based thinking;</p>
<p>[2] Innovation and Design,&nbsp; which ignites innovation and design-based thinking; and</p>
<p>[3] Global Leadership and Social Entrepreneurship, which nurtures change leadership and systems-based thinking.</p>
<p>This integrative design moves far beyond the traditional boundaries of STEM education and situates learning in diverse locations: schools, museums, universities, NGOs, research laboratories, design and production studios, and online pavilions. It engages practitioners, scientists, researchers, designers, inventors and social entrepreneurs as colearners and teachers."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/50904/title/Comment__STEM_talent_Moving_beyond_traditional_boundaries" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/50904/title/Comment__STEM_talent_Moving_beyond_traditional_boundaries</a></p>
<p>This sounds like an environment where anyone can contribute and partake of lessons, but how can a group of experts socialized to learn from books and lectures learn to become inquiry-based teachers? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Would it be helpful to move people from a straight forward (but boring) explication to an interactive exploration:</p>
<p>2+2=4&nbsp;</p>
<p>versus</p>
<p>2+2=&lt;fill in the blank and see what happens&gt;?</p>
<p>In a discussion of Constraint-Based Student Models on page 81 of Woolf's book, she notes one theory "asserts that procedural learning occurs primarily when students catch themselves (or are caught by a third party) making mistakes (Ohlsson, 1994)" &nbsp;Constraint-Based Student Modeling, <em>Student Modeling: The Key to Individualized Knowledge-Based Instruction</em>, J.E. Greer and G. McMalla: 167-189</p>
<p>Could it be that the design of an e-Learning system should focus on having students <em>intentionally</em>&nbsp;make mistakes so they can get immediate feedback and learn from their mistakes?</p>        </div>
