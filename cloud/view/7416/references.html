        <p>Okay, so it's been a baptism of fire signing up and getting involved with my first MOOC.&nbsp; After nearly giving up a few times, I've persevered and followed the advice of some others who have either floundered or just got on and done something!&nbsp; So, I'm up to my knees with various online tools (passwords aren't such a problem, but I have felt that I'm moving around from one thing to another and doing 'bits' rather like starting out a jigsaw puzzle) and I think I'm reasonably comfortable now.</p>
<p>I've found a few participants from my institution so that's reassuring to see some familiar names around the MOOC although I've deliberately tried to find a different set of people to form a Team and Study Circle: I can always fall-back on well-known colleagues if I need to do so in the future.&nbsp; My Team (I think) will be looking at small changes, doing something small (but significant) and that suits me as I'm not exactly time-rich in relation to this project.&nbsp; My Study Circle is Edinburgh-based, which is a nearby city and I think it's nice to have some variety.&nbsp; Hopefully we might even get to meet up in person, but I suppose this maybe depends on how well we get on, what time we have and what we'll be asked to do in the future weeks.</p>
<p>I think we've achieved something this week.&nbsp; I've not read an awful lot about learning design, but have picked up a couple of discipline specific papers that I've been meaning to look at for a while, so that's progress for me.&nbsp; Not really sure if the mind-map worked out as it should have done.&nbsp; i did add a couple of nodes with some next and links, but I think a lot of people were put off, or perhaps still yet to complete the task.&nbsp; Learning design, for me, is very subject dependent.&nbsp; I teach law, so our learning activities are often centred around 'learning to be a lawyer' which is okay for the professional route, but many don't go into practice or indeed want to learn about practical aspects of the law.&nbsp; Learning design must therefore reflect the substantive, jurisprudential or theory of law on the undergraduate cirriculum, but still address the employability agenda for would-be-lawyers and graduates with a law degree who do something else but still want those skills.</p>
<p>Final thoughts - the technology hasn't been working well for me from the iPad, and also experienced problems loading up the MOOC pages when travelling on a train, but that's the national infrastructure and not the MOOC's fault.&nbsp; Time may well become and issue - I really don't want to work weekends (what: an academic with a weekend life?!) so I worry about being an early starter on Thu/Fri and then playing catch-up on Mon-Tue which are busy work days for the old 9-5 that pays the bills!</p>
<p>Can I have a badge now please?!</p>    </div>
