        <p><strong>Title</strong>&nbsp;<em>Developing group assessments</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p><em>I am a lecturer developing a new module, on Transitions in children and young people's lives, aimed at first year undergraduates. Transition is a key research area for me, and I am passionate about the value of the module to the studetns as practitioners.</em></p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>This is an optional module, which will become compulsory for next year. It was deliverd to 34 students, by one lecturer (me). The students often come to the course with limited academic skills, and lack confidence. Many find the transition to university difficult, and this module is delivered in Semester 2, when they have had some chance to settle in, but are often still have not fully adapted to university life.</em></p>
<p><em>Across the degree course we are introducing more group assessment, with the aim of creating a stronger sense of belonging, deepening learning through sharing, developing academic skills, and (coincidentally) reducing marking loads. A final aim for this module was to help students to understand the transition they have been/are still undergoing, in making the move to university, and to encourage them to share their experiences.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>To develop group assessments that would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Improve group sense of belonging, and help students to get to know each other better.</li>
<li>Increase student confidence, through developing a sense of shared struggle with learning.</li>
<li>Develop study skills by learning from each other, through doing together.</li>
<li>Deepen learning, through taking on different perspectives and incorporating them into their own thinking.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>1.</em><em> Students begin the module with an individual task to encourage them to develop some understanding of core theories by themselves (although using groupwork in class).</em></p>
<p><em>2. Careful selection of students for groups of three or four, based on knowledge gained in Semester 1. Groups put together based on personality, academic skills and motivation.</em></p>
<p>This worked well. It took time to work out how to assemble the groups, but it was repaid, because there was very little conflict within the groups. A particular bone of contention is non-contribution from some members. Some had 'passive members', but this was predicted, and the group number balanced to reflect this expectation.</p>
<p><em>3. Use of One Note Class Notebook to support students to work on their writing together whilst off campus.</em></p>
<p>This worked well. Students quickly took to it, and valued it. It had guided tasks on it as well as just being a &lsquo;space&rsquo; for them, to help them to see the value in it. They also liked that I could see whether or not they were all contributing.</p>
<p><em>4. Support provided to students/groups finding the task of working together difficult.</em></p>
<p>There was only one group that required intervention, and following a group discussion of the problems they were having the issues were resolved. One other student contacted me towards the end of the module to say she hadn&rsquo;t enjoyed the group work, but when she accidentally sent her &lsquo;contribution feedback&rsquo; about the rest of her group to the peers who were frustrating her, she managed to address the issues. From this she felt she had learned that she needed to tell people how she felt, as when she did they responded positively.</p>
<p><em>5. Peer assessment of contribution to the task.</em><em><br /> </em>This also helped to alleviate issues over who did what. 10% of the mark was allocated according to the contribution made, according to strict criteria, by the student. Each student rated their own contribution, and the rest of their group, and I would then work out a fair mark. In general, there was little difference between marks given by different group members, and those who did less were usually honest about it. In the previous semester we had tried getting the students to agree marks between them, but they found this too socially awkward, so this time it was done anonymously.</p>
<p><em>6. Discussion of the way the groups functioned for the first task.</em>This encouraged students to reflect on how their group could have worked better in the previous task. The reflection focused on their own learning and contribution, rather than the others in the group, so that each student reflected on what they could do as an individual to make the group's work stronger.</p>
<p><em>7. Second group task completed beyond the teaching timetable.</em></p>
<p>This seems to have caused less problems, although one student has dropped out between the first and second task, and this has caused some issues for her group.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><strong>Through this method of assessment I hoped to:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Improve group sense of belonging, and help students to get to know each other better.</li>
<li>Increase student confidence, through developing a sense of shared struggle with learning.</li>
<li>Develop study skills by learning from each other, through doing together.</li>
<li>Deepen learning, through taking on different perspectives and incorporating them into their own thinking.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Students reported that they did feel more connected to their group. Overall retention across the course is very good, and where students have left it is because they want to go to another course, rather than to leave this one. Student feedback reported very high levels of satisfaction with the module, and the group assessments. Attendance on this module was better than all other modules in this semester. When a colleague observed a taught session she said the learning in the room was tangible, and commented on the atmosphere of mutual support between students.</p>
<p>2. Students reported greater confidence, and more trust in each other. They realised that they were not alone in their struggles, and became better at helping each other. There were no module fails.</p>
<p>3. Students reported an improvement in their study skills, though this was not evident in their group marks, which went down, rather than up, for the final assessment. This may have been because they were not physically together for the final part of the assessment.</p>
<p>4. In the students written work there was evidence of learning &ndash; they clearly understood the theories they had been introduced to, and were able to see how they applied in practice. They reported that they felt they had learned a great deal through the module and valued the access to other people&rsquo;s perspectives that the group assessment gave them. The engagement with theory and practice was more developed than we often see. However, this was not necessarily reflected in their marks, because of their lack of academic skill (particularly in relation to how to use their reading to support their arguments).</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>Group assessments can be effective and enjoyable for students, if they are carefully managed on an interpersonal as well as academic level. The students valued the group assessment, and felt they benefited from it, even though this was not entirely evident in their marks. They feel they are learning from the module content and teaching, learning and assessment&nbsp; methods. One Note Class Notebook did help students who were highly committed to the module, but struggling with other life commitments, engage with the task even when they were unable to attend. There are however, areas for development.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>Students value face-to-face time together more than virtual time. For this module, I can timetable more group study time, but when it is being delivered outside the university, through a much more blended approach, this will be more difficult. I will need to think about how to support students in maintaining a sense of individuality and connection in the virtual world as well as in the real world.</em></li>
<li><em>Rather than beginning the module with an individual assessment, followed by two group assessments, I need to begin with the group and end with the individual, to give the students an opportunity to practice as an individual what they have learned with their group.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Finally, not all learning is measurable. Through this task the students have gained valuable transferable skills, around team work, communication and collaborative writing. They have increased their empathy and patience with each other, and their confidence has grown. These things are difficult to count, but invaluable</em> <em>to the students over the coming two years of their studies and in the work place.</em></p>    </div>
