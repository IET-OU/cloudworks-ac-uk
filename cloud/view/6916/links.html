<li>I have been a teacher/lecturer for many years, worked in different countries, taught different subjects, at different levels. I am originally from Sweden, but have lived in Ireland or Britain for many years. At the moment I am teaching English to Oman i students in Sohar, Oman. I am also an academic involved in research, mainly in English language and literature, which has been my discipline for the last 20 years. My PhD is in English literature. I am also interested in pedagogical matters, and have embraced using technology in teaching. Last year I completed an MA in Online and Distance Education (OU, UK). I want to learn more about the technical side of developing elearning material.</li>

			<p>The first few days of following this MOOC have been partly chaotic and partly invigorating. The chaos has consisted of finding&nbsp;my way around the Cloudworks site and the different cloudscapes&nbsp;and clouds, The invigorating part has been to connect with&nbsp;people&nbsp;all over the globe by reading their posts and commenting on some contributions. It was particularly pleasing to find some participants based in the same region as myself, the Gulf.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what will transpire from this, but I am intrigued to follow developments and participate as much as I can. I've always been of the view that the internet is good for social and outgoing people, and this MOOC will probably reinforce that belief. Just like the MAODE I completed last year, I think this course will also give me the opportunity to make some more contacts that will last beyond the 9 weeks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggested a dream project based on a discussion I had recently with a manager at my college, who was concerned about the inadequate level of English among engineering students at the college where I teach, a higher education college in Sohar, Oman. I hope that during the course I will be able to develop ideas how to help that situation in my workplace.</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>Reflections on EoR phases</p>
<p>I had a gap of almost two weeks from week 1 to week 2, so I have worked through the writing for the EoR phases rapidly. I have based my writing on my initial project. Through this process I have realised that I need to emphasise more that co-ordination between lecturers from the major subject - engineering - and the supporting are - English - is essential. There must also be a willingness by the lecturers to accept the strong influence of the designer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that there is currently unstable network access at the institution makes it a priority to find solution to enable students to work offline to a large extent. Mobile learning is also an alternative, as many students have internet-connected phones, usually Samsung.</p>
<p>Thinking about how to implement the project has made me able to map weaknesses in the current system, and made me verbalise&nbsp;necessary changes. What I am planning for is not a MOOC, but a real project that I have been asked to do at my institution; the blended learning approach is still present, but I will try to do it as self-contained as possible. Although I am behind in my MOOC work and have had to more go it alone and cut corners, I am still learning from this activity. I am forced to address elements, and I know that I have not explored it fully. The cultural dimension is bigger than I have so far scrutinised, for example. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>			<div class="posted-by">

			<p>My week 5 has ended as far as I'm concerned. I have tried to produce a prototype, but I'm afraid I wasn't quite clear about what I was doing. After having looked at a few other examples I still wasn't quite sure. The introduction&nbsp;video clearly&nbsp;did express the purpose, but I was never quite clear about how much or how little to use to inform the programmer what the course wanted to achieve. I have done this week on my own as I was late starting, so I've had no collaboration in any tasks.</p>
<p>I have in another context&nbsp;used a storyboarding&nbsp;template to do prototyping, as well as PPP, and that seemed more straightforward. The way it was done in this MOOC I got the impression you really had to have a lot of background knowledge. I had some knowledge, I realised, but I didn't know the term prototype in this context,</p>
<p>At this point I know that I have learnt a lot&nbsp;already by following this MOOC, although I have swept over parts of it quickly. I think, however, that I will to have gone through the whole MOOC, before I can go over things again, and be able to assess more clearly&nbsp;what I have actually added to my understanding of LD. The chaos, at least, doesn't seem to be imminent.</p>
<p>Now to week 6</p>			<div class="posted-by">
