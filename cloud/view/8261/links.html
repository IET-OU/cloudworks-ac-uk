        <h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I worked as a Participation Officer for deaf young people and my role was to engage with this audience and find out their interests, thought and their obstacles through fun and interactive activities, and to use this as a vehicle to influence organisational change from a child-centred perspective.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>This 1 hour long activity took place within a school classroom with 5 deaf and 5 hearing students aged 11-18. All the participants knew of each other having seen each other around school, however only two were friends. Students were initially awkward with one other there being a wide range of ages and communication factors present such as students who signed, students who spoke but still needed communication assistance to understand full instructions. The presenter was deaf, and relied on the British Sign Language interpreter to translate the comments of the hearing students, and the BSL interpreter was also on hand to translate the comments of the deaf students to the hearing students. To encourage full disclosure, no other classroom teacher was present. The classroom was of a good size, however tables had to be adjusted from rows to a horseshoe shape so that the deaf students could see and lip-read the hearing students better. Students had access to felt pens and coloured post-it notes so that thoughts and comments could be jotted down. All the students were interested in contributing to improve communication and awareness between deaf and hearing people within the school.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Developing a new resource pack containing films and lesson plans to educate hearing students about deaf students and how to communicate better with them. The measure of success was getting positive feedback on how the students wanted the films and resources to look, and to see improvement in awareness and communication within this group of students to be passed on to other students within the school.</p>

<td valign="top" width="328">
<p>Students played a lip-reading game which included getting students into pairs and getting them to turn their voice off and lip-read a few phrases. Their partner had to guess what they were saying. There was discussion about which words were easy and hard to understand, and what factors might impact on lip-reading such as moustaches, environmental factors eg light, context and accents.</p>

</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Objectives were met and interesting thoughts and comments were gained from the students to influence the creation and design of the resources.</p>
<p>The group dynamics were interesting as there was such a wide age range, older students talked more than the younger students and the younger students had to be encouraged to share their thoughts. It might have been better to have a separate session focusing on the look, feel and style of the resources, audio and subtitle access.<br /> However access to the students was limited. <br /> <br /> Due to limited time, evaluation of the session in the form of a short questionnaire was sent to the teacher to do with the students, and questions included if the students had talked to each other after the event, and if they had shared some tips from the session with their classmates.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Further sessions were held with deaf and hearing students separately, however it would have been beneficial if several sessions were held with the same group together and separately so as to glean more articulate thoughts and suggestions as deaf students may have been reluctant to share communication difficulties with hearing students.</p>    </div>
