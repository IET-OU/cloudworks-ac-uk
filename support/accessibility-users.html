            <h3>Making the most of your browser</h3>
<p>Cloudworks does not use access keys<a href="#_msocom_1">[RG1]</a>&nbsp; because they can conflict with screen reading and other adaptive technologies, however we do support keyboard access, and you can use the keyboard shortcuts and cursor (arrow) keys to navigate through the site as suggested by your web browser<a href="#_msocom_2">[RG2]</a>&nbsp;. The following links take you to the advice given by some of the most commonly used browsers: <ins datetime="2011-01-25T09:50" cite="mailto:Rebecca Galley"></ins></p>
<p><a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Accessibility?s=access+keys&as=s , http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/Internet-Explorer-accessibility-options , http://www.apple.com/safari/features.html#browsing">Firefox accessibility advice</a></p>

<h3>Navigating through Cloudworks</h3>
<p>You can navigate through Cloudworks in a number of ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the tabs at the top of each page &ndash; Home, Clouds, Cloudscapes, Events, Tags, People and Support.</li>
<li>Using links from the home page &ndash; Events, Popular Clouds/ Cloudscapes, Cloudstreams and Active Clouds</li>
<li>Using the search box which appears on all pages</li>
<li>The site uses cascading style sheets, <a href="#_msocom_3">[RG3]</a>&nbsp;rather than tables, for visual layout. </li>
<li>Headings are provided throughout, and are nested appropriately. </li>
<li>The site only uses relative font sizes, compatible with the user-specified &ldquo;text size&rdquo; option in visual browsers</li>
<li>If your browser or browsing device does not support style sheets at all, the content of each page will still be readable</li>
</ol>
<h3>Site layout and structure</h3>
<h3>User generated content</h3>
<p>Cloudworks is a social networking site, and most of the information which appears in the site has been added by other users. Although we can not control the accessibility of the material other users add, we are working to provide information and advice to make it easier for people to make their material accessible.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>Links to external websites and documents can appear in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the text, in which case the context in which      the link sits is likely to provide some explanation about where it is      going to. Users      are prompted to check that this is the case.<a href="#_msocom_4">[RG4]</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Under the &lsquo;Links&rsquo; tab on each Cloud page. Users      are prompted to give links a descriptive title.<a href="#_msocom_5">[RG5]</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h3>Images and videos</h3>
<ol>
<li>Images and videos are embedded in the site and      can be viewed in Cloudworks or directly from the host website.</li>
<li>Users are prompted to include a textual descriptive      <a href="#_msocom_6">[RG6]</a>&nbsp;&lsquo;Accessible Alternative&rsquo; when they embed images      and videos.</li>
<li>Users are prompted to add captions to their      YouTube videos <a href="#_msocom_7">[RG7]</a>&nbsp;and are provided with links to instructions and      tools to do this. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Text</h3>
<ol>
<li>The site uses TinyMCE text editor.</li>
<li>All text editors have a drop-down menu to format      text as Paragraph, Heading 2, Heading 3 etc. In order to support use of      screen readers please note that Heading 1 is deliberately not available.<ins datetime="2011-01-28T09:10" cite="mailto:Rebecca Galley"> </ins>Advice is given to contributors about      using headings via in-site help boxes.<a href="#_msocom_8">[RG8]</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>The text editor      has a full-screen button, to make it easier to edit large clouds.</li>
<li>When using a screen reader, it might be      difficult to use the TinyMCE editor. In these cases it is possible to turn      off the editor in &lsquo;preferences&rsquo;, and then plain form fields will be used      instead. To do this: <ol>
<li>log in</li>
<li>click on the red tab with your name on it to       open the drop down box</li>
<li>click on preferences</li>
<li>turn <em>on</em> &lsquo;Do not use a WYSIWYG text editor&rsquo;.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Across most of the site there are good levels of      colour contrast. The exception to this is the dark blue on light blue of      the navigation links. Here the text is written in a larger font.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Standards compliance</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Cloudworks website aims to achieve W3C WAI      Priority 2 level.</li>
<li>We aim to ensure that all pages on this site validate      as <acronym>HTML5</acronym>. You      can check the validity of any page by using W3C&rsquo;s Markup Validation      Service <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a> </li>
<li>All pages on this site use structured semantic mark-up.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cloudworks Accessibility known issues</h3>
<p>Throughout development we have worked towards achieving a high level of accessibility and usability; however, sometimes we do not meet our goals in all areas. In particular, we are aware of current issues in ensuring accessibility of user-generated content, and this is likely to be an ongoing challenge. From time to time, we will publish more about how well we are meeting our goals.</p>
<p>Cloudworks last underwent an expert accessibility audit in June 2010. The site was tested with IE7 (including largest font setting), under Windows XP, and with Jaws 11, ZoomText 10 (screen magnifier), and Windows High Contrast display setting (large font, white and yellow on black), Dragon 10 (voice recognition), and Colour Contrast Analyser tool version 2.2 (<a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrast-analyser.html">http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrast-analyser.html</a>). Many positive accessibility points were noted in the audit, and a number of issues highlighted. We are continuing to work on the following known issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who use a      screen reader may have some difficulty navigating the content, and      operating various features.</li>
<li>People who do not      use a mouse may have some difficulties with some aspects.</li>
<li>People with visual      impairments or dyslexia may find some text difficult to read due to low      contrast with the background.</li>
<li>People who require      Windows high contrast settings will find some elements are invisible or      indistinct.</li>
<li>People who use a      screen magnifier will be able to access most content, but may have      difficulty navigating the registration form due to the alignment of fields      and labels.</li>
<li>People with severe      hearing impairment will not be able to access the audio on site-related      videos.</li>
<li>People who use      voice recognition will have difficulty accessing some features.</li>
</ol>
<p>The full accessibility audit report can be found here: <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/OULDI/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Cloudworks-accessibility-June-2010.doc">http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/OULDI/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Cloudworks-accessibility-June-2010.doc</a> &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Accessibility software</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_downloads/jaws.asp">JAWS</a>, a      screen reader for Windows. A time-limited, downloadable demo is available.</li>
<li><a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a>, a      free text-only web browser for blind users with refreshable Braille      displays.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>, a      visual browser with many accessibility-related features,<ins datetime="2011-01-26T09:43" cite="mailto:Rebecca Galley"> </ins>including text zooming, user      style sheets, image toggle. A free downloadable version is available. Compatible      with Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and several other operating systems. It is      also available for the iPhone and iPad.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nvda-project.org/">NVDA</a>,      a free and open source screen reader for the Microsoft Windows operating      system. Providing feedback via synthetic speech and Braille, it enables      blind or vision impaired people to access computers running Windows. Features      include support for over 20 languages and the ability to run entirely from      a USB drive with no installation.</li>
<li><a href="http://webanywhere.cs.washington.edu/">Web      Anywhere</a>, a web-based screen reader for the web. It      requires no special software to be installed on the client machine and,      therefore, enables blind people to access the web from any computer they      happen to have access to that has a sound card. WebAnywhere will run      on any machine, even public terminals, regardless of what operating system      is running and which browsers are installed. WebAnywhere does not aim to      replace existing screen readers - it has some big limitations, for example      it will not provide access to desktop applications like word processors or      spreadsheets.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Accessibility services</h3>
<p>In addition to the BBC&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/">My Web My Way</a> site you might find the following services of interest:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://access.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ToolBar/">ATbar</a>.Developed by the University of Southampton with help from OSS      Watch and JISC. The concept behind ATbar is simple: One toolbar to provide      all of the functionality you would usually get in many different products      (i.e. magnifier, text-to-speech, dictionary, referencing, issue reporting      function), and which will run in any desktop web browser. As a user, you      have a choice of either installing the Lite bookmarklet version that can      be accessed with one click in your browser, or a full install which will      load automatically for every page.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.delorie.com/web/wpbcv.html">Web      Page Backward Compatibility Viewer</a>, a tool for viewing your web pages <em>without</em> a variety of modern browser      features.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_1">[RG1]</a><strong>Title attribute: </strong>What are access keys? Access keys provide a way to navigate around a website using predefined keys to jump to a place on a page with a single key stoke (for example to a form or a link)</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_3">[RG3]</a><strong>Title attribute:</strong> What are style sheets? Style sheets describe how documents are presented or formatted to the computer. They make more sense to screen readers than tables do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_4">[RG4]</a><strong>Text editor help: </strong>When you insert a hyperlink, check that there is sufficient contextual information to explain where the link is going to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding a link</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure that your link is fully accessible, choose a title that properly describes the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_6">[RG6]</a><strong>In site help</strong>: What is an accessible alternative?</p>
<p>Use this text box to describe the embedded content for users not able to access the embed. For example this might be a transcript to a video, or a description of an image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_7">[RG7]</a><strong>In site help</strong>: Adding captions to your YouTube videos.</p>
<p>YouTube now offer a quick and easy way to add captions to videos, making them accessible to more people. You can do this using an existing transcript, or by using the (less accurate) machine transcription service. For more information see this YouTube help guide <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=100077">http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=100077</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_8">[RG8]</a><strong>Text editor help:</strong> Using Headings</p>
<p>Headings are a useful way of organising text, and make content more accessible for users of screen readers. Screen readers used by people with vision impairment rely on the built-in heading styles to make sense of documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is there no Heading 1?</p>
<p>We have deliberately left out Heading 1 because it is already used in the main page and may cause confusion for screen reader users if it is also used in the text editor. Just use Heading 2 as your primary heading.</p>        </div>
