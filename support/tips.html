            <h2>1. Supporting conferences</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set up a Cloudscape for a conference.</li>
<li>Include a short clear description of the conference in the Cloudscape with a link to the conference website.</li>
<li>Agree and promote a hash (#) tag to be used for the conference, which can be used for Twitter, Blogs, Flckr etc.</li>
<li>Incorporate a dynamic twitter stream, blog aggregator, flickr stream using the agreed conference tag.</li>
<li>Promote the conference Cloudscape to delegates, via Twitter etc and invite them to follow the Cloudscape.</li>
<li>Live blog sessions and include as Clouds in the conference Cloudscape, keep entries short with succinct summaries, provide links to further information.</li>
<li>Comment on related Clouds in the Cloudscape that others have created.</li>
<li>If you would like the Cloudscape to be featured on the front page, send us the URL and a 240x180 image. We'll need permission from the copyright holder to put the image on the site too.</li>
<li>The site is only supported on a best effort basis and during UK working hours, so please don't rely on it as a replacement for a conference website. We also usually perform upgrades on Thursday mornings so there is sometimes some short downtime then. </li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Supporting workshops</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cloudscapes can also be used to support workshops and all the tips and hints suggested for supporting conferences are also valid for supporting workshops.</li>
<li>Set up discussion Clouds that can be used as a basis for group activities during the workshop. Include a brief outline of the activity you want delegates to take part in and any associated questions you want them to address. Get them working in groups and entering their discussions as comments on the discussion Cloud. Encourage them to scan what other groups are entering.</li>
<li>Live blog workshop sessions such as plenary discussions and feedback sessions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Aggregating resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set up a Cloudscape to support a special interest group and input Clouds of relevant resources. For example Cloudscapes can be set up for particular cohorts of students, enabling them to share good learning resources, and discuss learning strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Sharing innovative learning and teaching ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create Clouds on good learning and teaching ideas you have created or that you have seen or experienced. Keep your Clouds short and succinct; include relevant links to further information. Consider depositing further information in an Open Educational Resource repository such as Connexions. Tag appropriately in terms of subject, pedagogy and tools.</li>
<li>Set up a Cloudscape to aggregate related innovative Clouds - for example those relating to mobile learning, problem-based learning, learning a language.</li>
<li>Enrich Clouds using the html functionality available in the editor. Hyperlink to relevant information.  Include illustrative images. Embed slideshare presentations, YouTube videos or flickr images. Aggregate related tweets or blogs.</li>
<li>Search the site by browsing the tag Cloud, 'All Clouds' list, 'All Cloudscapes' list or via individual profiles or search using key words.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Connect with others</h2>
<ul>
<li>Complete your profile details - include a summary of your interests and link to relevant websites. Provide details of your twitter name, which will enable any tweets with your twitter name on to be aggregated under your profile and will provide a means for other users of Cloudworks to contact you via twitter.</li>
<li>Follow Cloudscapes and people you are interested in, these will be listed on your profile and give others an idea of your interests.</li>
<li>Get creating Clouds! These will also be listed on your profile.</li>
<li>Engage in a conversation, comment on other people's entries and Clouds.</li>
<li>Find others by name or institution.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Keep abreast of new developments</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set up RSS feeds for Cloudscapes or people you are interested in keeping up to date with.</li>
<li>Browse the front page to get an idea of new Clouds and any new discussions around Clouds.</li>
