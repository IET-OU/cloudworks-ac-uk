<li id="intro"> <h2>Introduction</h2> <ol>
<li>Cloudworks is a social networking site for finding, sharing and                  discussing learning and teaching ideas and designs.                   (<a href="https://cloudworks.ac.uk">https://cloudworks.ac.uk</a>) ('Site') and is operated by the Open                  University ('we' or 'us') whose principal contact address is PO                  Box 197 , Milton Keynes, MK7 6BJ, United Kingdom . We are a provider                  of higher education facilitated by distance learning and operate a                  wide range of courses for students both in the UK and internationally. </li>
<li>This Site is offered free of charge to you and your use of it is              subject to these terms and conditions ('Terms'). Only those who accept              these Terms are allowed to contribute to this Site. </li>
<li>To contribute to this Site you must read and accept these Terms. Upon              registering you accept that you are legally bound by these Terms. If              you do not agree to be bound then please do not complete your registration. </li>
<li>You can gain different levels of access to this Site. You can simply             browse this Site and view its contents however to experience its full              potential (e.g. to interact with other users, add comments/additional               content, including any links (URLs)) you must become a registered user.               You will need to provide us with some personal details about yourself in               order to become a registered user. Further information is set out in our               Privacy Statement [<a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/about/thiswebsite/">https://www.open.ac.uk/about/thiswebsite/</a>]. You should                read our Privacy Statement before registering. </li>
<li>We may update these Terms (including our Privacy Statement) from time              to time. Changes will have immediate effect from the date of posting on              this Site and you should therefore review these Terms regularly. Your              continued use of this Site after changes have been made will be taken to              indicate that you accept that you are bound by the updated Terms. </li>

<li id="license"> <h2>Content and information</h2> <ol> &lt;!--
<li>Comments and additional content on the Site are covered by one of three licences/ terms detailed below. At registration a default position will be automatically applied to any comments/ additional content you may add. You may change your default permissions on your profile page and edit the permissions for any of your individual comments/ additional content. You may choose from:                 <ol>
<li>The Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 UK: England & Wales license

<li>the content is yours, or you have the permission of the owner to agree to this usage, and
<li>you accept that the content is available to all users  upon the terms agreed in 2.1. </ol>
<li> subject to 2.5 you may use content and services directly available through the Site under the appropriate terms. This means you agree to adhere to the permissions granted to you by the author of the comments/ additional content.
<li>you should not link to any third party sites where to do so would breach the terms of those sites
<li>content and services embedded or linked to from third party sites, for instance YouTube or Flickr, will be subject to the terms of those sites. It is your responsibility to check.
<li>If you no longer want us to use the content you have added, you should delete it from the site. It will stop being available to other users. (It will remain in the site backups for a reasonable period of time, but will not be available to other users.) </ol>--&gt;
<li> All rights are reserved on comments and additional content added to the Site and no other uses permitted without permission from the user. Over the first 6 months of 2010 we will add functionality to allow users to choose from the following permissions:
<ul>
<li>The Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales license </li>
<li>The Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales or </li>
<li>All rights reserved and no other uses permitted without permission from you. </li>

You will be able to change your default permissions on your profile page and edit the permissions for any of your individual comments/ additional content.
