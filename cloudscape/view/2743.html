        <h2>DIY Google Group at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>I'm experimenting with a Google Group as an alternative to Cloudworks, if &nbsp;I can work out how to invite everyone who has expressed interest in DIY Multimedia I will send invitations but in the meantime, please do go to the link and request membership.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>DIY Multimedia links at <a href="http://www.bibsonomy.org/user/suewatling" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.bibsonomy.org/user/suewatling&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>I've started a collection of links to free audio and video software on this bibsonomy site&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>DIY multimedia is a close relation to digital literacies so if this is your interest please feel free to join in too - &nbsp;'lurking' can be useful :-)</p>
<p>Next step is to contact everyone who has expressed interest in DIY &nbsp;multimedia and try to bring you all into the same place - this might not work - so am keeping virtual fingers crossed :-) If you see this and are interested please do let me know; it would be helpful if you could cc my work email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:swatling@lincoln.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">swatling@lincoln.ac.uk</a>&nbsp;if this is possible.</p>
<h2>Back ground information&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Innovation with Multimedia demands enhanced digital literacies and successful production is empowering in terms of digital confidence and competence.</p>
<p>At Lincoln, staff adopt a DIY approach to content creation of audio/video materials to enhance their teaching and learning. &nbsp;This can be highly successful but many projects don&rsquo;t get beyond the planning stage or remain half completed and abandoned; most often due to time restraints and technical difficulties in particular with content quality and production. My role is supporting the pedagogical development of online resources but inevitably the technology barriers dominate. At Lincoln there is no central content production unit or access to network supported software for audio/video. I show staff how to run Audacity from a datastick. For Video I recommend looking at free software like MovieMaker, Screenr and Jing and suggest Camtasia as a worthwhile &nbsp;&lsquo;one stop shop&rsquo; expense for screen capture etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim is to produce a help guide for staff in terms of what software to use, how to use it and hints and tips for production of short video clips/podcasts with appropriate beginnings and endings - using as much as possible existing free open resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just completed the lead on a 12 month JISC/HEA funded project to look at adopting and embedding the use of Open Educational Resources as a whole institution strategy <a title="Embedding OER Practice " href="http://oer.lincoln.ac.uk" rel="nofollow">http://oer.lincoln.ac.uk</a>. This surfaced interest in content to support learning but also highlighted the absence of central support and lack of a knowledge/skill base to move forward.</p>
<p>Multimedia production is integral to digital literacies; digital cameras and hosting services like YouTube make it possible to produce content outside of the professional studio and with appropriate guidance and support plus application of the principles of learning design, DIY multimedia production can not only enhance T&amp;L quality but also support individual confidence and competence with digital ways of working.</p>
<h2>Afterthoughts&nbsp;</h2>
<div>Learning design with multimedia must include attention to accessibility and inclusion. Making sure content is provided in alternative formats is something to be considered at the beginning of the process, e.g. transcripts, captions, subtitles etc, and not bolted on as an after thought at the end (see TechDis for advice and guidance). This process needs to be meaningful otherwise the result becomes tokenistic. See&nbsp;<a href="http://suewatling.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2013/01/16/tokenistic-captions-on-nss-official-video-2013/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://suewatling.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2013/01/16/tokenistic-captions-on-nss-official-video-2013/</a>&nbsp;for an example of careless attention to these things!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Oh and the ethics of using multimedia - permissions, consent, copyright, health and safety etc.... more on this to follow</div>    </div>
