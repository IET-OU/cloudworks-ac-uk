<h2>Competition trail winner</h2>
<p>Fiona Harris, Faculty of Business and Law was the lucky winner of the wifi Kindle as a result of participating in the trail around the fair competition.&nbsp; Congratulations Fiona.</p>
<h2>Your Feedback</h2>
<p>Feedback is currently being collated and analysed.&nbsp; Thank you for completing the online feedback form.</p>
<h2>About the fair</h2>
<p>IET, The Library and LTS collaborated in the planning and running of this annual drop-in event for all OU staff which gave an informal opportunity to find out about the latest developments of using technology in education.</p>
<p>We chose topics to interest a wide variety of OU staff including associate lecturers.&nbsp; Whether you are involved in teaching students, conducting research or supporting module teams, you'll have found something to inspire you and which will be useful for your work.&nbsp; The fair also gave you a great opportunity to network and exchange news and views with colleagues.</p>
<p>This time we provided a facility for remote participation in some aspects of the fair for staff members not on campus, enabling you to ask questions about the featured topics and watch the presentations.&nbsp; We pilot tested this online element of the fair with two regions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the fair, please email <a href="mailto:iet-epd@open.ac.uk" rel="nofollow">iet-epd@open.ac.uk</a>.&nbsp; There was no need to register your attendance in advance, though we always invite people to sign in at the door so we can request feedback later.&nbsp; Online participants were invited to sign in and provide feedback about the event too.</p>

<h3>Comments from those who have attended previous fairs:</h3>
<p><em>It is really useful to be able to talk to people face to face, and find out more. It is helpful that they can demonstrate items in response to a question. It is also useful to see other technologies that could be useful in the future. The stalls are a brilliant resource and I appreciate the people who give up time to run them.</em></p>
<p><em>Really important event for getting stimulated and excited by the wide range of things going on and their application.&nbsp; Very interested by the development of tools to support learning and teaching.</em></p>
<p><em>I love the Learn About fairs! Always learn something new, the presentations are short, to the point and well-delivered, and every time I come away with a freebie (this time the chromosome fridge magnets). Great that you can dip in and nip out if you're short of time. </em></p>
<p><em>Good to get the 'lowdown' on aspects I was aware of but did not necessarily understand.</em></p>
<p><em>Interesting mobile learning stand &amp; presentation. Really good format for an event - very lively &amp; energetic!</em></p>
<p><em>Really exciting - lots to look at &amp; learn.</em></p>
<p><em>Very interesting to see what courses are already doing - and good to see the wide range of technologies!</em></p>
<p><em>It's always enjoyable just to browse and find out more about technological aspects which one hears about in the course of a day's work but doesn't necessarily understand what they are or how they work.</em></p>
