<p>The conceptual framework has been introduced in a&nbsp;Commentary&nbsp;by Andrew Pollard on behalf of&nbsp;the UK's Teaching and Learning Research Programme (<a href="http://www.tlrp.org" rel="nofollow">www.tlrp.org</a>) and&nbsp;produced in collaboration with the General Teaching Council for England (<a href="http://www.gtce.org.uk" rel="nofollow">www.gtce.org.uk</a>).&nbsp; A pdf of the full Commentary, in all its design glory, can be viewed at: <a href="http://www.tlrp.org/pub/documents/TLRPGTCEProf&Pedagogy.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.tlrp.org/pub/documents/TLRPGTCEProf&amp;Pedagogy.pdf</a>.&nbsp; Taking a look at this may help in understanding the overall intentions of this initi\ative.</p>
<p>Within this Cloudscape, the first two&nbsp;introductory Clouds explain the rationale and background to the work.&nbsp; Most of the remaining Clouds relate to cells in the conceptual framework and are coded by Row and Column (R1C1, for instance).&nbsp; Both the rationale as a whole and the content of specific cells is contestable of course - hence posting in this Cloudscape to facilitate debate.&nbsp; It is nevertheless hoped that there may be sufficient substance in this type of representation to make it a useful device for professional and academic discussion. That is its status - it is not seeking to be definitive in any way.</p>
<p>Comments are invited on any of the elements - now presented as Clouds.&nbsp;Flash debates are anticipated .....</p>
<p>Outcomes of such discussions will be used to develop the framework further and to enhance the underlying evidence-base.&nbsp; Improved versions will then be made freely available under a Creative Commons license at <a href="http://www.rtweb.info/concepts" rel="nofollow">www.rtweb.info/concepts</a>.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;expected to underpin future development of Andrew Pollard's materials on reflective teaching (see <a href="http://www.rtweb.info" rel="nofollow">www.rtweb.info</a>) which already incorporate many TLRP findings and insights.&nbsp; This work will take that process a stage further to maximise the impact of the research programme as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consultation on this conceptual framework is taking place during 2010&nbsp;through both Cloudworks and also in more conventional seminars and presentations.&nbsp; The work is funded by ESRC and the Institute of Education, University of London as part of a Programme Fellowship award to Andrew Pollard.</p>    </div>
