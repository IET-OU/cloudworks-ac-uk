<h3><strong>Your Feedback please</strong></h3>
<p><strong>We have sent out requests for feedback to everyone who registered at the door.&nbsp; If you watched the presentations online please complete the feedback questionnaire at <strong><a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/forms/LAFair2013feedback/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www3.open.ac.uk/forms/LAFair2013feedback/</a></strong> by 22 March 2013.<br /></strong></p>
<h2>About the fair</h2>
<p>IET, Library Services and LTS collaborate in the planning and running of this annual drop-in event for all OU staff which gives an informal opportunity to find out about the latest developments of using technology in education.&nbsp; Originally launched as a way to showcase the <a href="http://epd.open.ac.uk/browseLAG.cfm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Learn About Guides</strong></a> the fair has grown over the years to keep abreast of new tools and methods of teaching and learning, it has always been 'topic' rather than 'department' or 'project' focussed.</p>
<p>Topics were chosen to interest a wide variety of OU staff including associate lecturers.&nbsp; Whether you are involved in teaching students, conducting research or supporting module teams, you will have found something to inspire you and which would be useful for your work.&nbsp; The fair gave you a great opportunity to network and exchange news and views with colleagues.&nbsp; The fair was offered as a occasion for you to expand your knowledge of the topics both for your work and professional development.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the fair, please email <a href="mailto:iet-epd@open.ac.uk" rel="nofollow">iet-epd@open.ac.uk</a>.&nbsp; There was no need to register your attendance in advance, though we always invite people to sign in at the door so we can request feedback later.&nbsp; Online participants were invited to email us or tweet <strong>#learnaboutatOU</strong> and provide feedback about the event too.</p>
<p>There was a free light lunch available for those who attended the event face-to-face, if you visited the fair this way we ran a competition in which participants had a chance to win a Kindle Fire (unfortunately we could not extend this offer to those participating online).</p>
<p>OU Associate Lecturers who attended the fair were asked to check the procedures for claiming travel to Walton Hall which are explained at <a title="http://www.open.ac.uk/tutors/employment-info/pages/expenses/traveltodevelopmentevents.htm" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/tutors/employment-info/pages/expenses/traveltodevelopmentevents.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.open.ac.uk/tutors/employment-info/pages/expenses/traveltodevelopmentevents.htm</a></p>
