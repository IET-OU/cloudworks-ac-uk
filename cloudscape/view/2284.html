        <h2>Inclusive practice and Open Educational Resources: a research-based workshop</h2>
<h3>Professor Christine Hockings, University of Wolverhampton</h3>
<h4>Wednesday 18th May 2011, CMR11, Open University campus in Milton Keynes, 1pm &ndash; 2.30pm with a light lunch and networking from midday.</h4>
<p><em>Full details and booking instructions are available from: <a href="http://www8.open.ac.uk/about/wideningparticipation/research/seminars" rel="nofollow">http://www8.open.ac.uk/about/wideningparticipation/research/seminars</a>. This event is <strong>free </strong>to attend.</em></p>
<p>In recent years there has been a growing concern in the sector about  the understanding and evidence for what are described &lsquo;Professional  Values&rsquo;.&nbsp; These values include &lsquo;respect for individual learners,&rsquo;  'commitment to encouraging widening participation in HE, acknowledging  diversity and promoting equality of opportunity.&rsquo; (UKSPF 2006) In  response to this concern, the sector has recently revised and clarified  the professional values within the framework, and committed investment  to aid their development through the creation of Open Educational  Resources (OER), to be freely available for the sector.</p>
<p>In this workshop, I outline the ways in which one OER project  (Learning to Teach Inclusively), funded under the HEA/JISC OER OMAC  scheme, is attempting to address the gap in the understanding and  development of professional values and inclusive practice.</p>
<p>I begin by outlining some of the principles of inclusive learning and  teaching arising from our ESRC funded research project 'Learning and  teaching for social diversity and difference in HE'.&nbsp; I then explore  with colleagues the ways in which inclusive practice is currently being  developed within your own institution.&nbsp; I demonstrate some of the OERs  that we have developed so far and discuss with colleagues the ways in  which they might be reused or repurposed to support and enhance  inclusive practice within your institution.&nbsp; There may also be an  opportunity for colleagues to engage hands on with the on line, media  rich, activities and resources that include video clips of authentic  learning and teaching sessions illustrative of inclusive approaches.</p>
<p>By the end of the workshop colleagues will have had the opportunity  to discuss principles of inclusive practice and the development of  professional values and inclusive practitioners.&nbsp; They will also have  had the opportunity to contribute to the on going development of open  educational resources designed to enhance inclusive learning  environments.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Speaker biography</h3>
<p><strong>Christine Hockings </strong>is Professor of Learning and  Teaching in Higher Education at the University of Wolverhampton's  Institute for Learning Enhancement.&nbsp; She has an international reputation  for her research in the pedagogy of widening participation and student  diversity. She is frequently invited to speak at conferences and has  published widely in the area of academic engagement and inclusive  learning and teaching.&nbsp; In 2006-8 she was the Principal Investigator  (PI) for a widening participation project funded by the Economic and  Social Research Council (ESRC) and she is currently PI for a project  funded by JISC and the Higher Education Academy (HEA) to develop Open  Educational Resources for the HE sector designed for the enhancement of  inclusive learning environments.&nbsp; She recently carried out a synthesis  of the research into inclusive learning and teaching for the Higher  Education Academy.</p>
<p>She is committed to developing undergraduate research and has  conducted a number of small scale studies with undergraduates as  co-researchers on projects including fairness in assessment and black  minority ethnic student attainment.&nbsp; She is responsible for promoting  and coordinating pedagogical research across the University of  Wolverhampton and in 2007 she was awarded a National Teaching Fellowship  for her research and capacity building work.</p>    </div>
