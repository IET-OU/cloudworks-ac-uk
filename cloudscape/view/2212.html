        <p>The  &lsquo;Mobile learning: Crossing boundaries in convergent environments&rsquo;  Conference, taking place in Bremen (Germany) from Monday to Tuesday,  March 21st to 22nd, 2011, builds on a series of mobile learning research  symposia hosted by the <a href="http://www.wlecentre.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.londonmobilelearning.net/images/ico_extlink.png" border="0" alt="" align="bottom" />&nbsp;WLE Centre for Excellence</a> at the Institute of Education, University of London between 2007 and  2009. It will focus on the challenges of developing new pedagogic  approaches and on the potential of mobile devices for learning in formal  and informal contexts. As mobile learning is not only about learning  with mobile technologies, but also considered to be "new" learning, the  conference will look at challenges for research and practice in  understanding the changing social and technological structures allowing  the use of technology for learning that are present in our personal  lives, in school and in work places. Thus mobile learning crosses the  boundary of institutional learning and looks at practical fields like  research and medicine, too. Also, the conference will look at the latest  developments in hardware and software which can support personalised  learning.</p>
<p>By focusing on theory and practice, development  and use, teaching and learning, formal and informal contexts, the  &lsquo;Mobile learning: Crossing boundaries in convergent environments&rsquo;  Conference intends to offer spaces for researchers, practitioners,  developers, the industry and policy makers to exchange ideas,  experiences and research around issues and approaches to mobile  learning, including sociological and educational issues and their  effectiveness and desirability as learning spaces as well as the design  of environments.</p>
<p>Whilst the conference includes a traditional  research paper strand, we also encourage proposals for sessions in  different formats including workshops, posters, cafe and debate  sessions, videos, slideshows, podcasts, cartoons and hands on sessions.  There will be a German language strand, so contributions in German are  also welcome!              <br />We will also provide opportunities for 'unconference' events,  including the provision of spaces for informal meetings and discussions.</p>
<p>The number of participants is limited to 150.  However, video contributions for loop-presentations during the  conference from people who are not able to attend in person are welcome.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Mobile learning: Crossing boundaries in convergent environments&rsquo; Conference is preceded by the <a href="http://educamp.mixxt.de/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.londonmobilelearning.net/images/ico_extlink.png" border="0" alt="" align="bottom" />&nbsp;EduCamp</a>, a specialised BarCamp for people interested in media and learning, which will take place in Bremen from March 19 to 20, 2011.</p>
<p>In collaboration with <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.londonmobilelearning.net/images/ico_extlink.png" border="0" alt="" align="bottom" />&nbsp;MirandaNet</a>, the conference is running a <a href="http://www.mirandanet.ac.uk/mirandamods/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.londonmobilelearning.net/images/ico_extlink.png" border="0" alt="" align="bottom" />&nbsp;MirandaMod</a>,  developed as part of a WLE Centre-funded project, which addresses  teachers and practitioners who are interested in teaching and learning  with new technologies, and would either like to share their experiences  or learn from others. People can attend the MirandaMod in person at the  conference or online via a FlashMeeting. Detailed information about  technical requirements and collaboration tools will be made available on  the conference website.</p>

<p><strong> </strong>Submission of  abstracts for research papers, workshops  and posters are invited. The  submission for conference activities in  alternative formats such as  cafe or debate sessions, videos, slideshows,  podcasts, cartoons, hands  on sessions &nbsp;&ndash; or any other kind of format  you can think of &ndash; is also  welcome.</p>
<p>The abstracts for research papers should contain 650  words,  including keywords. Abstract for alternative formats differ. Full   details may be found in the <a href="http://londonmobilelearning.net/downloads/CfP-Bremen_2010-10-15.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.londonmobilelearning.net/images/ico_download.png" border="0" alt="download" />&nbsp;guidelines</a>. Please indicate the thematic strand and the type of activity as well as the language the contribution covers.</p>
<p>Proposals can be submitted electronically through  the conference  tool from October 31st, 2010 to December 5th, 2010,  accessible via the  conference website. We are especially looking for  originality and  relevance of ideas and for creativity in proposals, in  form and  content.</p>
<p>All proposals will be subject to a peer review process.</p>
<p>The conference proposes - but does by no means limit contributions to - the following topics:</p>
<p>Strand 1: <em>Theoretical inputs on mobile learning</em><br /> Issues to be explored may include:</p>
<ol>
<li>What theoretical and methodological approaches are appropriate for research mobile learning?</li>
<li>What pedagogic approaches to the use of mobile devices for learning are feasible?</li>
<li>How does ubiquitous access to the internet change the dynamics of learning both in and outside the classroom and work place?</li>
<li>Cultural practices of learning, meaning-making and  appropriation:  Media usage and the social impact of using networked  technologies in  everyday life context.</li>
<li>How does mobile learning impact on research and innovation?</li>
<li>Ethical issues around learning with mobile networked technologies.</li>
<li>How can informal learning and learning in informal contexts contribute to learning in formal contexts?</li>
<li>How does sign-making and communication with mobile devices impact on language and literacy? </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strand 2: <em>Practical issues to support mobile learning</em><br /> Issues to be explored may include:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the rationale for implementing mobile learning in educational settings and at work?</li>
<li>What end-user support is important for mobile learning? How can it best be provided?</li>
<li>Challenges of the implementation and management of mobile  learning:  educational institutions, organisational learning, the  organisation of  learning</li>
<li>Using mobile devices for work based learning</li>
<li>What are the issues around using personally owned devices for mobile learning in institutional contexts?</li>
<li>Scalability problems: difficulties and solutions from developing a pilot project into mass application</li>
<li>Assessment with mobile technologies, assessment of and with mobile learning</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strand 3: <em>Concrete pointers and examples on mobile learning</em><br /> Issues to be explored may include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use of mobile networked technologies in medical settings</li>
<li>Game-based learning using mobile technologies</li>
<li>Augmented reality and augmented learning</li>
</ol> <ol>
<li>Mobile devices and e-science</li>
<li>Mobile learning and arts</li>
<li>Using mobile devices, e-Portfolios and Personal Learning Environments</li>
<li>Visualisation, Gesture-based interaction, Wearables, Open and linked data, Location-awareness and context-sensitivity</li>
<li>Impact of new technologies and its semiotics on the way we use language/ signs for meaning-making</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strand 4: <em>Utopian corner: Glimpse of our future learning and work<br /> </em>We  welcome the exploration of ideas and visions of how our  future  learning as well as work becomes influenced by mobile  technologies and  convergent environments. We encourage the discussion of  ideas of  tomorrow to make meaning of the devices of today. In this  strand we  provide the space and time for ideas to be explored not in a  practical  sense but in terms of an utopian situation. Any type of  suitable format  (video, simulation, images, art, poster) is possible.</p>
<ol>
<li>Current and emerging trends</li>
<li>Ideas for the future, ideas for a learning utopia</li>
</ol>
