              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Multimedia Poster</h2>
<p>For an introduction to the project presentation please see the >multimedia poster</a> . I have also created an >accessible version</a> of my poster for people with sight challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Social exclusion has continued to be an enormous issue despite the increase in technologically rich learning platforms on the internet. A lot of those who use mobile technology have access to the internet but are unaware of the existence or use of OER (Online Educational Resources) and so they are being left behind.</p>
<p>My project is focus on the adaptation of OER for English language teachers. The essence of the project is to provide help to ensure the provision of learning materials to the marginalised teachers in the developing world, especially those in sub-Saharan African countries such as Nigeria.</p>
<p>The project will sensitise the teachers and help them acquire information and knowledge on OER. The English language teachers on the project will discover alternative ways of demonstrating what they know, and this will lead to a change in their classrooms as they begin to challenge their learners in more productive ways using materials from the OER sites.</p>
<p>Most teachers in Nigeria use mobile technologies and are on social media app networks such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram. This project will empower the teachers and improve their access to professional development and education available via OER sites (See O&rsquo;Connor, 2000). OER offers a plethora of choices.</p>
<p>My presentation will consider how systems can be created for teachers to have access to OER repositories. In recent times, there has been an increase in internet-based network of freely available online resources for learning and teaching. These open educational resources include highly interactive and innovative curricula, visualizations, simulations and lesson plans. There are features that support the use of real-world resources (see McArthur &amp; Zia 2008; Zia, 2001; Borgman et al., 2008). These increasingly available online resources are infrastructure available for teachers to use, access, and share, connect, create and adapt resources in ways that can change their practice (Borgman et al. 2008).</p>
<p>In the presentation, I will demonstrate that the use of social media technologies has an essential place in teacher professional development because teachers learn voluntarily. Teachers use forums to reflect on own practices and exchange ideas with colleagues (see Marcia &amp; Garcia, 2016). So, instant messaging software have helped teachers to adapt information, to re-conceptualize and to make information much more functional for their contexts (Cranefield &amp; Yoong, 2009). In very recent years, mobile learning devices have offered a variety of learning opportunities (see Macia &amp; Garcia, 2016; Rambe &amp; Bere, 2013; Cakir &amp; Arslan, 2013; Hwang, Huang &amp; Wu, 2011).</p>
<p>Given that WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook stand out in many studies as effective tools and applications used by many people and available in mobile devices. It is easy to create online community of practice using WhatsApp, Telegram or Facebook (see Baran &amp; Cagiltay, 2010; Wesley, 2013) and many teachers all over the world use WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook for social and learning purposes.</p>

              <title>MON:Online international collaboration to analyse childcare practices  (Angela Bonehill)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10201</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10201</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This presentation aims to demonstrate the impact of a collaboration between two universities. Online International Learning (OIL) projects involve online interactions between students studying at a UK university and other international universities, developing further &lsquo;intercultural and digital skills&rsquo; between students and organisations ( Villar-Onrubia, &nbsp;Rajpal, 2016). A small amount of students get the opportunity to work or travel abroad as part of their studies, interactions through the internet can be a way forward for widening participation with regards to supporting the intercultural interactions.</p>
<p>The design of this innovative online project was to facilitate a working party of students from Denmark and England to converse and assess the differences of curriculum planning and childcare in the two countries. There is a vast difference in the childcare systems of both countries. This was explored through digital collaboration on a number of platforms.</p>
<p>What was the motivation? To educate the students on the different curriculums, to enable them to analyse, to evaluate, and to give them knowledge of other practices.&nbsp; We began with UK organisations linked to education, we invited guest speakers, we watched videos of different practices, we read studies and papers, we visited children&rsquo;s centres, forest schools, nurseries, and schools, but the learning was passive, the students were not engaged, the students found it difficult to put this into practice or to contextualise their learning. The teachers were the depositors and the students were the depositories (Freire 1974). How could we change the perspective and practice of these new practitioners? We were beginning to get a vision: to expand cognitive horizons about early childhood studies and research beyond the United Kingdom with an interactive project where other students gave their perspective of curriculum and children&rsquo;s development through online collaboration. The students became the teachers.</p>
<p>As a group we began to question&hellip;What if we could&nbsp; encourage students to unlearn everything that they have learned about education, to gain a better understanding of natural learning rather than the structured delivery here in the UK? How can we ensure the new practitioner goes out into practice with a new mindset? How can we empower new practitioners to make changes to the existing curriculum but still meet the government frameworks for the county? Why do children not go outside to learn? (Henley 2010)</p>
<p>Early childhood students in their second-year degree collaborated with their equivalent in Copenhagen studying a contrasting early childhood pedagogy program. This occurred through structured online learning using platforms; &nbsp;a shared Moodle, vlogs and&nbsp; skype.</p>
<p>The students had regular interactions and developed relationships as well as &nbsp;learning about the child care practices and culture of another country, from the initial feedback students and lecturers, developed an understanding of the democratic and spiritual care that pedagogues &nbsp;provide in Denmark and the importance of the assessments and milestones children are expected to reach as per the Early Years Framework in the UK (Gov.uk 2016).</p>
<p>The presentation will report on the experience of networking with academics, students and colleagues, it will demonstrate that digital communications will encourage wider collaboration, mobility and changes in practice for the early years sector.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Since 1974, disabled students in England have been able to apply for non-repayable grants, known as &lsquo;Disabled Students&rsquo; Allowances (DSAs)&rsquo;, to assist with the additional costs incurred whilst completing higher education study (Willetts, 2014). Such grants provided allowances for specialised equipment, non-medical assistance such as note takers and specialised tutors, books and consumables, as well as travel allowances (Disability Rights UK, 2015). In addition to the support provided by DSAs, the introduction of the Equality Act 2010 placed a legal duty on businesses and education providers to take positive steps, referred to as &lsquo;reasonable adjustments&rsquo;, to remove barriers faced by people, due to their disability (Citizens Advice, n.d.). This includes making changes to the ways things are done e.g. provision, criterion or practice; physical features of buildings such as entrances and exits; as well as the provision of extra aids or services such as: induction hearing loops, providing information in alternative formats etc. (Citizens Advice, n.d.).</p>
<p>Despite the reasonable adjustments implemented by higher education institutions (HEIs), the costs of the DSA provision have risen sharply from &pound;101.3m in 2009-10 to &pound;145.8m in 2012-13, an increase of 44% (Weale, 2015). In 2014, the Minister for Universities and Science announced a series of changes to modernise the existing system to &lsquo;rebalance&rsquo; responsibilities for student support. Thus, ensuring that the limited public funding is available to those most in need, and provides the support they require (Willetts, 2014). The changes are designed to move away from a system of individualised support funded by DSAs, to one where HEIs play a greater role in supporting all students, regardless of whether they have a disability or not.</p>
<p>With these changes coming into force from September 2016, HEIs within England have been required to review and, if required, revise their current student support arrangements to ensure they are prepared for these changes and can support learners effectively (McNaught, 2016). Whilst there are many small and simple changes academic staff can take to improve the accessibility of their teaching such as: providing information ahead of sessions, creating learning materials which meet accessibility guidelines and encouraging students to record teaching sessions etc. (Canterbury Christ Church University, n.d.), this does not resolve the underlying issues. As McNaught (2016) summarises &lsquo;[t]eaching and learning pedagogies, practices and technologies can inadvertently create barriers for students with disabilities&rsquo;, to overcome these a different approach is required.</p>
<p>To address some of the challenges raised by these recent changes and the need for HEIs to make anticipatory, rather than reactive changes, this conference presentation will provide an overview and demonstration of a short online course being developed by the author. Built using the Canvas open education platform, this short course aimed at academics working within UK HEIs, will provide a more in-depth overview of the changes to disabled student support, whilst also introducing delegates to two educational frameworks; Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Inclusive Curriculum. Building on research undertaken by Marquis et al. (2016), this course will utilise a flipped learning pedagogy; whereby the learning materials are placed online and classroom sessions are used to enable deeper exploration and discussion of the topics raised (The Higher Education Academy, n.d.).

<p>If people are changing the ways they engage with work then careers workers need to reform the help they offer.&nbsp; There are few twenty-first-century answers to twenty-second-century questions.</p>
<p>There's a lot to catch up on.&nbsp; Key areas of careers-work thinking need updating. &nbsp;The links to the thinking include the originals, so that you can track the background for reform.&nbsp; The new thinking is re-aligned to an increasingly commercial world, driven by a disturbingly clever information technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other links feature a widening range of new &amp; radical ideas for supporting the reform and expansion of careers work.&nbsp; All accommodate new thinking for twenty-first century reform.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>People are changing the way they manage their lives.&nbsp; Careers work cannot afford to neglect the news.&nbsp; But it comes with a <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/nicecspace&place.pdf">warning about priorities</a>&nbsp;- should careers work embed prevailing expertise, or rebuild it in response to change?&nbsp; It's a balancing of convention and reform - guess which is a way foward and which a blind alley?</p>
<p>Reform needs new ideas.&nbsp; The new idea here understands contemporary career management as a process of 'holding on' and 'letting go'. &nbsp;The idea cropped up first in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbnarrative.pdf">narrative thinking</a>.&nbsp; It can connect to policy, professionalism and practice.&nbsp; It would expand the careers-work repertoire. &nbsp;More importantly, it can position clients and students as agents of change.</p>
<p>To get anywhere with this means documenting how a person <em>holds on</em> to friends that matter, to assumptions that feel right, and to privileges that stand a person in good stead.&nbsp; But people might instead&nbsp;<em>let go</em> of friends, or assumptions or privileges if they are found to obstruct what that person finds important.</p>
<p>Navigating the pushes and pulls of these dynamics is among the most significant features of contemporary career management. &nbsp;Knowing when to hold-on and when to let-go enables people for ready-for-anything flexibility. &nbsp;Was there ever a time when that was more needed?</p>
<p>Much of the evidence and analysis here is heavy-duty - with occasional tongues-in-cheek. &nbsp;It will stand some back-and-forth revisiting. &nbsp;The analysis is illustrated with examples of useful encounters, materials and practice. &nbsp;The evidence uncovers five dimensions...</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1: &nbsp;<strong>connection</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; finding links to what's happening and with whom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->reach</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;developing ready-for-anything flexibility<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->buoyancy</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; making good use of bad news<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->grasp</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;establishing learning for life-long living<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->direction</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; realising independent critical-thinking and creativity</p>

<p align="center"><em>careers work needs your say on this&nbsp;</em><br /><em>sign up on the right and blog below</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>a shorter but fully referenced version of this appears&nbsp;</em><br /><em>in the&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.nicec.org/html/journal.html">The NICEC Journal</a> for Autumn 2015</em></p>

<p><strong>1: &nbsp;CONNECTIONS</strong></p>
<p>There are causes-and-effects, there are meanings a person attributes to those events, and there are purposes set in motion by those atrributions. &nbsp;Defnding convention or pursuing reform, careers work needs to <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">track those links</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The possibilities are varied, dynamic and expanding.&nbsp; In one way or another people are connected to family, friends and school-or-college contacts.&nbsp; There are neighbourhoods, where communities can link to locally-based agencies. &nbsp;Links to shops, bars, advertisers, stylists and media are constantly appearing - both off-line and on.&nbsp; Connections to politics, campaigns and demonstrations are being forged and broken as you read this. &nbsp;All raise question about what's worth holding-onto and what can be waved goodbye.&nbsp; People&nbsp;act on and&nbsp;live by their answers - they move and shake.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>move or shake</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf"><strong>professional thinking</strong></a> has a spectrum of links that clients and students deal with. How much of it can you and your colleagues recognise as significant in their lives?...</p>
<p><strong>there's what everybody seems to know...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>people act on <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->instinct</strong>&nbsp;- impulsively looking for immediate pay-offs</li>
<li>they are most aware of their <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->individuality</strong>&nbsp;- at the extreme as though in a social vacuum</li>
<li>but lives are also&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->situated</strong>&nbsp;- what people do reflects where they live</li>
<li>and there is&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->background</strong>&nbsp;- where people learn how people-like-us manage all this&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;no big surprises so far, but more to say about social settings</strong>...</p>
<ul>
<li>individuals are located as a members of a <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->community</strong>&nbsp;- with its agreed way of doing things</li>
<li>it is also where <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->attachments</strong>&nbsp;are forged - shaping give-and-take relationships,&nbsp;loyalties and aspirations</li>
<li>and each locality nurtures a <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->culture</strong>&nbsp;- with its shared beliefs, values and expectations</li>
<li>social <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->enclaves</strong>&nbsp;are formed - each with its own set of&nbsp;sympathies, tolerances and hostilities</li>
<li>the dynamic of such social life is <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->habitus</strong>&nbsp;- where the inhabited culture shapes habits-of-mind</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;political influences rate more attention...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>social <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->polarisation&nbsp;</strong>builds over time - separating into 'like or not like us', valued or disdained, becoming strangers to each other</li>
<li>by contrast a <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->nudge</strong>&nbsp;is immediate - reinforcing behaviour which serves such interests as market, profession and business</li>
<li>while <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholding</strong> is deeper - more than shareholding, it represents the interests of customer, citizen and worker</li>
<li>among those&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->interests</strong>&nbsp;- are some people's beliefs in the certain deserving of one's own success, and the probable deserving of other people's failure</li>
<li>more inclusive interests voice <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->identity politics</strong>&nbsp;- opposing discrimination on&nbsp;gender, race and sexuality although, though less on class &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;change provokes fast-developing accounts of career influences.</strong>..</p>
<ul>
<li>influences are defended in <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->political theory</strong>&nbsp;- voicing beliefs, interests and evidence ranging from economic necessity to planetary survival</li>
<li>people are increasingly asked to show <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->resilience</strong>&nbsp;- seen as a 'good' upbringing for building character</li>
<li>and <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->intuitions </strong>are not lightly to be dismissed - our brains know more than we know they know and that insight can be worth heeding</li>
<li>but ideas of <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->enlightenment</strong>&nbsp;oppose entrenched interests - urging independence-of-mind, and expecting to be taken seriously in education</li>
<li>enlightenment also signposts <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->critical thinking</strong>&nbsp;- which undermines arbitrary controls by developing reliably-informed progression</li>
<li>and <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->creativity</strong>&nbsp;takes a similar stance - refusing to settle for how things are with an&nbsp;inventiveness which reconnects how &nbsp;life is experienced</li>
</ul>
<p>Reality&nbsp;is muddier than analysis. &nbsp;Instinct and intuition are not easy to tell appart. &nbsp;Impulse can both trap and liberate. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/review-how-good-we-can-be-by-will-hutton">claims of stakeholders</a>&nbsp;are contested. &nbsp;But what are their drivers? - different <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5322">interests</a> (pragmatically served) or different <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/enlightened_citizens_vs._moral_sheep/">philosophies</a> (epistemologically&nbsp;scrutinised)? &nbsp;Some interests are rooted in the memories of a <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/opinion/can-higher-educations-golden-age-of-plenty-continue">privileged</a> and&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/review-baby-boomers-and-generational-conflict-jennie-bristow">ageing generation</a>.&nbsp; And the&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/journals/rsa-journal-issue-4-2014/">polarisation</a>&nbsp;of interests&nbsp;can thwart reforming zeal in all but the bravest (pp.20ff). &nbsp;So independence-of-mind calls on <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/CCREAD/etscc/kant.html">courage</a>.&nbsp; And, full circle, some of the <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=7Ze0ohBVFY0C&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=samual+oliner+pearl+oliner+altruistic+personality&ots=wo1b6PwfL2&sig=6ZyWjC2DJtr4ZMD65_zGQDp9nLY#v=onepage&q=samual oliner pearl oliner altruistic personality&f=false">bravest political action</a> is rooted in upbringing.</p>
<p>Links in all directions - and few certainties. &nbsp;There's no straightforward conversation to be had about holding-on-and-letting-go. &nbsp;But how refreshing to find <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2015/02/17/martin-sheen-tells-pupils-to-walk-with-him-to-social-activism.aspx">a celebrity</a>&nbsp;recognising students changing the world. &nbsp;And what more-important education agenda could there be?</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>who shaking what</strong></p>
<p>It's an education agenda, but it's also political - about who who gets to do what in society. &nbsp;Politics is <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094">getting clever</a>&nbsp;about this - enough to lead and mislead. &nbsp;A&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n20/owen-hatherley/who-will-stop-them">framework for action</a> is based on three elements. &nbsp;Firstly, any dominant group is an 'establishment'.&nbsp; It is supported, secondly, by 'outriders' - research-and-development outfits capturing connections for the establishment. &nbsp;Some of these are&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8875">careers outfits</a>. &nbsp;Thirdly, all politicking needs to persuade people about 'what everybody knows', and that frames an 'overton window'.&nbsp; Named for its inventor, it contains what people can be persuaded to believe - and that need not be truthful. &nbsp;The products appear daily in the media. &nbsp;And students who know how politics works can outflank it.&nbsp; There is such&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/04/russell-brand-changes-mind-about-voting-and-urges-support-for-labour">student politics</a>. &nbsp;Does it count as education for citizenship?</p>
<p>Students and their helpers never more needed to engage politics.&nbsp; There's no shortage of&nbsp;<a href="http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/">myths and findings</a>&nbsp;to probe. &nbsp;The evidence is that however much <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview">a politico thinks he knows</a> he&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/31/finnish-teachers-special-train-teach">probably doesn't</a>.&nbsp; So there is a <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1014635203149#page-1">world-wide search</a>&nbsp;for people ready to deal with politics in their own terms.&nbsp; But how many regimes can you list where the population is schooled in superstition, myth and compliance, rather than educated for independent and critical creativity? &nbsp;I can't help wondering whether you listed any part of the UK.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p><strong>2: &nbsp;REACH</strong></p>
<p>People are developing their own ways of dealing with work-life. &nbsp;They reach beyond career development and its&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.teachingtimes.com/articles/iag-strategy-question-answer.htm">information, advice and guidance</a>&nbsp;(IAG). &nbsp;They reach towards career management - which is&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUW8V7Jupns&feature=youtu.be">not the same thing</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time political interests are becoming more of a problem. &nbsp;They talk of individuals making economic decisions based on <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8509">impartial information</a>. &nbsp;It's narrow thinking, fitting into an overton window framing business interests, political time-lines and habits-of-mind.</p>
<p>Time is up on both IAG and impartiality.&nbsp; Neither deal with the accelerating&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">change and complexity</a>&nbsp;of contemporary lives. &nbsp;Research into <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf">work-life experience</a> speaks of a search for work-life balance and a rejection of arbitrary demands. &nbsp;It intensifies pressure on education, looking beyond self-advancement and towards <a href="http://eax.sagepub.com/content/2/1/63.full">finding meaning</a> in their lives. &nbsp;It calls for a hold-on-let-go career conversation - and bigger windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>career conversations</strong></p>
<p>Talk of IAG&nbsp;conjures&nbsp;two favourite words: 'choice' and 'decision'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Choice speaks of acting on 'this-or-that?', decision on now-or-when?'.&nbsp; Both lurk in this conversation between questions and answers...<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">'does it have to be sciences or arts?'<br /><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'no, you can get a better deal from the college'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">'suppose I just can't face any more exams'<br /><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'there are jobs where your personality will take you a long way'</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">'if I don't grab it now do I lose the chance?'<br /><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not necessarily, the firm might respect you asking for time to think'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">'I thought you were supposed to tell me what to do'<br /><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'I can't do that, but your test and inventory scores are very promising'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">_______________________________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>this and similar inserts are illustrative</em><br /><em>of possible conversations<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->based on what I remember and can imagine<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->you have more recent memory and imagining</em></p>
<p align="center">_______________________________________________</p>
<p>Such conversations go down well with some interests. &nbsp;They attend to what evaluators need. &nbsp;They get frequent airings in the literature. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/moving on/cafcurriculum.pdf">influential approve</a> - including politicians, employers and conventional leaders. &nbsp;But something gets lost in the applause...&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>'you can get a better deal from the college'<br /></em>'so what makes it better?'<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'there are jobs where your personality will take you a long way'<br /></em>'but all my mates are leaving now'<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'a firm like that might respect you asking for time to think'<br /></em>'will the firm want to listen to me talking about my baby?'</p>
<p align="center"><em>'your test and inventory scores are very promising'<br /></em>'they'd feel more like the real me if they contradicted each other'<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>There's surprise, puzzlement and <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20159814?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">ambivalence</a>&nbsp;here. &nbsp;Research suggests it's what drives creative change. &nbsp;But convention has little to say about change-of-mind. &nbsp;So reform needs a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">counter-narrative</a> featuring departures, turning-points and new-horizons. &nbsp;Reform calls for an expanding dynamic of change rather than a narrowing settlement of choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wide-ranging talk like this can shake confidence - conventionally upheld as a condition for success.&nbsp; It's true that positive&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview">talk of confidence</a>&nbsp;comes across well. &nbsp;But <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.tesdigital.com/magazine">evidence suggests</a> that the habitual use of rewarding talk can hold back learning (17/07/2015 pp.12-13).&nbsp; And there are&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/people-are-overly-optimistic-about.html?m=1">well-documented</a> accounts of over-confidence, misleading confidence and deluded confidence. &nbsp;They identify&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/NICECSbEnlarge.pdf">self-contradicting</a> and <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf">self-serving</a> beliefs.</p>
<p>These exchanges feature conflicting interests. &nbsp;Some attempt to&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">capture education</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Stakeholders&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/30/ofsted-learn-instead-alternative-inspections-headteachers-schools-naht">reach for release</a>. &nbsp;Either way, they raise hold-and-let issues - with degrees of not necessarily helpful confidence. &nbsp;Somebody once mentioned how a <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.tes.co.uk/teaching-resource/the-beatitudes-cartoon-6070434">reach for the meek</a> will get things right.&nbsp; The evidence on confidence suggests that he had a point - or she.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>affect and effect</strong></p>
<p>A long-standing account of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf">learning from experience</a>&nbsp;illustrates the affective dynamics of conflicting interests. &nbsp;And, on top of everything, career management is a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">response to change</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;charged with affect. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcegs.pdf">Clinical evidence</a> sets out a spectrum of affect.&nbsp; It starts from fight-or-flight instinct.&nbsp; It moves into an account of approach-or-avoid emotion.&nbsp; It settles on a sustained feeling about how things are. &nbsp;But it has all has been lumped togather as 'emotional intelligence' - said to be good for personal development. &nbsp;And, while that supplies a conventional account of what works well or needs help, reform needs an account of what transforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf">professional thinking</a>&nbsp;</strong>sets out a three-fold spectrum of career-management affect. &nbsp;What sense do your students make of it?&nbsp; And recognise in their experience?...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;thinking on feeling-good in upbeat experience...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->self-esteem</strong> - widely thought to be necessary to achievement</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->confidence</strong> - said to be needed for risk-taking</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->ambition</strong> - held to be made possible by both</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;thinking on demanding attention is less upbeat than astringent...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->self-regulation</strong> - appeals for a disciplined state-of-mind</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->character</strong> - deals with difficulties and obstacles</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->resilience</strong> - is a bouncing-back response to loss or failure</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->mindfulness</strong> - a special focus on here-and-now reality</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;thinking on transformation engages the excitement of change...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->independence of mind - i</strong>nterrogating and confronting arbitrary influences</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->critical-thinking -</strong> an unwillingness to settle for the way things are</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->creativity&nbsp;</strong>- transforming how people see reality and how they will now live in it</li>
</ul>
<p>There's <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497">no consensus</a> here. &nbsp;There are view-points reflecting mixed feelings, different interests, and conflicting priorities.&nbsp; It is a narrative. &nbsp;And in a narrative nothing need be unchallenged, or under control, or believed without doubt. &nbsp;The thinking speaks of a <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/sbjournalarticle.pdf">rounded story</a>&nbsp;which has&nbsp;muddles to unpick, bad news to confront and minds to change. &nbsp;Nothing is taken for granted.</p>
<p>Careers work has plenty to consider - ranging from <a href="http://www.hse.ru/data/2013/01/28/1304836059/Standing. The_Precariat__The_New_Dangerous_Class__-Bloomsbury_USA(2011).pdf">precarious employment</a>, through&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21648627-controversial-new-book-says-islam-must-change-five-important-areas-thoughts-its">arbitrary religious demands</a>,&nbsp;to <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/12/sure-start-childrens-centres-face-worst-year-of-budget-cuts">neglected child care</a>.&nbsp; It brings&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.localschoolsnetwork.org.uk/2015/04/time-to-put-an-end-to-excessive-testing-of-our-children/">stress-related anxiety</a>&nbsp;where bad feelings can bury everything.&nbsp; It's hard to know where 'passion' belongs on this spectrum. &nbsp;But suppose it were a willingness to risk, endure, and suffer for something <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.allaboutjesuschrist.org/the-passion-of-jesus-faq.htm">bigger than self</a>? &nbsp;Wouldn't that change some minds? &nbsp;</p>
<p>And there's no ready-made script here.&nbsp; It's a hold-and-let-go process reaching beyond feel-good, and beyond demanding-attention, and leading to start-again transformation. &nbsp;Ready-for-anything flexibility is attainable when nothing is thought inevitable.</p>

<p><strong>3: &nbsp;BUOYANCY</strong></p>
<p>The idea of self-regulating character has a tough 'get-over-it' tone.&nbsp; As a teacher and lecturer I never found such 'pull-yourself-together' talk doing much to help angry or panicky students.&nbsp; And, these days, there's plenty to be angry and panicky&nbsp;about. &nbsp;There are also ways of making&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">good use of bad news</a>, and that's part of what I'm calling&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">buoyancy</a> - staying afloat in turbulent conditions. &nbsp;It's learned in day-by-day encounters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf"><strong>professional thinking</strong></a>&nbsp;takes account of such encounters. &nbsp;Your colleagues will recognise them. &nbsp;But which do they think it worth strenthening as links?...</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;the most basic learning encounters are inter-personal...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->families facing tough times</strong> - for whom coping is a priority and who may prioritise a shared sense of what's right-and-proper</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->privileged families</strong> - whose wealth and contacts mean that they can expect success, protect these advantages and share them with chosen beneficiaries</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->neighbourhoods</strong> - where shared&nbsp;experience unites people, but when little is shared people become strangers to each other</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;locally-learned like-mindedness forms groups...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->gangs</strong> - where insiders display loyalty and allegiance, and outsiders are treated with hostility</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->devout</strong> - valuing what is thought of as spiritual and sometimes looking for religious obedience</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->associations</strong> - loosely organised clubs, societies and websites where people follow shared interests</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;institutions shape and frame resources for learning...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->organisations</strong> - with rules and roles like those of sport, clubs, cadets, leisure centres and scouts</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->schools and colleges</strong> - valued for what is examinable, but also for meeting your mates</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->businesses</strong> - where learning needs to be about customers, effort, costs and supply-and-demand</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->services&nbsp;</strong>- such, as careers and youth work, where people learn to deal with what's going on in neighbourhood and officialdom</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->officialdom</strong> - both nationally and locally shaping who gets access to what learning services and opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>Conventional thinking has developed&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hecsu.ac.uk/current_projects_graduate_market_trends.htm">a lot to say</a>&nbsp;iabout 'me-and-my-plan'. &nbsp;But wondering about which these locations are serving whose interests is a reforming conversation. &nbsp;Different locations, differently understood, make different sense of that.&nbsp; And&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf">community-interactive</a> talk signposts its possible breadth.&nbsp; While other evidence speaks of students&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30210514?SThisFB">learning from each other</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And so reform talk is shared, exploratory and releasing. &nbsp;It includes explaining to herself how she manages her life, or why his children are so precious, or how they feel about the invasion of change.&nbsp; And an employer at the civilised end of the commercial spectrum can recognise the value of that learning. &nbsp;So there can be plenty of hold-and-let&nbsp;reform talk. &nbsp;Conversation is buoyant when it lifts people, to where they can see how things are, and what needs changing, and where to make a start.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>education for a change</strong></p>
<p>Dealing with change can be thought to depend on character.&nbsp; Causes and effects then tidily fall into place: character comes from 'good' upbringing, and 'bad' upbringing causes failure. &nbsp;Research&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/psychological-perspectives-poverty">probes the thinking</a>,&nbsp;exposing it's self-serving unfairness. &nbsp;The poor are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/rethinking-unemployment-and-the-work-ethic-beyond-the-quasi-titmuss-paradigm-by-andrew-dunn/2017770.article">deprived</a>&nbsp;by an officialdom which chooses to see them as authors of their plight. &nbsp;While educators are vulnerable to attempted capture as <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=2017752">agents of control</a>. &nbsp;Snobbery is a prototype of such discrimination, laying blame where no blame belongs. &nbsp;The damage is at its greatest when provoking anger about who is worth holding onto and who can go and fuck themselves. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever those feelings are, that is an educator's starting point - the opening of a conversation.&nbsp; Educators need to hear talk of 'where we live', 'what it's like' and 'how we feel about it'. &nbsp;They also need to hear about 'who we know', 'how they are respected', and 'why they can be trusted'. &nbsp;So how do educators rate in this exchange? &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's worth asking what teacher-talk gets as much as a nod...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'learning gets you ready to claim your place in society'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'that means your work-life and citizenship'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'there's no hope in giving up on either'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not for you and not for anybody you care about'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'a free society means people have the right to live by their beliefs'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;'but nobody has a right to impose their beliefs on you'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not the people who treat you badly'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not the people who are close to you'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>'we all need each other's help in finding how things can be better'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not forgetting the past but not living in obedience to it'&nbsp;<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'you and your people can be bigger than that'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'learning how big you can be is what education is for'</em></p>
<p>Would they know what this teacher is talking about? &nbsp;Anything to say to each other? &nbsp;Worth setting down? &nbsp;Suppose they come up with another version - by making a movie, showing others and hatching a plan? &nbsp;So they are revisiting remembered experience, but attributing new meaning, and finding reformed purpose. &nbsp;That can become self-propelled hold-and-let. &nbsp;Then it's buoyancy.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>what's left of rights</strong></p>
<p>Not everybody sees education that way; and it really is vulnerable to <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">capture</a> by dominant interests.&nbsp; A much-canvassed interest in education is for employability. &nbsp;But employability is a moving target - not a cause of anything, but a wavering effect of recruitment rates. &nbsp;Nonetheless it's pushed by commerce, majorities and convention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's put to a test by the idea of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/RARDM2ETwdWn9euNSmdV/full#.VNC8R0Ik-JU">career image</a>&nbsp;- looking good to recruiters in...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'appearance' --- 'attractiveness' --- 'self-presentation'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call it the cosmetic curriculum. &nbsp;And the best career work in the world can't jig it to create jobs or improve conditions. &nbsp;What it can do is change the pecking order for available work.&nbsp; But that doesn't favour ability, it favours people&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/128348-sincerity---if-you-can-fake-that-you-ve-got-it">who can fake</a> it, because recruiters are <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jasp.12157/abstract">not hard to deceive</a>. &nbsp;Is this what convention means by employability: business assigning success to image? faces-that-don't-fit discarded? myth excluding reality?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are faces-that-don't-fit all over:&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/02/many-pupils-are-expelled-illegally-and-not-as-a-last-resort-charity-alleges">students who kick over tracers</a>, <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/comment/opinion/the-big-grants-the-big-papers-are-we-missing-something/2017894.article">independent researchers held back</a>,&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.socialsciencespace.com/2014/12/ref-an-idea-whose-time-never-came/">dissenting educators supressed</a>, <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/10/what-would-you-pay-to-be-happy">compliance commodified</a>,&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=11006155">the erosion of student rights</a>. &nbsp;At the same time the idea of <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/mkngtwork/cafimages.pdf">competitive employability</a>&nbsp;fails to understand work-life motivation.&nbsp; Workers in demanding jobs find <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0511.pdf">monetary rewards a disincentive</a>.&nbsp; They look for <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://deliveringhappiness.com/the-motivation-trifecta-autonomy-mastery-and-purpose">meaningful work satisfactions</a>,&nbsp;which - as it turns out - prove impossible to fake.</p>
<p>The cosmetic curriculum will collapse - it loses its edge when everybody learns to do it. &nbsp;It's a product of playground economics and will be displaced by a&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.neweconomics.org/blog/entry/labours-living-standards-index-does-it-go-far-enough?&utm_medium=email&utm_source=nefoundation&utm_content=3+-+Labours+living+standards+index++and+our+&utm_campaign=Feb-eletter-2015&source=Feb-eletter-2015">reliable account</a>&nbsp;of how things are. &nbsp;It has nothing to say about issues ranging from work-place well-being to planetary survival. &nbsp;&nbsp;But suppose it survives? &nbsp;You'll notice compliant workers, uniform in 'appearance, attractiveness and self-presentation'. &nbsp;While reforming independence-of-mind, creativity and critical thinking will have their unfit faces excluded. &nbsp;Try to imagine that.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p><strong>4: &nbsp;GRASP</strong></p>
<p>Dealing with the realities of career management calls for what I'm calling reach and grasp. &nbsp;I mentioned reach earlier - learning that helps here-and-now action. &nbsp;But reach needs grasp - carrying learning to some there-and-then action. &nbsp;Any hold-and-let process needs breadth in reach and strength in grasp. &nbsp;And in any collection of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30210514?SThisFB">education aims</a>&nbsp;that grasp is part of meta-learning - learning to learn. &nbsp;It is knowing what to do in who-knows-what futures. &nbsp;It is not learn-and-score now, it's learn-as-needed later. &nbsp;The more unexpected the later the greater the need for grasp. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's no quick-fix. &nbsp;Meta-learning's grasp is engaged stage-by-stage: from getting a sense of what's going on, through sifting that into useful order, onto focusing what matters, to getting an understanding of the causes-and-effects to be managed. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">career learning</a>&nbsp;research sets out how to practice the process so that it becomes second nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But most learning is forgotten - because it's disposable, out-of-date, not used or inconvenient. &nbsp;Meta-learning thrives when it reminds students of their lives so that their lives remind them of their learning. &nbsp;This learning is then transferred from where it's gained to where it's used. &nbsp;It's&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">learning for living</a>, it's&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf">infinitely reusable</a>, and it's ready for anything.</p>
<p>Enabling grasp is no pushover.&nbsp; Few are in a better position than <a href="https://www.tesdigital.com/magazine">educators to do it</a> (23/01/2015 pp. 26-29).&nbsp; But convention pushes them for prescribed performance, and meta-learning doesn't lead to ready-made prescriptions. &nbsp;Indeed, students - having learned hold-and-let processes - might let convention go.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>meta conversation</strong></p>
<p>So - with no ready-made answers, to unforeseen futures, in ready-for-anything flexibility -&nbsp;how can the conversation go? &nbsp;A conversationally-worded version of <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">career-learning</a> opens up some wondering...</p>
<p>in <strong>finding out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what's going on?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'am I being pushed?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'held back?'</em></p>
<p>in <strong>sorting out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'why does it matter?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'what can I be sure of?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'who's involved?'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in <strong>checking out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'who and what is important?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'why?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'what can anybody say and do about this?'</em></p>
<p>in <strong>figuring out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what will I say and do about it?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'with who and about what?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'how will that work out?'<br /></em></p>
<p>There's no prescripted endpoint here. &nbsp;But that doesn't exclude evidence of outcomes. &nbsp;A feature of <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8844">creativity</a>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;unwillingness to allow the past to control the future. &nbsp;And some versions of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/01/long-term-thinking-investment-internet-age">resilience</a>&nbsp;thinking show how impatience damages the process. &nbsp;Similar losses are found in work-life where there is&nbsp;<a href="http://asq.sagepub.com/content/60/2/189.full">unresisted control</a>. &nbsp;And creativity is found to depend on the very ambiguity that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20159814?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">impatience represses</a>.&nbsp; In positive terms this means that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-organized-mind-by-daniel-j-levitin-1408137852">new thnking is enjoyable</a>.&nbsp; So, could joyousness be an <a href="http://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/2014/06/24/ctq_faridi_finland.html">outcome of education</a>? &nbsp;The question is worth asking because teachers are reported to find the curriculum '<a href="https://www.tesdigital.com/magazine">staggeringly dull</a>'&nbsp;(17/07/2015 pp. 6-7). &nbsp;I wonder whether Ofsted knows about this. &nbsp;Or whether a conversation about grasping uncertain futures with no prescribed anchorages calls for a greater breadth of mind.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>grouded help</strong></p>
<p>And having no ready-made endpoint does not consign grasp to a social vacuum. &nbsp;Meta-learning works in social settings - agency, church, museum and more. &nbsp;It is a grounded network where people apply grasp to life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf"><strong>professional thinking</strong></a> can here re-examine the help it offers as part of a range. &nbsp;But what most count are students' ideas about who in that range is worth calling on - or not...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;there are formal outfits claiming trained expertise...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->careers services </strong>- often what people first think of, but seriously under-resourced, providing information to identify work-life possibilities</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->careers education </strong>- delivered as 'lessons' in schools and colleges, though variable in materials and in designated staff</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->mainstream education</strong> - where educators get to know students over a prolonged period, including the few who can link learning to experience</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->colleges, apprenticeships and universities</strong> - offering opportunities to compete for improved life chances, and for adventures with new people</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;in some outfits the offer is supplementary to core commitments...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->churches, mosques, synagogues and temples</strong> - based on deeply-held and detailed principles, and sometimes more diffusely spiritual</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->community agencies</strong> - often with links to education and sometimes voluntary, with an understanding of local conditions and experience</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->libraries, museums, galleries and collections</strong> - where visitors gaze at what fascinates, look for more, find surprises and buy reminders</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;some <strong>on-line outfits are&nbsp;</strong>professional, some fun, some irresponsible...&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->career websites</strong> - often careers-education-based and digitising its material, some of it interactively diagnostic</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->dedicated websites </strong>- setting out specific aspects of career experience, usually in narrative form and for interactive use</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->social media</strong> - on-line exchange of impressions and advice, including career concerns, which may be poorly informed</li>
</ul>
<p>Different sources are familiar to different people.&nbsp; But each is <a href="https://berarespectingchildren.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/bera-fair-equal-final.pdf">designed to help</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;formally or informally. &nbsp;Some do more harm than good. &nbsp;Some are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/jul/23/museums-should-charge-entrance-fees">under threat</a>. &nbsp;So students need to be savvy in their use.</p>
<p>This is not comfort-zone stuff. &nbsp;Nothing moves until students find help worth holding onto or contacts needing to be let go. &nbsp;And that's&nbsp;troublesome, because it turns things on their head - whatever information, advice and guidance there may be is conceived by students and offered to helpers.&nbsp; This is not convention: meta-learning enables students in a life-long grasp of agency - and that agency can be for reform. &nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p><strong>5: &nbsp;DIRECTION</strong></p>
<p>Change is not what it used to be. &nbsp;Once upon a time humanity learned to live with change brought about by such innovations as migration,&nbsp;cities, telescopes, print and industry. &nbsp;Each brings crisis, and we deal with it by seeing things differently - and doing accordingly. &nbsp;But that <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->was</em> change-after-change, this <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->is</em> change-upon-change. &nbsp;Today's crises simultaneously ride on massive increases in commercial leverage, dizzying technological advance, and constantly repositioning cultures. &nbsp;It's been called a '<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/03/britain-economic-crisis-public">crisis like no other</a>'. &nbsp;Sociology characterises it as <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/cafculture.pdf">liquid modernity</a>&nbsp;- the imagery is of evidence drowned by celebrity, reflection sinking in impatience, and producing a pathetic splash compared with consuming. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The imagery of clinging on was never more apposite. &nbsp;It's true that we&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094">mostly learn from failure</a>, and that now means learning to stay afloat in the backwash of change. &nbsp;Careers work cannot, so to speak, duck this. &nbsp;And in the resulting conversation convention will find few twentieth-century answers to twenty-first-century questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>finding chaos</strong></p>
<p>There's no shortage of career conversations - lots of talk. &nbsp;Conventional wisdom positions walking-the-walk ahead of talking-the-talk. &nbsp;It's wrong - we need the talk to signpost the walk. &nbsp;So what might students find worth talking about? &nbsp;Careers work has a good lead on this; looking for student's signposts by inviting them to talk about...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'...songs, movies and stories - I'll never forget'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...memories - that bother me'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...dreams - that keep coming back'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'...experiences - that surprise and excite me'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...what somebody said - that makes me think again'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...surprises - I find hard to forget'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'...people I've met - like I've never met before'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...new possibilities - that have just come into view'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...pressures - that are hard to resist'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'...people - that I could never let down'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...relationships - that I'm beginning to question'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...promises - that I won't break'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until such talk been heeded the conversation has no starting point.&nbsp; Listening to <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/JVB Feb 11 YJVBE2475.pdf">what is going on in a life</a> belongs to thoughtful careers work.&nbsp; But not to all of it - and there is some jostling for position. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/07/eyond-mindfulness-horse-riding-eating-greens-walk-depression-anxiety-cbt">Cognitive behaviour therapy</a> and its variations pursue one-off mind control rather than enduring understanding. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/NICECCoach.pdf">Career coaching</a>&nbsp;speaks only of individuals and winning.&nbsp; <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000187910900058X">Psychological constructs</a>&nbsp;use expert insights to shape individual memories. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://careersintheory.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/applied-chaos/">Chaos theory</a>&nbsp;is a newcomer, boldly taking on change, but bolstering practice in an alliance with psychological constructivism. &nbsp;The publication of that chaos-alliance has been welcomed as&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H6NP9v6KNVIC&pg=PR2&lpg=PR2&dq=savikas+chaos+the+theory+we've+been+waiting+for&source=bl&ots=_CXIerGtix&sig=YSo7qFAnL9hFqqXs7zVHMT2MWyk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GzsRVfzqJ5OP7AbohoCYCA&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=savikas chaos the theory we've been waiting for&f=false">'the book we've all been waiting for'</a>. &nbsp;Not by me.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>managing chaos</strong></p>
<p>When psychologists run out of things to say about career they'd do better turning to sociology than to chaos theory.&nbsp; Physics increasingly sees <a href="http://gu.com/p/49mht">chaos theory as a fad</a>. &nbsp;And, anyway, the unpredictable is not necessarily chaotic and feeling chaotic is not the same as being chaotic. &nbsp;But the chaos-alliance plot-line wins converts - chaos feels like hell and psychological constructs look like salvation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But it ain't necessarily so. &nbsp;There's no case for upgrading chaotic feelings to chaos theory. &nbsp;The alliance is right to acknowledge chaotic feelings.&nbsp; But the narrative needs more than psychological constructs offer.&nbsp; A <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">convincing narrative</a> speaks of both individual and shared experience. &nbsp;Chaotic feelings stem from a spectrum of the who-what-how-when-and-why of what's going on. &nbsp;And there are people in there, doing their thing. &nbsp;So both psychological and social constructs must feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But social constructs can't count on a good press - identity politics don't like them.&nbsp; Anyone defending the rights of gender, race and sexuality see social influences as <a href="http://oakes.ucsc.edu/academics/Core Course/oakes-core-awards-2012/laura-flores.html">entrapment</a>. &nbsp;Actually the evidence is better balanced -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf">socially acquired beliefs</a> are not bound to mislead, and <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/careerlearning.html">individually held beliefs</a> are not bound to be reliable. &nbsp;Emerging&nbsp;evidence shows how we need to be clearer about race and <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1111/hequ.12074?r3_referer=wol&tracking_action=preview_click&show_checkout=1&purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED">class interaction</a>. &nbsp;Some&nbsp;dangerously&nbsp;dare to confront the confusion of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://vimeo.com/79811169">race and class</a>. &nbsp;Too dangerously? &nbsp;Worth talking about? &nbsp;Because any conversation coming out of this spectrum must face the pushes and pulls of all its dynamics. &nbsp;</p>
<p>None of this can bring a halt to change-upon-change or dissolve chaotic feelings. &nbsp;But it can release the depth and breadth of an independently-minded, critically-thinking and creatively-engaged humanity. &nbsp;And that will call on both psychological and <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://thegreatrefusal.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/bourdieu-deviance-from-constructionism/">social constructs</a>. &nbsp;The conversation then becomes less about experts developing career, and more about&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUW8V7Jupns&feature=youtu.be">students managing career</a>.&nbsp; The insights that count speak of the feelings they start from, the hope they look for, and the purposes they find.&nbsp; Their management of these let-go-hold-on processes transforms entrapment into release. &nbsp;Students become their own life-enhancing&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www2.mmu.ac.uk/mcys/">researchers</a>&nbsp;- as well as&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2015/02/17/martin-sheen-tells-pupils-to-walk-with-him-to-social-activism.aspx">agents of change</a>.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>space and credibility</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is no hit-and-run agenda. &nbsp;It expands the reach and grasp&nbsp;of career learning. &nbsp;It confronts chaotic feelings, bad news and deception. &nbsp;It enables the transforming use of all such confusion. &nbsp;It releases independent, creative and critical thinking into a change-upon-changing world.&nbsp; And it processes a troublesome but necessary hold-and-let process. &nbsp;It overtakes convention and engages reform.</p>
<p>This is learning that can only be acquired <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">stage-by-stage</a>.&nbsp; Students trial methods, gaining a tangible sense for what needs to be done.&nbsp; Real-time practice connects learning to living.&nbsp; Rehearsed tactics gather feedback to sharpen ready-for-anything flexibility. &nbsp;These are heavy-duty demands on educators, who need to be in position to design programmes and make them happen.&nbsp; It means establishing credibility with colleagues and students, and alertness to the significance of students claiming their rights and finding fulfillment.&nbsp; Not every teacher is like that.&nbsp; But this work doesn't need a recruited many, it's looking for a committed few - with their expanding repertoire for action.</p>
<p>This reform is widely applicable. &nbsp;The hold-and-let process may be most engaged by the <a href="http://shop.niace.org.uk">decade-upon-decade experience</a> of older people.&nbsp; And it is particularly applicable to people for whom&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/cafBuonfino.pdf">blame-upon-blame</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2195">squeezed out all ambition</a>. &nbsp;But we must fully round out the range of applications. &nbsp;And that means calling on the future altruism of the self-excluding, whose past engineering has given them&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/31/inheritance-britain-wealthy-study-surnames-social-mobility">minority advantage at majority expense</a>. &nbsp;I think that would count as reform.</p>
<p>This work needs more time and space than convention, from&nbsp;its marginal position, has been able to find. &nbsp;It needs the&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8844">knowledge, commitment and credibility</a> that can only come from mainstream <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/moving on/cafcurriculum.pdf">curriculum</a>.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>sensibility and sense</strong></p>
<p>It's no doddle - this kind of bothersome thinking is best&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">set out as narrative</a>. &nbsp;And educators can find any number of images.&nbsp; The well-written ones intrigue: like the&nbsp;<a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2015/03/cinderella-—-disney’s-newest-“ella”-both-courageous-and-kind">pretty as courageous</a>; the victim who&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392170/">changes everything</a>;&nbsp;bad news as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/24/migrants-leave-home-future-past-borders">loss and gain</a>; entrapment that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.psychotherapy.com.au/fileadmin/site_files/pdfs/TheDoubleBindTheory.pdf">brings release</a>. &nbsp;These are stories that rise above clich&eacute; and engage year-on-year questioning. &nbsp;They belong to a curriculum for reformed careers education. &nbsp;But where in curriculum?&nbsp; Conventional thinking looks for links with science, technology engineering and maths (STEM).&nbsp; But narrative thinking links to&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/cafbiog.pdf">history and literature</a> - history for its cultural perspectives, literature for its personal proximities, both asking...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'...what sense are these people making of their lives?'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...what sense am I making of these people?'</em></p>
<p>Few storytellers better pose such questions than the creator of <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/sense-and-sensibility/">Elinor Dashwood</a>. &nbsp;Her narratives recount cultural and personal sensibilities - telling of a culture that can't let go of gentility, and a gentility that can't take hold of opportunity.&nbsp; For Elinor hope needs unforeseen chance to realise a longed-for-life. &nbsp;The story still works because, in both yesterday's and today's <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">cultural enclaves</a>, there are hold-and-let entanglements. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My early-life theological training drew heavily on history and literature. &nbsp;It persuades me that these two disciplines&nbsp;might be where light is most usefully thrown on what can be learned from religion - and what can't. &nbsp;In all events, history and literature is where curriculum pushes at conventional boundaries, welcomes surprises and risks offence. &nbsp;It's where well-written accounts illuminate experience. &nbsp;And if, for some, it points to STEM then that will be a more reiable signpost - not bowled over by persuasion but realised by discovery.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>which way forward</strong></p>
<p>The chances of <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf">survival</a> rest on two make-or-break questions.&nbsp; From a long-ago savanna to a barely-recognisable high-street people need to know...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what's going on?' ... </em>and&nbsp;<em>... 'what can anybody do about it?'</em></p>
<p>Survival is more likely when causes are identified earlier, so that effects can be based on them later. &nbsp;This is horse-and-cart thinking. - things work out better that way round. &nbsp;But not everybody sees things that way round.&nbsp; People who <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview">think they already know</a> what to do harness their horses to jump the causes and gallop in pursuit of effects. &nbsp;The trouble is that it's the causes that are present realities; the effects are&nbsp;merely future constructs.&nbsp; Any other talk is evasion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And evasion need to be managed - which, the evidence shows, entails <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094">maneuvering</a>.&nbsp; That evidence is of obfuscating facts, capturing support and - if all else fails - telling lies. &nbsp;Part of it recounts devious <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/cafetzioni.docx">economics-politics collusion</a>. &nbsp;Conventional thinking has found <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8875">no way out</a>&nbsp;of the mess. &nbsp;Its allies in commerce and politics trot out answers to questions they've never bothered to ask. &nbsp;This is obstructive and needs to be let go.</p>
<p>Establishments position their influential windows over decades - in the UK the 80's saw a massive and sustained re-alignment of priorities. &nbsp;But there is no correct alignment. &nbsp;The window outlines the sort of society that the politics needs the electorate to favour. &nbsp;This is not rectitude, it's&nbsp;maneuvering.</p>
<p>Reform looks elsewhere - among agencies which are neither politics nor commerce but&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf">civil society</a>. &nbsp;Those interests are best represented by locally-rooted and in-touch <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf">stakeholders</a>. &nbsp;And contemporary stakeholders speak of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/mkngtwork/caffrmwrk.pdf">changing expectations</a>&nbsp;concerning what can and should happen. &nbsp;People are learning to see things differently, triggering new <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf">ways of managing change</a>. &nbsp;And in contemporary change-conditions - needing ready-for-anything flexibility - independence-of mind, critical-thinking and creativity are essential to reform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The argument is an extension of decade-by-decade thought-and-action. &nbsp;A version begins with <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/CPIpdfs/cafcpiz.pdf">matching</a> people to destinations. &nbsp;Its listing of information allows the assignment of an individual to what is judged suitable work.&nbsp; But, early on, thinking acknowledges the dynamics of social groups engaged in <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf">community-interaction</a>.&nbsp; And that calls for an understanding of how social links, set up in families and neighbourhoods, feature in what people do. &nbsp;That thinking then calls for an understanding which can deal with growing complexities, triggering <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnoriginal.pdf">learning theory</a>&nbsp;as a progressive thought-and-feeling process.&nbsp; It enables people for self-propelled career management in finding and negotiating fulfillment in life. &nbsp;But both community interaction and learning theory are most convincingly expressed in <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbnarrative.pdf">narrative</a> terms. &nbsp;People find more sense in recounted stories than in collated lists. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Research-and-development is unstoppable. &nbsp;So we should not be surprised to find a process for interrogated what, in all this, is worth holding onto and what must be let go. &nbsp;Reform is an assembly of thought-and-action in support of ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; And that calls for more than a single test of validity. &nbsp;But, whatever the test, it can only be administered by stakeholders. &nbsp;It's a local call, because the curriculum is community property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thinking poses two supplementary questions concerning community realities and possibilities...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'...what works for how things are?...'<br /></em><em>'...and what does not?'</em></p>
<p>They are hold-on-or-letting-go questions.</p>

<p>What I say here draws on learning from my students.&nbsp; They give us moments we can't forget.&nbsp; I taught sociology in all-through state comprehensives, during the 60's. &nbsp;(I could be Michael Gove's worst nightmare.)&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>There has been lot written about learning Financial Modeling and most of the <strong><a href="http://www.wallstreetmojo.com/free-financial-modeling-training-course/">financial modeling courses </a></strong>are exactly the same. This goes beyond the usual gibberish and explore practical Financial Modeling as used by Investment Bankers and Research Analysts. In this Free Online Financial Modeling Training Course, I will take an example of Colgate Palmolive and will prepare a full integrated financial model from scratch.Financial modeling is the task of building an abstract representation (a model) of a real world financial situation. This is a mathematical model designed to represent (a simplified version of) the performance of a financial asset or portfolio of a business, project, or any other investment. Financial modeling is a general term that means different things to different users; the reference usually relates either to accounting and corporate finance applications, or to quantitative finance applications.In simple terms, financial modeling means forecasting the future of the company or an asset by way of an Excel Model that is easy to understand and perform scenario analysis.</p>]]></description>

<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->questions and answers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The morning after an election defeat provokes what-went-wrong-questions - and the peddling of ready-made answers.&nbsp; But, for me, the key questions are neglected...&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>'why do people elect a regime</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>that shows little interest in their experience,</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>more-or-less disdains their needs</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>and damages their interests?'</em></p>
<p>It's some question - the propensity to <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/whatsthematterwithkansas/thomasfrank">ignore reality and embrace myth</a> is bigger than a UK issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But it's a neglected question.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/09/labours-first-step-to-regaining-power-is-to-recognise-the-mistakes-we-made">post-mortems</a> find their answers in movements to left or right.&nbsp; They wonder if they should&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/g/grouchomar122547.html">adjust ideologies</a>.&nbsp; The need to improve cosmetics gets an occasional mention.&nbsp; More seriously, but less frequently, commentators find reasons for failure in opponent manoeuvring by powerful lobbies, media manipulation and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/08/question-time-ed-miliband-die-cast-tories-trample-labour-economic-record">down-right lying</a>.&nbsp; The electorate deserve to know who to acknowledge for what comes next.&nbsp; But its far from clear whether that 'who?' is a party leader or a press baron.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->windows on righteousness</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The evidence is that political outcomes are decisively determined by what people feel ready to believe.&nbsp; In the hands of politicians it frames what it is advantageous to talk about - it's called the <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n20/owen-hatherley/who-will-stop-them">overton window</a>.&nbsp; And it encloses what people are to acceptably believe - say about the economy, or the poor, or a political party.</p>
<p>It works, but it may not yet have been tested to destruction.&nbsp; There has been a time when it was acceptable to hold blue-collar poverty in contempt.&nbsp; But as poverty invades the suburbs, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/06/alan-berube-moving-poverty-to-suburbs">white-collar poverty</a> might well prove to be less of a pushover.</p>
<p>Yet, after all is said and done, the killer question stands - why deny reality in order to embrace myth?&nbsp; There is an answer, but it's not on any of the what-happened lists.&nbsp; It turns out that some political positions are <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf">easier to defend</a> than others.&nbsp; These are politics which distinctively proclaim the values of...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'authority', 'loyalty' and 'sanctity'</em></p>
<p>Surely these are unassailable values?&nbsp; Maybe, maybe not.&nbsp; Take the don't-rock-the-boat belief in the authority that comes with status.&nbsp; It's enemy is disobedient subversion.&nbsp; Then there's a flag-waving loyalty to team-membership.&nbsp; The enemy of that is treacherous betrayal.&nbsp; And there is the sanctity of untouchable beliefs.&nbsp; Its enemy is impure invasions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a matter of daily observation that a majority of the the press, and some politicos, vigorously assert these 'unassailables'.&nbsp; All are worth talking about as, in one frame or another, because they are the distinctive values of political positions.&nbsp; There are, of course, other values. Two in particular can be set alongside the distinctive three.&nbsp; Number four and five are care for the vulnerable, and fairness for everybody.&nbsp; It is a five-fold political agenda...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'authority' - 'loyalty' - 'sanctity' - 'care' - 'fairness'</em></p>
<p>Who would it not appeal to?&nbsp; Everybody can find something they want to support.&nbsp; They can even think of it as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/the-righteous-mind-by-jonathan-haidt.html?_r=0">righteous</a>. &nbsp;It is the politics of success.&nbsp; But it is formulaic.&nbsp; And it is not the politics of reform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->reform is 'difficult'</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are long-standing arguments about how people are best helped to manage their lives.&nbsp; They point to the importance of confidence and, more recently, to resilience.&nbsp; But asking what is useful in dealing with change-upon-change is finding other answers.&nbsp; The study (shortly to appear on this site) identifies sources of help in developing ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; And the values that emerge are independence or mind, critical thinking and creativity. &nbsp;This is the politics of reform</p>
<p>In order to understand the need for reform we need to face the realities of contemporary causes and effects.&nbsp; For example. some businesses are predatory, they exploit until they're caught, and then they declare themselves everybody's friend. Global commerce has failed to invest in productivity, so that workers don't have the gear for meeting exportable standards, and much of the labour-force is stuck on low-wages, where it's easy to exploit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Small business, providing valued services, are being lost to both local trading and employment, because they can't borrow enough to cope with a late-payment economy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are not taking hold of their citizenship or work life, because there has been massive failure of curriculum, which has been hijacked, using the externalising ploy of off-loading development costs onto education.&nbsp; Education needs time, patience and freedom from ineffective structural change.&nbsp; Stress - in and out of school - is at a high, and care provision at a low.&nbsp; Civil-society is assumed to comprise of volunteers, with or without an appreciation of the cultural, economic or cultural differences in their neighbourhoods, and they are offering a privilege rather than a right. &nbsp;And political moves to strengthen city governments have more to say about powerful mayors and shareholder values than what informed thinking knows about the experience and needs of citizen-stakeholders, who anyway seem disinterested.</p>
<p>Much civil life is presided over by the well-healed, who are influential enough to have their interests defended by government.&nbsp; The country needs, and is rich enough, to pay for care, fairness, health, and education, from tax contributions and in a shared polity.&nbsp; Meanwhile it's assumed that international links are matters entirely for commerce, minimising the need for agreements on international crime, planetary safety, negotiating strength, shared cultures and the absence of war.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some assume that creativity is more a concern for the decorative arts than for economically hard-headedness of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM), so demonstrating how narrow their interests are in anything.&nbsp; If citizens and workers are to have a fair crack of any political whip, the release and constraint of these causes and effects - or some version of them - need probing.&nbsp; And 'independence', 'critical-thinking', and 'creativity' need to feature in that interrogation.</p>
<p>But here's the point: that three-fold agenda is pretty-well the opposite of 'loyalty', 'sanctity' and 'purity'.&nbsp; It rocks-the-boat of beliefs, is disobedient to authority, and in no way is sanctified. &nbsp;This is a differently-distinctive reforming agenda on the causes and effects of contemporary change... &nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>'independence' - 'critical thinking' - 'creativity' - 'care' - 'fairness'</em></p>
<p>But can it be a winner?&nbsp; It won't fit into any overton window.&nbsp; It has no easy-to-defend answers.&nbsp; And it doesn't come across as righteous.&nbsp; It comes across as difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->narrative and rights</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Narrative transpose causes-and-effects into sequences. &nbsp;And in managing their lives people find most <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">sense in narratives</a> - more sense than in questions-and-answers, or arguments, or analyses.&nbsp; Somehow it's easier to make good use of narrated bad news than reported bad news.&nbsp; Televised appeals make the point.&nbsp; So reforming policies need to be able to take what is difficult and transpose it into credible narratives. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I know what I want to see in that...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'you have rights'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'to figure out what to believe <br /> 'and who to trust'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'you can probe the promises'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'question the sources' </em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'understand the investment'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'know who's getting what'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'know what's helping your family</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'and what's harming'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'so you don't need to be told'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'you will sort the confusion'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'and claim your rights'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'we all need you to do that'</em></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's no short cut here.&nbsp; No headline. &nbsp;Needing time. &nbsp;Nowt that can be crammed into an election campaign.&nbsp; More like education than declaration.&nbsp; Particularly in citizenship and work-life - which have <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8875">not looked good</a> in the recent past.&nbsp; And more important than finding leaders, if leaders are to be agents of policy.</p>
<p>It's a narrative, and any decent narrative hands the issues to the audience - 'what do you think?'&nbsp; So...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'which of that complexity do we hold onto?'</em></p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.wallstreetmojo.com/free-financial-modeling-training-course/">Financial modeling</a> is the task of building an abstract representation (a model) of a real world financial situation. This is a mathematical model designed to represent (a simplified version of) the performance of a financial asset or portfolio of a business, project, or any other investment. Financial modeling is a general term that means different things to different users; the reference usually relates either to accounting and corporate finance applications, or to quantitative finance applications.</p>

<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Critical issues are being raised for how people are enabled to manage their careers.&nbsp; Some of the most influential voices speak for the Network for Innovation in Careers Guidance and Counselling in Europe (NICE).&nbsp; How the issues are resolved will affect how your students are placed for claiming their rightful place in their societies. &nbsp;No mainstream educator can afford to ignore this.</p>
<p>These are critical times: global commerce is strengthening; politicians are besieged; neighbours become strangers to each other; growth has reached the limits of planetary safety; work-life is riven by opposing interests. &nbsp;Careers work inhabits a changing world, posing make-or-break issues for both careers work and education.</p>
<p>The issues are set out in a <a href="http://www.nice-network.eu/fileadmin/erasmus/inhalte/dokumente/NICE_Summit_Canterbury/NICE_Summit_Materials_Onlineversion.pdf">NICE Summit</a> held in Canterbury Christchurch University (NICE, 2014). &nbsp;Its forecasts are not downbeat: they list the strength, coverage and international membership of a movement focused on career guidance and counselling.&nbsp; NICE speaks of citizens, educators and employer as its stakeholders.&nbsp; An organisation's stakeholders are people whose lives are affected by what the organisation does.&nbsp; I'm arguing for a strengthening in the stakeholder position of mainstream educators ready to work on career-management thinking with their students, their families and their communities.</p>
<p>Viable partnerships rely on each understanding what the other can do.&nbsp; A couple of the summit's opening keynotes help.&nbsp; The first sets out a well-documented case for breadth of thinking on 'the story behind work'.&nbsp; The second autobiographically recounts events that shape a professional's informed understanding of career. &nbsp;They both call for wider and deeper career-management thinking.</p>
<p>I'm using the terms 'careers-work' and 'career-management'.&nbsp; The terms 'guidance', 'counselling', 'careers education' and 'guidance' may be more familiar.&nbsp; But they are unreliable: they overlap, shift in definition and are overtaken by new terms - such as 'career coaching'.&nbsp; The field needs more reliable, inclusive and flexible terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>careers-work is what professionals and others do to enable students and clients for what they need to do about working-life</li>
<li>career-management is the sense and use that students and clients are able to find in what careers work does</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot assume that what a career manager does will recognisably play out as careers work suggests.&nbsp; Different people facing the same facts attribute to them different meanings.&nbsp; And the argument here is that testable facts can inform, but it's experienced meaning that gives action its dynamic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So what meaning do NICE careers workers bring to NICE facts? &nbsp;A full-sized lecture theatre is filled with people ready with probing questions.&nbsp; This blog takes a close look at the answers.</p>
<p>It poses five questions...</p>
<ol>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->what can guidance claim?<br /><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->what roles does it consider?<br /><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->how does background culture figure?<br /><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->what thinking most influences its action?<br /><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->what future possibilities does any of this open up?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" align="center">_____________________________&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->CLAIMS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>NICE is a network organisation.&nbsp; It argues for Europe-wide competencies for guidance professionals. &nbsp;They are to be measurable, based on academic training, and drawing on inter-disciplinary thinking.&nbsp; That thinking is claimed to be distinct, unique and research-based.&nbsp; All are argued to be requirements for the protection of student well-being.&nbsp; The aim is, then, to link research, theory, practice and policy into a unified foundation for professional effectiveness.</p>
<p>There's room for a deeper and wider conversation - questions for an alert educator to pose...</p>
<ul>
<li>is it possible for careers-work thinking to be absolutely distinct? - Isn't much of it imported from economics, psychology and sociology? - and isn't some of that of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator">doubtful validit</a>y?</li>
<li>isn't it true that <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf">labour-market experience</a> is as much a problem as a solution? - what about the need to examine the markets for the way they damage life chances? - don't students need to be enabled to examine, probe and scrutinise them?</li>
<li>isn't it true that any commercial commitment to growth breeds both <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/03/food-shortages-everyones-responsibility">hope and fear</a>? - don't both need an understanding of its historical backstory? - and doesn't the breadth and depth of hope and fear range from the personal to the planetary?</li>
<li>surely a full account of research, theory, practice and policy needs students engaged in <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">critical questioning</a>? - and isn't creativity also an unwillingness to settle for the way things are? - is commerce open enough to people's unwillingness to settle for the way labour markets are?</li>
<li>don't all stakeholders need to know <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/CPIpdfs/cafcpiz.pdf">whose interests are being served</a>? - does careers work know what alert educators learn from students and their family-and-neighbourhood communities? - and what if the volunteers and activists of civil society also claim a stake?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions depends on understandings rooted in the sciences, the humanities and probabilistic mathematics - which are all part of mainstream curriculum.&nbsp; And they raise issues which students also need to engage.&nbsp; They push aims beyond learning-for-assessment; they reach for learning which is useful in students' lives - learning-for-living. &nbsp;I know of no deeper or wider education.</p>
<p>So, what are the possibilities for a careers-work partnership with mainstream education?&nbsp; I don't think it matters what subjects educators bring to it.&nbsp; Whatever their discipline, nobody does better what a good teacher can do about finding a point for learning. &nbsp;And learning for effective career management moves beyond acquiring facts it reaches for future possibilities.&nbsp; And that means asking probing questions and checking the answers.&nbsp; And it moves on by figuring out what causes in people's lives bring about what effects.&nbsp; What in-touch educator wants no part of that?</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->ROLES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Over the hundred-or-so years of its development careers work has diversified.&nbsp; From time to time attention shifts on what careers workers do - their roles.&nbsp; The vocabulary shifts.&nbsp; Terms like, 'guidance', 'counselling' and 'coaching' are variously associated with the need for 'empathy' 'information' and 'advice'.&nbsp; Roles can be 'non-directive', 'student-centred', 'infused' or 'integrated' and located in an organisation which is 'public service', 'private enterprise' or 'civil society'.&nbsp; The pursuit of any of this may be towards 'employability', 'competitiveness', 'fairness', 'happiness', 'well-being' or 'fulfillment'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These are not lists of what can be clearly defined, they are features in the comings-and-goings of unfolding narratives.&nbsp; The sociology of careers work has imported features of such <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">narrative thinking</a> - the term 'role' is taken by sociology from the theatre. &nbsp;And, in both the theatre and sociology, a role need not be contained by any ready-made script.&nbsp; In sociology role speaks of an actor positioned for taking on a task arising from a relationship - it speaks of 'being here, getting on with this, together'.&nbsp; And, although sometimes scripted, a role can also be questioned. &nbsp;So in careers work we can think of roles as being ready-made and as being newly-made - <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafsor1.pdf">roles as assigned and achieved</a>.&nbsp; A changing world needs such critical creativity.</p>
<p>NICE has variously mapped 'types of career professionals'&nbsp;(NICE, 2014, pp. 19-20 and 27-29). &nbsp;I think this use of 'types' corresponds with what a sociologist calls 'roles'. &nbsp;The simplest analysis finds three broadly-distinguishable positions...&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>...careers advisers have a basic competence - with a 'level-6' grasp of theories and principles</li>
<li>...careers guidance counsellors have 'level-7' competence - able to work with the more complex, uncertain and multifaceted situations</li>
<li>...career experts have level-8 expertise - in addition to guidance and counselling skills this brings scholarship, integrity, autonomy and inventiveness to the work - it is held by service managers, high-order counsellors and researchers capable of grasping the complexity of the whole field</li>
</ol>
<p>NICE is right to point to the limitations of careers advisers. &nbsp;But I doubt that much of that can be attributed to 'level-6' qualifications. &nbsp;My own experience in education tells me that careers advisers, however able and committed, are limited by institutional mismanagement. &nbsp;The ways careers advisers are casually enlisted, marginally positioned and poorly resourced has doubly damaging effects.&nbsp; They limit what the overloaded can do, and they deter other teachers from getting involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three-fold role analysis is challenged from the summit-conference floor. &nbsp;A good many participants see the three positions as ordered hierarchically - and they don't like that. &nbsp;NICE will sort this out. &nbsp;But NICE can't sort out institutional mismanagement. &nbsp;And so it's unlikely that mainstream educators are dreaming of becoming careers advisers. &nbsp;But that does not mean they have nothing to say...</p>
<ul>
<li>educators make week-on-week relationships with students - not just in classrooms but in the yard, during excursions, at sports events - and over several years &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>every school or college has people that students trust - relationships with professionals and community contacts - ready to work with hopes and fears - about school and about life&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>somebody in a school and its network knows about families who get disconnected from education - the institution feels unfamiliar,&nbsp;remote, daunting - they need somebody to reach out</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking account of these roles needs analysis in more than one dimension.&nbsp; There's a lot to know - where are helpers best located? - how can they be usefully supported in getting on with things? - how does anybody know what help different students and which families need? &nbsp;The answers are as likely to come from up-close experience as from ready-made expertise - whether educator's or careers-worker's.&nbsp; And so, although a good many roles are assigned, this kind of work needs role creation - less waiting for an assignment more volunteering for something more. &nbsp;It works where there's open institutional management. &nbsp;And the role-achievement of staff, by both careers workers and educators, contributes to the making of that openness.</p>
<p>There's a lot for both sides to learn about why careers work and mainstream education need each other. &nbsp;Each needs to know what the other can offer.&nbsp; It requires two-way flexibly, because there's no ready-made way of heeding student- and stakeholder-voice.</p>
<p>It's true that lists and definitions have their attractions.&nbsp; They offer what looks like clarity and feels like solidity. &nbsp;But are careers-work roles best understood as features in ready-made structures, or as elements in steerable dynamics?&nbsp; Should a partnership be dropping a heavy anchor or navigating an energising flow?</p>

<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->CULTURE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Talk of what stakeholders need from careers work, and of the roles careers work develops, and of the institutional support those roles get - such talk will, sooner or later, mention culture.&nbsp; It comes up in the first NICE group session I attend. &nbsp;Somebody says that the proposals for reform must not leave out 'the cultural dimension'.&nbsp; She has quite a point: careers work's own thinking understands culturally-rooted <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf">community-interaction</a>&nbsp;to have added a sociological dimension to its psychology-based matching methods.</p>
<p>A culture reflects group assumptions.&nbsp; They convey the way group members tend to agree with each other about the way things are.&nbsp; Its conversations may bring up something about who or what is worth bothering with.&nbsp; And there may be talk of what work prospects there are for people like them.&nbsp; A culture is an assembling of such beliefs, values and expectations.&nbsp; It's rooted in the shared experience, memories and allegiances of the group - and so it is a social phenomenon (Bourdieu, 1991).&nbsp; Whether seen by others as 'posh' or 'common', a culture becomes what the group takes to be 'proper', 'cool', &nbsp;'normal' - or '<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/reallives/cafjoey.html">for the-likes-of-us</a>'.&nbsp; Cultures can inspire, encourage and carry people to doing great things.&nbsp; But, 'posh' or 'common', they can lead bright people into doing something silly, and good people into something bad. &nbsp;The curriculum has examples. &nbsp;So does the daily news. &nbsp;So does the schoolyard.</p>
<p>Cultures are nurtured in both communities and institutions.&nbsp; That summit group-member is right, culture frames and shapes the way organisations and their communities both understand and misunderstand each other. &nbsp;Some social theory rejects the possibility of a shared understanding between the one and the other. &nbsp;But the major premise of reform is that past facts need not predict future possibilities. &nbsp;Partnership work with cultural influences needs shared understandings between helpers in their institutions and stakeholder in their communities. &nbsp;It is not that any reformer can assume first-attempt success - misunderstanding is possible, so is a failure to try to understand, but so is creative persistence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>An analysis of how different nations nurture different cultures is possible. &nbsp;Might it be true that German careers work is more thorough? &nbsp;Brit more direct? &nbsp;American more flexible?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; But the evidence is that there is as much cultural variability within nations as between them. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/nicecspace&place.pdf">differences between cultures are local</a>.&nbsp; In some neighbourhoods a person can notice evidence of different communities while taking a short walk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An authoritative source on school-community cooperation sets out a range of what are cultural assumptions (Munn, 1993).&nbsp; Compiled by educationists, it permits an account of the links between educators and stakeholders - the former in their institutions, the latter in their communities. &nbsp;The study sets out a base-line platform for cooperation, but it also allows for different starting points for action.&nbsp; The base line assumes cultural assonance - it sets out what stakeholders will readily agree.&nbsp; But the study also invites a questioning dissonance - and that allows for reform possibilities that some may not yet have recognised...</p>
<ul>
<li>... there can be agreement about student and family self interests</li>
<li>... but what about interests in the well-being of other people's children?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... there can be agreement about education in familiar settings</li>
<li>... but what about emerging voluntary and community organisations?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... there can be agreement about partnership as a well-established process</li>
<li>... but what about the disturbances by minority points-of-view?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... there can be agreement that 'happiness' is a principal family concern</li>
<li>... but what about the value of competitiveness? or fulfillment? or even resistance?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Munn base-line looks to the future, and is prescient in recognising that institutions may assign to stakeholders roles as 'customers' rather than 'partners'.&nbsp; But stakeholders can resist what institutions assign. &nbsp;It is culture which explains why a programme is welcomed in one community and rejected in another.&nbsp; Institutionalised careers work can usually come up with an account of any programme it propose.&nbsp; And that proposal may well come from what a national government expects.&nbsp; But the evidence (Law, 2013) is that remote expectation is less important than local response.&nbsp; It is more important to appreciate the sense and use that local people are able make of any proposal...<br />if any.</p>
<p>And that needs up-close contact, which is in touch with local stakeholder beliefs, values and expectations.&nbsp; The evidence is sociological; it is that cultures live in 'social enclaves' which are located in neighbourhoods.&nbsp; Different enclaves cultivate different cultures. &nbsp;And the evidence shows that it is <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8787">locally-based networks</a> which are more likely to be understood and acted upon. &nbsp;That evidence is that city-and-regional institutions of work-life and citizenship forge strong links with stakeholders.</p>
<p>Any partnership between careers-work and education rests on two-way trust.&nbsp; Educators can count on careers-workers' understanding of local cultures and their allegiances - in up-close contact careers workers engage with the sense that experience makes of working life. &nbsp;And careers workers can know that educators enable local people to voice that cultural experience and to question it - in stage-by-stage exploration educators enable student recognition of unforeseen possibilities.</p>
<p>Educators are aware that doctrinaire assumptions assign a bad press to cultural studies.&nbsp; I'm not qualified to say much about that.&nbsp; But, until you show me better, I'll stand by this.&nbsp; Students have a right to see beyond their culturally-acquired experiences and memories.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.katsandogz.com/onchildren.html">Upbringing is a beginning not an end</a>.&nbsp; Career management then becomes students settling on what, in upbringing, they will hold onto - but, also, what they will let go.&nbsp; Then they are ready to say how they shape their beliefs, values and expectations.&nbsp; It needs rehearsing with families - both now and one day.&nbsp; Because it is how they, life-long, see how the culture they embrace connects to the institutions they inhabit.&nbsp; And it equips them to act when there is no connection.&nbsp; Cultural studies extend the reach of what we call careers work and citizenship.&nbsp; It opens up the shaping of who gets to do what in society. &nbsp;I can think of no more important task for educators and their partners.</p>

<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->THINKING</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>credibility</strong></p>
<p>An influential voice at the NICE Summit calls on medicine as a professional model for the future of careers work.&nbsp; Can careers work aspire to a status like that of doctors?&nbsp; There are parallels - both deal in consultations, diagnoses and cures.&nbsp; But much is changing, and medicine is developing new and far-reaching repertoires for help.</p>
<p>Part of the trend rests on a well established understanding that prevention is better than cure.&nbsp; And, now, the accessibility of on-line diagnosis is changing the GP conversation.&nbsp; There is also some market manipulation by pharmaceuticals, which can distort doctor-patients relations. &nbsp;But medicine is a resilient profession, and it's finding ways of dealing constructively with change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The trend makes status less of a concern than credibility.&nbsp; And the most adaptive and useful responses to people's needs are not prescriptions but explanations. &nbsp;When compared with treatment, health professionals are recognising the greater usefulness of education.</p>
<p>Why would careers workers imagine that that they are exceptions to such trends?&nbsp; The underlying changes have invaded careers work as much as they have invaded any profession.&nbsp; The trends assemble into an economic, technological and cultural backstory.&nbsp; And that narrative is changing attitudes to all professions - from the media to the clerical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we can't rely on the backstory getting the air-time that it deserves - and the electorate needs.&nbsp; It is curtailed by time-limited broadcasting, flabby news management and camouflaged priorities.&nbsp; There is also a careers-work backstory for NICE to develop.&nbsp; It manifests the background ways in which economics, technology and culture are framing and shaping the possibilities for future careers work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As every historian knows finding and narrating what goes on has never been easy. &nbsp;And the modern apparatus of economics, technology and culture can be used to massage any backstory into a preferred but misleading account. &nbsp;We must hope that neither careers work nor educators are among the culprits.&nbsp; But well-funded and skillfully-managed outfits can re-write, and even eliminate, any backstory that damages their interests. &nbsp;Educators and their students can find examples on a daily basis in news bulletins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of such techniques is unfairly damaging the credibility of public-sector careers workers. &nbsp;Examples appear as unwarranted enthusiasm for private-sector provision and belief in business people as the most effective sources for careers work in schools. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A person might well be able to hunch what interests are most served by such claims. &nbsp;But why should a person have to probe so hard to find and decisively verify the backstory? &nbsp;And, even if a person had the time and made the find, what hope is there in trying to influence hidden interests with&nbsp;rational argument? - the careers-work leadership has tried it to destruction. &nbsp;</p>
<p>None of this argues for backing away. &nbsp;Hiding realities is anti-educational. &nbsp;And is such camouflaged maneuvering&nbsp;impenetrable? &nbsp;We know that independently-minded students learn how to probe distorted backstories. &nbsp;We know that medicos are quick learners. &nbsp;Can we find careers workers and educators who can deal with this? &nbsp;Are they NICE?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->research</strong></p>
<p>The NICE position is that professional credibility comes from a valid research base. &nbsp;At its best research finds what's going on, shows how it gets this way, and identifies what causes bring about what effects.&nbsp; These are the facts belonging to the descriptions, explanations, and anticipations which make effective careers-work possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But research outfits are juggling in an increasingly politicised arena.&nbsp; What politicos seek from research, and the action they take in response, may well demonstrably overlook what is known about how people actually live their lives. &nbsp;I've sat in careers-work research meetings considering invitations to tender for research whose findings are specified in the invitation - 'we want evidence to show that...'.&nbsp; In such a climate winning contracts and reporting results can be opportunistic, or arbitrary or inventive - or all three.&nbsp; That research can obscure more that it illuminates. &nbsp;The obfuscation can be deliberate.</p>
<p>Economics is a noticeable example.&nbsp; It is a core concern of careers work because it researches the labour-market information which underpins careers work.&nbsp; But what if there were evidence of <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/57ba23f8-23a0-11e4-8e29-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3HzpbVdUJ">economists deliberately massaging</a> their findings in order to camouflage the political or commercial interests they see themselves as serving?&nbsp; What would that do to credibility?</p>
<p>So this can't be what NICE is signing up to. &nbsp;Its refusal to do so finds support among professional groups now arguing for <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7540.html">practitioner control of research</a>.&nbsp; They see angling academics as distorting any conversation between policy, profession and research. &nbsp;Careers work and education need research which informs useful action.&nbsp; And that needs researchers who are in ground-level contact with career-management experience, and who are able to formulate proposals that are recognisably practical.&nbsp; Some education professionals are calling for a tightening of the links between research and development. &nbsp;The call speaks of research-and-development in one breath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It needs <a href="http://news.tes.co.uk/b/tes-professional/2014/09/04/take-control-of-your-teaching-by-embracing-research.aspx">research-savvy</a> practitioners.&nbsp; I doubt that careers work needs much of the number-crunching for epidemiological 'big data&rsquo; favoured by politicians.&nbsp; Where causes and effects work out differently in different locations it is ethnographies that promise to be useful.&nbsp; Ethnography is open to all the variability and variation of up-close-and-immediate experience.&nbsp; Educators and careers workers have proven themselves capable of producing such exact accounts.&nbsp; They have a precise kind of validity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But no research has any practical validity until it is tested in use.&nbsp; That test is called 'catalytic validity' (Cohen and others, 2000).&nbsp; It asks whether what the findings anticipate in theory correspond with what happens in reality. &nbsp;Practicality needs that kind of research.&nbsp; It is information which can be grasped, probed and made to work by professionals in conversation with their stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are neglected issues here.&nbsp; They are for how research findings are worded, packaged and made available.&nbsp; Managed well catalytic validity can open up partnerships' r&amp;d conversations. &nbsp;It brings professionals and their stakeholders into shared conversations concerning what's going on, how it gets this way, and what anybody can do about it. &nbsp;It makes research community property.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>qualifications</strong></p>
<p>The NICE conference is part of an on-going on-line <a href="http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/nice/article/view/16726/10556">consultation on competency standards</a> (Katsarov, 2014). &nbsp;Its argument is that careers work needs to provide accounts of qualification so that politicos can understand what policy is being asked to support.&nbsp; The NICE versions of qualifications for careers work list levels of quantifiable competencies. &nbsp;There are other versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A host at the university's welcoming of NICE is the Dean of Education.&nbsp; He remarks that education is more than imparting measureable competencies.&nbsp; He refers to the unquantifiable attitudes which, in any worthwhile learning programme, foster the development of 'creativity' and 'critical thinking'.&nbsp; The two phrases have long-since been linked together as key elements for qualifying as an educator.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/thinking-skills-and-creativity">Anna Craft</a> is the trail blazer (Wegeraf, 2014).</p>
<p>Creativity is more than innovation - 'what's new?' need not be such a big deal.&nbsp; Creativity's bigger deal makes a difference to how things are - a cause with a bigger effect. &nbsp;It has been said &nbsp;(Hyde, 1983) to offer a gift and promise a surprise. &nbsp;And that is a disturbance provoking a special kind of excitement.&nbsp; The effect ranges from remapping the solar system to getting more suck from vacuum cleaners. &nbsp;Both change lives, each in its own way.</p>
<p>And then there is critical thinking, which also makes a difference. &nbsp;But it's more deliberative - a learning process driven by interrogating, probing and scrutinising what's going on.&nbsp; It asks awkward questions. &nbsp;And,&nbsp;when it would be a bad mistake to allow the past to predict the future,&nbsp;that counts for a lot. &nbsp;But it also means that it comes across as disturbing how things are, and that causes discomfort.</p>
<p>Both creativity and critical thinking are an unwillingness to settle for how things are.&nbsp; People may be grateful for the gift, but they won't thank you for being taken out of their comfort zone.&nbsp; And either may be more welcomed by reformers than by the defenders.&nbsp; But, in their different ways, both are necessary responses to change - and when mere innovation won't do.</p>
<p>If he needs it the Dean will find support in the case for <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/partnership-agreements-worthy-pact-or-childrens-charter/2016066.article">authentic learning</a>.&nbsp; This is not compliance with ready-made lists or measurable competencies.&nbsp; Indeed, it sees that as a form of institutional control.&nbsp; Authentic learning lifts candidates above trying to look good enough to comfortably and safely secure an award. &nbsp;Comfort and safety do not work for creativity, they work as marketing ploys.&nbsp; Mere novelty can figure, and that might attract some students and educators.&nbsp; But the movement for authentic learning argues that comfortable and safe breeds dependency, infantilises candidates and undermines any useful understanding of how things are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Significant learning takes risks, it does not play safe; it excites, it does not calm; it works through discomfort, it does not evade.&nbsp; A <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">meta-analysis of career learning</a> tracks what this means for careers work. &nbsp;More recent neurological evidence speaks of how <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pzr00">learning thrives</a> (podcast). &nbsp;The researcher (Karmiloff-Smith, 1992) shows that useful learning needs unfamiliar, surprising and disturbing experiences - so that learners don't switch off, or doze off.&nbsp; And, against the conventional grain, she especially recommends all of this wake-up stuff for watching tv.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;qualifications&nbsp;indicated by such thinking&nbsp;record evidence of ready-for-change independence-of-mind.&nbsp; Playing safe and comfortable would be the most dangerous thing that any learning partnership could do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's true that a person wanting to look good and avoid risk would not immediately be bowled over by what that qualification invites. &nbsp;We are on a journey here, and so an institution's need for reform, fired-up by creativity, informed by critical thinking and leading to authentic learning may not get its first nod before Friday. &nbsp;But the need for all this will become more compelling as change gathers momentum.&nbsp; And it will.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>promotion</strong></p>
<p>Future possibilities for careers work and education must deal with commercial and political interests in careers work. &nbsp;The most influential of them work on a global scale.&nbsp; The backstory is not good news; the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13632434.2013.856294">politicisation of helping agencies</a> has never resulted in reliable support.&nbsp; And, now, careers work is being overtaken by a global <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/how public-sector careers work thrives alongside private-sector career coaching">career-coaching</a> industry, while education is faced by attempts at <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">curriculum capture</a> by commercial interests. &nbsp;The trends put public-sector careers work and education under existential threat.</p>
<p>It's difficult to know how to promote careers work in these conditions. &nbsp;An example not to follow is set out in an <a href="http://adventuresincareerdevelopment.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/was-there-ever-a-golden-age-for-careers-education-and-guidance/">account </a>of careers work's success.&nbsp; It likens being an instrument of government policy as living in a 'golden age'. &nbsp;But that golden memory is not entirely happy.&nbsp; At the time commercial pressure on government is strong; social fragmentation is accelerating; and education is under arbitrary inspectorial attack.&nbsp; And yet the <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf">careers-work response</a> (pp.1-4) shows no interest in mainstream curriculum; has little to say about learning processes; and worries that measures to integrate the excluded will dilute careers-work professionalism. &nbsp;This promotion of a golden age is neither miserably failing&nbsp;nor&nbsp;impressively successful.</p>
<p>Promotion - in advertising, marketing and canvassing - urges success in the past, promise in the present, and trust in the future. &nbsp;There's room for doubt about whether all that jam-tomorrow positivity works. &nbsp;It might impress people who've never had the time, opportunity or inclination to think otherwise. &nbsp;But the evidence is that dedicated positivity&nbsp;ioses opportunities to improve - there is more to gain from diagnosing failure than from promoting success. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be argued that the promotion is for outsiders and the bad news for insiders. &nbsp;But surely we've been talking about bringing outsiders in? &nbsp;And&nbsp;lifting the lid&nbsp;is a lot more interesting than&nbsp;banging the drum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no shortage of evidence on the <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8787">usefulness of bad-news shock</a>. &nbsp;And the reflective wing of the business world has developed various formats for such '<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/12/testing-or-checking/">checking and testing</a>'.&nbsp; It acknowledges the inter-dependence of failure and progress. &nbsp;Critically understanding why the breakdown broke down tells a professional more about how the system and its programmes work; cheering from the rooftops tells the provider nothing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That's for the provider, but self-congratulatory applause holds back user learning by smothering critical voices. &nbsp;Is that what happens in this NICE group session on innovation? &nbsp;A chair-person opens it by listing NICE achievements. &nbsp;But, on closing, the chair's 'summary' pretty-well ignores the group's probing for how to make headway.&nbsp; Instead it repeats the up-beat listing already made. &nbsp;The smothering suffocates when the chair thanks the group for its positive thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education is not exempt.&nbsp; A&nbsp;<em>Times Education Supplement</em>&nbsp;ad (TES, 2014) features two agencies close to government - Pearsons Education publishing and the Confederation of British Industry.&nbsp; In an upbeat opening session business people identify the value of curriculum to commerce.&nbsp; But a downbeat follow-on has many educators countering by pointing to the risks to student well-being.&nbsp; So how is it that the chair feels able to claim inspiration from the resulting consensus?&nbsp; Could it be that promotion needs ready-made applause for ready-made intentions?</p>
<p>From selfies to corporate videos self-promotion is rampant. &nbsp;But the reality is that there is more hope in facing bad news than in faking good. &nbsp;Stepping out of the self-promotional trend may seem like too much of a risk.&nbsp; But <a href="http://www.gertbiesta.com">Gert Biesta</a> (2014) is prominent among the many cited here who show that that facing risk is the immeasurable foundation of all worthwhile learning. &nbsp;Neither careers-work nor education can afford to be distracted by strategies that won't work. &nbsp;And there's little to gain by patting each other on the back.</p>

<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->POSSIBILITIES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Careers work and education share a concern for people's chances in life.&nbsp; The imagery is compelling when it portrays elbowing for an 'inside track' to 'get ahead' by 'overtaking' the 'competition' and being a 'winner'.&nbsp; Such wants are liable to be manipulated by self-serving interests.&nbsp; Students and their educators need to recognise that - whether from politics, commerce, culture, or professions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apparatus of manipulation captures how people think and talk about their concerns.&nbsp; Its imagery erects a boundary around how people see things.&nbsp; A philosophical collation of decades of research into this kind of control has coined the term <a href="http://stephenlaw.blogspot.co.uk">'intellectual black hole'</a> (Law, 2011).&nbsp; At the extreme it sweeps people into wanting what is contrary to their needs. &nbsp;Where 'what I want' is mistaken for 'what I need' then education is failing.</p>
<p>The retort is to demand 'says who!' - who has any right to tell anybody what they need. &nbsp;Getting control means capturing what people sense is worth saying - the language. &nbsp;So should we worry when an interested group pushes terms like 'guidance' and 'career'? &nbsp;We should if it holds back the dynamics of how meanings change as events unfold.&nbsp; And we should worry when the powerful forbid the use of terms like 'guidance' and 'career'. &nbsp;Up-front definitions are at least transparent. &nbsp;But informal reports of elimination are hard to verify - unless you know more than I do.</p>
<p>All such capture pushes unwanted language and probing questions out of reach. &nbsp;The unwary are not bothered.&nbsp; The encircled space can feel safe, and the talk can feel free.&nbsp; Both feelings are deceptive - language, thinking and action have been curtailed.&nbsp; People have been deceived.&nbsp; There is nothing more anti-educational.</p>
<p>And neither is there is anything unfamiliar about this.&nbsp; It features in cleverly constructed press-releases, news separated from its backstory, superficial interviewing, and the terms inserted into commissions-of-enquiry.&nbsp; It's also the scenario for a fair few dystopias - where debate is curtailed, history is re-written, language is manipulated, doubt is punished, questioning ignored.&nbsp; And possibilities fall out of sight. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this is relevant to any outfit which might be a target for capture, or be an inadvertent perpetrator, or be both.&nbsp; The range of outfits which look to the future of careers work include some that lean toward reform, and others toward the promotion of success. &nbsp;Some show controlling tendencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, a resource kit for life-long guidance (ELGPN, 2012) takes a reforming position on enabling career management for a changing labour market.&nbsp; Elsewhere a <a href="http://www.derby.ac.uk/research/icegs/news/2014/icegs-launch-a-beacon-for-guidance.html">'beacon for guidance'</a> (Hyde, 2014) relies on the celebration of past success.&nbsp; Alongside both is a generalised claim to <a href="http://www.suttontrust.com/researcharchive/advancing-ambitions">advance ambitions</a> in an opportunistic attempt to attract favourable government attention. &nbsp;From what we know we can expect signs of control to curtail research.&nbsp; And so it proves. &nbsp;The claim to be advancing ambition by-passes earlier work examining <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5322">careers work's failures on aspiration</a>.</p>
<p>Education is no more immune to attempted capture than careers work.&nbsp; A much-canvassed attempt (Christodoulou, 2014) re-defines and dismisses the underpinning for progressive education.&nbsp; This circling of the semantic wagons pushes 'mythical beliefs' out of sight. &nbsp;But, as independent minds step outside the controlling circle its defences crumble...</p>

<p>Daisy Christodoulou's seven headlines signpost dead ends.&nbsp; She's right to raise the issues. &nbsp;They are genuine - anybody with any sustained contact in education has come across head-bangers arguing that all facts are opinions.&nbsp; But we have more than enough careers workers and teachers who know the difference between a fact (like gravity) and a construct (like daleks).</p>
<p>At any rate, students should be giving teachers a run for their money on the issues.&nbsp; And that conversation needs to appreciate that students have many ways to learn, and a fair-few needs for learning. &nbsp;For some it won't be an asked-for 'want'. &nbsp;For some it will feel uncomfortable - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29518319#?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">more like anarchy than education</a>. &nbsp;But it's learning for work-life and citizenship, and poses a crop of questions - the prevailing answers to which shape young lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blandly asking 'how do you feel?' mustn't get in the way of uncomfortably asking 'how do know?' (Williams, 2014).&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, is there anything here of any use to reforming careers-work partnerships?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->on expanding claims</strong> - careers work needs to be informed by an inclusive range of stakeholders - their interests extend beyond labour-market concerns - partnerships can realise, support and learn from these wider links</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->on refining roles</strong> - roles need to be acknowledged in both institutional expertise and community experience - sustained conversations are crucial for connecting professional expertise to student, family and community experience</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->on working with culture</strong> - local beliefs, values and expectations influence life chances - careers work is necessary to understanding these cultural influences - learning-for-living needs stage-by-stage work in mainstream curriculum</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->on developing thinking -</strong> credibility is more important than status - it needs reliable research with recognisable applications - and to be accessible to stakeholders - research-and-development can then be brought into community ownership</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->on realising possibilities </strong>- effective and sustainable change needs an account of observable causes and effects - stakeholders and professionals can then work together on how the one brings about the other - questioning failure is more useful than promoting success</li>
</ol>
<p>Education has a distinctive voice on the possibilities.&nbsp; The Royal Society of Arts (RSA) is an agency for mainstream education reform.&nbsp; It has published an <a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal">educator's account of working life</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of it holds no surprises for experienced careers workers.&nbsp; But a 'big-data' report (pp.10-15) goes into some detail on the 'hollowing out' of labour markets, both for the&nbsp;recruitment consequences in the mid-range, and for the rewards of top-range self employment.&nbsp; It welcomes global companies looking to educators to rebalance labour supply.&nbsp; It doesn't say how welcoming educators might be about being assigned that role.</p>
<p>A similarly unsurprising report (pp.16-24) examines the robustness of the demand for interpersonal, creative and digital abilities. &nbsp;And it examines some anticipations concerning the future relationship between automation and recruitment.&nbsp; It also points to how digital technologies may be good news for rich consumers but bad news for less well-off producers.</p>
<p>There are more surprises in a report (pp.21-25) of how people are moving into self-employment.&nbsp; It explains why this is not just a behavioural adjustment by people desperate for any work.&nbsp; It is a structural labour-market change, driven by able people seeking congenial settings for the fulfilment of high-level abilities. &nbsp;But there are issues: capitalising small businesses takes on financial risks.&nbsp; This is not what educators mean by 'learning is risky'- it has consequences for family and community well-being. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the RSA material it is an academic historian (pp.30-35) who gets close to the experience of change in working-life. &nbsp;It illustrates ways in which people are becoming increasingly curious and critical about 'what's going on'.&nbsp; Yet work-life has not adjusted to the way in which that hope is becoming expectation.&nbsp; The author's historical tracking sets out how work connects people to a credible, experimental, conversational and intellectually-engaging experience.&nbsp; The problem is that labour markets cannot accommodate the demand for work offering that kind of fulfillment. &nbsp;Indeed, it finds that work-life routines are too often futile, and sometimes traumatic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Big data rarely reflect enough of what the RSA reports.&nbsp; Alert and trusted helpers might. &nbsp;The historian is most interested in catalysing a congenial conversation. &nbsp;The less congenial scenarios are of low-paid, zero-hours and benefit-dependent working lives. &nbsp;That needs a more fully-equipped partnership response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I leave it to others to detect any shift in some paradigm. &nbsp;Some dust has to settle, some issues revisited. &nbsp;The range of thinking might be something like a copy-and-paste of this scattergram.&nbsp; Some of its terms crop up again and again in earlier pages...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the ideas disturb the relationship between careers work and policy.&nbsp; But they improve the relationship with stakeholders - and stakeholders elect politicians. &nbsp;But this is not arguing for severing relationships with politics.&nbsp; It's arguing for an interactive rather than a dependent relationship. &nbsp;Interactive is more dignified.</p>
<p>I doubt that there's any one place to start. &nbsp;And no sane partnership would try swallow all in one gulp. &nbsp;But, wherever the starting point, it's for educators to fire-up the action.&nbsp; NICE has mapped what careers work can do.&nbsp; It's time for mainstream educators to recognise what they bring to the partnership. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Registering and contributing to this blog would declare that intention - and open the conversation.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Career learning is how clients and students take on their own career management.&nbsp; The career-learning caf&eacute; is a place where their helpers take on the issues.&nbsp; And that work needs to be independent of professional and careers-service interests. &nbsp;It also needs to stand aside from political and commercial influences.&nbsp; So the caf&eacute; has no sponsors.&nbsp; It carries no advertising.&nbsp; It welcomes debate. &nbsp;And, as events unfold, it changes its thinking.&nbsp; You are invited to take part in that process.</p>
<p>This blog sets out the most recent contributions to that process.&nbsp; You can get the preceding account <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/CafCLN17.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp; But, now, both education in general and careers work in particular need to go into how technological and cultural change is raising urgent issues for voice, interests and hope.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;policy&nbsp;issues. &nbsp;The account probes the political causes of career-management effects.&nbsp; It finds that big data and sociology are at odds on that.&nbsp; It shows why the future of career needs re-envisaging. &nbsp;And it probes what, in all this, yesterday's theory has to do with tomorrow's practice.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic defenders of careers-work may not like it.&nbsp; But that's a good reason for studying it.&nbsp; A thinker's best friends are opponents, because not facing what goes wrong is a highway to failure.&nbsp; And all aspects of public-service education are facing that possibility.&nbsp; This is a sequence of signposts to new ways forward.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->new questions demand new answers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There's no shortage of reports urging the recovery of public-sector careers-work.&nbsp; The arguments are strong, but contemporary politics is not listening.&nbsp; It is the politics of individual responsibility, for achieving economic gain, by participating in a market place. &nbsp;It seeks private-sector solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a backstory.&nbsp; The global commercial-and-political consensus entertains the possibility of unfettered economic growth.&nbsp; The damaging consequences range from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; Policy characterises such damage as 'creative destruction'.&nbsp; The caf&eacute;'s evidence is that valued and viable small businesses are lost, citizenship and worker rights are undermined, careers and social services are captured, the compliant are rewarded, the critical are dismissed, and society fragments.&nbsp; It is private-sector interests that are served.&nbsp; And the trend is accelerating.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8484">education and policy - changing attitudes</a></strong><br />This is a detailed run-down on why public-sector careers-work is in such a fix.&nbsp; The article examines the interests influencing policy, the appeal to simple-mindedness, the confusion of reality with myth, the fragmentation of society, and the recognition of who is most at risk.&nbsp; It also suggests how fear can be transformed into hope. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8466">what education gets from politics</a></strong><br /> The article examines what policy does and what it fails to do for learning services.&nbsp; It separates stakeholder from shareholder interests, and it explains why it is stakeholder voice that careers work should heed.&nbsp; It wonders why so much of career talk is metaphorical, and how the images shape perceptions.&nbsp; It uses these insights to show how stakeholder interest are voiced.&nbsp; It describes how student voice is central.&nbsp; It shows how educator voice connects to students.&nbsp; And it sets out how community voice can be activated with or without policy support.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8226"><strong>is careers work distinct or extinct?</strong><br /> </a>This is a short introductory article linked to a monograph examining how public-sector careers work can thrive alongside a global multi-billion-dollar private-sector career-coaching industry.&nbsp; The article begins by facing up to the bad news - diagnosing the threat of extinction.&nbsp; It moves on to examine how careers work can make a new start.&nbsp; It points to careers-work thinking, which careers coaching has done little more than cherry-pick.&nbsp; And that gives careers work an opportunity to start again - from scratch.&nbsp; It has done it before, it can do it again.&nbsp; The article points to the opportunity to re-imagine an altogether more inclusive, substantial and distinctive service.&nbsp; It is needed to enable people to manage the precarious work-life that is becoming the norm - people ready for anything in what is partially a foreseeable and but increasingly an unforeseeable future.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">change in politics and education</a> </strong><br /> A careers work whose leadership fails to engage with change cannot survive.&nbsp; This monograph goes into detail on the realities of change.&nbsp; And it sees a way forward in a strategic repositioning of careers work in its communities.&nbsp; In particular it shows how local stakeholder interests can outflank shareholder interests.&nbsp; It examines the ways in which student-educator-community conversations can outshine any hokum.&nbsp; And it sets out how authentically credible voice will attract more constructive attention than merely plausible ploys.&nbsp; The argument is that such a re-negotiated way of working with students and clients in their communities will forge a more sustainable grounding for help.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">which way is forward for students their educators and the business-world?</a></strong><br /> Is there a business-world attempt to capture the careers-work curriculum? &nbsp;If there were, then no educator could afford to ignore it.&nbsp; This article faces the possibility, documenting how such attempts work, and pointing to the unresolvable conflicts that result.&nbsp; It cites and links to examples.&nbsp; And it documents how a prominent careers-work think-tank failed to recognise the danger.&nbsp; But the article also finds a stronger basis for partnerships between students, educators, and employers.&nbsp; And that means setting the partnership in a social-world.&nbsp; It reports how business interests are acknowledging that need.&nbsp; There are no heroes or villains here, just causes worth identifying and effects to be dealt with.&nbsp; One of the most telling conclusions is that genuine partnerships work best, not with 'how-to-do!' prescriptions, but with 'what-went-wrong?' diagnoses.</p>

<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->enclaves and cities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Collections of statistics which can analyse and order wide-ranging findings are called 'big data'.&nbsp; They are commonly used to track national trends used to influence governments.&nbsp; Among their uses is the backing they give to complaints that access to services is a post-code lottery. &nbsp;And in a sense it is.&nbsp; But such massive generalisations need to assume that what applies anywhere applies everywhere.&nbsp; And, in another sense, it doesn't.</p>
<p>There are realities that big data fails to find.&nbsp; They can only be detected up-close.&nbsp; Sociological observations find that what is welcomed in one neighbourhood falls flat in another. &nbsp;Where that is so there is no 'best practice', there is what local people recognise as relevant, useful and possible where they live.&nbsp; What serves some neighbourhoods harms others.&nbsp; These are post-code realities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sociological term for such realities is 'enclaves'.&nbsp; An enclave is where what the people believe, value and expect belongs to that location, and need not belong to any other. &nbsp;Inside the enclave understanding is shaped by that experience.&nbsp; Outside it is misunderstood.&nbsp; This is not economics, it's culture.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf">enclaves and voice</a></strong><br /> This monograph examines how geography influences life chances. &nbsp;It is because what people mean by winning respect, or gaining self confidence, or experiencing freedom are understood differently in different locations.&nbsp; Each location frames its own memories, expectations &amp; voice.&nbsp; And each has its own way of realising a stake in society.&nbsp; And of not realising such a stake.&nbsp; The monograph sets this thinking in relation to an extensive range of careers-work sociology.&nbsp; And it uses that mapping as a platform for suggesting research and development which must be made to work locally.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8787">while nations fail and cities liberate it's shock that sets the agenda </a></strong><br /> The article examines a new perspective on the importance of locality.&nbsp; It reviews fast-emerging thinking on the potential dynamism of city-grounded reform.&nbsp; It looks at the differences between how nations and cities develop policies.&nbsp; It cites evidence on why nations so frequently fail and cities increasingly succeed.&nbsp; It shows how any careers-work leadership needs better to understand what's going on.&nbsp; The article probes what politicians do, why they disappoint, and how to test them for trustworthiness.&nbsp; It also shows why raising aspirations is the most demanding test for any education policy.&nbsp; But this means being open to the arresting meanings found in the resulting narratives.&nbsp; And it is that shock that opens minds to needed change.&nbsp; The article unfolds a dynamic radicalism which can carry education reform farther and faster.&nbsp; But it needs city specificity rather than national generality.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>

<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->theory for practice</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Careers theory is an applied not a pure discipline. &nbsp;Its ideas are, at best, second-hand - imported from original sources, largely in economics and psychology.&nbsp; Early-days UK thinking drew on a handful of US adaptations of such basic research.&nbsp; If UK careers work has a distinctive position it is because it reaches beyond psychological characteristics linked to economic possibilities.&nbsp; The UK account develops an understanding of career management as grounded in economic, social and cultural conditions.&nbsp; This is a distinctively wide-ranging explanation of what people do about work.</p>
<p>Any theory is conventionally validated by the reliability of its research.&nbsp; There is an array of methodological validity tests.&nbsp; But the only test that matters asks whether the reported causes have the predicted effects.&nbsp; And that is not found on library desktops, it is found in immediate observations.&nbsp; The grounded understanding of how and why things work is called catalytic validity.</p>
<p>The importance of the test is heightened where what is found is found on-line.&nbsp; Careers workers have attempted a colonisation of the net by exporting their ready-made theory-based techniques.&nbsp; The more impressive and more worrying career sites are unhampered by any attempt at theoretical justification.</p>
<p>Careers work makes itself most useful by closing all these gaps between thinking about causes and acting on effects.&nbsp; It means never talking about research without saying something about development.&nbsp; The unified concept of research-and-development makes educators and researchers mutually-dependent partners.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497">what educators can do</a></strong><br /> The caf&eacute;'s use of the unified term 'careers work' replaces the divided term 'careers education' and 'guidance'.&nbsp; The unified term undermines the possibility of making either activity ancillary to the other.&nbsp; And could there be some residual clinging to the idea that it is guidance that holds the core careers-work expertise?&nbsp; Such a belief would locate a teaching staff's command of learning disciplines as lesser than a person's hold on a limited application.&nbsp; This article argues that contemporary conditions demand the breadth and depth of both the disciplines and the application.&nbsp; It does that by signposting the untapped relevance to students' lives of so-called 'academic' knowledge.&nbsp; This account of what educators can do identifies and links to sources on how curriculum can enable students to navigate their path through a fulfilling work-life.&nbsp; It rebalances the relationship between curriculum and guidance.&nbsp; And, while the article acknowledges that not all teachers are up to shaping curriculum to such purposes, it also shows that some are ready - and that careers work only needs some.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/NICECHit&Myth.pdf">on-line careers work as hit &amp; myth</a> </strong><br /> This fully-references journal article examines what on-line careers work does well, the 'hits', and how some sites mislead and damage life chances, with 'myths'.&nbsp; It shows how educators are well placed to enable students to deal with on-line sources.&nbsp; There are three key concepts: helping students to &lsquo;grasp&rsquo; understanding, which means enabling critical thinking; while extending student's &lsquo;reach&rsquo; means enabling students to transfer on-line finds into off-line life; and &lsquo;embodiment&rsquo; means the direct-and-personal contact needed to incorporate on-line learning into off-line identity.&nbsp; The article sets out a partnership between what can only be offered through face-to-face guidance and what can only be delivered through stage-by-stage curriculum.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6571">careers education in schools</a></strong><br /> A review, linked to its source, of one of the most influential publications on careers education.&nbsp; Written by David Andrews it sets out a past, present &amp; future for careers education in schools.&nbsp; His key distinction is seminal - it is between learning about something and learning for something.&nbsp; On the one hand students can &lsquo;learn about careers and work', on the other they can  &lsquo;learn for careers and work&rsquo;.&nbsp; The distinction deserves close attention.&nbsp; It opens possibilities for education, showing that it is about more than competing for up-coming placement, but can also explore unforeseen possibilities.&nbsp; David Andrews puts a finger on what kind of mutually-respecting partnership there can be between guidance and curriculum.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8509">what's the use of impartiality?</a></strong><br /> The article wonders whether careers work's claim to impartiality are credible.&nbsp; It finds an impressive definition in Canada: impartiality acts &lsquo;without fear, without favour and without affection&rsquo;.&nbsp; The article wonders if any Canadian or Brit can sustain the belief that careers work has been so unshakably impressive.&nbsp; It also suggests that it might not matter, because it finds, documents and links to a bigger and more independent education professionalism.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUW8V7Jupns&feature=youtu.be">theory and practice</a></strong><br /> This video shows me under interrogation concerning what a century of&nbsp;careers-work&nbsp;thinking has done for careers-work&nbsp;practice.&nbsp; My interrogator is pushy on whether the thinking is for description or for prescription. &nbsp;I'm also asked what is a theory anyway? &nbsp;I have a go at explaining why theories change.&nbsp; And I try to say why the difference between a professional's work on career-development needs to be distinguished from student's action in career-management.&nbsp; The interrogator allows me to track thinking, from career matching, into community interaction, and onto learning theory and critical thinking.&nbsp; When asked 'what next?' I say why I think it's the careers-work's uses of narrative.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6540"><strong>why we need a career-learning theory  and now?</strong><br /></a>The text of a lecture, with links to its sources, sets out operational steps to enabling learning-to-learn, as part of a programme of life-relevant learning.&nbsp; It probes what the theories say.&nbsp; It locates learning theory in the mel&eacute;e of career thinking.&nbsp; It acknowledges that the disturbances of critical thinking may be counter cultural.&nbsp; But It also illustrates how critical thinking is necessary to any conversation about working life.&nbsp; And it shows how that kind of conversation equips a student for control in the navigation of a path through working life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6973">narrative as a critical voice of experience in contemporary career management</a></strong><br /> The text of this fully-referenced and linked lecture identifies the uses of narrative in commerce and in politics.&nbsp; It argues for the various ways in which careers work can also draw on the dynamics of narrative.&nbsp; It uses 'storyboarding', a technique with a wide range of applications, as an example.&nbsp; The thinking hinges on a distinction between analysis and narrative.&nbsp; The former appears to draw on scientific expertise, the latter is a natural human approach to understanding.&nbsp; There are issues concerning reliability and practicality to resolve.&nbsp; But that resolution is handed to community stakeholders and their partners in education, rather than to remote theorists or political interests or commercial shareholders.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7681">the uses of narrative</a></strong><br /> The article sets out the material used in a research-and-development workshop on the uses of narrative.&nbsp; It examines how displaying careers-workers' expertise needs to be balanced by engaging the authority of clients' and students' experience.&nbsp; What careers workers know is modified by what students know, and narrative is the medium for recognising that reality.&nbsp; There is a link to the presentation used at the workshop as well as to the monograph which underpins the work.&nbsp; The workshop invites educators into partnerships with careers workers.&nbsp; It encourages the different members to group and regroup in their search for an approach to using narrative which promises to be useful to their work.&nbsp; They look for how they can shape these uses so that they best engage student learning.&nbsp; The assumption is that no one way of doing this will be found - indeed more than one way must be found. &nbsp;All of the issues and findings are documented and subsequently made available to the whole group.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.cegnet.co.uk/blog/peter-daws">trail-blazing thinking for UK careers work</a></strong><br /> An educator who changed the direction of my life was Peter Daws; he died this year. &nbsp;But it was Peter who laid the foundations for a distinctive UK careers work. &nbsp;Nonetheless, Peter was no out-and-out defender of careers-work institutions. &nbsp;Long ago he wrote an article on its iatrogenic effects.&nbsp; He argued that enthusiasts need to consider the possibility that careers work can harm as well as help.&nbsp; The task is not to defend what it actually done but to figure out what needs to be done - and that makes the ideas, not the institutions, the priority.&nbsp; Ideas and institutions are not the same thing.</p>

<p>A recurring distinction here is the Career-learning Caf&eacute;'s distinction between career development and career management. &nbsp;The former is what educators do to help. &nbsp;The latter is what students and clients do about it. &nbsp;The one rarely exactly corresponds to the other. &nbsp;In a changing world maybe we should worry when it does. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Educators and careers workers, their managers and their leaders, need to catch up with the sense student and clients are making of their experience of learning and work. &nbsp;There is no simple answer to any of the questions, neither is there is any single answer. &nbsp;But any answer must take account of the politics of whose voices are heeded, what interests are served, and who can afford to hope. &nbsp;</p>

              <title>students, their educators and the business world - which way is forward?</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bill Law<br /></strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Business-world proposals for curriculum need a long hard look.&nbsp; Educators can't afford to ignore what seem to be attempts at curriculum capture. &nbsp;The curriculum is community property - and not for takeover.</p>
<p>It's true that students need to see how they can join the labour-market, but that's not all they need to understand in order to navigate working life.&nbsp; I find some consensus about that in the proposals.&nbsp; But there are also blind alleys, and unresolved issues, and some agencies that can't deal with them - or won't.&nbsp; A prominent careers-work think-tank features in this.&nbsp; Making useful sense of it all means stepping back - to get wider perspectives on partisan interests and pervasive influences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is addressed to educators.&nbsp; I say 'educators' because students learn, not just with teachers and lecturers, but with a range of on-line and community-based helpers - including some business people.&nbsp; That works well when help is based on a credible understanding of what's going on, and what can be done about it.&nbsp; And the business world has some of that cred - but not all of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In any event, I see little point in looking for heroes to be lauded and villains to be condemned.&nbsp; Working out what to do means examining causes worth identifying and effects to be dealt with.&nbsp; This is about escaping capture and building informed, useful and genuine business-education partnerships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, here's the grit, it turns out that partnerships don't so much need 'how-to-do!' prescriptions, they need 'what-went-wrong?' diagnoses.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>finding consensus</strong></p>
<p>A reality everybody must face is successive governments embracing neo-liberal capitalism. &nbsp;Its claim is that education must support commerce by readying students for working life.&nbsp; Actually you don't need to be a capitalist to see that the more students know about working life the better.&nbsp; So there could be the makings of a consensus here.&nbsp; There's certainly enough going on in contemporary working life to attract the interested attention of educators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there's also this: the declared objectives of dominant business voices are wholly economic.&nbsp; The Educator and Employers Taskforce has sponsored a well documented programme for <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/.U5ljkBaZahM">employer engagement</a>.&nbsp; It's designed to increase students' future earning capacities.&nbsp; Anthony Mann's and Christian Percy's (2013) research for the programme looks for correlations between programme participation and subsequent earnings.&nbsp; It's an economics-driven move on curriculum.&nbsp; And capture would limit the curriculum's ability to probe the range of work-life performance, well-being and fulfilment. &nbsp;And how far any of these are found in working life - or not found. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Declarations for new programmes usually rest on a claims that the future can improve on the past. &nbsp;And there is a past.&nbsp; Most schools and colleges have set up some combination of work-related learning activities.&nbsp; They include work experience, work-place visits, enterprise activities, conversations with visitors, mentoring, cv and interview workshops, classroom discussions, careers fairs and face-to-face help.&nbsp; Students also learn from the recounting of acquaintances' work-life experience as well as in part-time and voluntary work.&nbsp; Some students are also carers.&nbsp; Informal learning gathered from their own people, and in their own neighbourhoods, can be more compelling than formal programmes.&nbsp; A good educator can enable students learn from that mix.&nbsp; And make useful sense of it - whether for approach or avoidance.</p>
<p>There's evidence that students do not generally find formal programmes useful (<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.edge.co.uk/research">YouGov, 2008</a>).&nbsp; And reported experiences of and reactions to careers work are variable.&nbsp; Anecdotal evidence is easy to dismiss, but much of it accords with careers work's struggle to deal with massive change with minimal resources (<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf">Bill Law, 2013</a>).&nbsp; It has seemed safer to try to repair, refurbish and re-assert what careers work once did.&nbsp; The trouble for careers work is that twentieth-century answers do not cope well with twenty-first century questions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This may be why the Mann-Percy proposals outflank conventional careers work, by calling for 'mainstream educational experiences'. &nbsp;But their readiness to work with curriculum-wide possibilities need to be negotiable.&nbsp; Attempts at capture will lead nowhere - there's no shortcut to consensus.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>avoiding blind alleys</strong></p>
<p>Programme correlations do not necessarily point to programme effects; intervening variables distort the numbers. For example, some reports come from students predisposed to agree, or disagree; there are some who readily adapt to dominant voices, or don't.&nbsp; Now agreeableness, argumentativeness, adaptability and bloody-mindedness are not necessarily good news, or bad.&nbsp; But, one way or another, they can each account for how much a person earns. &nbsp;Mann and Percy find other statistical distortions: wealth, ambition, gender, ethnicity and location can each account for high earnings, whatever careers-work activities a person might have engaged in.&nbsp; It's selective state schooling which turns out to be the most prevalent predictor of high earnings.&nbsp; For Mann's and Percy's purposes these are all blind alleys.</p>
<p>The Mann and Percy research is based on data, recording effects which can be counted or measured and then used to justify action.&nbsp; After taking account of possible blind alleys, their data were gathered from 169 individuals, aged between 19 and 24.&nbsp; They were asked:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how frequently they have taken part in any of the listed careers-work activities</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how much they now earn</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how useful to their future career plans they find the careers-work experiences</li>
</ol>
<p>The data appear to show that every time an activity puts a student into contact with an employer that student's earning potential is increased by &pound;900. &nbsp;The programme justification is 'learn more get more'.&nbsp; The learning is said to be like 'a penny dropping'. &nbsp;We'll come back to that.</p>
<p>For the moment it's worth setting the programme in a wider frame, and then asking the researchers...</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; are new jobs created for promising students?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; do other students earn less because participating students earn more?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; can other institutions join the scheme in order to level the field?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; is the research able to detect any hard-to-quantify features of these gains?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; can it tell if it works by actual talent or by symbolic qualification?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; any ideas about questions that this research cannot answer?</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually Mann and Percy do have such ideas - more about that later. &nbsp;But they entirely overlook the widely-discussed <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/improvement-by-degree-or-natural-talent/2014079.article">talent-or-qualification</a> issue.&nbsp; It is far from clear whether people are favoured for what they've learned, or for what their qualification signals. &nbsp;Neo-liberal policy favours signals.&nbsp; So there's a question for Mann and Percy - are they really cranking-up wages, or just making selection easier in a market-place? &nbsp;Or, maybe, neither of these? - we'll see.</p>
<p>People of 19-24 have seen enough work-life to have noticed all of these causes and effects.&nbsp; It's true, finding out what they know would need more expensive research.&nbsp; But its questions are worth posing, because there are critical zero-sum issues here.&nbsp; One person's plus can be another's minus - the one career displacing the another, but adding nothing to the economy.&nbsp; And when all institutions join the scheme to give their students a fair shot, all advantage is neutralised - and adds nothing.&nbsp; If this is so the programme is either unfair or pointless. &nbsp;Another blind alley?</p>
<p>Right now student and teacher feedback is positive.&nbsp; But gratitude for gifts is not the same as learning for life.&nbsp; Standing back for a wider perspective shows the programme to be surrounded by complexities, blind spots and distortions. &nbsp;What they need is more conversation not more counting. &nbsp;And partnership works on agreement about what questions are worth asking.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>reaching turning points</strong></p>
<p>Mann and Percy themselves pose the question.&nbsp; And there's a shift of focus&nbsp;in their answers -&nbsp;from the individual to the collective.&nbsp; The idea of social capital figures prominently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's the past that gets questioned. &nbsp;During the 1990s the <a href="http://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/publications/2010/?page=4">Confederation for British Industry</a> (CBI) published a series of good-looking-and-gratis booklets arguing that the interests of students, employers and nation are as one.&nbsp; In a decade of cheers for business all we had to do is wait for its trickled-down success.&nbsp; A lot of people are still waiting.</p>
<p>The CBI series kicked off with a call for 'a stronger partnership between business and education',&nbsp;it confidently looked for 'a skills revolution', in a 'skills decade' it bravely set out 'an employer's view of careers education and guidance', it mapped 'routes to success' documented by a 'skills passport', looking beyond careers work it set out priorities for 'the future curriculum', and it put the term 'employability' on everybody's lips.&nbsp; That zeitgeist was strong enough that the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) could be persuaded that careers education and guidance can deliver economic benefits to the nation (Chistopher Ball, 1993).&nbsp; It was all hard to ignore. &nbsp;I tried, and that was a mistake.</p>
<p>The National Institute for Careers Education and Counselling was a player then, and still is - a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nicec.org">NICEC seminar</a>&nbsp;is never a waste of time. &nbsp;Following its 1975 foundation it earned a reputation for reliable research-and-development leading to new thinking.&nbsp; Ideas were trialled and revised in conversations with practitioners at several bases throughout the UK.&nbsp; This was a pre-internet careers-worker network. &nbsp;It might have been expected to argue that careers work changes things, but it also argued that careers work itself needed to change. &nbsp;Much of its material was diagnostic for improvement. &nbsp;Prescriptions outlining careers-work achievements were more popular.&nbsp; Ready-made prescriptive messages also go down well with politicians seeking closure, speed and action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But politicians need evidence; and they contract r&amp;d outfits like NICEC, as well as think-tanks, consultancies and NGOs.&nbsp; These&nbsp;contracts&nbsp;are prestigious, and winning them can mean framing-and-shaping reports to be as welcome as possible to politicians.&nbsp; In the worst cases the evidence does not shape the conclusions, the conclusions shape the evidence. &nbsp;The risk is real, and monitored by a <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://static.squarespace.com/static/52e1f399e4b06a94c0cdaa41/t/536a108ee4b0e77a5729562c/1399459982820/How Transparent are Think Tanks (Transparify 07May2014).pdf">transparency-monitoring organisation</a>.</p>
<p>NICEC has, over time, redefined itself as a policy-research institute. &nbsp;An effect is an understandable tendency to underline the value of careers-work - its usefulness, its expertise, its impartiality and its economic significance.&nbsp; None of these claims have been convincingly substantiated.&nbsp; Though, to be fair, there are correlations between careers-work activity and student employability (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2014.918934">Anthony Richard Taylor and Tristram Hooley</a>,&nbsp;2014).&nbsp; These correlations get as close as any to validating careers-work expertise. &nbsp;But, as the task-force enquiry has illustrated, data-based correlations overlook social complexities. &nbsp;Taylor and Hooley are right to advise caution in interpreting their data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These complexities become more visible when we stand back in order to look wider.&nbsp; It reveals a zeitgeist celebrating the individual in pursuit of the economic. &nbsp;That cuture visualised a free-standing person cultivating personal qualities which can be linked to work opportunities. &nbsp;This is fit-and-match career management, simple because its conducted in a social vacuum. &nbsp;It's supporters can still be heard to declare 'it's as simple as that!'. &nbsp;As most of the sources cited here confirm, it never is.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>comfortably prescribing and uncomfortably diagnosing</strong></p>
<p>Mann and Percy have stepped back far enough to see what went wrong with the CBI campaign.&nbsp; They diagnose a lack of a social theory. &nbsp;The theory calls on the idea of <a href="http://infed.org/mobi/robert-putnam-social-capital-and-civic-community/">social capital</a> - published in&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone">Bowling Alone</a>&nbsp;</em>(Robert Putnam, 2000). &nbsp;Social capital is a currency gathered in social encounters, not in trousered cash.&nbsp; It is the social contacts a person makes.&nbsp; More contacts brings more social capital, yielding more options for action. &nbsp;Less brings less. &nbsp;Robert Putnam sees social capital as a carrier of national economic recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The explanation may still be in economics, but it's no longer individual.&nbsp; Mann and Percy find that the past failure to recognise social realities explains the failure of CBI's pursuit of employability.&nbsp; They also see the task force's present pursuit of individual earning-potential as risking failure. &nbsp;The key factor is social engagement. &nbsp;And the findings are not prescriptive of what goes right, they are diagnostic of what goes wrong.</p>
<p>Hearing somebody say what went wrong feels bad, listening to what can be done feels better.&nbsp; So what feel-good thing can we do? - better quality standards? - some 'how-to-do' guidelines? - more force from the task-force? &nbsp;- All of these? - Other? &nbsp;How would anybody know? &nbsp;Diagnosis doesn't find&nbsp;that-went-wrong-so-let's-do-this solutons, it is useful in another way, it locates the problem. &nbsp;And that calls for better than knee-jerk responses.</p>
<p>During the decades following that early-days CBI optimism, but before Mann-and-Percy provoked a rethink, we had <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/register/sure-start-childrens-centres.htm">SureStart</a>.&nbsp; In its time it provided widely-available and locally-rooted places of accessible help for young families bringing up their children.&nbsp; Each was open to the two-way links which, at their best, educators make with their communities.&nbsp; Looking out for other people's children needs a network.</p>
<p>It also needs some serious thinking.&nbsp; And SureStart thinking was at least as much diagnostic as prescriptive.&nbsp; It invited community workers and educators to find how locally-useful reform can be realised.&nbsp; Principles were set out in a government publication <a href="https://www.education.gov.uk/consultations/downloadableDocs/EveryChildMatters.pdf"><em>Every Child Matters</em></a> (DfES, 2004).&nbsp; It proved to be the first in a series on what hinders children's learning and thriving.&nbsp; It stood back enough to track causes and effects in global economic forces, the technologies they engage, and the cultural changes that brings.&nbsp; It particularly tracks the causes of damage, loss and unfairness.&nbsp; And it seeks more than economic effects - as much concerned for personal-and-social fulfilment and well-being.</p>
<p>The argument was linked to the <a href="http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/5956/">Connexions</a> programme, also set up by government.&nbsp; It still is a national network relying on the inventiveness of locally-rooted providers of career-management help.&nbsp; Help is offered in the context of each student's family and community experience.&nbsp; This socially-situated perspective means that what is happening in the career management can be understood as part of what is happening in the life. &nbsp;Most resources are to be dedicated to those most in need of help.</p>
<p>SureStart anticipated Mann's and Percy's thinking: the diagnosis of conventional careers work's failure is that it lacked scope.&nbsp; It was not in enough of a position to deliver fit-and-match career development.&nbsp; It was in no position at all to deal with global trends, or unlock national wealth. &nbsp;But, most of all, it was out-of-tune with the changing way social-and-cultural dynamics figured in student's lives. &nbsp;Careers work needed to change. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students - learning to map change, to make sense of it, and to navigate it - need the space and progression afforded by curriculum.&nbsp; The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA, 2004) proposed such a forward-looking reform of curriculum. &nbsp;It found plenty going wrong: education is too fragmented, the burden of assessment too great, and staying-on rates too low. &nbsp;Too little is done to support well-being or to evoke a love of learning &nbsp;The QCA called for blue-sky thinking on the issues.&nbsp; Part of that thinking was published as a case for Life-role Relevance in Curriculum - <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/caflirric.html">LiRRiC</a> (Bill Law, 2006).&nbsp; It came up with principles, for...&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>relating formal learning to the local-and-social world in which students informally learn for themselves</li>
<li>with enough space and time to engage students in making their own sense of that experience and its complexity</li>
<li>linking academic learning to students' present and future life-roles to signal its learning-for-living usefulness</li>
<li>embedding academic learning in a subject-with-subject coherence which makes it both memorable and motivating</li>
<li>making learning transferable by reminding students of their lives so that their lives remind them of their learning&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every academic teacher would be up for this, but not all would be needed.&nbsp; It's enough that every education outfit has enough people who can win trust, fire-up interest and have enough command of their subjects.&nbsp; Learning for living needs to attract the interested attention of the best educators.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf">record</a> (Bill Law, 2013) suggests that the careers-work leadership response to&nbsp;<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Every Child Matters</em>&nbsp;reform was conditional.&nbsp; The fast-developing technologies were seen as opportunities to disseminate existing material.&nbsp; What was thought to matter to every child was what careers work was already doing.&nbsp; There were fears of a dilution of careers-work expertise. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In any event, the reforms were overtaken by a different politics, giving careers workers more to worry about - and, I don't know, some reappraisal of how every child matters.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>questioning proposals</strong></p>
<p>The employers' task-force proposals promise a 'fully facilitated' programme, with business 'at the centre'.&nbsp; They are aimed at having students 'work-place ready', and with an 'appetite for working-life'. &nbsp;This is not an isolated initiative, there are wider resonances. &nbsp;<a href="http://lsect.co.uk/where-is-careers-advise-going.pdf">Securing our future talent</a> is an on-line argument for linking business to careers work.&nbsp; Commercial logos and endorsements lay the ground for 'good practice'. &nbsp;Similar claims are made in a business-led prediction of <a href="http://lsect.co.uk/where-is-careers-advise-going.pdf">where careers work is going</a>.&nbsp; And what about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.balticpublications.com/Changingcareers/2014issues/cc36/index.html?utm_source=Changing+Careers&utm_campaign=fbfbf4be0b-Changing_Careers_August8_7_2012&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_4733e52c05-fbfbf4be0b-412228749">changing careers</a>?&nbsp;a career-coaching site cheerfully urging job seekers to fit-and-match to an unproblematic labour market. &nbsp;Wider afield, there are reports of celebrities helping to finance business-friendly <a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6434251">agendas for education</a>.&nbsp; And then there is a politico lining up a commercialised education for <a href="http://www.policy-network.net/publications/4695/Mending-the-Fractured-Economy">mending a fractured economy</a>.&nbsp; Now, what could be wrong with any of that?&nbsp; Careers-work leaders think little, a fair few have signed up in the endorsements.</p>
<p>It's not surprising to find businesses externalising labour costs.&nbsp; Shareholders want as much as possible off their balance sheets.&nbsp; So it's worth noticing how carefully the proposals are managed. &nbsp;They feature more prominent celebrities than informed academics. &nbsp;The business-lists omit G4S, Serco, Capita, Atos, Wonga, News International and any other outfits that mislead, defraud and exploit for as long as they can get away with it. &nbsp;There are no investment-bank logos. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A careers-work leader might welcome the flattering attention. &nbsp;An educator might wonder whether the popular, plausible and rich are able to camouflage, entice and capture. &nbsp;If so, they might also wonder what they and their students can do about it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There's lot for students to wonder about: by probing inside tracks to high-status jobs, by interrogating employment and remuneration conditions, by researching the consequences of unlimited growth, by questioning how private commerce relies on public investment, by digging into the polarisation of salaries and tax avoidance, by examining the transfer of global capital, by probing the commercial canvassing of power.&nbsp; I don't know how much of what they find would be counted as 'labour-market information' in conventional careers work. &nbsp;But that's what it is.</p>
<p>Students need to talk directly with working people at all levels in a working life.&nbsp; They need to know what's happening to the small firms where most people look to get started.&nbsp; They may be allowed to know about <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jul/01/children-colliery-towns-not-learn-miners-strike">wars and royals in history</a>, but not the work-life of their families (Geoff Bright, 2013).&nbsp; They need to understand why there is decay in some local neighbourhoods and exclusion in others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's easy to wind people up with free 'information, inspiration and advice' - but is it education?&nbsp; Or is education what faces evidence, outlines argument, invites questions, acknowledges doubts, recognises points-of-view and sees alternatives? &nbsp;Because that is where nothing is ready-made, and nothing is inevitable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's no way back.&nbsp; Contemporary social attitudes are formed by different memories, attributing different meanings, stirred up by different politics.&nbsp; The conventional wisdom is that promotions have upbeat prescriptions of good-news possibilities.&nbsp; But the reality is that our students are in safer hands with educators who can enable diagnostic questioning of 'what went wrong?'&nbsp; Failure is endemic to the human condition.&nbsp; We will all fail again, but we can all learn to <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/s/samuel_beckett.html">fail better</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>working with educators</strong></p>
<p>The human condition being what it is, the more we find out the more we realise how little we know.&nbsp; There's a lot more to know about how social capital is acquired and how students can use it. &nbsp;So what can educators make of these social causes and effects?...</p>
<ul>
<li>learning is not just what students find out it's how collectively they make sense of it</li>
<li>educators need better to understand why students do what they do about learning</li>
<li>we all learn best from surprising and disturbing processes</li>
<li>career management is usefully understood not as a routine to follow but as a story to relate</li>

<p><strong>finding out and making sense:</strong>&nbsp; In education ideas about prescribed-knowledge and diagnosed-failure belong to a long-standing distinction between <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/moving on/cafcpibrief.pdf">content and process</a>.&nbsp; Educators and employers may grab centre-stage on the content, but when it comes to making sense of it educators have no more than bit-parts. &nbsp;Tick-box evaluations don't detect this. &nbsp;Some educators, including some from business, never know what's going on.&nbsp; Not knowing what students are making of learning is a catastrophic deficit.</p>
<p>Alert educators understand how those hidden complexities, undisclosed confusions and private conflicts are part of learning. &nbsp;But how does <em>social</em> capital come into that?&nbsp; The idea of <em>cultural</em> capital gets closer.&nbsp; The keep-it-simple brigade won't like this, but 'social' and 'cultural' are not the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>who students are and what they do:</strong>&nbsp; Words are important; and what we now know has needed that other term,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212956.Language_and_Symbolic_Power">cultural capital</a>,&nbsp;much used by sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1991).&nbsp; His research crops up a lot in career-management thinking.&nbsp; It focuses on how dispositions are acquired from upbringing, and how attitudes are differently cultivated in different communities.&nbsp; Each community forms the culture which collectively makes sense to its inhabitants.&nbsp; And that sense is reflected in habits-of-mind expressed as beliefs, values and expectations.&nbsp; Pierre Bourdieu speaks of &lsquo;habitus&rsquo; simultaneously referring to the inhabited-collective and the habits-of-mind it cultivates.&nbsp; It is both a shared identity and a group's way of seeing - the who-we-are which explains why we do what-we-do.&nbsp; Educators frequently bump into cultivated collectivities.&nbsp; And they are missing too much if they miss its range - from inner-city have-nots to cosmopolitan have-yachts.</p>
<p>There are tough questions here - less about how much capital to onload, more about how much habitus to disturb. &nbsp;It asks how much of what students bring in is it good for them to carry away? &nbsp;Working on the answer is where hidden complexities, undisclosed confusions and private conflicts become visible.</p>
<p>The process evokes a real-time real-place remembering of promises made, models admired and possibilities recognised - and all in people encountered in the group - and, with a more chance of surprise, outside.&nbsp; Career management is negotiated with, for and in response to other people.&nbsp; Those social facts call up thoughts-and-feelings ranging from loyalty to suspicion. &nbsp;And that needs to be resolved by how much to hold-onto and how much to let-go <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf">(Bill Law, 2009)</a>.</p>
<p>There's no know-more-get-more formula here.&nbsp; Pierre Bourdieu makes much of the way people talk.&nbsp; Actually, in curriculum that conversation is more likely to be soliloquy.&nbsp; But, whether in disclosure or inner-life, there are no ready-made outcomes. &nbsp;This is is disturbing. &nbsp;But if education is not going to disturb anything why would anyone bother?</p>
<p><strong>troublesome surprises: </strong>&nbsp;There's education-research evidence for the value of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pzr00">disturbing learning</a> (podcast).&nbsp; A surprising experience releases more learning potential than a routine one (Annette Karmilloff, 1992).&nbsp; The findings are documented as <a href="http://www.scaruffi.com/mind/karmilof.html">unexpected learning</a>.&nbsp; From infancy, more sustained learning has avoided fixed patterns, predictable movements and bemusing scenarios.&nbsp; Rather, it comes from being troubled, getting surprised and tracking change.&nbsp; We like the safe, the assured and the comforting, but they don't do much for learning.</p>
<p>Between them Pierre Bourdieu and Annette Karmilloff characterise learning as a shared and disturbing process in which students make sense of causes, and get a grip on effects. &nbsp;This is good news. &nbsp;Fit-and-match self-marketing works well for the plausible by deceiving the credulous.&nbsp; Troubling-and-disturbing nuisances are more likely creatively to expand business possibilities. &nbsp;They also lift education out of keep-'em-quiet child minding, don't-bother-me-routine, and jobs-worth compliance. &nbsp;It is altogether more interesting, possibly enough that fewer able teachers will quit their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>career-management narratives:</strong>&nbsp; Information about experience, habits, points-of-view, surprises and change-of-mind can readily be recounted as narrative. &nbsp;And there's a lot of interest in how to do that.&nbsp; Some want homilies - tales with ready-made meanings.&nbsp; But the educational <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">uses of narrative</a> draw on rounded stories which provoke who-what-where-when-how-why questioning. &nbsp;They do not so much whizz people along, as draw people in.&nbsp; That causes a person to wonder about more-than-one possible outcome. &nbsp;Career management could do with some more surprising closing scenes.</p>
<p>And any curriculum is packed with such narratives. &nbsp;A study of their educative use (Bill Law, 2012) shows how a rounded story does not impose meaning but invites response.&nbsp; Meaning comes not from the author's prescription but from the student's diagnosis. &nbsp;Career management becomes an open-ended story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where Mann's and Percy's penny drops. &nbsp;Narrative thinking calls it 'turning point'.&nbsp; And that moment of insight belongs to a longer, and sometimes troublesome, will-I-won't-I story.&nbsp; Much of what's important in learning about work is important because change is fraught.&nbsp; It needs educators who can work with students on questioning those hidden complexiities, undisclosed confusions and private conflicts - becoming ready for navigating change. &nbsp;And it's that process that unsticks the penny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using narrative in education is no narrowly-framed process, eliciting rushed answers, with no time to explore. &nbsp;Its processes enable students to take command of their own lives.&nbsp; That quest was never more demanding.</p>
<p><strong>new ways forward:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;There's an account of&nbsp;what the quest demands in <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">education for change</a>.&nbsp; It's a long list: resisting impulse, strengthening resilience, developing concentration, feeling pleasure, becoming mindful, being optimistic, maintaining relationships and finding meaning - all get a mention.&nbsp; The outcomes are variously claimed to win competitiveness, to support well-being, to bring fulfilment and to permit flourishing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interest in the list is growing.&nbsp; A recent source claims this search for underlying causes to be <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Flourish.html?id=ng7RJW-udoQC">unprecedented</a> in education.&nbsp; But that claim overlooks the decades-earlier examination of the many ways in which we can take care of how every child matters.</p>
<p>An attempt to reflect the breadth of thinking uses the imagery of buoyancy (Bill Law, 2014). &nbsp;It lists what is needed to stay afloat, as a precondition for navigating the surge. &nbsp;It also lists what is less frequently mentioned by others - critical thinking.&nbsp; Critical thinking is what students do to retain informed control of their own lives.&nbsp; It is how they question, interrogate and scrutinise - separating the credible from the merely plausible.</p>
<p>It's prominent in the LiRRiC proposals. &nbsp;Examples of how it can work are set out in <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">career-learning thinking</a> (Bill Law, 2010).&nbsp; It calls on what the best of educators do best. &nbsp;It enables students for engaging with the 'honesty, authenticity and modesty' which business partners claim.&nbsp; There are here the makings of a three-way partnership - giving voice to students and their families, educators and their managers, and business partners and their shareholders. &nbsp;They are all stakeholders in any partnership. &nbsp;(But let's not go into why some interests are wary of critical thinking which is capable of asking awkward questions.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critical questioning does not assume that commercial conduct is self-interested, only that some might be.&nbsp; Not that careers-work leadership is blind, only that it miscalculated risk.&nbsp; Not that all educators are ready or willing, only that enough are. &nbsp;Not that selection is corrupt, only that curriculum can be reduced to a selection process.&nbsp; Not that all fit-and-match thinking is pointless, only that it is not the whole point. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Partnership needs no heroes or villains, it needs a grasp of the causes and effects which can inform shared action. &nbsp;And so the conversation begins; and the essence of conversation is that change-of-mind is possible.&nbsp; There's no last word on education.</p>

<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western"><em>I was the learning designer</em></h2>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Situation</h2>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>I was commissioned to build a sequence of 5 elearning modules for a specialist Oil and Gas inspection community. There were international contributors in the US and in the middle East as well as the slightly closer to home contributor in Hamilton, Scotland.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Interestingly, the design was not explicit at the design phase &ndash; which was reflected late on in the programme when there was a significant interface re-design.... </em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>The tension between Hamilton (subject matter expert) and Houston (holding the purse strings) was noted at the first conference call where each clearly thought the other was an idiot. The intended audience was experienced technicians and engineers with deep specialist knowledge of detailed tests and measurement principles (hardness testing, tolerances and materials analysis) but with limited exposure to the Oil and Gas Industry.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Task</h2>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Develop 5 discrete modules as a single deployable eLearning element via an archaic LMS to provide an introduction to key components, supporting paperwork and reporting responsibilities for the benefit of junior inspection engineers.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Success would be judged by acceptance from a team of subject matter experts (both eLearning specialists and Oil and Gas Inspection Engineers).</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Actions</h2>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Develop an outline narrative for module 1 and produce an Alpha release for sign off by the subject matter expert. I expected feedback from the SME group to agree / submit corrections regarding interface, colour palette and content delivery style.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Not a lot happened &ndash; after a week a short email was received from Hamilton to say 'yes that looks fine'.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Develop modules 2 to 4 to the same style and standard, submitting each module for SME review. Content was not mature so an unexpectedly long time was spent to-ing and fro-ing with Internet searches and SME questioning to ensure content was correct before submission.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Module 5 &ndash; essentially a scenario in which an inspector must trace paperwork requirements against industry standards to describe what tests will be conducted and what reporting must be made. Reports to be submitted for external moderation by SME group. A module of considerable complexity but which ensured the user was tested in the synthesis of information from modules 1-4 as well as genuine examination and interaction with international standards documents to identify the types of test and report required for each item described.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Beta review &ndash; passed without comment.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Results</h2>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Once the Beta was produced, I was expecting some minor amends to result in Gold edition publication and for Gold to be accepted with little or no comment. What actually happened is that the SME group rejected the product on the basis of a non-approved interface.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>However, (at a cost) the interface was amended, SME group passed product at second time of asking and the training released into a waiting world. </em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Feedback is very positive. Users are complimentary and success rates for Module 5 are approximately as anticipated (around 65% at first attempt &ndash; climbing to 100% after revision and re-submission). </em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Objectives met at the second time of asking.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Asked to produce two more modules for the company.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Reflections</h2>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Don't begin development until the content is all brigaded and understood. Three months in we were still battling with SME's to sign off on content in the narratives produced in week 2....</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Ensure you have a single point of content. The failure to appropriately agree the design was the result of 'too many cooks' and no-one being quite sure who was authorised to sign off.</em></p>

              <title>policy, politics - and show-biz</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8544</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8544</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is an extract from a call for urgent action on <a title="part two" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8528" target="_blank">the politics of education</a>. &nbsp;It says that it's shock that stokes the energy needed to reclaim curriculum.&nbsp; Shock can live dangerously enough to step outside the shallow and narrow manipulation of opinion.&nbsp; It's small-mindedness that puts the future of education at greatest risk. &nbsp;And its big thinking that will bang on the doors of show-biz politicians.</p>
<p>The starting point is that the UK electorate mistrusts politicians - some hold them in contempt.&nbsp; Politicians may not deserve this; but surveys vary only on the extent to which they show it. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s easy enough to find politicos doing nothing more impressive than angling for power. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;d be surprised if you&rsquo;ve not also noticed some trying to get something worthwhile done. &nbsp;And then we have the razzle-dazzle-&lsquo;em performers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe we should be thinking of politicos in three groups: politicians, policy makers and performers?:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electioneering politicians</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serious policy makers</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show-biz performers.</p>
<p>But is every politico only one these?&nbsp; Surely they move there-and-back across a range of standpoints?&nbsp; That movement would make each position an episode in a story, rather than a category on a list. &nbsp;Mind you, some politicos don&rsquo;t move their standpoints very much.</p>
<p>Much of politics deserves to be dismissed.&nbsp; But the serious stuff is where policy makers genuinely try to do something worthwhile with education. &nbsp;And they deserve respect. &nbsp;They also deserve to be interrogated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take, for example, policies to &lsquo;raise aspiration&rsquo;. &nbsp;And who could be against that?&nbsp; But, before the cheering starts, let's ask the questions. &nbsp;Are we rooting for aspirations to be a good out-of-work dad?&nbsp; &nbsp;Do we favour aspirations to quit work and end that stress?&nbsp; Suppose it were an aspiration to oppose the economic growth that damages the planet and ruins the neighbourhood? &nbsp;And, even if any of these get a political cheer, who would make sure that the neglected poor are in on this aspiration thing? &nbsp;A politican can win applause for a claim to &lsquo;justice available to all&rsquo;. &nbsp;But there&rsquo;s enough argy-bargy among the sources cited here to show that &lsquo;justice&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean what you think it means.&nbsp; Neither does &lsquo;available&lsquo;.&nbsp; Nor does &lsquo;all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Policy for aspiration is about people&rsquo;s chances in life - far too important to be left to politics, and certainly not to show-bizz. &nbsp;It's not a lot of laughs, not in Sunderland, anyway. &nbsp;So, if anything can help Alice in Sunderland it will be policy&nbsp;interrogation&nbsp;- acting in whose interests? - heeding which voices? - driven by what stakeholders?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<em>Prospect Magazine</em>&nbsp;monograph,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/free-download-poverty-in-the-uk/">Poverty in the UK</a>, makes a good start on policy.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t know how its seventy pages could have packed in more disagreement about what it should be.&nbsp; Never a dull moment.</p>
<p>And, of course, things changed before&nbsp;<em>Prospect&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;ink had dried.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s out-of-date on bishops, popes and action in the name of religion.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t caught up with what&rsquo;s happening on wages, debt, predators, and economic myths. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s behind the curve on the philosophy of &lsquo;what's fact?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what's knowledge?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;what's valuable?&rsquo;. &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s longer on opinion than on evidence.</p>
<p>But it bumps into all the influences on Alice&rsquo;s life chances.&nbsp; And it surprised and provoked me into trying to get the argument for progressive education into something like a narrative form.&nbsp; A narrative needs a starting point leading to a turning point.&nbsp; Does this?</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; fast-growing technologies mean that unfettered growth is damaging the planet &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; those technologies are also strengthening commerce and weakening government  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; and they&rsquo;re bringing both help and harm to people&rsquo;s personal and social well-being</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; so people can think for themselves about what they believe, value and expect &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the thinking is located in communities that become strangers to each other &nbsp;</p>
<p>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which means that each community makes a different demand on education</p>
<p>... &nbsp; &nbsp;no resolution of this is inevitable it persists with consent and withdrawn consent changes everything&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a narrative if it sets out one thing leading to another. &nbsp;It's like a journey, moving on from the starting point and coming across the turning points. &nbsp;A turning point often surprises and sometimes shocks. &nbsp;And either can lead to unanticipated change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are surprises coming to educational professionals - especially if they are so convinced of their righteousness that they've waited for politicians to ride to their rescue. &nbsp;But they've been&nbsp;stood up, so should they withdraw consent? &nbsp;The planet has enough examples of withdrawn consent for people to wonder whether the days of national politics are numbered. &nbsp;Some of the people are brits. &nbsp;And some of those are students</p>
<p>Could it be a turning point for 'provoking the imagination and realising new possibilities'? &nbsp;And how crazy is it to wonder that, if educationist can't rely on national government, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea to look around for what might be more reliable?</p>
<p>This blog&rsquo;s evidence show that a national government stability depends on inclusive and responsive institutions.&nbsp; It documents policy which excludes open institutions. &nbsp;It quotes&nbsp;global commerce's&nbsp;unresponsive scripts for education. &nbsp;There are, of course, denials; but the evidence is that commerce is moving in on education and policy is not obstructing it.</p>
<p>And so the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) is sticking its neck out. &nbsp;It wants national governments to back off. &nbsp;National governments are too big to grasp locally variable experience, and too small to protect that experience from globally-generated damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSA looks instead to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal">The Power of Cities</a>&nbsp; (journal #3).&nbsp; For a start, it requires us to rise above the show-biz clowns in charge of some of our cities.&nbsp; The more important reality is that around half the world&rsquo;s population is living in metropolitan areas.&nbsp; Sunderland is among them.&nbsp; And the numbers are increasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cities people need to learn to live with all kinds of others. &nbsp;They are close enough to the action for people to know what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;And cities are big enough for them to find more than one way of dealing with things. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why RSA-chief Matthew Taylor (p.5) recognises cities as a promising new setting for designing education policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are significant advantages. &nbsp;A city can develop a network of local stakeholder organisations, reaching to all its neighbourhoods, outlying villages and other settlements. &nbsp;Few locations are entirely out of urban reach. &nbsp;Those that are choose to be.</p>
<p>Political scientists (pp.20ff) find four upsides. &nbsp;Cities have: (1) a wide-enough range of sources to draw upon; (2) a great-enough range of ideas to engage with; (3) a willingness to let go of what no longer works; and (4) an ability to re-integrate the insights that large-scale clumsiness has fragmented. &nbsp;They&nbsp;see cities as thriving on that scope and complexity rather than relying on the bogus persuasiveness of the narrow and shallow.</p>
<p>There are exceptions but, world-wide, cities are gathering approving coverage. &nbsp;The records show that they can act quickly on dealing with the consequences of global warming. &nbsp;They are well placed to undermine trafficking in flesh and drugs.&nbsp; They are moving into locally-relevant crime-control measures, traffic-management schemes and health-and-safety programmes. &nbsp;And no policy needs this combination of local responsiveness and wide-ranging scope than a policy for education.</p>
<p>And cities do not need to be dependent on commercial and government funding; indeed, they really need to be looking elsewhere.&nbsp; Economists (pp.10ff) have tracked city-based capacity for gaining alternative funding with fewer strings attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also business-world voices (pp.32ff) that can see how such trends are usefully getting organised independently of commerce and state.&nbsp; They are seen to be fostering change that is owned by communities and is developed on a human scale. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Metropolitan smarts seem to hold out a hope of dumping national politicking and outflanking global power. &nbsp;But Matthew Taylor advises the hopeful not to hold their breath: it&rsquo;s going to take time. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s right: there are logistical issues for anchoring civil society to metropolitan areas; market players try to eliminate competition not encourage it; and transatlantic trade agreements already protect them. &nbsp;Matthew Taylor is talking about policy, and policy takes time to be realised. &nbsp;It will need persistent stakeholder action to neutralise shareholder guile.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a long haul. &nbsp;It won&rsquo;t be completed in a parliament - I doubt in my lifetime.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m betting it will happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a narrative that is relatively easy to talk about.&nbsp; And a backstory that is not. &nbsp;Education needs the bigger story...</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; civil society is bigger than the big society  because it gets organised for coordinated action</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stakeholder&rsquo;s interests are wider than shareholder&rsquo;s  because they work with the people whose lives are affected</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; citizen voice is bigger that consumer demand  because it knows how a local past, present and future belongs to local people</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conversation is bigger than commissioned consultancy  because it voices both expertise and experience&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning for action is bigger than winning an argument  because it understands the narrative in order to change it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the backstory. &nbsp;It makes the promise possible. &nbsp;The evidence is that without informed resistance to the hegemonic power that it reveals there can be no progressive education. &nbsp;It shows that the resulting promise can be kept with or without national government support. &nbsp;It believes that nothing is inevitable and that withdrawn consent can change everything.&nbsp; It holds to the stakeholder interests and voice that can make change happen.&nbsp; And it insists that education is community property and must be returned to its owners.</p>
<p>Alice will believe none of this unless her educators do.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Bill Law<br /></strong> <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p><strong>on causes-and-effects</strong></p>
<p>Political influences have been famously characterised by a UK prime minister as &lsquo;events, dear boy, events&rsquo;.&nbsp; He also confessed that politics are &lsquo;the art of the possible&rsquo;. &nbsp;His remarks display a genteel modesty about power.&nbsp; It was long ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The political management of events and possibilities has since been seriously weakened.&nbsp; This account shows how increasingly powerful and globally-situated commercial interests besiege domestic politics.&nbsp; Part of the political response is to concede to those interests, and some of these concessions relate to education. &nbsp;But there are conflicts of interest and frustrations of intention embedded in all of this.&nbsp; The politics of all colours sometimes seem to call less on genteel modesty than on futile desperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet government needs to be able plausibly to declare that it can make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives. &nbsp;And so where it finds itself a global loser, it looks for domestic wins. &nbsp;The bigger reality is that issues for contemporary society reach from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; But plausible politics contains attention, keeping it close to home. &nbsp;And education is close to everybody&rsquo;s home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the evidence here is that education is close to home in a sense that central governments are in no position to manage.&nbsp; The dynamics&nbsp;found here&nbsp;of how people learn are precarious, complex and local.&nbsp; Their causes and effects play out differently in different neighbourhoods. &nbsp;Central claims to educational solutions can be made to sound plausible, but this evidence shows them rarely to be credible.</p>
<p>Central directives cannot accommodate local variability. &nbsp;Claims to be acting in everybody's interest do not stand up. &nbsp;This section includes evidence that what is proposed for education-for-all actually works well in some localities, but is demonstrably damaging in others.</p>
<p>Government needs a narrative for education. &nbsp;But it's the backstories, reaching wider and probing deeper, that point to hope. &nbsp;They lift education above government press releases of the narrow, the shallow and the easier to take on board. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The politically neglected particularly need the backstory if their needs are to be understood. &nbsp;And there are out-of-power and opportunistic politicians claiming to understand those neglected interest. &nbsp;The political landscape is being reshaped.</p>
<p>It would be understandable were preoccupied educators to overlook it. &nbsp;But it would be a mistake. &nbsp;Prevailing political narratives shape the future of education in the interest of the constituencies they serve. &nbsp;The backstories are essential to an understanding of how any of those futures will play out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This section revisits the art of the possible and its events, searching among backstories for leads on progressive action. &nbsp;There's no shortage of troublesome news here. &nbsp;The challenge is to make good use of bad news. &nbsp;The section searches for what educators need to understand in order to set up credible causes of needed effects which ignite realisable hope.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; causes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/freedom-for-sale-by-john-kampfner-1784894.html">Freedom for Sale</a> - think-tank based analysis, illustrating how world-wide global corporations gain control of national governments - it describes how weakened governments pump up domestic anxieties, notably concerning health and education - their promises of liberation camouflage the realities of a global capture of governments, and the services they commission</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators working with students and stakeholders need a voice speaking deeply and widely enough to tell of global pressure in terms of local needs</p>
<p><a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Restating_the_State.html?id=mbHpaptI7CwC&redir_esc=y">Restating the State</a> - collection of articles by politically-sophisticated authors, showing that repeated attempts to reduce the size of the state have failed - this is a failure of both the political right and left - the failure includes various attempts to reduce the costs of education - the collection examines the state&rsquo;s weak relationship with market forces, but concedes the relationship as necessary - however it also argues that a sustainable future needs a clear idea of what makes a public good - that means reconciling public ownership with individual rights, a renewed sense of citizenship, and a commitment to personal-and-social well being - the articles assume that solutions will be found in the generalised processes of national politics, it therefore speaks in largely abstract terms</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->education stakeholder groups are not political abstractions but&nbsp;organisers of informed&nbsp;action&nbsp;that is&nbsp;concrete, operational and locally-recognisable</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6344672">Is PISA flawed?</a> - education journalist&rsquo;s report on doubts about the international politics of education - the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has world-wide influence on the politics of education - but statisticians claim that its methodology is misleading - its host, the Organisation for Economic and Cultural development (OECD), shows more interest in setting out clear results for besieged politicians than in disentangling the complexities of education&rsquo;s causes and effects</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders can work on research data in conversation with the people in all education institutions who understand research methods</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/11/why-nations-fail-acemoglu-robinson-review">Why Nations Fail</a> - journalist&rsquo;s review of a world-wide academic explanation of why national survival depends on what kind of political institutions they set up - it characterises some political institutions as &lsquo;extractive&rsquo; because they exclude from benefit all but the few, that is themselves and their closest supporters - the explanation contrasts these with &lsquo;inclusive&rsquo; institutions, which distribute the benefits of action to the many, that is most or all of their citizens - the explanation also shows how history documents the prevalence of these competing orientations - and it shows how, over time, control of technology and science have change the balance of power in favour of exclusion - that trend is discrediting politics, undermining governments and causing political collapse</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders groups need to include both reliable expertise and authentic experience in education if they are to neutralise politicised exclusion&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/29/europe-british-politicians-stand-up-anti-eu-populism">Beware this populism sweeping across Europe</a> - journalist&rsquo;s review of professor of politics&rsquo; account of populism in politics - following the explanation of &lsquo;Why Nations Fail&rsquo;, it argues that institutions once set up for informed debate are being invaded by the political stoking of emotional heat - the resulting intentions are contained inside a narrow scope, where easy conclusions can be reached from short statements - the tactic often invites anxiety, provocation and blame - a consequences is that the extent and complexity of conflicted political realities are overlooked - the overall argument points to the dangers to democracy in seeking only for political advantage - such politics lacks the courage of leadership which brings people to where they can claim citizenship, grasp realities, find social membership, and value education</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders are at the crossroad between popular-and-plausible and informed-and-authentic but will readily recognise which way is forward</p>
<p><a href="http://www.compassonline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/COMJ501-Elephants-in-the-room-WEB.pdf">&lsquo;...where does political vitality come from?...&rsquo;</a> - collection of short articles each outlining an unresolved issue for the future of education - it examines the shifting relationships between what is happening in welfare, identity, immigration, human rights, liberty, economy and ecology - each brings changing, complicated, uncomfortable and yet vital consequences into people&rsquo;s lives - dealing with such big issues must therefore be thought of not as a destination but as a journey - and education must be a part of learning to navigate that journey</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->students with their educators and other stakeholders need a shared conversation to get big issues ready for local action</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Schumpeter.html">Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</a> - scholarly definition of the neo-lib theory which is increasingly embraced by national governments - it argues for &lsquo;creative destruction&rsquo; which allows businesses that are not growing to collapse, so that they can be replaced by enterprises seeking growth - but neo-lib thinking ignores the many ways in which a settled business can be valued by&nbsp;its community - and so its thinking demands that effective local education must be scaled up, so it become more generally and commercially marketable - but this the right-wing hijacking of a left-wing theory - creative destruction was&nbsp;first&nbsp;designed to reinvigorate useful local businesses - and that is what neo-lib economics fails to do</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->local education means by definition not to be scaled-up and its stakeholders are there to invigorate what is at its best scaled-down&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/09/labour-unite">&lsquo;...Unions aren&rsquo;t influential enough...&rsquo;</a> - economic commentator&rsquo;s argument that the voice of working people has been suppressed by a closed circle of corporate power and political establishment - the argument is that experience of work-life, and the agencies that support it, are not represented in the UK parliament - nor in any other fairly-reported part of public life</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->progressive educators are close to worker representation&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;where both are committed to people&rsquo;s fulfillment and well-being&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jul/24/charities-voluntary-sector-five-years-existence">&lsquo;...we&rsquo;ve got five years left...&rsquo;</a> - journalist&rsquo;s report of think-tank research into the future viability of &lsquo;third-sector&rsquo; charities and volunteering - the research is illustrated by anecdotal reports on what active members of society think of government appeals to &lsquo;the big society&rsquo; - those appeals are for the third sector to meet the demands that first-sector policy and second-sector commerce cannot or will not supply - this is neo-lib thinking, supportive of private-sector commerce and committed to reducing public-sector spending - but community-based educators are part of the third-sector and, as charitable or voluntary outfits, they are not commercially motivated - neither do they see themselves as agencies of the state - the title of the report reflects widespread pessimism concerning the future of genuinely charitable and voluntary helping agencies</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators and their stakeholders need to be able to call on locally-rooted third-sector outfits for their hands-on understanding of local needs&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2013/05/britain-can-prosper-understanding-how-germany-succeeds">&lsquo;...We need to rediscover the need for each other...&rsquo;</a> - professorial account of how governments can reconcile the uses of capital with the dignity of labour - it sets out thinking successfully applied in post-war Germany and originated with the help of a left-of-centre UK government - it asserts the mutual dependence of management and labour - their shared institutions continuously review and creatively replace how things are done - the account shows how management acts in agreement with labour - neo-lib economics, which is concerned only with what can be monetised, has no way of understanding such solidarity - Germany&rsquo;s difference from the UK is said to be its unwillingness to value everything only in terms of profit, whether in firms, in banks and even (by some accounts) in football clubs - that unwillingness can also be found among its educators</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->there can be no unthinking importation of culture but local stakeholders can outflank shallow and narrow thinking by finding like-minded thinking abroad</p>
<p><a href="http://www.conlaw.org/Intergenerational-II-2.htm">&lsquo;...the stewardship doctrine...&rsquo;</a> - legal account, well-linked to its sources, of the different ways that citizenship can be framed - it sets out a disagreement, deeply rooted in UK history, and having consequences for how a society educates its people - the questions are 'do we prioritise the rights of the living individual?', as does radical left-wing support for revolution - or 'have we wider commitments embraced by right-wing politics?', where membership of society is a contract with those who have gone before, those who are living now, and those who are yet to be born?</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators and their stakeholder need no cut-and-dried politics of left or right but a left-right conversation can map scope for imaginative learning</p>

<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; voices</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7207.html?wknews=05152013">&lsquo;...servant leadership...&rsquo;</a> - long-overdue business-world acknowledgement that leadership is to improve the lot of &lsquo;followers&rsquo;, not the status of &lsquo;leaders&rsquo; - it is fashionable to attribute outstanding qualities to leaders, though there is little evidence in education to support that claim &ndash; this is plea for others to be heard and heeded</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholder voice means that useful, valued and often informal leadership can be found at all hierarchical levels in education</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6343932">&lsquo;...a union for school students...&rsquo;</a> - education journalist&rsquo;s account of how students are engaging with the politics of education - there are proposals to catch up with an international trend to unionise UK secondary school students - it will form a partnership with higher education&rsquo;s National Union of Students - worker representation is a third-sector activity and part of civil society - this is a proposal for solidarity</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->students are educators&rsquo; prime stakeholders and links with their unions strengthens a shared voice for well-being and fulfillment&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.teachers.org.uk/campaigns/curriculum">&lsquo;...curriculum concerns contact...&rsquo;</a> - website, run by a teachers&rsquo; union, carrying a day-by-day social commentary for educators - visitors share information, voice concerns, compare perspectives, canvass for improvements and petition for change - the teachers&rsquo; union hosting means that the commentaries refer to professional interests - but the internet has other links drawing on research, notably the <a href="http://www.localschoolsnetwork.org.uk/about-us/">Local Schools Network</a></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholder groups gain from links to on-line education commentaries which are important channels for educator voice&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/13/sweden-social-democrats-stefan-lofven">&lsquo;...bringing the left in from the cold...'</a> - journalist&rsquo;s report of how a social-democrat movement is working with trade unions and employers - the group also has links to left-of-centre politics - the initiative is characterised as part of an international trend to restore working people&rsquo;s voice in the pursuit of human rights - these concerns link work rights with rights to education</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholder voices are stronger where they are in concert with assonant voices from elsewhere</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/30/workers-role-global-middle-class-revolutions">&lsquo;...workers role in &ldquo;middle-class&rdquo; revolutions...&rsquo;</a> - journalist&rsquo;s survey of growing international resistance to political and commercial exploitation of working people - it describes the way working people are taking initiatives which would formerly have been pursued by middle-class people trying to act in their interests - claiming the right to education is part of the process</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->comparing one culture&rsquo;s stakeholding with another's is useful because &lsquo;who knows England who only England knows&rsquo;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>on results</strong></p>
<p>Why are arguments about politics, once started, so hard to stop? &nbsp; It's not hard to see why some people get started - they're looking for the point.&nbsp; But it's not always easy to find. &nbsp;And even harder to agree what it should be.</p>
<p>Much depends on what sort of results people want to see. &nbsp;Are they a return on investment?&nbsp; Is that the tax we pay?&nbsp; Should we be getting at least as much out as we put in? &nbsp;Suppose it's more like a fee? &nbsp;Would that be like an admission charge for membership of society? &nbsp;Suppose some people can't afford it? &nbsp;Could the payoff be held in common ownership? &nbsp;Would we then let people draw on it just because they need it? &nbsp;How would we know?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And why would anyone see it one way and dismiss all others?&nbsp; Is it because, as a species, we each protect our own's best chances to survive and flourish? &nbsp;Do we extend that protection to people we like? &nbsp;And who are like us? &nbsp;They and their children? &nbsp;People we've never met.&nbsp; Other people&rsquo;s children? &nbsp;Is this getting out of hand?</p>
<p>And where do we find these people? &nbsp;Citizens on the street? &nbsp;Workers in the economy ?&nbsp; Claimants on benefits? &nbsp;Grandparents in care. &nbsp;Immigrants at the airport? &nbsp;Subjects of the queen? &nbsp;Should different roles have different rules?</p>
<p>Such talk is full of contradiction, complexity and confusion.&nbsp; Never let anybody tell you &lsquo;it&rsquo;s as simple as that!&rsquo; - they don&rsquo;t know that they don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;I suppose that's why it&rsquo;s hard to bring a political argument to an end - there&rsquo;s too much to disentangle, much of it irreconcilable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This material finds why it is that claim the political high ground. &nbsp;It also finds what kind of evidence points to that claim being a fact, or an opinion, or a lie. &nbsp;The argument here is that there is no more important task for educators than enabling that critical thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evidence stems from three question to be put to any education programme:&nbsp;</p>
<ol><ol><ol>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->interests</strong> does it serve?&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->voices</strong> should it heed? &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what can <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders</strong>&nbsp;do about it?</li>
</ol></ol></ol>
<p>The questions locate education policy where it can be done with or without the support of party politics.&nbsp; Education policy has no need to be tied to a party, but it does need to be established as a movement. &nbsp;That means taking a stand on pressures and priorities. &nbsp;Which means looking wider and deeper than where party politics is prepared to go. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outcomes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jun/30/population-growth-wipe-out-life-earth">&lsquo;Humans are the real threat&rsquo;</a> - statistical mathematician&rsquo;s estimates of what he takes to be the most pressing priorities for government action - he calculates the probabilities that what any organisation can do about anything will be curtailed most by its damaging impact on the biosphere and the diminishing availability of resources&nbsp;- in a range of issues for education, stretching from the personal to the planetary, there is no more basic voice for policy than that&nbsp;- it makes the neo-lib pursuit of unlimited growth non-viable - educators, acting independently of the interests of commerce and government, can develop informed, authentic and constructive ways of enabling students to work on these base-line realities</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators and their stakeholders can see unrestrained growth as an issue for the well-being of students&rsquo; and for the children they have and will have&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/9365">&lsquo;...Rescuing the enlightenment...&rsquo;</a> - review of a free-thinking publication, arguing that there can be no idea more significant for education than &lsquo;enlightenment&rsquo; - it originates in the politics of resisting control by crown and mitre - it values well-being and fulfillment above obedience and salvation - it is contentious, arguing that the right to independence can be curtailed by the powerful - and also that control is as much asserted by background and culture as by nation and state - wherever it focuses, the thinking is rejected by some who see it as an instrument of western intellectual imperialism - but enlightenment offers no guarantee of either truth or progress, it thrives on argument - and similar stands have, in both medieval North Africa and in modern Europe, made educational progress possible - the enlightenment&rsquo;s part in education would be to engage students in the value of critical thinking concerning control by political power, by religious belief or by monetary wealth - and it would enable students to act on that independence</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->there&rsquo;s no escape from competing claims on education so its stakeholders need to know where to take a stand</p>
<p><a href="http://helenaroy.wordpress.com/2012/10/27/review-justice-whats-the-right-thing-to-do-by-michael-sandel/">Justice - What&rsquo;s the Right Thing to Do</a> - commentator&rsquo;s review of an ethics publication arguing that values are what a society says they are - this may be because they are convenient to some dominant interest - but it may also be because they accord with what most people can recognise as, in some sense, &lsquo;good&rsquo; - goodness can attach to a handed-down belief about what is honorable, virtuous or safe - it can move into the protection of a person&rsquo;s right to act on behalf of self and those close to self, the self responsibly accepting the consequences of the resulting action - but values can move farther into the justice of protecting people&rsquo;s well-being, not because they are thought of as deserving or responsible but because they belong to a shared humanity - an outcome of education is, then, the enablement of students to take a defensible position, while offering the same respect for others as they would argue for themselves - there is no greater demand on imagination than picturing what you would wish from a society if you did not yet know where, with what, and to whom you will be born - and there are few issues which call more widely or deeply on what a good education should promise</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators and their stakeholders are part of a civil society independently voicing the values and interests of people engaging with living together</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/19/richard-hoggart-virtue-and-reward-review">Virtue and Reward</a> - journalist&rsquo;s review of a scholarly reappraisal of &lsquo;The Uses of Literacy&rsquo; - it is a book setting out learning as enabling &lsquo;working-class&rsquo; people usefully to examine critical issues - the learning does not lead to ready-made answers, nor is it materialistic, and it is worked out with others in a community, sharing a culture - the re-appraisal contrasts then with now - in contemporary cultures literacy is found to be for asserting opinion, urging &lsquo;have your say&rsquo;, &lsquo;get your message across&rsquo; and &lsquo;win attention&rsquo; - there is less interest in what &lsquo;The Uses of Literacy&rsquo; takes to be &lsquo;respectable&rsquo; or &lsquo;responsible&rsquo; thinking - and, it&rsquo;s true, such old-fashioned talk is now unlikely to impress - it should, however, be possible to ask that learning is &lsquo;informed&rsquo; and &lsquo;thought-through&rsquo;, and to hope that learning can enable people for reflective as well as assertive conversations - such a society would then be equipped to undermine what is shallow and narrow - and learning would enable people to change their minds - the review raises political issues, including the effects of close links between the US and UK - but the reappraisal doubts that the politics of education can do much about any of this - yet government needs to know how lost reflectiveness and contemporary assertiveness is reshaping what&rsquo;s left of progressive policy - the reflective uses of literacy were never more needed - and, if government can&rsquo;t see that, education&rsquo;s stakeholders can</p>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>policy, politics - and show-biz &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This final section is allowing itself to be surprised by events that 'provoke the imagining and realisation of new possibilities'.&nbsp; That shock lives dangerously, by stepping outside the shallow and narrow. &nbsp;The assumption here is that it's small-mindedness which poses the bigger risk.</p>
<p>The starting point is that the UK electorate mistrusts politicians - some hold them in contempt.&nbsp; Politicians may not deserve this; but surveys vary only on the extent to which they show it. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s easy enough to find politicos doing nothing more impressive than angling for power. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;d be surprised if you&rsquo;ve not also noticed some trying to get something worthwhile done. &nbsp;And then we have the razzle-dazzle-&lsquo;em performers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe we should be thinking of politicos in three groups: politicians, policy makers and performers?:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electioneering politicians</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serious policy makers</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show-biz performers.</p>
<p>But is every politico only one these?&nbsp; Surely they move there-and-back across a range of standpoints?&nbsp; That movement would make each position an episode in a story, rather than a category on a list. &nbsp;Mind you, some politicos don&rsquo;t move their standpoints very much.</p>
<p>Much of politics deserves to be dismissed.&nbsp; But the serious stuff is where policy makers genuinely try to do something worthwhile with education. &nbsp;And they deserve respect. &nbsp;They also deserve to be interrogated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take, for example, policies to &lsquo;raise aspiration&rsquo;. &nbsp;And who could be against that?&nbsp; But, before the cheering starts, let's ask the questions. &nbsp;Are we rooting for aspirations to be a good out-of-work dad?&nbsp; &nbsp;Do we favour aspirations to quit work and end that stress?&nbsp; Suppose it were an aspiration to oppose the economic growth that damages the planet and ruins the neighbourhood? &nbsp;And, even if any of these get a political cheer, who would make sure that the neglected poor are in on this aspiration thing? &nbsp;A politican can win applause for a claim to &lsquo;justice available to all&rsquo;. &nbsp;But there&rsquo;s enough argy-bargy among the sources cited here to show that &lsquo;justice&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean what you think it means.&nbsp; Neither does &lsquo;available&lsquo;.&nbsp; Nor does &lsquo;all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Policy for aspiration is about people&rsquo;s chances in life - far too important to be left to politics, and certainly not to show-bizz. &nbsp;It's not a lot of laughs, not in Sunderland, anyway. &nbsp;So, if anything can help Alice in Sunderland it will be policy&nbsp;interrogation&nbsp;- acting in whose interests? - heeding which voices? - driven by what stakeholders?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <em>Prospect Magazine</em> monograph, <a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/free-download-poverty-in-the-uk/">Poverty in the UK</a>, makes a good start on policy.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t know how its seventy pages could have packed in more disagreement about what it should be.&nbsp; Never a dull moment.</p>
<p>And, of course, things changed before <em>Prospect&rsquo;s</em> ink had dried.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s out-of-date on bishops, popes and action in the name of religion.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t caught up with what&rsquo;s happening on wages, debt, predators, and economic myths. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s behind the curve on the philosophy of &lsquo;what's fact?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what's knowledge?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;what's valuable?&rsquo;. &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s longer on opinion than on evidence.</p>
<p>But it bumps into all the influences on Alice&rsquo;s life chances.&nbsp; And it surprised and provoked me into trying to get the argument for progressive education into something like a narrative form.&nbsp; A narrative needs a starting point leading to a turning point.&nbsp; Does this?</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; fast-growing technologies mean that unfettered growth is damaging the planet &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; those technologies are also strengthening commerce and weakening government  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; and they&rsquo;re bringing both help and harm to people&rsquo;s personal and social well-being</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; so people can think for themselves about what they believe, value and expect &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the thinking is located in communities that become strangers to each other &nbsp;</p>
<p>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which means that each community makes a different demand on education</p>
<p>... &nbsp; &nbsp;no resolution of this is inevitable it persists with consent and withdrawn consent changes everything&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a narrative if it sets out one thing leading to another. &nbsp;It's like a journey, moving on from the starting point and coming across the turning points. &nbsp;A turning point often surprises and sometimes shocks. &nbsp;And either can lead to unanticipated change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are surprises coming to educational professionals - especially if they are so convinced of their righteousness that they've waited for politicians to ride to their rescue. &nbsp;But they've been&nbsp;stood up, so should they withdraw consent? &nbsp;The planet has enough examples of withdrawn consent for people to wonder whether the days of national politics are numbered. &nbsp;Some of the people are brits. &nbsp;And some of those are students</p>
<p>Could it be a turning point for 'provoking the imagination and realising new possibilities'? &nbsp;And how crazy is it to wonder that, if educationist can't rely on national government, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea to look around for what might be more reliable?</p>
<p>This blog&rsquo;s evidence show that a national government stability depends on inclusive and responsive institutions.&nbsp; It documents policy which excludes open institutions. &nbsp;It quotes&nbsp;global commerce's&nbsp;unresponsive scripts for education. &nbsp;There are, of course, denials; but the evidence is that commerce is moving in on education and policy is not obstructing it.</p>
<p>And so the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) is sticking its neck out. &nbsp;It wants national governments to back off. &nbsp;National governments are too big to grasp locally variable experience, and too small to protect that experience from globally-generated damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSA looks instead to <a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal">The Power of Cities</a>&nbsp; (journal #3).&nbsp; For a start, it requires us to rise above the show-biz clowns in charge of some of our cities.&nbsp; The more important reality is that around half the world&rsquo;s population is living in metropolitan areas.&nbsp; Sunderland is among them.&nbsp; And the numbers are increasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cities people need to learn to live with all kinds of others. &nbsp;They are close enough to the action for people to know what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;And cities are big enough for them to find more than one way of dealing with things. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why RSA-chief Matthew Taylor (p.5) recognises cities as a promising new setting for designing education policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are significant advantages. &nbsp;A city can develop a network of local stakeholder organisations, reaching to all its neighbourhoods, outlying villages and other settlements. &nbsp;Few locations are entirely out of urban reach. &nbsp;Those that are choose to be.</p>
<p>Political scientists (pp.20ff) find four upsides. &nbsp;Cities have: (1) a wide-enough range of sources to draw upon; (2) a great-enough range of ideas to engage with; (3) a willingness to let go of what no longer works; and (4) an ability to re-integrate the insights that large-scale clumsiness has fragmented. &nbsp;They&nbsp;see cities as thriving on that scope and complexity rather than relying on the bogus persuasiveness of the narrow and shallow.</p>
<p>There are exceptions but, world-wide, cities are gathering approving coverage. &nbsp;The records show that they can act quickly on dealing with the consequences of global warming. &nbsp;They are well placed to undermine trafficking in flesh and drugs.&nbsp; They are moving into locally-relevant crime-control measures, traffic-management schemes and health-and-safety programmes. &nbsp;And no policy needs this combination of local responsiveness and wide-ranging scope than a policy for education.</p>
<p>And cities do not need to be dependent on commercial and government funding; indeed, they really need to be looking elsewhere.&nbsp; Economists (pp.10ff) have tracked city-based capacity for gaining alternative funding with fewer strings attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also business-world voices (pp.32ff) that can see how such trends are usefully getting organised independently of commerce and state.&nbsp; They are seen to be fostering change that is owned by communities and is developed on a human scale. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Metropolitan smarts seem to hold out a hope of dumping national politicking and outflanking global power. &nbsp;But Matthew Taylor advises the hopeful not to hold their breath: it&rsquo;s going to take time. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s right: there are logistical issues for anchoring civil society to metropolitan areas; market players try to eliminate competition not encourage it; and transatlantic trade agreements already protect them. &nbsp;Matthew Taylor is talking about policy, and policy takes time to be realised. &nbsp;It will need persistent stakeholder action to neutralise shareholder guile.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a long haul. &nbsp;It won&rsquo;t be completed in a parliament - I doubt in my lifetime.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m betting it will happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a narrative that is relatively easy to talk about.&nbsp; And a backstory that is not. &nbsp;Education needs the bigger story...</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; civil society is bigger than the big society  because it gets organised for coordinated action</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stakeholder&rsquo;s interests are wider than shareholder&rsquo;s  because they work with the people whose lives are affected</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; citizen voice is bigger that consumer demand  because it knows how a local past, present and future belongs to local people</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conversation is bigger than commissioned consultancy  because it voices both expertise and experience&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning for action is bigger than winning an argument  because it understands the narrative in order to change it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the backstory. &nbsp;It makes the promise possible. &nbsp;The evidence is that without informed resistance to the hegemonic power that it reveals there can be no progressive education. &nbsp;It shows that the resulting promise can be kept with or without national government support. &nbsp;It believes that nothing is inevitable and that withdrawn consent can change everything.&nbsp; It holds to the stakeholder interests and voice that can make change happen.&nbsp; And it insists that education is community property and must be returned to its owners.</p>
<p>Alice will believe none of this unless her educators do.</p>

<p class="qote" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>asked to suggest a university mission statement, a philosophy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;professor suggested &lsquo;analysing concepts for our region&rsquo; </em></p>
<p align="right">urban myth?</p>
<p>Philosophy poses the most basic of questions - &lsquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo;, &lsquo;how do we know?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;why does it matter?&rsquo;.&nbsp; They often-enough need some kind of answer before anybody does anything about something.&nbsp; The trouble is that they rarely get quick-and-easy answers; they get what the professor calls &lsquo;concepts&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My shot at seeing how educators work on such questions is set out in an <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497">account of what educators can do</a>.&nbsp; It shows a lot going on, much of it is based on little more than opinion, and all of it is fiercely contested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Politicians also lay claim to similar what-how-why questions - they need to say what they&rsquo;re doing, how they go about it, and why it&rsquo;s a good idea. &nbsp;This blog takes a look at the opportunities they grasp, the connections they make,&nbsp;the options they find, the complexities they navigate, and the gains they make.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be a quick and easy read; nobody can deal with it in one take. &nbsp;But nobody needs to.&nbsp; So scan the pages to find what your work can act on. &nbsp;Skip what looks as though it can safely be ignored.&nbsp; Then figure what sort of political support education on your particular patch needs.&nbsp; No two are the same.</p>
<p>But mark this: one of the reason why proposals don&rsquo;t deliver is because something else needed to be done first.&nbsp; And that sometimes means recovering the at-first-ignored and making it the now-reconsidered.</p>
<p>I somehow doubt that the philosophy professor&rsquo;s suggestion galvanised those bosses into reconsidering the organisation&rsquo;s mission statement.&nbsp; But educators don&rsquo;t need a script; this is a range of starting points for thought and action. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Like earlier blogs, each step suggests action by students working with their educators, and by the stakeholder groups representing local interests in education.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on mood</strong></p>
<p class="text">Phrases like &lsquo;sea-change&rsquo;, &lsquo;its time has come&rsquo;, and &lsquo;cometh the hour&rsquo; reflect a belief in the importance of political timing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an ability to shape and catch a nation&rsquo;s mood. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s still about what, how and why to make a move - but it's also about when.</p>
<p class="text">Good timing can be no more than piggyback opportunism - today&rsquo;s headline becomes tomorrow&rsquo;s &lsquo;what teachers must do!&rsquo;. &nbsp;Politicians quickly learn not to waste a crisis. &nbsp;Managed well, good timing can transform a minority myth into a majority belief. &nbsp;This is not recommending that.</p>
<p class="text">But clever political timing sees education as a happy hunting ground for claims that politics can improve electorate's lives.&nbsp; And the claims often turn out to be ignorance of what has already been tried and discredited.&nbsp; Doesn't this mean that educators must get involved in understanding the mood they're dealing with?</p>
<p class="text">But it can't mean following any socio-political consensus. &nbsp;The search here is for durable springs for sustainable action.&nbsp; Like philosophy it's searching for underlying realities, for their reliability, and for their value.&nbsp; So how do we attract a contrary mood's&nbsp;interested attention in that? &nbsp;The way things are changing makes that an interesting question for educators and their studetns - and vital to how they learn from each other.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on connections</strong></p>
<p class="intro">If other peoples' timing can damage education then educators' timing can progress it.&nbsp; Timing takes hold of connections in the comings-and-goings of what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; It may link to the unfamiliar, and that may be unwanted by some.&nbsp; An exploratory brit careers-work programme was significantly entitled &lsquo;Connexions&rsquo;.&nbsp; But influential professional voices chose to canvas its imperfections. &nbsp;Might such resistance be habits-of-mind dressed up as professionalism?</p>
<p class="intro">Changed connectedness moves professionalism on, reframing conversations about what needs to be done.&nbsp; It pushes the questions beyond &lsquo;what to do?&rsquo; and &lsquo;when to do it&rsquo;.&nbsp; They are now about &lsquo;whom do we listen to?&rsquo; and &lsquo;who do we need to listen to us?&rsquo;&nbsp; These are questions of trust.</p>
<p class="intro">The slowest reader of political economy will soon come across complaints that &lsquo;nobody&rsquo;s listening!&rsquo;. &nbsp;But is it possible to listen to everybody?&nbsp; And what if the cry &lsquo;listening is what it&rsquo;s all about!&rsquo; turns out to be the right-foot left-foot politics of the hokey-cokey? &nbsp;</p>
<p class="intro">And so connectedness is complexity: customers are not always right; deals are struck both over the counter and under it; wanting is not the same as needing; claims are not invariably justified. &nbsp;All may demand a hearing. &nbsp;But not all can be heeded; or should be.</p>
<p class="intro">Shaping the connectedness of progressive education is the work of its stakeholder groups.&nbsp; Their links range from local-and-informal communities to established-and-institutionalised organisations.&nbsp; It means not just allowing things to take their course; it needs a tough-minded deliberate positioning of communities and organisations.&nbsp; It reaches outward to the experience it serves, and inward to the expertise it offers. &nbsp;At it's best it is a nicely-timed and appropriately-connected conversation.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on complexity</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Policy should be informed by expertise.&nbsp; In education it&rsquo;s hard to avoid the claims of psychology and economics.&nbsp; But there are also the social sciences and cultural theory.&nbsp; All of this is complicated enough, but it is further complicated by doubtful claims, maneuvering&nbsp;for position and as-yet unresolved issues. &nbsp;Whatever you want to urge on politics, Google can inform a&nbsp;plausible&nbsp;but&nbsp;bogus opponent.</p>
<p class="text">The journey is as much a literary as a scientific one.&nbsp; Null hypotheses are hard to formulate; there is too much going on in learning for anybody to be able to say what is never the case.&nbsp; And, anyway, education is a search for what might be so as much as an account of what might not. &nbsp;There is no last word on education.</p>
<p class="text">For most people the need to make sense of education is urgent. &nbsp;And complexity confuses.&nbsp; This attempt to say something useful about education is not inventing complexity where there is none, it is recognising the complexity that is out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">As a species we need to make sense of things, and confusion gets in the way.&nbsp; For some it can mean caving in to what appears to be chaos.&nbsp; That surrender doesn&rsquo;t say that education can be anything we want it to be; it says that education may be nothing at all.&nbsp; Some students agree - and some of them have a point.</p>
<p class="text">But facing complexity means you're still interested, and if you&rsquo;re not confused then you&rsquo;re just not paying attention. &nbsp;Enabling people to tell the difference between which of this is plausible and which is credible is what educators do. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">And there is also this: the more anybody can take account of complexity, then the more ways that person has of figuring out what to do about it. &nbsp;It's a repertoire which can say 'if this won&rsquo;t work, what about that?'.&nbsp; Repertoires have survival value; they make complexity&nbsp;a solution,&nbsp;not a problem. &nbsp;They mean that nothing is inevitable. &nbsp;Taking some complexity on board could keep you and your work afloat. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">All of this makes complexity a starting point, not a place to jump ship.&nbsp; Actually the discomfort of saying &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know where this is going!&rsquo; energises the pursuit of meaning, and finding meaning gives purpose to action.&nbsp; But all of this comes while dealing with complexity, not while evading it.</p>

<p class="main" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->students have a natural interest in subversive questioning by philosophy and they have a right to educators who can engage with them in it</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on beliefs</strong></p>
<p class="text">Complexity and confusion are troublesome.&nbsp; Is it so hard to understand why people are more likely to spend their energy on dealing with the urgent simplicities of day-on-day survival?&nbsp; The contemplation of the complexities of long-term hope gets squeezed out. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">But education needs to be convincing about hope. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a promise, and to break it is to invite rejection.&nbsp; And that turning away can be to where people find their simplest beliefs confirmed.&nbsp; Among the simplest of beliefs are to be quick in instinct, fierce in competition, and strong in retaliation.&nbsp; They may not feel like aberrations to avoid; they&rsquo;re as likely feel like models to emulate. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s education that can feel like the aberration.</p>
<p class="text">The signs of turning away include classroom phenomena: fidgeting with devices, camouflaging comics, gazing out of windows.&nbsp; And there be media giants out there. &nbsp;Media distractions can feel more real than lessons.&nbsp; They include the adoration of the famous, which can breed dependence.&nbsp; And there is also the rage against everything else, and that can breed fear. &nbsp;The media have a strong narrative; it recounts how &lsquo;we bring you closer to what you hope for, and we defend you from what you&nbsp;hate&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">That may be the story, but there is an undeclared back-story. &nbsp;It's about people becoming believers in what politics and commerce want them to believe.&nbsp; It's the backstory which has the greater impact on their chances in life: anybody who can capture beliefs is well on the way to being in charge. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">The backstory is both complicated and inconvenient to dominant interests. &nbsp;So it gets little attention in the media. &nbsp;It can exasperate people attending to filleted versions of the news. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s not too hard to label anyone who tries to draw attention to that as the true outsiders. &nbsp;Informed educators may qualify for the label. &nbsp;Wear it with pride.</p>
<p class="text">But few educators can be surprised to find cynicism among their students.&nbsp; So, is there a way forward? &nbsp;There's no shortcut; the evidence here is that students need to be drawn into a conversation, and that it must start from what they believe. &nbsp;And that may mean working with impulse, suspicion and hate.</p>
<p class="text">So, let's ask ourselves, &lsquo;is academic learning any good at thinking about such things?' and 'do its exams measure how well people are getting on with it?&rsquo;. &nbsp; On the first, our brains discard redundant learning. &nbsp;People quickly forget what they do not get a chance to use. &nbsp;You may have noticed that. &nbsp;On the second, the disappointed are entitled to their doubts about exams.&nbsp; We have not evolved to waste energy on pointless striving. &nbsp;That too?</p>
<p class="text">All of this leaves academic educators holding an awkward student question: &lsquo;but miss, why are we doing this?&rsquo;. &nbsp;Making &lsquo;because it&rsquo;s in the exam&rsquo; the end of the matter positions educators as running the most expensive selection system ever devised.&nbsp; Worse than that, it cops out of the promise.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">The needed conversation may start cynically. &nbsp;But it's actually about finding personal fulfillment, claiming social membership, earning economic independence, and counting on planetary well-being. &nbsp;And all of that makes the interest of the &lsquo;shirkers&rsquo; and &lsquo;strivers&rsquo; as one - indivisible.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Evading the issues insulates education from all but commercial and political concerns.&nbsp; It makes learning a closed system.&nbsp; And it makes what people will wind up believing a foregone conclusion. &nbsp;Some people like that idea. &nbsp;Not progressive educators.</p>
<p class="text">Any understanding of democracy demands that everybody involved in education is clear about where it stands on working with belief. &nbsp;&lsquo;Everybody involved&rsquo; is commerce and politics, it&rsquo;s education and it&rsquo;s stakeholders, and - most of all - it's students. &nbsp;&lsquo;Being clear&rsquo; means declaring what beliefs are worth airing and whether any doubts should be suppressed.&nbsp; The more genuinely inclusive is that appeal then the stronger its narrative.&nbsp; And that narrative determines who gets into bed with whom, and who gets kicked out.</p>

<p class="main" align="right"><a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-times-they-are-achangin-lyrics-bob-dylan.html">Bob Dylan</a></p>
<p class="main">This is not about acoustic and electric guitars.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more important even than that.&nbsp; This is about change - from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; And the times they are a-changin&rsquo; alright, but more than Bob knew.&nbsp; More than anybody could know.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">He held out hope for a generation; but no generation gets the last word on anything.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s little consensus on what anybody can do about what's happening.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy enough to trot out vague promises - &lsquo;more choice&rsquo; is popular, &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo; might get applause, and &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; a murmur of approval.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re pretty fluffy concepts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m suggesting that they camouflage more than they illuminate.</p>
<p class="main">I&rsquo;m thinking about the way influence is exerted, how it fragments societies, whether myths can easily posture&nbsp; as reality, why there are so few whistle blowers, and the risk all of this poses for us all.&nbsp; Growing fear needs transposing into sustainable hope.&nbsp; Educators are in no position to fix that; this is about how students will figure it for themselves.&nbsp; But this is pragmatic, it signposts what can help.</p>
<p class="main">It is a companion piece to an earlier blog - &lsquo;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8466">what education gets from politics</a>&rsquo;.&nbsp; If it feels a bit scowling-grumpy, ask yourself whether we've passed the limits of what smiley-nice can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">It's addressed to education&rsquo;s stakeholders.&nbsp; These are the families, educators, voluntary groups and social enterprises concerned for what students can gain from education.&nbsp; It signposts useful ideas, arguments and evidence.&nbsp; Each source is followed by an item for a stakeholder agenda.&nbsp; Education doesn&rsquo;t need shareholders looking for a pay-off, it needs stakeholders probing who is getting what out of education, and whether its stakeholders need to do something about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff here, because there&rsquo;s a lot going on.&nbsp; It may be best to start from the signposts which point to your work now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll update the list as things change - and they will.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll also open up other areas of enquiry.&nbsp; You can track this, and other news, by dropping in on <a title="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/billaw" target="_blank">my Twitter page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub">I don&rsquo;t want to be unfair to Bob Dylan - I don&rsquo;t dare.&nbsp; But the issues are too troublesome for uplifting inspiration.&nbsp; The point is this: stakeholders need students to get more from education than they&rsquo;ve so-far been in a position to realise.&nbsp; Boundaries need to be pushed.</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on influence</strong></p>
<p class="text">Should the wishes of the rich-and-powerful prevail?&nbsp; Are the people who most need help least likely to get it?&nbsp; Should we be surprised that there is little resistance?&nbsp; Is there damage that is not being openly confronted?&nbsp; And, if any of this is so, how does education resist being bounced into compliance with it?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s evidence on all of this, showing the interplay between politics and commerce - and its consequences for how we live together.&nbsp; Or don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p class="intro">An informal but prevalent script for learning is "tell 'em, and then they&rsquo;ll know".&nbsp; It&rsquo;s implicit in media claims about what teachers should do on issues ranging from love-life to bullying.&nbsp; A more sophisticated script is that education should pass on to each new generation &lsquo;the best that has been thought and said&rsquo;.&nbsp; And that view sees students as vessels waiting to be filled with golden wonders.&nbsp; The trouble with both theories is that students come to educators already full of learning.&nbsp; It is experience-based learning, and experience can be a convincing teacher.&nbsp; So whatever is taught must find a place, if it can, among what is already believed.&nbsp; And whatever comes out of that mix will not correspond with what the media or the &eacute;lite think desirable - never exactly, sometimes not at all.&nbsp; Learning is a back-and-forth process: educators wondering what students are taking from it, students wondering what it has to do with them.&nbsp; The only sense that matters is the sense that students make of it: &lsquo;what&rsquo;s going on and what can I do about it?&rsquo;, &lsquo;is this good for me, or bad?&rsquo;, &lsquo;do I approach, or avoid?&rsquo;, &lsquo;must I fear, or can I hope?&rsquo;.</p>

<p>There is a salutary tale here.&nbsp; It concerns an aspect of education fully enmeshed in these issues.&nbsp; Careers work is about who gets to do what in society.&nbsp; It has a century of research-and-development to draw on.&nbsp; It assiduously canvasses policy support.&nbsp; The commercial world can be counted on to take an interest.&nbsp; It has had some kind of representation in most education settings.&nbsp; Yet it is struggling to secure its own future.&nbsp; What went wrong?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible that it defended a past rather than reaching for a future?&nbsp; That would explain why it ran out of recognisably useful things to say.&nbsp; That retro-thinking was framed by a psychologically-understood individualism, linked to economically-understood opportunity.&nbsp; Such simplicity was, for a time, convenient to both commerce and politics.&nbsp; But it has little place in a privatised, digitised and globalised world.&nbsp; And it has no room for the social-and-cultural complexities of a fragmented, polarised and damaged social world.&nbsp; It has produced not so much inspiration as desperation - and the confusion seems to have taken refuge in what is called &lsquo;career-chaos theory&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But students don&rsquo;t need to be told about chaos.&nbsp; It they are to find meaning and purpose in confusion, it will need more time and space where students can learn about what&rsquo;s going on, and how they can&nbsp; make sense of it.&nbsp; Little of that can be done in hit-and-run careers interviews.&nbsp; This is not to say that face-to-face help is not necessary, but it is to say that it is not sufficient.&nbsp; Careers work has never found the need to draw on the full range of processes available to a well-constructed curriculum.&nbsp; It needs to do that now.&nbsp; The whole of what is set out here need the full scope of a curriculum designed to deliver learning for living,</p>
<p>This website is about innovation.&nbsp; And innovation means the 'creative destruction' of what can no-longer help.&nbsp; Should that be a lesson to us all?</p>

              <title>what education gets from politics</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8466</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8466</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>What education needs from politics is much less control and a whole lot more imagination.&nbsp; I try here to say something useful about how things got this way.&nbsp;&nbsp; My conclusion is that the way things are demands more than an adjustment here, a fix there and a re-launch sometime.&nbsp; I'm arguing for mind-boggling imagination, in support of learning-for-living usefulness, based on root-and-branch innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>stakeholder voices</strong></p>
<p>The way things are is not a happy story.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s certainly not hard to find reports that politics is remote from experience.&nbsp; People's life-and-work is changed for the worse by politicos claiming to be acting for the better.&nbsp; The people I&rsquo;m thinking of are <em>students</em>, in the <em>communities</em> where they and their families live, with their <em>helpers</em> in schools and colleges and in civil society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All three groups are stakeholders - a term which includes shareholders, but reaches far beyond them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll talk a lot about stakeholder voice - how different people, in different groups, differently voice their interests in education.&nbsp; Each speaks with an indispensable authority of the sense they make of their experience.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s more leadership for education than its designated leaders necessarily know about.&nbsp; There are also more conflicts of interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, the most pressing need has to do with the way in which students now need to navigate a path through accelerating change - a journey too-often signposted for manipulation, deceit and predation.&nbsp; Educators cannot ignore this.&nbsp; But stakeholder responses vary: some see market opportunities, some wonder what markets do for social well-being or personal fulfilment, and some argue for critical thinking to enable students to deal with whatever is thrown at them.&nbsp; I try to show how and why politics shows an active interest in some of this, promises but does not deliver on some, and largely ignores some.&nbsp; Educators are bound to wonder why.</p>
<p class="text">There's plenty here for you to disagree with - and plenty of opportunity for you to say why.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>abstractions and metaphors</strong></p>
<p class="text">But there&rsquo;s no quick-and-easy way to talk about education.&nbsp; Attempts at any length resort to abstract nouns.&nbsp; Various stakeholders variously call on such concepts as...&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="text">&lsquo;achievement&rsquo; - &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; - &lsquo;fairness&rsquo; - &lsquo;fulfilment&rsquo; - &lsquo;progress&rsquo; - &lsquo;self&rsquo; - &lsquo;well-being&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">They&rsquo;re rarely defined in ways that everyone accepts.&nbsp; Some get regularly redefined.&nbsp; And when any of them are loaded into a conversation about accelerating change, a person can get lost.</p>
<p class="text">It gets worse.&nbsp; As politics turns to education for responses to its own problems, the list lengthens, to include for example...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;aspiration&rsquo; - &lsquo;career&rsquo; - &lsquo;choice&rsquo; - &lsquo;citizenship&rsquo; - &lsquo;employability&rsquo; - &lsquo;enterprise&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">They&rsquo;re pretty fuzzy concepts.&nbsp; Some are demonstrably meaningless.&nbsp; But some people&rsquo;s interests find one or more term compelling - even compulsory.</p>
<p class="text">When definitions don&rsquo;t help, metaphors sometimes can.&nbsp; They substitute abstract talk with talk of the tangible.&nbsp; Metaphors conjure images which can be visualised as part of a narrative.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s possible to talk of education...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote">as if it recounted <em>&lsquo;a journey&rsquo; - </em>or<em> - &lsquo;a race&rsquo; ........ </em>or as if featured<em> - &lsquo;a trap&rsquo; - </em>or<em> - &lsquo;a key&rsquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">Such images matter.&nbsp; And narrative seems to be the species&rsquo; default way of making sense of what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; It gives voice to experience...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>what did he say? - why&rsquo;s that so important to her? - </em><br /><em>what can she do about it? - he won&rsquo;t like that!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">Ministerial pronouncements and stakeholder response can be narrated in such terms.&nbsp; But education can&rsquo;t rely wholly on such talk - it can deceive.&nbsp; Thinking about education can use narrative, but it needs hard evidence.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>imagination and reality</strong></p>
<p>I've put in links to imagery that stakeholders might find worth engaging.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the first...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote">Imagine no possessions<br /> I wonder if you can<br /> No need for greed or hunger<br /> A brotherhood of man<br /> Imagine all the people sharing all the world</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text" align="right">John Lennon</p>
<p class="text">John Lennon bequeathed <a title="hope" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnlennon/imagine.html" target="_blank">hope</a>, not least to young people.&nbsp; He sees young people as moving on together, as if on a shared journey.&nbsp; He avowedly does not see them as being taken in one-by-one, as in a trap.&nbsp; He wrote this when an economy, culture and technology made such western-hemisphere hopefulness seem possible.&nbsp; Contemporary experience needs a different narrative - not least for students, with their educators, and in their communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>student voice</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">So what kind of narrative might resonate with students these days?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no hope in a story of entrapment, but it might be worth wondering about the attractions of racing imagery - where people can be winners...&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose students mainly value education to help them be winners?</li>
<li>so that they seek coaching? - to get ahead of the pack? - finding an inside track? - to the finishing line?</li>
<li>might that mean that giving way to others is believed to be weakness?</li>
<li>what about if the belief were that losers have only themselves to blame?</li>
<li>would anybody then expect that excluding others from the game is how the competitive win?</li>
</ul>
<p>Are students finding such talk any more &lsquo;hard to do&rsquo; than John Lennon found in his imagining?&nbsp; Probably not: such competitiveness is not hard to understand in a stagnant economy, where one person's gain will be another's loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a lot of issues embedded here.&nbsp; There is evidence that finishing-line learning gets lost when the race is thought to be won.&nbsp; It's learning for a result, not learning for life.&nbsp; But the beliefs, values and expectations associated with such a story can, nonetheless, embed in the culture of a school, a college or a project...</p>
<ul>
<li>how far would education be valued for the advantages it gives to &lsquo;me&rsquo;, over &lsquo;others&rsquo;?</li>
<li>are relationship increasingly valued for their &lsquo;worth-knowing&rsquo; networking?</li>
<li>and about the excluded, who do they believe they can most count on when it matters? - day-on-day? - in a crisis?</li>
<li>do such outsiders have any value to the advantaged - worth talking to? - caring about? - given as much as a nod?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">This may not be what John Lennon calls &lsquo;brotherhood&rsquo;.&nbsp; And there is some evidence of loss of eye-contact in competitive cultures.</p>
<p class="text">Such issues are not intended for research schedules; they are the makings of fuller conversations.&nbsp; For the helpers these are listening conversations - helpers need to know what sense students are making of their experience of education.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">So what about John Lennon's talk of &lsquo;possessions&rsquo;? - among which socially-isolating on-line devices may be significant...</p>
<ul>
<li>are there possessions that are more valued than, say, on-line devices? - like what?</li>
<li>do we know what such feelings-for-things are about? - fun? - contacts? - status? - what else?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s fun, would that be exciting? - impulsive? - dramatic? - extreme? - dangerous? - what more could it be?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s about contacts? - does that mean with people whom &lsquo;I like&rsquo;? - or are &lsquo;like me&rsquo;? - what&rsquo;s most to like? - what people? - found where? - valued why? - something else?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s about status, would that have anything to do with expensive stuff? - up-to-date? - looking good? - feeling good? - having followers? - what else?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s plenty of room for imagination here, but it&rsquo;s not John Lennon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If educators find any trace of a &lsquo;me-now-and-fun&rsquo; culture, is it showing any traces of what some call &lsquo;immature&rsquo; - and some would call &lsquo;infantilised&rsquo;.&nbsp; There's evidence, and not only among young people. &nbsp; A second bit of imagery:&nbsp; Aldous Huxley attributes such attitudes to most of us, in his ironic <a title="huxley" href="http://classiclit.about.com/od/bravenewworld/fr/aafpr_bravenew.htm" target="_blank">imagining</a> of a <em>Brave New World</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s no limit in such talk to why-is-this-important-to-anybody questioning.&nbsp; Neither is there any limit to what-can-anyone-do-about-it hope.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>educator voice</strong></p>
<p class="text">Inserting words like &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo;, &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; and &lsquo;choice&rsquo; into a message captures comfortable compliance.&nbsp; Other words, like &lsquo;entrap&rsquo;, &lsquo;impulse&rsquo; and &lsquo;infantilise&rsquo; feel more like uncomfortable warnings.&nbsp; But both sets of terms belong to each other, like the conflicted dialogue in a well-told story.&nbsp; Educators do not come empty handed to that conversation.&nbsp; Engaging imagery, tracking sense-making and questioning meaning - that's what educators do.&nbsp; Whatever trap-door may be slammed shut, educators can find a key.</p>
<p class="text">Maybe.&nbsp; But what if education were favourably enough disposed to government to be itself susceptible to capture?</p>
<ul>
<li>is it worth asking how favourably disposed to government educators want to be? - need to be? - are?</li>
<li>what if prevalent social attitudes are more inclined to trust governing voices?</li>
<li>and suppose governmental and commercial priorities were to become interchangeable with each other?</li>
<li>would it then be possible that terms like &lsquo;markets&rsquo;, &lsquo;brands&rsquo;, &lsquo;customers&rsquo;, and &lsquo;choice&rsquo; meld education's aims with political and business-world claims? - okay with that?</li>
<li>if these are trends, then should educators be using on-line sources to track them? - and any place for &lsquo;professional&rsquo; and &lsquo;popular&rsquo; journalism?</li>
<li>and how much of this do government&rsquo;s &lsquo;expert&rsquo; advisers illuminate? - or do its commercially-based lobbyists?</li>
<li>should any of this be a concern of educators? - and would that be only if it concerns education and assessment? - or if it affects student&rsquo;s chances in life? - or because it has broader stakeholder significance? - like what?</li>
<li>but what if such trends are already shaping stakeholders attitudes? - how, then, is any of this making learning-for-living more accessible to some people? - and less to others?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">If any part of this line of conversation seeks to maintain independence then it is more than about skills and theory, it's about ethics.&nbsp; It seems to me to be easier to make ethical claims in mission statements, than to demonstrate ethical commitments in a crisis.&nbsp; There is here the makings a conversation for educators, their mentors, trainers, associations and theorists to get into.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Because the situation is critical, an independent education service faces formidable issues...</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose educators are asked to treat what students bring out of art, work and creativity as no more than saleable commodities?</li>
<li>what if history were to become a feel-good account of a great nation&rsquo;s leaders?</li>
<li>on another tack, would it matter if an uncomprehended &lsquo;nudge&rsquo; supplants any need to understand the whys-and-wherefores for taking action? - or if back-of-the-envelope &lsquo;tips&rsquo; were thought to be enough to guide what people need to do?</li>
<li>and what if, then, any resulting self-confidence and positive thinking become the prime outcomes of education? - and if not that, something more troublesome? - like asking awkward questions - or dissent?</li>
<li>would it matter if any me-and-mine individualism tightened its hold on curriculum? - setting aside the sense people make of their experience in their neighbourhoods? - about their inheritance and upbringing? - among their connections? - and their attachments to others?</li>
<li>would psychology then be strong enough to carry the explanatory freight concerning what people learn? - and what they do with the opportunity to learn? - rather than an understanding social-and-cultural-group influences on their attitudes?</li>
<li>and would any loss of the sense of living-with-others mean that local and systemic influences on learning are down-played? - allowing the need for socially-located help to be curtailed? - and, despite policy-and-commercial claims to &lsquo;openness&rsquo;, not open to scrutiny?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">There is evidence that political pronouncements shape prevalent attitudes.&nbsp; But policy promises of &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; might not be freedom as most people think of it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s freedom for families to manoeuvre into high-rated schools, and for commerce to edge education towards privatisation.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not freedom for families get their kids into a local school which they have come to think of as theirs.&nbsp; Nor for independently-minded teachers to escape derogatory labelling.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s certainly not a freedom that John Lennon imagined &lsquo;would make the world as one&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="text">A third piece of imagery: are there any traces here of George Orwell&rsquo;s <a title="orwell" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087803" target="_blank">nightmare</a>? - take control of the language, substitute belief for reality, re-write the past.&nbsp; Evidence of social control includes reports of clever news management neutralising what policy does not want heard, smothering it with press releases which are cut-and-pasted into news items by compliant journalists.&nbsp; The media gain is to capture attention and extend the reach of advertising.&nbsp; Popular demands for satisfaction make for a headline-driven curriculum requiring educators to come up with solutions to situations where they can have no control.&nbsp; And much of each requirement is written by politicos, their advisers and lobbyists.&nbsp; Some of it is lies.</p>
<p class="text">There are different interests at stake here - different students, different educators, in different communities, differently benefit - and are differently harmed.&nbsp; But independent educators make a different use of the headline-driven curriculum: enabling a critical grasp of what the media claim, engaging students in asking on what evidence?, on behalf of whom?, and why?&nbsp; How many politicos have you noticed asking for such disturbance?</p>
<p class="text"><strong>&nbsp;<br /></strong></p>
<p class="text"><strong>community voice</strong></p>
<p class="text">The politics of promise rests on a belief in the possibility of unlimited growth.&nbsp; The evidence is that the economics of such beliefs is unreliable, especially concerning the risks and costs of collateral damage.&nbsp; And that damage ranges from the personal-and-frightening, to the planetary-and-catastrophic.&nbsp; People need a new narrative, making new sense and based on sane assumptions.</p>
<p class="text">Isn&rsquo;t that what education is for?&nbsp; It would be surprising to find that no teacher wanted to help with any part of the processes suggested here.&nbsp; A tough test is the purest of all disciplines - maths (said to be god's language).&nbsp; The most basic grasp of probability undermines the most plausible of bogus promises.&nbsp; That educator needs only to understand that this is not just about acquiring skills for an examination, it&rsquo;s about transferring learning into life.</p>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s much talk of curriculum reform; a lot of it about the needs of the economy and the usefulness to employers.&nbsp; That story needs retelling...</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose we start from an assertion that a pressing need for education is to enable the navigation of a path through change? - how far would the features of that challenge be to deal with overload? - confusion? - deception? - risk? - and what more?</li>
<li>would that mean enabling people to probe and interrogate every promise, enticement and manoeuvre?</li>
<li>and how far do they need to be able to do that as individuals? - with friends? - in groups? - on-line?</li>
<li>do current conditions need an increased ability to scrutinise, probe and interrogate persuaders? - does the phrase &lsquo;critical thinking&rsquo; convey any of this?</li>
<li>if so, is enough attention given to critical thinking in calls for reform from policy? - commerce? - the media? - religion? - if not, is it up to educators to do more about it? - and students? - and other stakeholders?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">Not all educators will say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to all of this.&nbsp; But this reform doesn&rsquo;t need all educators.&nbsp; The need is for independent educators.&nbsp; Who work with the voice of stakeholders.&nbsp; With their ethics in good order.</p>
<p class="text">The issues raised here are locally experienced, but they are globally generated.&nbsp; The planet is peppered with regimes who find it easier to nudge, entice, cajole and threaten people into compliance than to educate them into autonomy.&nbsp; They breed dependence on dominant and controlling voices.&nbsp; They feed into every conflict, fear and risk that we all face.&nbsp; It justifies violence against outsiders and breeds docility in the group.&nbsp; Educators were never more deeply and urgently implicated.&nbsp; Not least in the UK.</p>
<p>A fourth piece of imagery: John Lennon, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell each rates his mention.&nbsp; But so does Norman <a title="Jewison" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZFaPezzM4k" target="_blank">Jewison</a>, for his movie <em>Rollerball</em> (since disastrously re-made).&nbsp; It tells of a world where global commerce has become the government, shaping what people are to believe, value and expect.&nbsp; The instrument of control is the game - fast, extreme, where winning and losing has life-and-death significance - and, it seems, is impossible to resist.&nbsp; It seems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>why so much detail?</strong></p>
<p class="text">Is there too much to bother about here?&nbsp; Some say so.&nbsp; But the evidence is that the more ideas we take on board the greater our repertoire for action.&nbsp; Complexity is not necessarily the problem, in some form it's necessary to the solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is certainly much more going on in teaching-and-learning than is immediately obvious.&nbsp; Anyone who wants not to be bothered by complexity should stay away from curriculum.</p>
<p class="text">The task of reform is, then, demanding.&nbsp; A sane understand must explain uncomfortable causes-and- effects if we are effectively to deal with crises concerning our economy, technology and security.&nbsp; What we do about education is doubly important: for how educators help students now, and for how students go on learning - life-wide and life-long.</p>
<p class="text">The enemy of all this is not &lsquo;what-if&rsquo; thinking.&nbsp; The biggest danger is &lsquo;if-only&rsquo; thinking.&nbsp; I doubt that there has been a reform movement that has not been colonised by such single-minded claims...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>if only we could get back to... - if only they had more... - if only somebody would...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">It&rsquo;s people zeroing-in on the opportunity to get their idea, or interest, or programme on-board.&nbsp; The argument is, often enough, that...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>there&rsquo;s no need to start again, we know what we need to do</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">But we don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Education is in unprecedented crisis.&nbsp; The economic, technological and cultural trends move at an accelerating rate, and on a global scale.&nbsp; They are invading &nbsp;students, their helpers and their communities with what are, at times, unmanageable demands. &nbsp;We may not be able start again, but we are able to imagine - and to imagine what it would be like to start from scratch...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>knowing what we know about how things are - and if we were building a new education service - what would we build in?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">This is not colonising the action with ready-made proposals.&nbsp; But neither is it discarding all the proposals that are within reach.&nbsp; If we can agree about what&rsquo;s going on, in all its complexity, then we can trawl proposals that can be adapted to those needs.&nbsp; And the more we&rsquo;ve got to go on, the better.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">This innovative strategy does not start with provision but with need.&nbsp; The perspectives which inform the process are not from institutions but from more widely-rooted stakeholders.&nbsp; It is, then, a process of letting go and holding on.&nbsp; It discards what is no longer appropriate, useful or tenable.&nbsp; And it turns to what is.&nbsp; This is what needs mind-boggling imagination, enables learning-for-living usefulness, and calls on root-and-branch innovation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve framed the issues outside dominant interests.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s why you can reframe them.&nbsp; I want you to.&nbsp; There are some issues on which I would be pleased to be proved wrong.</p>
<p>I'll follow this up shortly, with the ideas, argument and evidence that inform what I've set out above.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m collating it now, and a link will appear here.&nbsp; It will go into detail on both...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>what does education get from politics?<br /></strong>and<br /><strong>what does education need from politics?</strong></p>
<p class="text">It will cover...</p>
<ul>
<li>what's to be done about competitiveness - commerce - fragmentation - blame - values - infantilism - exclusion - fear-and-hope</li>
<li>how educators can be ready - getting results - working with stakeholders - re-structuring activity</li>
<li>what politics can do in localities - seizing opportunities - re-connecting to localities - facing complexities - becoming authentic - being fair - acknowledging failure - re-thinking bases - offering leadership</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2 class="title">Participatory Media Teaching and Learning Resources</h2>
<p>Open Educational Resources (OER) are learning modules that are available for reuse. By standing upon the shoulders of giants, we can reach further than if we attempt to reinvent our own learning modules.</p>
<p><a title="Howard Rheingold web site" href="http://rheingold.com/">Howard Rheingold</a> has created&nbsp;<strong><a title="Participatory Media Teaching and Learning Resources" href="http://socialmediaclassroom.com/community/wiki/participatory-media-teaching-and-learning-resources">Participatory Media Teaching and Learning Resources</a></strong> with a&nbsp;<strong><a title="cc by-nc 3.0 US license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC 3.0 US</a>&nbsp;</strong>license which I will be reusing.</p>
<p>I am creating a <strong>personal learning environment</strong> (PLE). I am inviting others to join with me to experience <strong>participatory learning</strong> as demonstrated by Howard Rheingold. I will also encourage participants to read this <strong><a title="Peeragogy Handbook" href="http://peeragogy.org/">Peeragogy Handbook</a></strong>. Mozilla is currently drafting a <strong><a title="Mozilla white paper on web literacies" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracyStandard/Legacy/WebLiteraciesWhitePaper">White Paper on Web Literacies</a></strong>, too.</p>
<p>I got a deal on hosting at BlueHost recently ($3.50/mo) and purchased the domain <strong><a title="digital literacy web site" href="http://dglt.org/">dgtl.org</a> </strong>for about $10/yr. I am using WordPress as a content management system and for blogging and have also installed forum, wiki, and Moodle software within this website. So for less than $5/mo I am able to provide a playground where I intend to learn by doing - hopefully along with others.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>As you might know, ITunes U is a great new way to provide a rich free learning experience, using just the IPad, IPod or IPhone. For teachers, educators and youth workers we developed a great ITunes U course that uses New Zealand&rsquo;s peer mentors to share real life stories and empowers youth to overcome obstacles, enable them to discover their true selves and make a difference in life. In order to freely access our ITunes U course, please visit: <a href="https://itunesu.itunes.apple.com/enroll/EME-WP9-8K5">https://itunesu.itunes.apple.com/enroll/EME-WP9-8K5</a></p>
<p>The programme consists of over 30 interviews with New Zealand&rsquo;s peer mentors that share their real life experiences. Because all interviews have their own unique stories and themes, the interviews can be used to discuss many different life aspects. In order to do so, this ITunes U course is divided into different topics and assignments and can be accessed together or as an individual assignment.</p>
<p>The materials available on this resource were collected during a research project that was funded by the Todd Foundation about the structure that creates life-changing impact. The themes that our peer role models speak of are: identity, enablement, education experience and the balance of personal development and social life.</p>

<p>We would love to hear if you find this course interesting, useful and are planning on using it during the new school year!!&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

<h2><strong><em>TITLE: web 2.0 vs teaching 2.0</em></strong></h2>
<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Actors </strong>(who is involved?)</p>
<p>Teachers in primary and secondary school education</p>
<p>Team of facilitators - depending on the number of teachers/participants to enroll.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goals </strong>(why?)</p>
<p>Train teachers to create more attractive dynamic digital resources to use in the classroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Settings</strong> (where &amp; when?)</p>
<p>The training will take place in post-working hours for a period of 4 weeks. This project aims to be firstly a version in the b-learning system, to facilitate the integration of teachers who have more difficulty or are more adverse to novelty and innovation. . But during the weeks the regime will tend to direct into the e-learning system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Objects </strong>(what things are involved?)</p>
<p>Computer / Desktop / tablet PC/ notebook / iPhone / smartphone, Internet connection, course platform, email and free Web 2.0 tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong> (what happens to actors?)</p>
<p>The course is provided by the Teachers&rsquo; Training Centre, through the Ministry of Education and announced in every school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Events </strong>(what do actors do?)</p>
<p>After a registration on the platform that will serve as the basis of the course, students will be asked to perform various tasks to be published in digital e-portfolio. They are then called to reflect and share ideas on thematic forums on the tools in use. The facilitators will give feedback in a maximum period of 24 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> (what is achieved?)</p>
<p>Realization of digital resources using Web 2.0 tools to make an e-portfolio with all the digital resources used by participants, these separated by areas of interest.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your design:</strong> (what role does your design play?)</p>
<p>The project is to help teachers produce more attractive and creative digital resources with the use of web 2.0 tools in order to assist in their teaching roles.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p class="Body1">Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com" target="_blank">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p class="Body1">This is about a day-long workshop, on three-scene storyboarding, for teachers and other careers workers, for their programme managers and for interested academics.&nbsp; In advance of the workshop participants can access two sources...&nbsp;</p>
<p class="body1" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">an illustrated account of underpinning thinking<br /></a><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbstrybrd.ppt">an animated workshop presentation</a></p>
<p class="Body1">The process starts with a question:</p>
<ul>
<li>what do you hope for from this?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">That opening-up question becomes a continuing conversation.&nbsp; But, to start with, participants are introduced to the process of creating a storyboard.&nbsp; They are asked to recall a turning-point episode in their own life, or of some other person with whom they can empathise.&nbsp; In work-table groups of 4-5, they compare that storyboarding experience.&nbsp; They can then revise their storyboard, or abandon it and start again.&nbsp; In forming and re-forming groups for this work they are encouraged to work with people they have not met before today.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">Throughout the day they are asked variants of four questions...</p>
<ul>
<li>what do you now hope for from this workshop?</li>
<li>what question do you have on how to work with storyboarding?</li>
<li>what reservations do you have about it?</li>
<li>what potential can you find, or not find, in it?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">Their ideas engage cross-flowing interaction in the whole group - the questions become...</p>
<p align="center"><em>...who has similar ideas?</em><br /><em> ...who has different? </em><br /><em> ...who has contrary? &nbsp;</em><br /><em> ...who has something not yet mentioned?</em></p>
<p class="Body1">At some point during the day everybody has said who they are, and have shown what they have to contribute.&nbsp; Sources of peer help are identified and professional links are made.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">All ideas are flip-charted for continuing review. &nbsp;And, here&rsquo;s the point, that on-going conversation makes it clear that some parts of the presentation need close examination, some can be skipped over, some can be ignored. &nbsp;There is a lot to storyboarding; we were never going to cover it all - but we don&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p align="center">____________________________</p>
<p class="Body1">Whatever learning up-the-front experts might anticipate, it is never identical to the learning that out-there experienced participants actually get.&nbsp; The back-and-forth learning between everybody in the place makes the workshop an innovative research-and-development event for us all.</p>
<p class="Body1">I&rsquo;ve set out five headings for what that exchange gave us.</p>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>1. hopes for how storyboarding might help people</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">helping them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>express a sense of identity</li>
<li>say what they need to say, that is what lies underneath what they do say</li>
<li>take charge of their own expression, and be calm where there is stress</li>
<li>enable people for whom language is not a tool but a hurdle</li>
<li>find and engage active learning-to-learn</li>
<li>find a focus in the complexity of contemporary life</li>
<li>help to visualise and recognise possible ways forward</li>
<li>be able to say it all out loud, meaning it becomes their commitment</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>2. ideas for how it might develop education professionalism</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">helping professionals to:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn a new tool for improved effectiveness</li>
<li>find new perspective for professional expansion</li>
<li>see how to recognise when storyboarding will, and will not, be useful</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>3. how-to-do questions</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">practitioners need to know more about...</p>
<ul>
<li>whether the turning-point has to be positive</li>
<li>whether it is for other peoples&rsquo; stories or only for the person&rsquo;s own</li>
<li>whether &lsquo;futuring&rsquo; (storyboarding&rsquo;s narrative form of action planning) runs from where the person was in the episode or from where that person is now</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>4. professional reservations </strong></p>
<p class="Body1">professionals need...</p>
<ul>
<li>a framework that gives a reason for doing this</li>
<li>to be convinced that storyboarding actually makes a useful difference</li>
<li>a feel for what can be safely shown in a storyboard - not risking too much disclosure</li>
<li>an idea of the policy focus for storyboarding - say for employability or well-being</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>5. ideas for storyboarding potential</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">working in this way can open-up possibilities...</p>
<ul>
<li>we use storyboarding according to whether or not there is a recognisable turning-point to look at</li>
<li>conversations are originated by the storyboard, so there is an ethical equality where both we and they learn from each other</li>
<li>storyboarded episodes must not be ignored - they require action</li>
<li>the &lsquo;futuring&rsquo; process needs to be un-resolved - and therefore open-ended</li>
<li>it means thinking about consequences of the facts, what they mean, this person&rsquo;s purpose</li>
<li>different turning-points, over a period, can reveal helpful patterns in a life</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">_______________________</p>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>issues</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">I should be clear that I'm the tutor here.&nbsp; But I don't claim I do it well - that&rsquo;s for others to say.&nbsp; I do claim, though, that something like this is required if education professionalism is to be respected, strengthened and voiced.</p>
<p class="Body1">The implication is that there can be no known-in-advance assumptions about outcomes and how they are to be reached.&nbsp; The workshop is a conversation between participants-and-tutor as a whole.&nbsp; And, in the cross-flow of ideas, that conversation is often between the authority of expertise and the authority of experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">It&rsquo;s true that there are unavoidable features of storyboarding format and process that need to be learned.&nbsp; But it's also true that participants need to say where they are, where they need to be, where they are going with it, and what is helping them - and hindering them.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">One of the most telling signs of what is learned is in the way they first design and then revise the storyboards they create.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">On-line exchange means that the thinking can be widely and continuously extended and made the basis for innovative action...</p>
<ul>
<li>finding what is critical to the value of storyboarding</li>
<li>realising what needs more thought, more discussion, or more enquiry</li>
<li>signposting needed changes in storyboarding format and process</li>
<li>prioritising future action</li>
<li>saying what I got wrong and whether I got anything right</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is why I'm putting it where there is a space - below - for such comments, ideas and purposes.</p>
<p align="center">_______________________</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">some of the workshop storyboards will be made available at the career-learning caf&eacute; in due course - there will be an alert at...</p>

<td valign="top">
<p>Teachers nowadays are asked to update themselves on the materials they use to give lessons in a more attractive way to their students. But the reality is that students sometimes have greater ease and knowledge in the use of technology, so it is important to equip teachers to find the tools at their disposal in web 2.0 for free. This project aims to be firstly a version in the b-learning system, to facilitate the integration of teachers who have more difficulty or are more adverse to novelty and innovation.</p>

<p>The aim is to encourage teachers to use web 2.0 tools as attractive features for their classes. With the use of these resources in teaching, students will become more motivated and classes will have different dynamics, since the use of technology is always a motivating factor for students.</p>

<td valign="top" width="612">
<p>The approach will be sought through a training regime in b-learning in order to motivate trainees and clarify any doubts that may occur at morecomplex moments in theclassroom. But the training will have a graduate scheme. In the beginning there will be more classroom sessions and toward the end of the training there will be the use of the e-learning system using videoconferencing one hour a week to clear doubts. The whole course will run from Moodle, Blog, GoogleDocs, Prezi, Youtube, Wikispaces, and videoconferencing amongst others &hellip;</p>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7551</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm always loath to start a blog or learning journal away from the platforms I've used for the last five years - Wordpress since 2007 (www.mymindbursts.com) 1500+ entries and as an OU postrgraduate student on the OU Student Blogging Platform since February 2010 (1000+ entries) ... and before this in Diaryland.com since 1999 1.5m words. I believe in the format, I've kept a diary for long enough. I rather like the idea of being able instead to blab into a webcam like Jack Sully in Avatar. I guess I could talk to Siri on the iPad but then it still has to be edited and posted somewhere ... here if it is to be shared (which is the whole point).</p>
<p>My experience with learning online for the last three years (Masters in Open and Distance Education) is that when at this level someone says it'll take 'x hours' in the week I double the number before I decide if I can make the time - this takes care of needing to familiarise myself with the landscape. I can take 'x hours' and multiply by 4 if there is new software involved, even longer to the point of giving up if it isn't immediately obvious, intuitive and FUN. A fellow MOOCER pointed me towards Pearltrees and I feel in love. But then again, I take both a professional interest and have the boyish curiosity that makes me click on everything anyway. So we'll see.</p>
<p>I've skipped in and out of week 1 trying to follow the instructions but feeling like one in a thousand playing a game of treasure hunt. Or, like one of several hundred on the first evening of an OU Residential School. With an added difficulty here - all Holiday Inn's look the same, but the platforms here are not. Even Cloudworks, which I tried during an MAODE module, looks as unfamiliar as it did 18 months ago. I couldn't get it then ... though I played ball, wrote and posted, but got no interaction. It felt like I was being sent into the jungle to list the flora and collect insects and meet fellow travellers but what I found as a desert full of chimeras.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7540</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7540</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Where to begin? I started the MOOC feeling a bit overwhelmed but excited to learn more about learnging design. I kept my goals for the week quite simple and just noted the specific activities we were to complete for the week. I have completed the ones I listed, so I feel good about that accomplishment.</p>
<p>From a technical side, I said I wanted to learn about some tools that I didn't know about before and that certainly happened. I'm a bit frustrated with how many spaces the course is held in and the need to figure out just what is meant to be said where. I'm pleased with myself for persisting and I think I have enough of a basic grasp to continue.</p>
<p>On the content side - I'm finding the way 'designers' look at the world intriguing in terms of the vast number of processes that are involved in course design. I remain a bit puzzled as I work through some of the models and ideas as it is rather difficult to see where they differ from the work I do as a teacher. Not that there aren't differences in the mix but that teaching itself is a process of design - a point made in one of the early videos as well.</p>
<p>The interaction with other people is teaching me a lot - I see common issues across the world and intitutional settings. People are open and willing to talk about thier own experiences and share their knowledge. We've even had a go at defining knowledge!</p>
<p>My learning journal is also an open study group space so feel free to pop by and join in the discussion. (link below)</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to next week and having a go at inquiring some more.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Your situation (context)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Describe the material and social characteristics of the environment in which you operate. Where will your project take place? Who are the main actors involved? Include images, videos, sketches - anything that would help others understand the opportunities and constraints you are dealing with.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen the time and effort taken to produce many training courses at institutions I have worked at with different departments re-creating the wheel, in different systems, platforms and creating a patchwork of ideas that don't tie in with the any institutional strategy. I realise you can't impose strict standards on people, but some type of system that allows for Staff to dip in and out of training resources - videos, quizzes, worksheets, resources they can customise.</p>
<p>These resources would be the full range of resources in a HE institution - from Leadership and Management to Healthy and Safety, for PhD, Post Doctoral, Lecturers through to Professors.</p>
<p>They would run on any device, so be mobile friendly and allow 'just in time' learning to occur, with statistics being delivered to a central location for senior management to view, but also this impact would be measured in more mixed method approaches, so not just on the figures, via regular staff surveys etc.</p>
<p><strong>The change you would like to see (challenge)</strong><br /><strong>What do you hope to achieve? What would be different if you succeed?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability via technologies to enable all staff in a HE institution to access Staff Development / Training tailored to their needs via a Portal / MOOC etc. If this was achieved, more staff would feel that the institution cared about their development, would be prompted within the institution and would be retained for longer. As anyone knows, replacing good staff is costly. Results, via surveys and data would show an increase in staff satisfaction and better wellbeing and hopefully an upskilling of staff. These resources would not stop face to face training, they would supplement it, for 75% of all courses. The institution in the long run would have a robust automated staff development system suggesting courses based on tags / fields / job specifications of staff. "Ah, Professor X, I see you are supervising 8 PhD students, there's an online course for this, please sign up here. There's also a face to face course in 2 weeks." - sent to their email / SMS etc. <br /><br /><strong>How you might go about bringing that change<br />What is your pedagogical approach? Which technologies will you use to implement it, and how?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would done via a series of in-house resources, based on the needs of the institution. There would be a 'grand plan for development'. The pedagogical approach would be a Constructivism. Due to the complexities of what's required, a customised LMS / SharePoint or other solution in terms of technologies would need to be deployed, but rather like Cloudworks have the ability to embed and display social media feeds, to enrich the user experience and to give features like 'rate resource' etc more context and meaning.</p>]]></description>

<p>I envision a <strong>map of learning activities</strong> for raising ones <strong>digital literacy</strong> competencies. Learners could jump in at any time, anywhere on the map,&nbsp;and find guidance to master that particular skill set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The map would be dynamic, continually being improved and expanded, much like in wikipedia.</p>
<h2><strong>Structure</strong></h2>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong><a title="digital literacy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy">Digital Literacy</a></strong> includes an enormous range of competencies.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>Mapping</strong> out the ever growing skill sets could perhaps be structured as a massive <strong>outline</strong> with collapsing/expanding branches (or a <strong>MindMap</strong>)</p>

They would offer to pay a coach/mentor/teacher coins &nbsp;in order to master a particular competency. Eventually they would advance into the mentor-coach role and pay their former mentor coach for back-up or support.</p>]]></description>

              <title>why we need a career-learning theory now </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6540</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6540</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com" target="_blank">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p><a title="CLT" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnoriginal.pdf" target="_blank">Career-learning theory</a> was first published in 1996.&nbsp; It argues that the most important features of careers work are those which enable people to think for themselves.&nbsp; This is learning-to-learn, sometimes called &lsquo;metacognition&rsquo;.&nbsp; It is applied here to careers work, but it&rsquo;s features are designed to be useful to all education professions.&nbsp; It is a questioning technique, and there is no topic on any learning programme which can escape the importance of asking not just...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<em>...&lsquo;what do you know?&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center">but also...<em><br /></em></p>
<p align="center"><em>...&lsquo;how do you know it&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>What-you-know may be soon discarded, contradicted or outdated.&nbsp; But, once learned, how-you-know can be applied to any task, and need never be lost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These ideas are applied here to careers work and to other educators who take learning to be a useful preparation for life - not just for passing exams but learning for living.</p>
<p>There are other formulations of metacognition - characterised, for example, as &lsquo;learning circles&rsquo; and &lsquo;learning styles&rsquo;.&nbsp; But few have the depth and breadth of research-based thinking invested in career-learning theory.&nbsp; It is a meta-analysis drawing on a wide range of behaviour-science - largely from sociological ethnography and psychological&nbsp; learning theory.</p>
<p>All that has happened since its publication reinforces the importance of its ideas.&nbsp; It can readily be <a title="CLTupdate" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf" target="_blank">applied to today&rsquo;s experience</a> of economic, cultural and environmental change - both world-wide and local.&nbsp; The need for &lsquo;how-do-you-know?&rsquo; questioning has never been greater.</p>
<p>The ideas are built into Bill&rsquo;s invited presentation on career-learning theory, for the Danish VUE conference in November.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; note: the links you'll find here are to immediate sources in Bill's work, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but each contains extensive references to the sources which inform that work</em></p>
<p>The ideas signpost how educators can...&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>see where career-learning theory belongs in education thinking</li>
<li>apply it to the processes of learning-for-living</li>
<li>appreciate why enabling such thinking is now more urgent than ever</li>
<li>claim a place in the reshaping of that work</li>
</ol>
<p>________________________<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. who says what?&nbsp; - a distinctive perspective</strong></p>
<p>Careers-work <a title="professionalism.pdf" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" target="_blank">professionalism</a> has, over a century, collected a range of ways of talking about how working life develops.&nbsp; We have theories about...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;matching&rsquo; and &lsquo;chaos&rsquo; - 'community&rsquo; and &lsquo;capital&rsquo; - </em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&nbsp;&lsquo;mindfulness&rsquo; and &lsquo;nudge&rsquo; - &lsquo;development&rsquo; and &lsquo;boundary-less&rsquo; - </em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&nbsp;&lsquo;constructs&rsquo; and &lsquo;dissonance&rsquo; - and &lsquo;attribution&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>There are issues: for example &lsquo;chaos&rsquo; does not naturally invite &lsquo;matching&rsquo;; &lsquo;community&rsquo; works differently for those who have little &lsquo;capital&rsquo;; and why take trouble with patiently enabling mindfulness when a conditioning &lsquo;nudge&rsquo; is quicker and easier?; also, can we set a framework around development if career is actually boundary-less&rsquo;?; are &lsquo;constructs&lsquo; more or less useful when they are &lsquo;dissonant&rsquo;; and, anyway, where do student and client &lsquo;attributions&rsquo; figure in any of this?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll know other theories, and they will raise other issues.</p>
<p>Stacking finding upon finding doesn&rsquo;t resolve any of the issues.&nbsp; We need another way of organising our ideas.&nbsp; And career learning has a place in one of three distinctive perspectives on learning-for-living.&nbsp; The perspectives are ...</p>
<ul>
<li>learning development, calling on our theoretical knowledge</li>
<li>programme delivery, calling on how we practically help</li>
<li>learning-for-living, calling on student and client experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Career-learning theory is in the third line - it is what students and clients do, which is different from what we think and what we say.&nbsp; People conduct their lives with or without the benefit of our theoretical expertise and practical help.&nbsp; And career-learning theory distinctively seeks to understand how people make use of whatever they find - whether they find that with us or in some other way.&nbsp; Its authority is their experience rather than our expertise.&nbsp; Career-learning thinking completes a partnership between our theory, its practice and their reality.</p>
<p>________________________<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. learning for living - part of a wider understanding</strong></p>
<p>Everybody is capable of framing and reframing what they learn.&nbsp; It is part of our species&rsquo; fingerhold on survival - finding out what is going on and figuring out what to do about it.&nbsp; It is a constant process of linking what people find to what they do - on the savannah, on the street and <a title="Colonist" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/EVColonist.pdf" target="_blank">on-line</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A requirement for such learning is <a title="storyboarding" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank">transfer</a> (pages 19-21): it means that what is learned in one place is used in another.&nbsp; It links reminders in the learning to experience in the life.&nbsp; Without those links learning is not carried from where it is learned to where it is used, and - therefore - is not learning-for-living.</p>
<p>There is more: that internalising and embedding of experience becomes part of an <a title="storyboarding" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank">embodied identity</a> (pages 21-22).&nbsp; It is manifested in the physical presence of one person with another - we call it &lsquo;body language&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And so...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;learning reminding me of life - and life reminding me of learning&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;what I find in experience&rsquo; - &lsquo;becomes as much me as a fingerprint&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>and means &lsquo;finding out&rsquo;&nbsp; - &lsquo;sorting out&rsquo; - &lsquo;checking out&rsquo; - &lsquo;figuring out&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Career learning is a third element in that triad - here set out in conversational terms.&nbsp; In that position career learning is part of a day-on-day entwined process - learning something useful..., embedding it..., transfering it to where it will make a difference.... &nbsp;</p>
<p>The technical account of that conversational process is...</p>
<ul>
<li>transferring learning to life</li>
<li>gathering and internalising a way of seeing</li>
<li>sensing and then sifting and then focusing and then understanding</li>
</ul>
<p>How distinctive is the career-learning process?:&nbsp; it is progressive - each step preparing the way for each succeeding step.&nbsp; And that progression expands the &lsquo;how-do-you-know?&rsquo; question into a bases for self interrogation...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;enough to go on?&rsquo;&nbsp; &gt; &lsquo;sorted out?&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; &lsquo;what needs probing?&rsquo;&nbsp; &gt; &lsquo;how it can work out?&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>It is also generic:&nbsp; there really is no boundary to how many &rsquo;who?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what?&rsquo;, &lsquo;where?&rsquo;, &lsquo;when?&rsquo;, &lsquo;why?&rsquo; and &lsquo;how?&rsquo; questions that search can generate.&nbsp; And everything else that happens in that triadic process depends on the effectiveness of that scrutiny - &lsquo;what is fact?&rsquo;, &lsquo;...opinion?&rsquo;, &lsquo;...useful?&rsquo;, &lsquo;...credible?&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But this is not a content-free process - there is no such thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; A person is reminded in the learning of how it can concretely be used in life.&nbsp; But the person is invited to pose the process questions - thinking less about &lsquo;what do I believe and do?&rsquo;, more about &lsquo;what makes it worth believing and doing?&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. working through confusion - out of the comfort zone</strong></p>
<p>Learning is never entirely comfortable, and significant learning can be seriously disturbing.&nbsp; One of the primary research-based sources concerning learning-for-living is <a title="CLTupdate" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf" target="_blank">Jean Piaget</a> (page 10).&nbsp; He sets learning in a context of experience, he sees what happens as a process of construct building, and he sets out learning as a stage-by-stage process.&nbsp; It is not surprising to find his work constantly revisited.&nbsp; And he sees confusion and discomfort as an essential&nbsp; feature of learning - he calls it &lsquo;disequalibrium&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of that discomfort concerns other people.&nbsp; An extensive collation of <a title="CIT" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcit.pdf" target="_blank">evidence on community influences</a> shows how people take account of other people's needs, feelings and interests in managing their own careers - even where it may limit their own life chances.</p>
<p>However internalised learning may be, talk of &lsquo;decision-making skills&rsquo; takes too little account of real-life struggles.&nbsp; It is not easy to let go of attachments to others, in trying to accommodate a promising new future.&nbsp; And it is no less of a struggle to assimilate new ways of seeing things, when the need to hold on to what the past has valued still feels so right.</p>
<p>Career learning does not evade such disequalibrium, it works through it.&nbsp; And it does so to a point where, whatever is held onto and whatever is let go, something new becomes possible. &nbsp;Whether experience is chaotic or just complex and confusing, it enables people with ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; And without that kind of adaptability there is no prospect of social mobility...&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;change in my life&rsquo; - &lsquo;..neighbourhood&rsquo; - &lsquo;...country&rsquo; - &lsquo;...the planet&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;my people...&rsquo; - &lsquo;background...&rsquo; -&nbsp; &lsquo;experience...&rsquo; - &lsquo;...overlooked&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;bad feelings...&rsquo; - &lsquo;...question' - &lsquo;...hold-on if I will - &lsquo;...let go if I must&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>The career-learning part of this process is a <a title="Colonist" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/EVColonist.pdf" target="_blank">critical and self critical</a> tool (pages 11-13).&nbsp; It equips people with a willingness to interrogate one&rsquo;s own life in such terms...</p>
<ul>
<li>from the personal to the planetary</li>
<li>for ready-for-anything flexibility</li>
<li>in holding on and letting go</li>
</ul>
<p>Education must not allow itself to fall into a position of helping most those whose experience best positions them to cope with change.&nbsp; It would mean helping least those who most need our help.&nbsp; The need for flexibility in dealing with unforeseen change is greatest among <a title="professionalism.pdf" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" target="_blank">the poor and the dispossessed</a> (pages 16-20). &nbsp;</p>
<p>And for education professionals, not working with the career-learning processes of both holding on and letting go, means that twenty years of experience can be no more than one year of experience repeated twenty times.</p>
<p>________________________</p>
<p><strong>4. re-positioning careers work - claiming your future</strong></p>
<p>There is no future for this work in trying to revitalise twentieth-century answers to twenty-first century questions.&nbsp; What people face is different, the sources they go to are different, and whom they defer to is different.&nbsp; And if they are changing the way they learn then education must change the way it helps.</p>
<p>But there is here an issue for independent professionalism: what people find immediately credible is not all that careers work has to offer.&nbsp; And, as every dietician knows, what people seek is not always what they need...</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;coach me for the race&rsquo; - &lsquo;invite me on a journey&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&nbsp;&lsquo;following others&rsquo; - &lsquo;wondering about celebrities&rsquo; - &lsquo;making a distinctive self&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>&nbsp;&lsquo;gut dealing with conflict&rsquo; - &lsquo;heart speaking to chaos&rsquo; - &lsquo;my story finding its point&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>The word &lsquo;career&rsquo; has its own <a title="metaphor" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/mkngtwork/cafimages.pdf" target="_blank">metaphors</a> for this: one conjures images of &lsquo;careering&rsquo; around a race-track, another pictures people travelling in a &lsquo;carriage&rsquo;.&nbsp; But the people are more likely to buy the more immediate rewards of winning a race.&nbsp; Yet it is journeying which finds the richer and deeper experience of life, and it is journeying which is more inclusive.&nbsp; A journey can contain a race, but a race will not contain a journey.&nbsp; There can be dissonance between what people seek and what we offer.</p>
<p>The uses of <a title="storyboarding" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank">narrative</a> may be a way in.&nbsp; Experience can only be set down as narrative.&nbsp; And it is plot or genre which gives a story its meaning, and meaning that gives a life its point.&nbsp; Indeed, there are said to be &lsquo;<a title="storyboarding" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank">basic plots</a>&rsquo; (pages 10-11), and they are thought to relate ready-made meanings.&nbsp; It is what myths, legends, parables, fables and fairy-tales do.&nbsp; But, however many fairy-tales a person might indulge, the spur to purpose in life comes from how we each learn to tell our own story - and attribute our own meaning to it.&nbsp; Even recruiters understand that they do not need to listen to another fairy-tale, they need to hear something which is about this person as it is about no other.&nbsp; Like it or not, that will attract their attention and stick in their memory.</p>
<p>This is why career-learning thinking is not completed, until a draft autobiography is probed with those &rsquo;who?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what?&rsquo;, &lsquo;where?&rsquo;, &lsquo;when?&rsquo;, &lsquo;why?&rsquo; and &lsquo;how?&rsquo; questions.&nbsp; The <a title="storyboarding" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank">questioning philosophy</a> of career-learning thinking invites people to construct their own story.&nbsp; They can tell of instinct and intuition, meaning and purpose and springboards for action...</p>
<ul>
<li>of mainly a journey, sometimes a race</li>
<li>in an autobiography, not a fairy tale</li>
<li>established through critical, and self-critical, questioning</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a basis for claiming one&rsquo;s stake in society.&nbsp; And, once learned, it is indefinitely re-usable, for learning in any sphere of life.</p>
<p>Returning to an educator's role, its life-long and life-wide scope makes career-learning theory applicable to any topic, for any programme, in any setting.&nbsp; And if management constraints on programme development will not allow the <a title="space&place" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf" target="_blank">space-and-place</a> this works needs, then learning-for-living can <a title="professionalism.pdf" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" target="_blank">move out of conventional &lsquo;education&rsquo; settings</a> (pages 24-27), into others more realistically linked to what is going on in people&rsquo;s lives - from the personal to the planetary.</p>
<p>Re-positioned students and clients means re-positioning the helper.&nbsp; And one of the most valuable skills that a trained career adviser and educator can bring to that programme is the ability to pose and enable <a title="Colonist" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/EVColonist.pdf" target="_blank">awkward questions</a> (pages 10-13)- which is at the heart of career-learning theory.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a long job, so there&rsquo;s no time to lose.&nbsp; But innovation in education does not mean being 'kwick-and-eazy' - it means being useful, appropriate and sustainable.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you say?</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The 'map my programme' tool employs a set of free google apps to graphically display all the hand-in dates for each course /unit/module and display, in real time, the types of assessment used across a programme and the effect of that assessment has on the learning journey of the students at any one point as well as the marking load for the academic. It can also be used to see if there is duplication of effort, or synergy bewteen courses. Core to this process are the dates when formative and summative assessments are set and subsequently submitted – students do not want to have a bunching of coursework and staff need to manage their workload! You can download guidance materials and request a trial at: http://www.mapmyprogramme.com/</p>
<p>There is no charge for using this tool but you will need a google account. </p>]]></description>

Aunque sin saber a ciencia cierta si ser&aacute; de la educaci&oacute;n como la conocemos ahora o si ser&aacute; aquello de los &lsquo;no lugares&rsquo;, de la educaci&oacute;n invisible.</p>
<blockquote style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Va a cambiar todo y por ello hay que repensar y redefinir la educaci&oacute;n.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Al hablar de Twitter, es tajante al se&ntilde;alar que obviamente &eacute;sta&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->no es una red social, sino una herramienta de comunicaci&oacute;n</strong>. Al tratarse de una herramienta que re&uacute;ne a la gente, categoriza que lo que importa realmente es lo que la sociedad quiere, c&oacute;mo quiere hacerlo. La sociedad es la que debe dictaminar lo que se ha de hacer. Desde esta &oacute;ptica, los modelos educativos se tienen que redefinir, y en la deseducaci&oacute;n podr&iacute;a estar la repuesta&hellip; deseducar es una forma de educar, sin embargo, para concretar lo que se ha de hacer se debe considerar que estamos en otra &eacute;poca y esta &eacute;poca tiene a&uacute;n que redefinir por d&oacute;nde quiere ir.</p>
<blockquote style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Las tecnolog&iacute;as de hoy son mucho m&aacute;s hipermedia, mucho m&aacute;s transmedia, lo que hace que la expansi&oacute;n de conocimientos y aprendizajes se transmita de una manera mucho m&aacute;s exponencial, viral, por lo tanto las tecnolog&iacute;as s&iacute; que van a condicionar las maneras de educar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Respecto a la educaci&oacute;n disruptiva, indica Juan Domingo Farn&oacute;s que la disrupci&oacute;n puede ser voluntaria o no voluntaria, es decir, Ivan Illich aboga por la desescolarizaci&oacute;n, como tambi&eacute;n lo hac&iacute;a Freinet. Roger Schank tambi&eacute;n aboga por lo mismo. Juan Domingo dice no abogar por una desescolarizaci&oacute;n total sino por una libertad de educaci&oacute;n, es m&aacute;s, aboga por que la sociedad diga lo que quiera hacer.</p>
<blockquote style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&iquest;La disrupci&oacute;n es&nbsp;<a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; color: #006600; text-decoration: underline; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-bottom-color: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wwwhatsnew.com/2012/07/22/disruptir-en-la-educacion…-mucho-mas-que-innovar/">innovaci&oacute;n</a>? Para nada! Innovar es mejorar lo que hay y disrupci&oacute;n quiere decir crear otra cosa. Esta sociedad es otra sociedad, y como es otra sociedad no tiene por qu&eacute; seguir los pasos anteriores. Si de algunas maneras Gutenberg con los libros logr&oacute; hacer otra sociedad, internet tambi&eacute;n ha logrado hacer otra sociedad. Lo que pasa es que estamos en un tiempo en el que no sabemos hacia d&oacute;nde vamos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Para Farn&oacute;s,<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;la escuela y la universidad se caracterizan por no ser disruptivas para nada</strong>, por el contrario presentan una educaci&oacute;n formal, curricular, obligatoria, con competencias, con&nbsp;<a style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; color: #006600; text-decoration: underline; border-bottom-style: dotted; border-bottom-color: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://wwwhatsnew.com/2012/07/22/disruptir-en-la-educacion…-mucho-mas-que-innovar/">objetivos</a>, todos totalmente predecibles y totalmente alejados de lo que es la sociedad, es decir, que si antes la escuela estaba alejada de la sociedad, ahora lo est&aacute; m&aacute;s, y contrario a esto, la educaci&oacute;n se debe basar en la libertad de las personas y de las comunidades. Incluso la palabra educaci&oacute;n puede ser redefinida</p>]]></description>

              <title>questions for learning and work - and three-scene storyboarding</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6410</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com" target="_blank"><em>The Career-learning Caf&eacute;</em></a></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the relationship between learning and work?&nbsp; Does the one...</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; determine the other?... inform the other?...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ignore the other?... distort the other?... </em></p>
<p>Or what?:&nbsp; 'work' and 'learning' are two massively abstract nouns, offering plenty of room for argument about the terms in which we make them concrete.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>professionalism, partnerships and conflicts of interest </strong></p>
<p>Programmes like <a title="sure start" href="http://www.everychildmattersbook.co.uk/chapters/every-child-matters-childrens-centres" target="_blank">Sure-start</a> and <a title="sure start" href="http://www.everychildmattersbook.co.uk/chapters/every-child-matters-childrens-centres" target="_blank">Every Child Matters</a> build from an appreciation of personal, family and community needs.&nbsp; They are commonly thought of as best located in the public sector.&nbsp; Whereas current UK policies look for private-sector ways of meeting the demands of commerce, competitiveness and employers. &nbsp;<a title="human resources" href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=6&ved=0CFwQFjAF&url=http://dasta.uoi.gr/fedora/images/stories/17_06_ws_phacking.pdf&ei=vBMJUIPbB6Gb0QWo-eDiCg&usg=AFQjCNGh0V-tLtDhJ6UAwyVd-3yEuf_QmQ&sig2=4OVb0WBXyiQHCfgDpwGuDw" target="_blank">Some argue</a> for a tighter fit between learning and work.&nbsp; Some go further, proposing that commerce-based human resources and education-based careers work can be one profession.</p>
<p><a title="G4S&A4E" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/17/g4s-privatisation-racket-outsourcing-revulsion" target="_blank">Headlines</a> reflect the depth of feeling about such issues.&nbsp; On the one hand is shock at the commercial exploitation of workers, the fraudulent use of public resources and the distortions caused by market competitiveness.&nbsp; On the other are impassioned complaints that a publicly-funded but out-of-touch education system fails to bring people to any readiness for work in a competitive global marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s a question...</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who sets the agenda for learning and work?</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about how careers are best managed.&nbsp; And both careers-work and human-resource professionals feature.&nbsp; Careers work can readily be seen as feeding into a process which human resources extends.&nbsp; And Philip Brown and Anthony Hesketh <a title="Brown and Hesketh" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Mismanagement-Talent-Employability-Knowledge/dp/0199269548/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1342796529&sr=1-3-fkmr1" target="_blank">(2004)</a> show how the unifiers may have a point; there is overlap between the two activities: in training for comparable qualifications; in comfortably frequenting the same associations and conferences; and in how much of the theory of the one is also the theory of the other.&nbsp; Also, they are bound together by the same recurring question...</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when it comes to work-life, who gets to do what?</em></p>
<p>The <a title="professionalism.pdf" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" target="_blank">professionalism</a> of careers work has, for much if its life, been developed to match and shape people for working life. &nbsp;But juxtaposing Sure-start and the competitiveness agenda illustrates a wider range of <a title="philosophies" href="http://bit.ly/tqTbgI" target="_blank">underlying</a> political, philosophical and cultural thinking which it could take on board.&nbsp; That greater complexity demands supplementary questions - such as...</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who controls the career-management agenda?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acting in whose interest?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; how much do the rest of us get to know about it</em>?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such an interrogation is part of a due process for scrutinising justice in the system.&nbsp; It calls on many voices: students and clients thinking about their futures; families and acquaintances maximising their own people&rsquo;s life chances, professionals asserting their own necessity, employers recruiting the best people they can find.&nbsp; There is conflict-of-interest, privilege and injustice here.&nbsp; And, as <a title="Wilkinson and Picket" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spirit-Level-Societies-Almost-Always/dp/1846140390/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1342797293&sr=1-1" target="_blank"> </a>Richard Wilkinson and Kate Picket <a title="Wilkinson and Picket" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spirit-Level-Societies-Almost-Always/dp/1846140390/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1342797293&sr=1-1" target="_blank">(2009)</a> show, no civilised society can afford to evade any of it.</p>
<p><strong>work, learning and the uses of narrative</strong></p>
<p>But there are also the makings of a deeper partnership: careers-work and human-resource people share a time-line.&nbsp; Careers work sets in motion a process which is continued by human-resource-development.&nbsp; The former front-loads into the latter.&nbsp; A <a title="hrhfigure" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/hrhfigure.pdf" target="_blank">diagram</a> can follow that time-line through its learning-and-understanding and selection-and-recruitment phases.</p>
<p>The process is by stages - of hours, days or months.&nbsp; But the diagram has a second dimension. &nbsp;Sometimes it touches on concerns for quality-of-life concerning the family, community and other aspects of well-being.&nbsp; Sometimes it is concerned for this individual showing-up in good shape for recruitment or selection.&nbsp; In parallel with Sure-start and competitive thinking, these are different understandings of career-management concerns.&nbsp; And they can be in conflict.</p>
<p>Three-scene storyboarding is designed to set down those concerns and any of its conflicts. &nbsp;The format and process poses a series of &lsquo;who?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what?&rsquo;, &lsquo;where?&rsquo;, &lsquo;how?&rsquo;, &lsquo;when?&rsquo; and &lsquo;why?&rsquo; questions.&nbsp; It is a narrative technique, using words-and-graphics to enable people to learn from the past in anticipation of the future. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s no need to go into detail here - an account of <a title="storyboarding" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank">storyboarding</a> will tell you more.&nbsp; But telling any story can show how, over time, an episode moves a person through such concerns.&nbsp; Users are encouraged to interrogate their own stories - they learn to probe for justice.&nbsp; Sometimes that means seeking for possibilities, it could be along the lines...</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how will I know when I&rsquo;ve found what I need?<br /></em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why does that have special meaning to me?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what would it mean for anybody else important to me? </em></p>
<p>Sometimes it is looking for competitive advantage...</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how do I give myself an edge?<br /></em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is demanded of me?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who am I dealing with? </em></p>
<p>The two-by-two <a title="hrhfigure" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/hrhfigure.pdf" target="_blank">diagram</a> illustrates how a time-lined narrative can be woven between both sets of concerns.</p>
<p><strong>bases for partnership</strong></p>
<p>Both career and human-resource professionals can engage with storyboarding.&nbsp; Their clients and students can use it as a way of setting out the inter-dependence of quality-of-life and competitive concerns.&nbsp; It does not work like conventional diagnostic assessment tools, and it does not replace such techniques.&nbsp; It has a distinctive way of working, which suggests a more fully interactive partnership between careers-work and human-resource professionals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two career-management agendas shade into each other: some careers workers give a lot of attention to recruitment issues, and some firms invest significant resources in staff development.&nbsp; But different things are going on here - and the differences embed tensions which both sides need to acknowledge...</p>
<ul>
<li>quality-of-life requires disclosure</li>
<li>competitiveness means looking good</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _____________________________</p>
<ul>
<li>quality-of-life examines the needs of self and other people important to me</li>
<li>competitiveness pursues employability for economic productivity</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _____________________________</p>
<ul>
<li>quality-of-life is about the meaning attributed to experience by me and mine</li>
<li>competitiveness is about meaning and purpose attributed by stockholders, managers and customers</li>
</ul>
<p>These are overlapping concerns, and there is no necessary conflict between them.&nbsp; But they are different starting points for thinking about career management.&nbsp; And, as any person who has considered issues for work-life-balance knows, there can be tensions.&nbsp; There is no single interest group which can frame the resolution of such issues.&nbsp; Gill Frigerio, Richard Mendez and Phil McCash <a title="McCash" href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/careerstudies" target="_blank">(2012)</a> show how work-related learning can be made to connect to the variety of perspectives taken by students.&nbsp; The resolution belongs to students and clients, and to their families, and to other stakeholders - and not to schools, to employers, or to governments.</p>
<p>Storyboarding can narrate all of this.&nbsp; It was designed to be used in education settings, but it is being used in the business world.&nbsp; Whether students and clients are visiting a firm, or already a part of its staff, it is useful for formulating an account of...</p>
<ul>
<li>one&rsquo;s own experience</li>
<li>the experience of other people working in the firm</li>
<li>the distinctive voice needed for this person&rsquo;s recruitment or advancement</li>
</ul>
<p>Storyboarding needs to be engaged organisation-by-organisation - it calls for local knowledge to inform different implementation in different settings.&nbsp; But, that said, it can bring...</p>
<ul>
<li>feedback to programme managers setting up learning events</li>
<li>an understanding of how people see that working life</li>
<li>distinctive appreciations needed by the organisation</li>
</ul>
<p>These are, then, resources for learning, recruitment and staff development.&nbsp; There is a need to protect people&rsquo;s right to privacy.&nbsp; But it is not beyond the wit of an ethical professionalism to anonymise documents, and to allow for personally-controlled versions of what is disclosed.&nbsp; The account of <a title="storyboarding" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank">storyboarding</a> shows how it can provide quantifiable data as frequencies.</p>
<p>The account also shows how partnerships with and between organisations can be expanded. &nbsp;It offers hope of enlarged bases for mutual comprehension between all stakeholders in how the &lsquo;who-get-to-do-what&rsquo; question is answered.&nbsp; &nbsp;Educators, employers, managers and workers need not be strangers to each other.&nbsp; Storyboarding might have got started in education settings, but if it proves able to do no more than what has been described here, that would justify its innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This presentation examines the experience of learning with technology in relation to context.&nbsp; To ensure that the technology enhances learning rather than impedes it, we need to understand context from the perspective of the learner.&nbsp; We propose four perspectives on context: <em>learning in context</em>; <em>learning through context</em>; <em>learning about context</em>; and <em>learning despite context</em>. These should not be seen as mutually exclusive; rather, they indicate a need for integrative and adaptive technology that supports learners in their efforts to understand and respond to changing contexts as they construct meaning within and across time, space and social settings.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6357</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6357</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>iTunes U was launched in 2007 as a repository of digital educational material provided by Universities in the US.&nbsp; In 2008 the OU joined the service and now hosts more than 350 collections of materials (audio, video, eBooks).&nbsp; Since its launch, iTunes U has delivered over 300 million downloads.&nbsp; Of these, 34 million are from iTunes U at the OU.&nbsp; Despite its popularity, little is known about the type of user who downloads iTunes U resources, or their use of the resources.&nbsp; This paper will present the results of a major survey of users of iTunes U at the OU.&nbsp; The survey ran for 20 months and collected more than 2000 responses.&nbsp; The paper will provide data on the kind of user who downloads iTunes U at the OU resources, what they do with the materials they download, and what they think of them as a learning resource.</p>
<p>The popularity of portable media players and podcasting has increased enormously in the last few years. Some researchers were quick to identify the potential uses and benefits of podcasting for learning. Among these is the fact that the materials are delivered in a format that is portable, convenient and easy to use as well as easy to access. To a large extent, the quick take-up of podcasting as a new technology was due to the success of the iTunes software for the delivery and management of audiovisual resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; iTunes U was launched in 2007 as a repository of digital educational material provided by Universities in the US.&nbsp; In 2008 the OU joined the service and now hosts around 400 collections of materials.&nbsp; Since its launch, iTunes U at the OU has delivered over 52 million downloads.</p>
<p>The fact that a large number of resources are regularly added to iTunes U by top universities worldwide has been heralded as a new way of providing unprecedented access to lectures and materials created by top experts in their fields.&nbsp; In most cases, the materials have been designed with the universities' own students in mind, but when they are uploaded to iTunes U, they find new and different audiences.&nbsp; Effectively, the providers are teaching strangers.&nbsp; Whereas previous literature on podcasting has focused on users who utilise resources provided by their own lecturers, little is known about the end-users of iTunes U resources and what they do with them.</p>
<p>This paper reveals some characteristics of the iTunes U user through a large survey which was carried out over 2 months and collected over 2000 responses.&nbsp; It provides a profile of the end user, their practices and opinions about materials. The data shows that the type of user who downloads iTunes U resources in this context is very different from the users and practices described in the literature so far.&nbsp; This profile of the iTunes U user provides a clearer picture of the target listener and can help inform and improve the materials design and delivery strategies for iTunes U.</p>]]></description>

              <title>The ‘Gamification’ of GIS for teaching and learning</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6356</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6356</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Geographic information systems (GIS) are powerful tools that help us make sense of geographic data. These systems take different forms, ranging from functionally simple interfaces (e.g. Google Maps) to complex, comprehensive analytical toolkits (e.g. ESRI ArcGIS), but all of them let us integrate, manipulate, analyse and also visualise geographically referenced data from disparate sources.&nbsp; Hence, a GIS allows us to put geographic data into context.&nbsp; The result is accessible geographic information that helps us make decisions and solve a wide range of spatial problems.</p>
<p>In particular, a GIS can support &lsquo;sensemaking&rsquo; for teaching and learning purposes through contextualising information and scaffolding small group augmentations.&nbsp; Furthermore, mobile GIS can increase sensemaking by linking abstract concepts <em>in-situ</em> to fieldwork activities.&nbsp; The elements of GIS that appear to be particular beneficial for teaching and learning are those that relate to the whole learning experience and how a learner develops their conceptual understanding through that experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the efficiency and usability of these systems has been limited by a poor understanding of exactly how GIS relates to the learner&rsquo;s experience and their developing conceptual understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast to GIS, games systems have focused research on understanding the gamer&rsquo;s experience and, when used for learning purposes, their supported progression through understanding concepts.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gamification&rsquo; has been employed as a term to describe the process of bringing gaming elements into the design of non-gaming systems.&nbsp; These elements can vary from the simplistic use of reward and reputation systems (badges, points, levels, leaderboards) to abstract concepts of &lsquo;funology&rsquo;.&nbsp; More recent research has merged gaming with virtual world research to unpick cognitive issues relevant to the design of systems for learning and sensemaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This paper presents work-in-progress with results from 118 participants in an online questionnaire detailing spatial concepts for GIS system.&nbsp; These are related to the design of GIS for learners&rsquo; experiences and their conceptual understanding.&nbsp; Finally, initial developments and walkthroughs will be presented on the gamification of GIS with GIS maps translated into 3D gaming and virtual worlds.&nbsp; Discussions around the roles of &lsquo;flow&rsquo;, &lsquo;immersion&rsquo; and &lsquo;1<sup>st</sup> person perspectives&rsquo; for GIS experiences will be explored.</p>]]></description>

              <title>change and careers work - a paradigm shuffle?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6313</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6313</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Career-learning Caf&eacute;</em></a></p>
<p>The opening paragraph in an article on change, like this one, is where you can expect to read about unfulfilled predictions of change.&nbsp; They are blind alleys, such as these...</p>
<ol>
<li>an anticipation that came to nothing;</li>
<li>an innovation that turned out not to be new;</li>
<li>a social change that petered out;</li>
<li>a warning dismissed as fraudulent;</li>
<li>some engineering that wobbled or collapsed;</li>
<li>some science that was never replicated.</li>
</ol>
<p>They make popular stories because they are reassuring.&nbsp; The doom-mongers were wrong.&nbsp; So were the romantic optimists.&nbsp; Life goes on.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re still struggling, but we&rsquo;re still here...</p>
<p align="center"><em>plus &ccedil;a change, plus c&rsquo;est la m&eacute;me chose</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a comfort.&nbsp; And - in case you need it - this article makes six attempts to get you out of that comfort zone.</p>
<p><strong><em>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an anticipation that is dangerously right</em></strong></p>
<p>Social ethnographer Gillian Tett is among the few commentators to predict the credit crunch.&nbsp; The few documented risk-avoidance in financial services.&nbsp; But the many took no notice, because the anticipation didn&rsquo;t fit with neo-liberal assumptions - about commercial expansion making everything possible.&nbsp; So the few were set aside.&nbsp; But they were right.</p>
<p>The consequences for work-life are out-of-control.&nbsp; And the damage to government budgeting is making public-service careers work close-to-impossible to maintain.&nbsp; Indeed, private careers-coaching is taking over - it&rsquo;s already a big-dollar global industry.&nbsp; Would you say that any of this is worth our professional careers-work attention?</p>
<p><strong><em>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an innovation that changes how people learn</em></strong></p>
<p>Practically everything is getting digitised - from friendship to fine art.&nbsp; We can digitise relationships, games, and subversion.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s wrong with that?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s how people find out what&rsquo;s going on, and figure out what to do about it.&nbsp; They can update by the hour - and often need to. &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s easy to think of all this as no more than a useful tool - nothing to worry about, more of an opportunity than a challenge.</p>
<p>And, for a time careers work colonised it, exporting what it does into its new handy formats - word-processors, data-bases, spreadsheets.&nbsp; But people may well feel now that they&rsquo;re getting as much information and advice as they need - and in interactive formats.&nbsp; And that digital territory is not only occupied by inhabitants, it is invaded by predators.&nbsp; Professional careers workers can best help by enabling them critically to interrogate the information and influences they find.&nbsp; Time, do you think, to nail the myth that the digitised can replace the direct-and-personal professional?</p>
<p><strong><em>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a social change that brings cultural turbulence</em></strong></p>
<p>In a stagnant economy opportunity becomes a zero-sum game - one person&rsquo;s gain is another&rsquo;s loss.&nbsp; Life gets more competitive.&nbsp; People pull back into a protected spaces.&nbsp; We become strangers to each other.&nbsp; Experience is documented as turbulent - unconnected, uncivil, unpredictable, and unsafe.&nbsp; &Eacute;lites become suspect:&nbsp; politicos, attorneys, academics, and even medicos are second-guessed.&nbsp; But we like to remember that we are social animals.&nbsp; So, no worries, it&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re good at adapting to necessity.</p>
<p>But surely work-life is nothing if not social.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it done with, for and in response to other people?&nbsp; Yes, but with a tighter and more immediate focus - &lsquo;me&rsquo;, &lsquo;my family&rsquo; and &lsquo;our kin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Conventional career-planning doesn&rsquo;t fit to that. &nbsp;And the background turbulence - some say &lsquo;chaos&rsquo; - seems to undermine the possibility of a plan.&nbsp; Well, maybe not entirely; but, if not, isn&rsquo;t it time to re-think what we can offer?</p>
<p><strong><em>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warnings that we dare not ignore </em></strong></p>
<p>The most persistent warnings we hear concern well-being and risk - for communities, species and the biosphere.&nbsp; But such warnings are easily neutralised - by well-placed outfits whose interests are threatened.&nbsp; Anything can be rubbished by drawing on sponsored research, yielding large-sample &lsquo;significance&rsquo;, promoted by client-compliant consultants.&nbsp; The issues get ducked.</p>
<p>Is it possible that careers work colludes with some of this?&nbsp; The diagnostic apparatus of employability plays to the interests of competitive marketing.&nbsp; And labour-market information doesn&rsquo;t include ratings of work-life&rsquo;s carbon footprints.&nbsp; And this is not just about emissions.&nbsp; Damage is done to African villages, developing-world sweatshops, and home neighbourhoods - where lives are blighted and people are discarded.&nbsp; Careers work deals in such consequences - from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; Any need, might we wonder, to re-think what we mean by independent assessment and impartial information?</p>
<p><strong><em>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; engineering that changes more than we think</em></strong></p>
<p>Alan Turing invented what we now call the computer.&nbsp; He also designed a test for knowing whether computers are intelligent - a test that no computer has ever passed.&nbsp; But global corporations use the technology to transfer gazillions of dollars from one side of the globe to the other - in micro-seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, as you may have noticed, the same technology can quickly off-load any risk.&nbsp; But global corporations smile the same smiles, and make the same promises.</p>
<p>Corporate wealth can exceed government wealth several times over.&nbsp; And the processing speed and power of computers explains much of that policy weakness and corporate strength.&nbsp; The rebalancing of power is transforming the working world - access to markets, cheap labour, polarised incomes, economic migration and global shifts in dominance.&nbsp; Would that kind of information be of any use or interest to your students and clients?&nbsp; Would it still be careers work?</p>
<p><strong><em>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; science that changes everything</em></strong></p>
<p>For the big scientific news we need to go back to Charles Darwin.&nbsp; His ideas never supported crude doctrines for the survival of the fittest.&nbsp; But genetics and neurology has transformed psychological, sociological and economic thinking.&nbsp; Nonetheless, at first his book <em>The Origin of Species</em> was thought to be useful to pigeon fanciers but ecclesiastically unacceptable.&nbsp; A kindly man, he had a bad time with it.</p>
<p>But he changed how we know ourselves - and knowing ourselves is a central careers-work concern.&nbsp; The behaviour sciences that Charles Darwin has most influenced are the three that careers work most persistently calls on.&nbsp; Genetics is transforming the way we can talk about consciousness, freedom and autonomy.&nbsp; None can any longer mean what we used to mean by decision-making.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re catching-up - but slowly.</p>
<p><strong><em>where do we go from here?</em></strong></p>
<p>Those times, they were a-changing - more than Bob Dylan, and a lot of other people, ever knew.&nbsp; The most dangerous negations of change rely on habits-of-mind - which are as dangerous for the future of careers work as for any.&nbsp; We need to re-shape our expertise and re-state our credibility.&nbsp; Might that mean....&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;re-positioning ourselves in relation to government and corporate interests?</li>
<li>&nbsp;shifting focus from an authoritative content to a questioning process?</li>
<li>establishing the social enterprises needed following world-wide privatisation?</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be a start on a radically changing story.&nbsp; And we need that story to be distinctive - separating us from predation and constraint, and pursuing ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;career&rsquo; offers such a narrative.&nbsp; It means both &lsquo;race&rsquo; and &lsquo;journey&rsquo;.&nbsp; Two stories, but one has the bigger and more distinctive idea.&nbsp; The clue is this: we can interrupt a journey with a race, but we can&rsquo;t interrupt a race with a journey.&nbsp; The smaller idea can be carried by the bigger one.</p>
<p>And the only possible format for setting out a journey is a narrative.&nbsp; So, are you sitting uncomfortably?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve guessed that I doubt that we&rsquo;ve done enough on extending the careers-work story.&nbsp; There have been, it&rsquo;s true, one or two attempts to characterise careers-work development as a paradigm shift.&nbsp; But they are exaggerated: more-of-the-same, but decorated with flattering bells and enticing whistles.&nbsp; A paradigm shift is a lot more troublesome than that.&nbsp; Charles Darwin finally faced it.&nbsp; <em>The Descent of Man</em> doesn&rsquo;t do much for pigeon fanciers - but it changes everything else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll find out soon enough whether or not we are facing a paradigm shift.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re bound to notice.&nbsp; My bet is that, at the very least, we&rsquo;re on a paradigm shuffle.</p>

              <title>IET TCM Event: The nQuire system for Personal Inquiry Learning </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6146</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6146</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:&nbsp;</strong>Personal Inquiry was a 3 year project between the OU and the University of Nottingham, funded by the ESRC and EPSRC, to develop and evaluate personally engaging science learning. The project developed the nQuire toolkit to guide and support the entire inquiry learning process, starting in a classroom setting, continuing at home or outdoors, and finishing with viewing and sharing results back in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nQuire system is implemented under Drupal and runs on Windows, Apple, and Linux OS. Work on nQuire has continued since the end of the project, and it now consists of a web-based application with demonstrator inquiries, a downloadable version that can run on a variety of devices, and an authoring system to modify and create new inquiries. Although tested with children aged 11-14, the system is equally applicable to HE or to adult informal learning. I shall demonstrate nQuire, showing examples of the Healthy Eating and Microclimates inquiries, and how new inquiries can be authored.</p>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5296</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5296</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Steve Midgley is the&nbsp;Deputy Director of the Office of Education Technology at the United States Department of Education. At Open Nottingham he introduced&nbsp;the "Learning Registry"&nbsp;to help educators to find the resources they need in the format they need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>What is the Learning Registry?</strong></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->1. Lightweight API</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->2. No centralised infrastructure: no &ldquo;off&rdquo; switch</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->3. Control and accountability is local</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->4. No default winners: level the playing field</p>
<p>Digital learning resources are widely available, but hard to apply for teaching and learning.&nbsp;Educators and students already know about how best to use resources.</p>
<p>Users are leaving data trails but their usage data is often thrown away or locked up.&nbsp;Expertise is highly distributed. users are leaving data trails, but usage data is often thrown away or locked up.&nbsp;The universe of diffreent forms of data orbiting around learning resources.&nbsp;Types of data: paradata (data about data), metadata, analytical data, linked data, context all around the learning resource.&nbsp;A big opportunity in the education space to be able to go after this metadata &amp; paradata and get value from it.</p>
<p>New services can include better discovery, recommendations, curricular integration and measurements of quality&nbsp;</p>
<p>The developer should be able to take the prototype and build with it / over it.&nbsp;Let the community speak to itself through the timeline of the learning registry (common metadata timeline).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Key messages:</strong></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Make possible a &ldquo;do-ocracy&rdquo; for those who run the project. Welcoming anyone who wants to make a difference.</li>
<li>Let the community speak to itself through the timeline of the learning registry (common metadata timeline)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Avoid bureaucratic heat death. Do as little as possible, as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Investment of time is a strong currency in education.&nbsp;Time constraint for teachers to find the resources &ndash; make it easy for them.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Thi study is expected to identify and provide further understanding of key self- and co-regulated learning strategies that learners use when working on a given task in a computer-supported collaborative learning environment. Moreover, the study will help their learning strategies together in order to improve their academic performance as well as their motivation to learning science. Finally, the developed and validated questionnaire will be used to measure co-regulated learning behaviour in a collaborative learning setting.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The world is changing. <br />&nbsp;<br />Technologies are changing. <br />&nbsp;<br />Learning is changing. <br />&nbsp;<br />Our learners are changing. How they learn, where they learn and with whom they learn, all are changing. <br />&nbsp;<br />Web 2.0 technologies allow learners to remove the social, geographical and physical <br />barriers to communicate and learn with others. <br />&nbsp;<br />Mobile technologies allow learners to be more mobile and be able to access learning and learning communities in ways which have never been possible before. <br />&nbsp;<br />James has extensive experience of mobile learning and has a vision that goes beyond <br />mobile technologies and focuses on the mobility of the learner, blurring the demarcation <br />between formal and informal learning. His current vision for tertiary education <br />encompasses the use of Web 2.0 technologies embedded into an institutional VLE which can be accessed through mobile technologies. Allowing learners a focal point for their studying, whilst allowing the depth and breadth of Web 2.0 to bring a personalised learning experience to students at a time and space to suit them. For the future, James hopes that institutions and others will allow for a flexible, personalised, accessible learning experience for all.</p><p>Contact details: James Clay</p>]]></description>

<p><strong></strong>Ten really nice sites to support learning across different disciplines. Although aimed at school kids I can see that some of them, like livemocha - social networking for language learners - are equally valuable for adults. I am certainly going to take a closer look at VerbaLearn with my daughter.</p>]]></description>

<p>Some key points for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the past four years we have been shifting from evaluation for proof or accountability (&ldquo;Did the program work?&rdquo;) to evaluation for program improvement (&ldquo;What did we learn that can help us make the program better?&rdquo;).</li>
<li>We do not have a one-size-fits-all approach to monitoring and evaluation. </li>
<li>Balance and feedback are key here.&nbsp; How can we get the highest quality information we need, when we need it, to make the best program strategy decisions without undue burden of reporting among those we rely upon for data?</li>

<p>From the website:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->According to recent studies, young children learn best through social interaction. Andrew Meltzoff and his colleagues at the University of Washington are studying an emerging field called the "Science of Learning," which re-evaluates how children learn in formal and informal settings.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->"We're finding that social aspects of learning are very important at all ages," said Meltzoff, who explained that this is especially the case for young children who learn "most rapidly and most effectively from other people."</p>]]></description>

              <title>That which is designed and that which is naturally occurring</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>There are things that occur without or in spite of human intervention; there are things that</p>
<p>people bring into being; and then there are things that occur within the context of things people</p>
<p>have designed. The Grand Canyon in the USA&nbsp;is an example of something that has developed</p>
<p>without or in spite of human intervention. People have created dams and irrigation policies that</p>
<p>have made relatively minor changes to the canyon, when then continues to evolve after</p>
<p>those people made those changes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>People are learning naturally and without conscious effort throughout their waking hours. Then</p>
<p>instructional designers and educational planners come along and create environments and</p>
<p>tasks intended to further learning and contribute to what people know and can do. During these</p>
<p>activities, people do various things, some of which might be consisten with what planners had</p>
<p>in mind. After engaging in these designed activities, people go on learning, sometimes building</p>
<p>on those activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Perhaps this relates to Peter Goodyear's distinction between designing learning tasks and then</p>
<p>observing and recording what people do in carrying out those tasks as they engage in various</p>
<p>learning activities. The learning task is designed. The learning activity is an internal process</p>
<p>that is not designed in same way that the task is designed.</p><p>Contact details: mspector@uga.edu</p>]]></description>
