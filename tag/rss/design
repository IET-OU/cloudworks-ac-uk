              <title>Blair Frame - Childhood Studies Game Design Narrative</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8624</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8624</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This narrative shows the design of a scenario to improve students critical decision making.</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>Age: 18+ Level 4 (First year of University) Childhood Studies students at University College Birmingham. Lecturer was interested in how he could give the class an interactive scenario to help them improve decision / analysis skills.</p>
<p><strong>Material</strong></p>
<p>The scenario story itself has been written by the lecturer and is purely fictitious but draws heavily on his own experiences working within the world of education. We decided to use a programme called 'Articulate Storyline' to produce the work with myself doing all of the design and illustration work to make the scenario appealing to the students.</p>
<p><strong>Social</strong></p>
<p>The tutor is popular amongst staff and students and is well known for his innovative use of technology in his teaching. The students in the class get on well with each other and the tutor. This project was initiated and driven by the tutor as he wanted to find a new way to engage his students in an almost life like situation to test their attainment of knowledge from previous weeks of teaching.</p>
<p><strong>Intentional</strong></p>
<p><em>What are the protagonists beliefs, desires and intentions, which shape the problem space?</em></p>
<p>The tutor's initial reason for deciding to push this idea further was that he found the current way he was testing the students critical decision making skills did not provide clear enough evidence that they where actually learning anything. He wished to find an easier way to assess whether information he had given them had sunk in and he could see an outcome through the use of a scenario. His belief was that by offering them a realistic situation the students would start to take ownership of the knowledge and conditioning they had been taught by applying it to something they may have to deal with when they begin to work with children in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
<p>The goals of the scenario game where for students to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase their ability to make decisions.</li>
<li>Understand what information use or discard.</li>
<li>Improve their analysis skills to choose relevant information.</li>
<li>Learn how to take responsibility for their own actions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Students where asked to log onto the VLE in the lesson and open up the scenario game. They were then asked to play through the game spending 20 minutes reading the scenario itself and making notes.</li>
<li>Then they were asked to go to the next part of the game which showed the students 9 pieces of brief information in the form of a Headline.</li>
<li>They were then told to select only 3 pieces of information to look at by using the notes they have made - once they had selected the three info snippets they could look at the more in depth info that was hidden behind it.</li>
<li>When they have read through this expanded info they are asked to go to the final page and select an answer to the question posed in the scenario.</li>
<li>When they have answered, either if they have gotten it right or wrong they are provided with feedback on the scenario.</li>
<li>The student can play through the scenario as many times as they want.</li>
<li>The teacher then explained what the point of the exercise was to the students.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Obstacles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was hard to get the students to undertake the task without speaking with peers - it may have been better to ask them to do the scenario whilst at home or alone.</li>
<li>The software used had limitations which didn't allow some restrictions - we had to explain to the students that they could only view 3 pieces of info and we had to trust that they would do this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>From the feedback the tutor recieved from his students it was a positive exercise and they felt that they gained a lot more ownership of knowledge and felt that they had improved their fundamental analytical skills by application. They found it more rewarding to play through a scenario and see some sort of outcome from the decisions they made.</p>
<p>The feedback that the tutor gave me, it was also positive and he was extremely pleased with the way it was designed and illustrated - which made the students more willing to engage. We have decided to rework the idea as the tutor saw some areas for improvement and we are now planning to develop the game and make it more complex.</p>]]></description>

              <title>what educators can do</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p class="qote" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>I'd rather leave the job I love than teach the government&rsquo;s propaganda</em></p>
<p class="qote" align="right"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/may/18/gove-leaving-teaching-curriculum-changes-history?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487">the secret teacher</a></p>
<p class="main">The secret teacher speaks for himself; we don't know how many other teachers and lecturers would endorse this condemnation of curriculum abuse.&nbsp; But he may well get a cheer from educators who would not call themselves &lsquo;teachers&rsquo; or &lsquo;lecturers&rsquo;.&nbsp; Education has agencies other than schools-and-colleges.&nbsp; Every locality has some such free-standing voluntary agency or social enterprise. organising help in what is called &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="main">My shot at explaining all this is set out in an earlier <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8484">account of education and policy</a>.&nbsp; I examined influences on education, the beliefs they call upon, and the risks they pose.&nbsp; Here I ask how education can respond to those pressures, by forming and activating stakeholder groups as part of civil society.&nbsp; Civil society, by definition, acts independently of commercial and political pressures.&nbsp; And stakeholder groups give voice to that independence.&nbsp; This blog asks what kind of conversations about education that independence sets up.&nbsp; It means probing what different groups want from curriculum, what commitments they each seek, and what varied outcomes they try to realise.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">The possibilities are far-reaching, especially when education for selection is set alongside education for well being.&nbsp; I look for what gets argued when education for competitiveness is set alongside education for fulfilment.&nbsp; The term &lsquo;learning-for-living&rsquo; crops up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">Curriculum development needs all the independent support it can find in schools and colleges.&nbsp; But an independent education may need civil society more than is yet obvious, even to the secret teacher and his allies.&nbsp; This blog faces the probability that education will be privatised; government is in no position to resist the leverage of commercial interests looking for new markets.&nbsp; Thinking about the future of education needs, then, to grapple with all the possibilities - if not in the public service then in civil society.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">It&rsquo;s a long-term project - bigger than a parliament.&nbsp; But Labour is calling for local communities, in partnership with businesses, to be free of arbitrary demands for unsustainable growth, and working for locally-valued outcomes.&nbsp; Those calls resonate with the forward-looking possibilities signposted here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on priorities</strong></p>
<p class="intro">Most people can answer to their own satisfaction the question &lsquo;what&rsquo;s education for?&rsquo;.&nbsp; Everybody has some experience to go on.&nbsp; But agreement in a group is less likely - people have different experiences.&nbsp; Some claims are at such levels of word-playing malleability to be useless: talk of &lsquo;inspiration&rsquo;, &lsquo;confidence&rsquo;, &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo; and &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; can obscure more than it illuminates.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not easy for stakeholders to get enough detail on the action that such claims call for.&nbsp;&nbsp; They need to get to grips with how far such underlying priorities can stretch...</p>

<p class="sub"><strong>education, interests and 'noises-off'</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/education-a-very-short-introduction-by-gary-thomas/2002267.article">Gary Thomas</a> has distilled curriculum thinking into an hour-or-so of reading.&nbsp; He maps a six-thousand-year history of education.&nbsp; I find his account riveting - it&rsquo;s of a struggle.&nbsp; In the blue corner, an insistence on the need for formal and reliable facts.&nbsp; In the red, trust in the case for an open and progressive process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, before the bruising starts, it&rsquo;s a pointless match - have you ever come across an unprocessed fact? or a fact-free process?&nbsp; So we should be able to find a consensus.&nbsp; But it's hard to find.&nbsp; Educators and their stakeholders need to understand why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author helps by taking a close look at pragmatics, constructivism and marketisation.&nbsp; I've tried here to take account of all that.&nbsp; But I can't help noticing that the author leaves out pretty-well all of what neurology, the social sciences and cultural theory bring to an understanding of curriculum.&nbsp; So where are the clues to understanding?&nbsp; Are they in what we can see included? or in what we can't see because something's left out?&nbsp; We'd have to ask who ignores what?&nbsp; And why would they do that?</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve managed to set out here, I find it hard to lose the suspicion that this is not really a debate about ideas, it&rsquo;s about whose interests are being served.&nbsp; A content-driven factual understanding of how things are suits some, and they are glad to see it included.&nbsp; A process-driven curriculum addressed to critically scrutinising how things got this way will upset some apple-carts</p>
<p>Assembling this account of what educators can do has repeatedly come across those conflicting interests.&nbsp; Any claim made, or research reported, or policy announced stands in a frawework of one set of interests or another...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>neo-lib&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; shareholder &lt; &gt;&nbsp; cosmopolitan&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; street-level&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; civil society&nbsp; &lt; &gt; stakeholder</strong></p>
<p>It also finds the interests managed in a range of settings...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>systemic&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; institutional &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; conversational</strong></p>
<p>Some of this is &lsquo;noises-off&rsquo; - hard-to-decipher murmers of what is somewhere being canvassed, or the wangling of manoeuvres, or - eventually - what turns out to have been downright misleading.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found some of what is signposted here in the news, but the news can also be a daily parade of immediate events, short-term consequences and facile solutions.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s too little time, space or attention-span to pose uncomfortable questions - just enough for evasive answers.&nbsp; Claims to transparency are so narrowly framed as to be laughable.&nbsp; Education needs larger frameworks, demanding disclosing answers.&nbsp; Am I paranoic to sense that there's some probing to do here?</p>
<p>And probing done before any compromises are made.&nbsp; A resolution can only be negotiated from what is put on the table.&nbsp; There's no compromise with absolute beliefs.&nbsp; And compromise with partial disclosure is a commitment to little that's worth having.&nbsp; Garry Thomas&rsquo;s story is in part an account of what kind of limp resolutions are left dangling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educators are not responsible for any of this, but neither can they afford to ignore it. This account of what they can do is widely-enough framed to take account of the gamut of interests and the reach of exchanges.&nbsp; So there&rsquo;s a lot here.&nbsp; But the more educators take into consideration, the more bases for action they can search.&nbsp; And this blog has argued that the action can include root-and-branch curriculum reform - with or without the support of the 'noises off'.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The initial graphic of the &lsquo;<strong>Best Practice Principles for e-Learning</strong>&rsquo; in the <strong>e-Design Template</strong> is very clear and could be useful as scaffolding to encourage learner autonomy over a period of time. The way each of the four stages (active induction, guided exploration, facilitated investigation, self-organised learning) is laid down one on top of the other, overlapping, moving from tutor led, deductive beginnings to a more student-centred inductive approach as the course progresses, keeps a focus on the constructive principles in learner development behind the design. Defining interaction patterns more clearly could be useful and some suggestions of appropriate tools, technology and other possible resources would also be very helpful. However, trying to fit these principles into a tabular format for individual lesson is not particularly useful or clear and there are certainly far better lesson plan templates out there.</p>
<p>The<strong> 4Ts model</strong> clearly presents the flow of the lesson and sequence of activities and is easy to follow visually. In contrast to the e-Design Template it seems better suited to individual lessons than for the development of a course or module over time. The lesson stages are clearly signalled, there are suggestions for the use of appropriate tools, resources and technology, the interaction patterns and timings are also clear but there is little detail in the procedure and no overall lesson or stage aims stated. I feel these are needed to make the &lsquo;Why&rsquo; more explicit.</p>
<p>The infographics and visual representations are clear in both cases and e-Design is fairly easy to read and concise. Whilst the first could be of some use for my design narrative over the whole semester the second could be used for the first face to face introductory lesson, with some tweaking and adaption that is.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Lynne&#39;s comparison of 4SPPI &amp; e-Design</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8342</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8342</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p class="western"><strong>Similarities</strong></p>
<p class="western">Both representations involve capturing the key features of a learning activity on a template, organised according to certain principles. The aim in each case is to produce a standardised representation which will enable one learning activity to be compared with another, in a consistent way. But the methods used &amp; the appearance of the end product are quite different.</p>
<p class="western"><strong>Differences</strong></p>
<p class="western">4SPPI analyses each learning activity design according to four factors: space (where it happens), pedagogy (how it is taught), participants (who is involved) &amp; history (what is produced during the activity). The information for each factor is then displayed as segments in a circular graphic. By contrast, e-Design uses a tabular format. Each stage in the learning activity is allocated to the column corresponding to its type: active induction (tutor-managed, closed), guided exploration (student-managed, closed), facilitated investigation (tutor-managed, open), self-organised learning (student-managed, open).</p>
<p class="western"><strong>Readability, expressiveness, utility</strong></p>
<p class="western">I found e-Design easier to use from the point of view of quickly finding out what each activity involved, perhaps because reading text left-to-right &amp; top-to-bottom is such a familiar process. 4SPPI took more interpretation, as the segment labels were displayed around the graphic (difficult to rotate the image on a PC monitor!). Both required a good deal of decoding, due to their use of space-saving abbreviations. But once familiarity with the layout &amp; language was achieved, 4SPPI gave me a deeper understanding of the intentions behind each activity &amp; its practical requirements (in terms of equipment, classroom space etc.). With e-Design, a teacher would know what s/he was supposed to do during the session. With 4SPPC s/he would know much more about how &amp; why to do it.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Joe&#39;s design narrative: introducing interactive whiteboards within a high school department </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8341</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8341</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Education challenges are situated within a specific context and incorporating/designing new interventions must take this into account. Logistics and resourcing are key components to consider.</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>About a decade ago, as interactive whiteboards and digital projectors became more popular in English secondary schools, the senior management team of the school within which I worked asked/wanted the science department to make more use of a recently purchased interactive whiteboard.</p>
<p>This was a single interactive whiteboard, which was available for use by the science department. The interactive whiteboard had to be booked and was shared with other departments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were 9 science teachers within the department. I, the head of department and one other science teacher were already using the interactive whiteboard in our science lessons. There was some resistance from the other science teachers in using the interactive whiteboard (essentially they had been offered no training with the technology - or in resource creation - and said it could currently add little to their teachings as no useful resources available and they had no time to develop resources). There was also resistance from the science technicians as they claimed it would be another task they would be &lsquo;lumbered with co-ordinating&rsquo; as they would have to move the whiteboard around the school site.</p>
<h2>My role</h2>
<p>As I had some previous experience in this area the head of science department passed this task on to me to action.</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p><strong>What the school wanted:</strong> increased use of the interactive whiteboard by the science department.</p>
<p><strong>What the head of department wanted:</strong> the interactive whiteboard task highlighted by the senior management team (SMT) resolved to a satisfactory conclusion for the SMT.</p>
<p><strong>What the science teachers wanted:</strong> training and access to ready-made resources for use with the interactive whiteboard.</p>
<p><strong>The perceived challenge:</strong> the SMT thought increased use of the interactive whiteboard itself would help (in part) improve the science (and any other) department. There was paranoia and mistrust within the science department regarding an initiative suggested by the SMT, the science department thought they were being unfairly targeted (part of an &lsquo;us&rsquo; and &lsquo;them&rsquo; culture). However, there was no wider resource-sharing between the science teachers within the department, which my work on this task highlighted as the biggest issue to overcome.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><strong>SMT:</strong> I highlighted to SMT the fact use of the interactive whiteboard alone would not improve a department; resources would be needed for more interactive whiteboards if any intervention was to be anything more than supplemental to department&rsquo;s offering; resources would also be needed for technology specific software and staff training (not assuming proficiency or ability to learn by some of the teachers). I also suggested grouping separate departments together for new strategies to overcome possible &lsquo;us&rsquo; and &lsquo;them&rsquo;; and &lsquo;being targeted&rsquo; issues.</p>
<p><strong>Head of department:</strong> there was a need to create a departmental culture of resource-sharing and this would have to be led by the head of department. Giving individual teacher&rsquo;s responsibility for separate parts of the curriculum was a suggested starting point in resource creation/sourcing, as was limiting resource development to one key stage initially.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers within the department:</strong> I ran a training session on suggested ways the interactive whiteboard could be used both interactively and passively (as a digital projector). I created some simple template resources in PowerPoint for use by the department (trading off some of the resource interactivity with the important characteristic of &lsquo;recreatability&rsquo; by novice and expert teacher creator alike for future sustainable working).</p>
<p><strong>Science technicians:</strong> together with the technicians I created a booking form for the interactive whiteboard which the science teachers would have to complete sufficiently in advance if they wished to book the whiteboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><strong>SMT:</strong> agreed to purchase of departmental specific resources and future purpose of departmental whiteboard. Though the SMT felt training needs should be met in-house.</p>
<p><strong>Head of department:</strong> agreed to lead on resource-sharing culture (creating first resources for use by other teachers) to support interactive whiteboard use and also to push for greater resource expenditure in support of this area.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers within department:</strong> agreed to create resources on a rolling basis targeting on key stage at a time. Two-thirds of the teachers produced resources for use by the wider department; the same proportion began to use the interactive whiteboard on a regular basis, usage increasing with resource availability.</p>
<p><strong>Science technicians:</strong> eventually saw the interactive whiteboard as just another piece of science kit to be ordered.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><strong>SMT:</strong> the SMT purchased subject specific software for the department without consulting the department for expertise. It was later agreed future software purchases should be signed-off by head of department.</p>
<p><strong>Head of department:</strong> became a great advocate for the whiteboard use and resource creation with the school.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers within department:</strong> as more teachers within department became regular users of the interactive whiteboard, clashes for using the whiteboard resources arose (led to purchase of departmental interactive whiteboard). Teachers became increasingly more confident in whiteboard use and creation of specific resources; they thrived on the additional responsibility of taking ownership of expertise within the curriculum and this transferred across to all areas of resource development within the department.</p>
<p><strong>Learners:</strong> a departmental survey of pupils several months later stated learner preference for lessons in which the interactive whiteboard was used as being more fun (this survey was later used by the SMT as evidence for rolling out use in other departments).</p>]]></description>

              <title>Jonathan Vernon: My OLDS MOOC Narrative - Four short stories, then retiring to the sidelines</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8160</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8160</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h1 dir="ltr">Summary</h1>
<p dir="ltr">I am use to problem solving techniques having used them in corporate communications and training for some 25 years. The contrast between higher education and learning and development always fascinates me - they are so different. Simply put the L&amp;D drive is usually to deliver more for less and to measure and justify the spend. It has to work and shown to work, saving money and improving results on previous approaches, so typically reducing and eliminating the cost of travel, overnights and being away from work. There will be a budget, schedule and brief. There will be a team of participants, a key player at the client end with their colleagues, support and their own line manager/director. The agency team will in all likelihood involve six or more people: project manager, learning design, subject matter expert, writer, designer, programme and an assortment of graphics designers, visualizers and testers. This seems to be in sharp contrast where those in education have no budget, no time and little support and in the old model of the lone teacher and their class have to come up with everything on their own, plan and create in their own time and often have systems and kit foistered on them.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week I looked at the time allocated to the OLDS MOOC by the OLDS MOOC team and quickly learnt to DOUBLE the time that would be required. And in the two most busy weeks I had working on Personas and Design I spent 12-16 hours on the reading, the activities themselves and maintaining contact with a fledgling group. This kind of commitment became unsustainable as I needed increasingly to commit this time to other projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I wonder if young people should start work part time at 14 as they did 100 years ago, and do so with a close, online support. They will increasingly benefit from sophisticated learning systems and catalogues and be able to apply what they learn.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Context</h1>
<p dir="ltr">What were the conditions and constraints in which your design experiment was situated?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Online, for me this mean STANDING at the dining room table. This is my office. After some Horizon programme on health I now stand all day. Works for me, in fact I find I am more alert and have had no back or no strain since &hellip; though the ball of my left foot doesn&rsquo;t like it and I&rsquo;ve worn through the slippers my daughter bought me for my birthday. This is context for me. The dog watches me all day expecting to me taken for a work. The &lsquo;footfall&rsquo; is such morning and later afternoon that I am disturbed by family members at meal time. Come to think of it, I prepare these meals so that&rsquo;s another period of disruption to me day. 4 x 3 hours across the day is how I try to operate. That is before breakfast, after breakfast, after lunch and after dinner.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I don&rsquo;t recommend it. In the past I have walked up the road or driven a few miles to an office. In future I would hope at least to have an office &lsquo;down the garden&rsquo;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This context has the potential to be highly disrupted as the ebb and flow of family life runs through the house - teenage children at, or not at school and my wife who also works from home even more stressed when she has no work than when she does. When she has work lucky her enters her study and is only ever seen at meal times &hellip; and perhaps if either she wakes me late at night, or I wake her early in the morning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the context. I could relate this to years in various production and agency offices working on linear then, as we quaintly called it &lsquo;non-linear&rsquo; interactive training. More recently experience of the 9 to 5 has been blissful as a team of 8 on a project in an office of 50 or so hunker down collectively to the task in hand. In this context an e-learning project, like producing TV and video (and film) where I have experience, runs almost like clockwork. I say almost because occasionally there is an overnighter or weekend panic. &nbsp;I have a dream context it would be the new Google-plex, especially with the opportunity to camp out on the roof if you&rsquo;ve got a deadline and would prefer to hang out around the office.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Material</h2>
<p dir="ltr">What are the spatial characteristics of the settings? What tools and resources are available to protagonists?</p>
<p dir="ltr">See above. Kit is one desktop, two laptops and an iPad.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A scanner and digital camera.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Art materials. A print on the wall is taken down in the morning and replaced with a white board. I resist the guitar, TV and piano.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Though there is a game of chess in permanent suspended animation between my son and I. The greater distractions are the ability and desire to read niche books and download papers before I add a fullstop to the end of a sentence</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is my office. I don&rsquo;t know what others tools and constraints others have.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cloudscape is the VLE, it the blog, is our social network and ought to be our singular means of communication. We are all used to and happy with other platforms. To be this comfortable online we have learnt to make our favourite tools sing. I feel as if I have spent over a decade learning the flute, guitar and piano to play in an orchestra and have been told to drop these to play an accordion in a brass band.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Social</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Who are the protagonists, what are the relationships between them, and what are the social and institutional configurations in which they operate?</p>
<p dir="ltr">I am used to working online. In 1999 I was in touch with a writers group through my blog that ran &lsquo;til 2004. Our office was a cloud somewhere above the North Atlantic that shifted as other members moved in turn to Japan, then South America, Scotland &hellip; then back to North America. Even in an office I work online, typically using a wiki like collaborative e-learning design/build platform. This is genius. Each project may have between 5 minimum and 8 people on it - more where assistance is required or the deadline gets close - which are also points where around the office people start to gather to meet and those working from home come in. I&rsquo;ve done this too as a postgrad student - I forget which MAODE module but six of eight gelled on a two work collaborative project between New Zealand, Thailand, Germany and the UK. In the OLD MOOC one, then two then occasionally, perhaps three of us worked on the same project. It was touch and go and after five weeks it fizzled because the &lsquo;team leader&rsquo; as it were who had been instrumental in galvinising a couple of us to join in felt they could no longer do it. Perhaps she&rsquo;d got the answers she needed. I do rather think that a couple of meetings and a solution was in place &hellip; find the right person to ask how? and you take their response on faith and you are done without having to plan the construction of the Empire State Building. Designing a one hour e-learning intro to multimedia is vastly different to designing a 60 credit MBA module on creative problem solving. I don&rsquo;t even think they compare if we were to use the metaphor of architecture (Christopher Alexander, 1970). One was a few bricks to make an outdoor BBQ, while the other is a self-build six bedroom house. (with indoor swimming pool).</p>
<p dir="ltr">I have written screenplays and TV &hellip; no more credits than a short on Channel 4. I hear &lsquo;protagonist&rsquo; and I need the antagonist and an entire family of other characters. Narrative is driven by conflict. This is where the metaphor or structure is weak - there should be no conflict where there is collaboration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If there were to be an &lsquo;antagonist&rsquo; then it would be Cloudworks. It has a character of its own which I&rsquo;m afraid I would described as doomed - rather like the Titanic. There was conflict in this narrative and it was always with the platform. Importantly the other characters, the players were the extraordinary array of character actors, the big name e-learning academics who have been schedule in for a star turn each week. They are players in this performance &hellip; as they led each week, and happily shared thoughts with us directly. Indeed, contact with the gliteratti of e-learning who for an MAODE student have been largely noticeable by their absence during the last three years - figure heads while moderator/facilitator tutors with very varied interest guide the students through &hellip; but I&rsquo;m wandering onto a different stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As players, these e-learning top guns, perhaps with a vested and professional and academic interest in how the MOOC plays out have been exception - all educators who, escaping the restrictions of distance and online learning, would surely enjoy and gain from &lsquo;teaching&rsquo; by giving lectures from time to time, but more importantly sitting down with students in tutorials too. I think the loop into cyberspace with e-learning is coming home and that the desire by students and tutors alike will be to have more face to face, online and in person. I cannot help but KNOW that had those of us in our MOOC group who could have said, let&rsquo;s all meet in person in such and such a place that that meeting would have bound us as a team to the end of the MOOC. This is why meetings still happen.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The constraints are (negative drivers):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Working online</li>
<li>Working with strangers</li>
<li>Working without pay</li>
<li>Working without the likelihood of the project being realised</li>
<li>The unlikeliness of meeting face-to-face</li>
<li>Cloudworks - Why send us to Mars when there are familiar landscapes where we could work?</li>
<li>Time (each participant runs to a different schedule and agenda).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Positive drivers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When meet someone with a common goal</li>
<li>Leadership from a project that others wish to follow</li>
<li>Using a variety of tools with which we are familiar to communicate</li>
<li>The comprehensive nature of the OLDS MOOC</li>
<li>The liveliness and commitment of the OLDS MOOC team</li>
<li>Time (it is my own, but other commitments jostle for attention)</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Intentional</h2>
<p dir="ltr">What are the protagonists beliefs, desires and intentions, which shape the problem space?</p>
<p dir="ltr">This &lsquo;space&rsquo; does exist where there is a fixed landscape, even one that is online via a blog, a common social group or website. This &lsquo;problem space&rsquo; where the protagonists meet has to have a sense of space and place. In Cloudworks, and this is my second effort to work in it, the reflection of real-life hubs and nodes simply do no exist. I still find it impossible to log directly into my own cloud, let alone find those of the groups I took an interest in or get back to the base camp. In our group we rapidly debunked to email and Google docs. I&rsquo;ve done this on other platforms too - in a student group where Elluminate had failed twice, or the tutor was clueless at how to operate that construction from the mind of Professor Brainstorm, we debunked successful and repeatedly to Google Hangouts - the ultimate bond being a &lsquo;pyjamma party&rsquo; which reminded me that none of us wanted to do any of &lsquo;this&rsquo; unless it was fun. .</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Force Map</h2>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fx3oTWyy8GIBB77-qqgzz1v2IFnG3_xwux_E5O3c9RA_wDKYiyEx5Nbxp6heWUDYH6UxV0put5SoaWsuW6OU-5V6251p0iPHYvsblfXQXBrMRcD-AVIa4VLbRw" alt="" width="348px;" height="522px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>This may pre-empted the MOOC by a week but expresses three things in relation to team work</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>top down hierarchical</li>
<li>democratic</li>
<li>everyone pitches in</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">For me this might illustrate working on a programme of work or curriculum for a school ten years ago, working on a creative project in the last five years where everyone has direct contact with each other and finally, online collaboration where not only can you be inside each other&rsquo;s heads and beds (see Google Hangout above), but there can be, for good or bad, other interlopers and powers getting involved.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This could also be drawn up in a series of Activity Theory plans &hellip; not just from first to third generation, but in the final episode in which an activity system, like icicles in spring, melts.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Challenge</h1>
<p>In advertising and corporate communications we might create a campaign to launch a new beer in a country, launch a new range of cars, or run a Government health awareness campaign over three years and it is reduce to A SINGLE PAGE OF A4. <strong>The most important question is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the problem?</li>
</ul>
<p>If there isn&rsquo;t a problem there can be no answer, no advert, no campaign. The same applies to academic research - the proper research question has to be to address a problem. If there isn&rsquo;t a problem then the enterprise is already a shopping trolley with a missing wheel. This applies to EVERY training video, every interactive DVD, or web-based learning project I have been involved with. It there isn&rsquo;t a problem to fix then the learning is unnecessary. If you cannot express it as a problem, then stop.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The advertising brief continues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Who are you speaking to?</li>
<li>What do you want to say?</li>
<li>How do you want them to respond to this message?</li>
<li>Is there anything else we need to know.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">And all of this must be researched and worked on until it can be kept to a SINGLE SHEET OF A4. i.e. a sentence or two in response to each of these questions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I apply this to running a 12 week series of classes in Primary School, a day long workshop on revision techniques, a 9 month squad swimming programme, an hour long e-learning module, an 8 minute short film, a poster campaign for the local sailing club, teaching 3,000+ swimming teachers how to fix breaststroke &hellip;</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Theoretical / Pedagogical Framework</h1>
<p dir="ltr">See above.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Actions</h1>
<p>I proposed a &lsquo;design&rsquo; that has worked dozens of times before - a weekend workshop with no need to do anything online. Indeed, having been made to think it through that was the conclusion. I keep an OLDS Mooc journal.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Obstacles</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Two, maybe three &hellip; or was it four complete strangers, all busy full time elsewhere, most of us new to this game, trying to commit to something were increasingly we felt lost. From beginning to end I had no idea whether there were 10 people, maybe 25 people or just 3 doing the MOOC. If there were a 1000 then I never had any sense of this, not a stream of tweets and messages, not long lists of names. None of it. In sharp contrast the last two MOOCs I have taken an interest in I felt as if from day one there were 10,000 people sharing the same Ferry<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNC5iLNguRQ"> energizing</a> in and out by transporter</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Results</h1>
<p>To work online is to complement meeting face-to-face. Projects I join or initiate in the real world might begin online, become a conversation and relationship but then develop and embed by meeting. If it is a speculative, even an unpaid project (I&rsquo;ve done a number of these), then people get the measure of each other and are far, far more likely to commit to the end.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roles are established</li>
<li>Motives are understood</li>
<li>Diaries are compared</li>
<li>Problems identified and resolved</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be done online but needs at least a Skype or Google hangout level of interaction. There is a reason and value to seeing a person&rsquo;s face. There is a reason why the face is so expressive - it is a vital form of comprehension, communication and connection.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>A three person team became two, then none.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite expressing interest in four other projects NOT ONE of these people came back in any shape or form to express an interest in my contributing to their effort. I pitched in some ideas, was ignored &hellip; so in turn ignored them.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Reflections</h1>
<p>I keep a learning journal. No longer a person diary, but a record of everything I do that relates to work and personal development - which for me is learning, with a significant nod to learning online and e-learning / e-coaching. <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SXghPePe0oSddFAGAgjwelMg7eJas5Mwer_vCaUM_QQSjJf3uNtwRZu_noJAzqzjvRLgUT0bAegNVG1BXbUzC0bBBmyIPGun5xZ_S-HY5QFJeg3m3SkyWlaT" alt="" width="601px;" height="212px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">These posts happen to be in <a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/mod/oublog/search.php?user=635984&query=olds+mooc">my Open University Student blog</a> as the OLDS MOOC complements the postgraduate courses I have done over the last three years to complete the Masters in Open &amp; Distance Education.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was able to being the OLDS MOOC with a clear diary - this became busier after week 5 and as the only group that I had joined that showed traction faded away it became less easier to justify staying onboard. I do however follow the activity, read through the weekly activities and dip into some knowing that in my own time, or should the course be repeated, that I will re-join in order to do the subsequent weeks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a &lsquo;narrative&rsquo; I would prefer to write three or four short stories. There is a narrative to specific busy weeks, particularly my/our love hate relationship with Cloudworks, &nbsp;&lsquo;Personas&rsquo; where I was able to consolidate knowledge of the extensive use and development of Personas at the Open University Business School, extending my interest in design based research, bringing my knowledge and understanding and practical application of Activity Theory into focus, using <a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/mod/oublog/viewpost.php?post=135543">Activity Cards,</a> which was the highlight of the my time on the OLDS MOOC, bringing a pack of cards into the real world, to shuffle, pick through and then lay out on the kitchen table and share - this would be an invaluable activity to use with colleagues in &nbsp;workshop. And formulation of my own conception of Learning Activities, which I reduced to THREE, from Grainne Conole&rsquo;s Seven and named them <a href="http://learn.open.ac.uk/mod/oublog/viewpost.php?post=136081">&lsquo;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&rsquo;. </a>&nbsp;Working in corporate Learning &amp; Development e-learning modules run for 45 minutes to an hour, they don&rsquo;t require the kind of thinking that is required and justified by a 30 or 60 point module in tertiary education where the OLDS MOOC is squarely aimed..</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Art volunteers for FreeGeekTwinCities and initially envisioned creating</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->"a&nbsp;<strong>map of learning activities</strong>&nbsp;for raising participant's&nbsp;<strong>digital literacy&nbsp;</strong>competencies.&nbsp;Learners could jump in at any time, anywhere on the map,&nbsp;and find guidance to master that particular skill set.&nbsp;The map would be dynamic, continually being improved and expanded, much like in wikipedia." (<a title="ARTiFactor Dream Project" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6942">My Dream</a>)</p>
<p>Art has a BS in Physics Education and created his own curriculum for 10 years but has not been in a class room for thirty years. Art is a life-long-learner and is aware of many recent internet communication technologies.</p>
<p>For years Art has wanted to help people use the internet to realize their potential. He read that 2012 was the "year of the MOOC" and decides to enroll in his first mooc, OLDSMOOC&nbsp;"Learning Design for a 21st Century Curriculum".</p>
<p>For three weeks Art functioned much as he had during his 10 years in college. He tried to do what he thought the instructors wanted. If he was uncertain of expectations he watched and imitated his peers (vicarious learning).</p>
<p>Art was thrilled to learn new tools like MindMeister, NetVibes, BibSonomy, LucidChart,and Twitter. Trying to manage the tsunamy of new resources was overwhelming. He decided not to even start using Diigo because it only allowed 1000 bookmarks before hiiting a paywall . He did start to see why social bookmarking was valuable, though.</p>
<p>Week 4 theme was connecting or partnering up. It did not happen. Art suddenly realized he had not made an entry in his daily jounal after Day 20. Feeling lost and hoplessly behind Art decided to sign up for 2 more MOOCs. He did a week's worth of assignments in foeMOOC but 2 minutes after submitting his homework the foeMOOC was suspended. He jumped over to edcMOOC and did 5 weeks of work, submitted his unfinished oldsMOOC project for his digital artefact requirement and will probably get a certificateof participation.</p>
<p>Now it is Week 8 and Art wants to show his peers he is not a quitter. His Dream Project is not finished but he now realizes how similar it is to the learning design of oldsMOOC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to best enable participants to learn, Art agrees with the learning design theory that &nbsp;<strong>learning is enabled best when it involves an authentic project that the learner is passionate about, and that involves group work with discussion, reflection, cooperation, and peer assessment</strong>. Art's experience in oldsMOOC, leads him to believe that community building, and if necessary, facilitating "partnering up"&nbsp;be a requirement before practicing social networking. He hopes to structure the learning environment so that every participant's contributions are&nbsp;acknowledged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Art's project intends to provide and model using tools for knowledge aquisition, collaboration, reflection, construction, presentation, etc., facilitating networks between fellow students, and also faciltating networking with others contributing to their field of inquiry.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->"Self-organised learning networks provide a base for the establishment of a form of education that goes beyond course and curriculum centric models, and envisions a learner-centred and learner controlled model of lifelong learning."&nbsp;(<a title="Koper 2004 life long learning design" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2004.00427.x/abstract">Koper 2004</a>)</p>
<p>Art is joining up with teams working on similar projects; <a title="Peeragogy Handbook Project" href="http://peeragogy.org/">Peeragogy Handbook Project</a>, <a title="P2PU peer to peer learning" href="https://p2pu.org/en/">P2PU</a>, <a title="wikiversity.org" href="http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page">wikiversity.org</a>, and <a title="MozillaFestival participate" href="http://mozillafestival.org/participate/">MozillaFestival</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some challenges yet to be worked out are:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting site visitors to commit (click on the join button)</li>
<li>match up newcomers by interests (maybe a form that populates a spreadsheet)</li>
<li>scaling if numbers exceed capacity of server or number of facilitators</li>
<li>a way for voting up or down available OER</li>
</ul>]]></description>

<h1 dir="ltr">Summary</h1>
<p dir="ltr">The story of Romulus and Remus and the foundation of Rome tells of brothers building a wall to enclose their new city. One brother builds his wall tall, the other low. Months .. or years later the two weels finally meet up. Remus is proud of his 2m high wall that is some 100m long, while Romulus has a 30cm wall that runs for some &nbsp;3km. Remus mocks his brother's efforts and runs back and forth leaping over the low wall. Romulus picks up a shovel and smashes Remus on the head. This is why we call it Rome.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this example there are two ways to build the wall. When it comes to e-learning design there are probably a thousand variations. I feel us we were being confined to the Remus model. That like it or not there are 8 steps and at each stage you have to build the wall 2m high.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Some necessary simple questions to ask before all of this:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>(Coming from the commercial sector if a project isn't profitable then half the staff might not have work by the time you end ... half the staff are freelance contractors anyway. This sharpens that mind compared to those in education on fulltime, salaried contracts).&nbsp;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">What's the budget?</p>
<p dir="ltr">When do you want it?</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the budget is &pound;6 and do it by the weekend your response is going to be somewhat different to being told the budget is &pound;6m and you have seven years.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I might add other questions such as:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Who is paying for it?</p>
<p dir="ltr">What are there expectations?</p>
<p dir="ltr">For everything else I'd work on a brief that would have to be expressed in less than 350 words on a single sheet of A4 paper. Or, to put it in Web 2.0 terms, five tweets to the following questions:</p>
<p dir="ltr">What is the problem?</p>
<p dir="ltr">What is the opportunity?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Who are we speaking to?</p>
<p dir="ltr">What do you want to say?</p>
<p dir="ltr">How do you want them to respond to this message?</p>
<p dir="ltr">What else do we need to know?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The detail would come later.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Context</h1>
<p dir="ltr">What were the conditions and constraints in which your design experiment was situated?</p>
<p dir="ltr">.Online, for me this mean STANDING at the dining room table. This is my office. After some Horizon programme on health I now stand all day. Works for me, in fact I find I am more alert and have had no back or no strain since &hellip; though the ball of my left foot doesn&rsquo;t like it and I&rsquo;ve warn through the slippers my daughter bought me for my birthday. This is context for me. The dog watches me all day expecting to me taken for a work. The &lsquo;footfall&rsquo; is such morning and later afternoon that I am disturbed by family members at meal time. Come to think of it, I prepare these meals so that&rsquo;s another period of disruption to me day. 4 x 3 hours across the day is how I try to operate. That is before breakfast, after breakfast, after lunch and after dinner.</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I don&rsquo;t recommend it. In the past I have walked up the road or driven a few miles to an office. In future I would hope at least to have an office &lsquo;down the garden&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This context has the potential to be highly disrupted as the ebb and flow of family life runs through the house - teenage children at, or not at school and my wife who also works from home even more stressed when she has no work than when she does. When she has work lucky her enters her study and is only ever seen at meal times &hellip; and perhaps if either she wakes me late at night, or I wake her early in the morning.</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the context. I could relate this to years in various production and agency offices working on linear then, as we quaintly called it &lsquo;non-linear&rsquo; interactive training. More recently experience of the 9 to 5 has been blissful as a team of 8 on a project in an office of 50 or so hunker down collectively to the task in hand. In this context an e-learning project, like producing TV and video (and film) where I have experience, runs almost like clockwork. I say almost because occasionally there is an overnighter or weekend panic. &nbsp;I have a dream context it would be the new Google-plex, especially with the opportunity to camp out on the roof if you&rsquo;ve got a deadline and would prefer to hang out around the office.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Material</h2>
<p dir="ltr">What are the spatial characteristics of the settings? What tools and resources are available to protagonists?</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">See above. Kit is one desktop, two laptops and an iPad. A scanner and digital camera. Art materials. A print on the wall is taken down in the morning and replaced with a white board. I resist the guitar, TV and piano. Though there is a game of chess in permanent suspended animation between my son and I. The greater distractions are the ability and desire to read niche books and download papers before I add a fullstop to the end of a sentence</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Social</h2>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Who are the protagonists, what are the relationships between them, and what are the social and institutional configurations in which they operate?</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I am used to working online. In 1999 I was in touch with a writers group through my blog that ran &lsquo;til 2004. Our office was a cloud somewhere above the North Atlantic that shifted as other members moved in turn to Japan, then South America, Scotland &hellip; then back to North America. Even in an office I work online, typically using a wiki like collaborative e-learning design/build platform. This is genius. Each project may have between 5 minimum and 8 people on it - more where assistance is required or the deadline gets close - which are also points where around the office people start to gather to meet and those working from home come in. I&rsquo;ve done this too as a postgrad student - I forget which MAODE module but six of eight gelled on a two work collaborative project between New Zealand, Thailand, Germany and the UK. In the OLD MOOC one, then two then occasionally, perhaps three of us worked on the same project. It was touch and go and after five weeks it fizzled because the &lsquo;team leader&rsquo; as it were who had been instrumental in galvinising a couple of us to join in felt they could no longer do it. Perhaps she&rsquo;d got the answers she needed. I do rather think that a couple of meetings and a solution was in place &hellip; find the right person to ask how? and you take their response on faith and you are done without having to plan the construction of the Empire State Building. Designing a one hour e-learning intro to multimedia is vastly different to designing a 60 credit MBA module on creative problem solving. I don&rsquo;t even think they compare if we were to use the metaphor of architecture (Christopher Alexander, 1970). One was a few bricks to make an outdoor BBQ, while the other is a self-build six bedroom house. (with indoor swimming pool).</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I have written screenplays and TV &hellip; no more credits than a short on Channel 4. I hear &lsquo;protagonist&rsquo; and I need the antagonist and an entire family of other characters. Narrative is driven by conflict. This is where the metaphor or structure is weak - there should be no conflict where there is collaboration.</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">If there were to be an &lsquo;antagonist&rsquo; then it would be Cloudworks. It has a character of its own which I&rsquo;m afraid I would described as doomed - rather like the Titanic. There was conflict in this narrative and it was always with the platform. Importantly the other characters, the players were the extraordinary array of character actors, the big name e-learning academics who have been schedule in for a star turn each week. They are players in this performance &hellip; as they led each week, and happily shared thoughts with us directly. Indeed, contact with the gliteratti of e-learning who for an MAODE student have been largely noticeable by their absence during the last three years - figure heads while moderator/facilitator tutors with very varied interest guide the students through &hellip; but I&rsquo;m wandering onto a different stage.</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">As players, these e-learning top guns, perhaps with a vested and professional and academic interest in how the MOOC plays out have been exception - all educators who, escaping the restrictions of distance and online learning, would surely enjoy and gain from &lsquo;teaching&rsquo; by giving lectures from time to time, but more importantly sitting down with students in tutorials too. I think the loop into cyberspace with e-learning is coming home and that the desire by students and tutors alike will be to have more face to face, online and in person. I cannot help but KNOW that had those of us in our MOOC group who could have said, let&rsquo;s all meet in person in such and such a place that that meeting would have bound us as a team to the end of the MOOC. This is why meetings still happen.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Intentional</h2>
<p dir="ltr">What are the protagonists beliefs, desires and intentions, which shape the problem space?</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This &lsquo;space&rsquo; does exist where there is a fixed landscape, even one that is online via a blog, a common social group or website. This &lsquo;problem space&rsquo; where the protagonists meet has to have a sense of space and place. In Cloudworks, and this is my second effort to work in it, the reflection of real-life hubs and nodes simply do no exist. I still find it impossible to log directly into my own cloud, let alone find those of the groups I took an interest in or get back to the base camp. In our group we rapidly debunked to email and Google docs. I&rsquo;ve done this on other platforms too - in a student group where Elluminate had failed twice, or the tutor was clueless at how to operate that construction from the mind of Professor Brainstorm, we debunked successful and repeatedly to Google Hangouts - the ultimate bond being a &lsquo;pyjamma party&rsquo; which reminded me that none of us wanted to do any of &lsquo;this&rsquo; unless it was fun. .</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Force Map</h2>
<p><strong><strong><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fx3oTWyy8GIBB77-qqgzz1v2IFnG3_xwux_E5O3c9RA_wDKYiyEx5Nbxp6heWUDYH6UxV0put5SoaWsuW6OU-5V6251p0iPHYvsblfXQXBrMRcD-AVIa4VLbRw" alt="" width="348px;" height="522px;" /><br /><br /><br /></strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This may pre-empt the MOOC by a week but expresses three things in relation to team work</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">a) top down hierarchical</p>
<p dir="ltr">b) democratic</p>
<p dir="ltr">c) everyone pitches in</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">For me this might illustrate working on a programme of work or curriculum for a school ten years ago, working on a creative project in the last five years where everyone has direct contact with each other and finally, online collaboration where not only can you be inside each other&rsquo;s heads and beds (see Google Hangout above), but there can be, for good or bad, other interlopers and powers getting involved.</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This could also be drawn up in a series of Activity Theory plans &hellip; not just from first to third generation, but in the final episode in which an activity system, like icicles in spring, melts.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Challenge</h1>
<p><strong><strong>In advertising and corporate communications we might create a campaign to launch a new beer in a country, launch a new range of cars, or run a Government health awareness campaign over three years and it is reduce to A SINGLE PAGE OF A4.<br /><br />The most important question is;<br /><br />What is the problem?<br /><br />If there isn&rsquo;t a problem there can be no answer, no advert, no campaign. The same applies to academic research - the proper research question has to be to address a problem. If there isn&rsquo;t a problem then the enterprise is already a shopping trolley with a missing wheel. This applies to EVERY training video, every interactive DVD, or web-based learning project I have been involved with. It there isn&rsquo;t a problem to fix then the learning is unnecessary. If you cannot express it as a problem, then stop. <br /><br /></strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The advertising brief continues:</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Who are you speaking to?</p>
<p dir="ltr">What do you want to say?</p>
<p dir="ltr">How do you want them to respond to this message?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Is there anything else we need to know.</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">And all of this must be researched and worked on until it can be kept to a SINGLE SHEET OF A4. i.e. a sentence or two in response to each of these questions.</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I apply this to running a 12 week series of classes in Primary School, a day long workshop on revision techniques, a 9 month squad swimming programme, an hour long e-learning module, an 8 minute short film, a poster campaign for the local sailing club, teaching 3,000+ swimming teachers how to fix breaststroke &hellip;</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Theoretical / Pedagogical Framework</h1>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">See above.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Actions</h1>
<p><strong><strong>I proposed a &lsquo;design&rsquo; that has worked dozens of times before - a weekend workshop with no need to do anything online. Indeed, having been made to think it through that was the conclusion. <br /></strong></strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Obstacles</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Two, maybe three &hellip; or was it four complete strangers, all busy full time elsewhere, most of us new to this game, trying to commit to something were increasingly we felt lost. From beginning to end I had no idea whether there were 10 people, maybe 25 people or just 3 doing the MOOC. If there were a 1000 then I never had any sense of this, not a stream of tweets and messages, not long lists of names. None of it. In sharp contrast the last two MOOCs I have taken an interest in I felt as if from day one there were 10,000 people sharing the same Ferry<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNC5iLNguRQ"> energizing</a> in and out by transporter</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Results</h1>
<p dir="ltr">A three person team became two, then none.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite expressing interest in four other projects NOT ONE of these people came back in any shape or form to express an interest in my contributing to their effort. I pitched in some ideas, was ignored &hellip; so in turn ignored them.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Reflections</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Never again on Cloudworks. Ever.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2 class="title">Participatory Media Teaching and Learning Resources</h2>
<p>Open Educational Resources (OER) are learning modules that are available for reuse. By standing upon the shoulders of giants, we can reach further than if we attempt to reinvent our own learning modules.</p>
<p><a title="Howard Rheingold web site" href="http://rheingold.com/">Howard Rheingold</a> has created&nbsp;<strong><a title="Participatory Media Teaching and Learning Resources" href="http://socialmediaclassroom.com/community/wiki/participatory-media-teaching-and-learning-resources">Participatory Media Teaching and Learning Resources</a></strong> with a&nbsp;<strong><a title="cc by-nc 3.0 US license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/">CC BY-NC 3.0 US</a>&nbsp;</strong>license which I will be reusing.</p>
<p>I am creating a <strong>personal learning environment</strong> (PLE). I am inviting others to join with me to experience <strong>participatory learning</strong> as demonstrated by Howard Rheingold. I will also encourage participants to read this <strong><a title="Peeragogy Handbook" href="http://peeragogy.org/">Peeragogy Handbook</a></strong>. Mozilla is currently drafting a <strong><a title="Mozilla white paper on web literacies" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracyStandard/Legacy/WebLiteraciesWhitePaper">White Paper on Web Literacies</a></strong>, too.</p>
<p>I got a deal on hosting at BlueHost recently ($3.50/mo) and purchased the domain <strong><a title="digital literacy web site" href="http://dglt.org/">dgtl.org</a> </strong>for about $10/yr. I am using WordPress as a content management system and for blogging and have also installed forum, wiki, and Moodle software within this website. So for less than $5/mo I am able to provide a playground where I intend to learn by doing - hopefully along with others.&nbsp;</p>

              <title>So important to have sound evaluation processes when prototyping</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8031</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8031</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I was involved in the evaluation of prototypes for a national multimedia development of online information literacy resources. The evaluation reports of the different phases (including the evaluation survey questions and observation questions and expert review material) that we used can be accessed via the link. We went through several stages.</p>
<p>1. Storyboard of prototype - We were careful to storyboard the original concepts for each of the 12 online modules. This was done after discussions with the subject experts about what they thought should be in the modules. We did this using paper BEFORE any multimedia production began. Several people were asked to comment on the design - subject experts and multimedia experts as well as people involved in the project.</p>
<p>2. Usability testing - this was carried out on the prototypes in their multimedia format. This involved observations of students and academic staff using the prototypes.</p>
<p>3. Formative evaluation of the prototypes - this involved evaluating the navigation, instructional design, effectiveness for learning, content and activities etc. Students, subject experts and academic staff from various disciplines were asked to use a checklist with likert-type scales to rate the modules.</p>
<p>4. Expert review - this occurred early before the formative evaluation phase. Two experts, one technical and the other a content expert used heuristic evaluation questions to critique samples of the resources.</p>
<p>The process took time but it was well planned and reported comprehensively, and this gave the project team confidence that the modules were of high quality when they were released. Educators from around the world have accessed and used and some have modified these modules for use in their organisations.</p>
<p>I am now involved ina development of a new tertiary teaching qualification. This is going online to an open global market, and yet the prototyping phase has been bypassed and the evaluation process totally ignored until now. Time is cited as the prohibitive factor but this is precisely why evaluation needs to be carefully planned so that it is integrated from beginning to end. From my perspective and also in the view of expert evaluators - prototyping and usability testing, in fact most types of evaluation are ignored. It is at the peril of an organisation to do this I believe because it actually costs money and time when you have to redo everything later on because it is poorly designed.</p>
<p>Why is everyone in such a rush to get the product out there and in doing so rush or ignore probably what is the most important aspect of any design project? I am interested in others' experiences of this.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Week Two Summary Contextualisation (Sue Watling DIY Multimedia)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Less about DIY Multimedia and more reflections on the contextualisation of OLD</p>
<p>Learning and isolation are poor partners. Focus on the learner context enhances the process of OLD through revealing motivations as well as potential barriers. Context can reveal attention hot spots e.g. ease of access to materials, availability of support, the loneliness of the long distance online learner, guidance on specific design criteria e.g. the variety of activities, collaboration with peers and tutors, interaction with content, formative and diagnostic assessment opportunities etc. Context assists the designer make appropriate choices, in particular providing mechanisms for customising learning to suit individual preference e.g. providing information in alternative formats. All this runs in parallel to theoretical approaches to LD for example constructive alignment (Biggs and Tang, 2011).</p>
<p>Scenarios,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/personas.html" target="_blank">Personas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/representations-and-languages/force-map" target="_blank">Force Maps</a>&nbsp;are useful approaches to OLD. Context can be presented in textual formats but also displayed through mind mapping or diagrams where a visual approach can offer an effective overview of key issues. Constructing context encourages sharing practice; drawing on own experiences and incorporating those of colleagues to bring key issues together. Doing this online rather than round a table can in itself reveal areas of online learning design which need attention.</p>
<p>For my own practice inclusion is a key concern. Without attention to access, the application of theory to practice becomes diluted. Effective OLD takes into account the diversity of ways people access learning resources and opportunities, this is particularly important where there are no face to face clues or opportunities for discussion. Identifying potential barriers to access and participation are key to retention and success.</p>
<p>In the future I will be looking to building a collection of contrasting scenarios for future reference and experiment with alternative ways of presenting these e.g. diagrammatically.</p>

              <title>Heather Peters OLDS MOOC Week 1 Reflections from Another Face in the Cloud</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7540</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Where to begin? I started the MOOC feeling a bit overwhelmed but excited to learn more about learnging design. I kept my goals for the week quite simple and just noted the specific activities we were to complete for the week. I have completed the ones I listed, so I feel good about that accomplishment.</p>
<p>From a technical side, I said I wanted to learn about some tools that I didn't know about before and that certainly happened. I'm a bit frustrated with how many spaces the course is held in and the need to figure out just what is meant to be said where. I'm pleased with myself for persisting and I think I have enough of a basic grasp to continue.</p>
<p>On the content side - I'm finding the way 'designers' look at the world intriguing in terms of the vast number of processes that are involved in course design. I remain a bit puzzled as I work through some of the models and ideas as it is rather difficult to see where they differ from the work I do as a teacher. Not that there aren't differences in the mix but that teaching itself is a process of design - a point made in one of the early videos as well.</p>
<p>The interaction with other people is teaching me a lot - I see common issues across the world and intitutional settings. People are open and willing to talk about thier own experiences and share their knowledge. We've even had a go at defining knowledge!</p>
<p>My learning journal is also an open study group space so feel free to pop by and join in the discussion. (link below)</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to next week and having a go at inquiring some more.</p>

              <title>Using Design to Anticipate Future Uses for Educational Technologies</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7501</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7501</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>There is a lot of talk about design in educational research supported by technology, and this is a good thing. These discussions are centered on different methods to design innovations and expand theory to support teaching and learning. The intention is to bridge the gap between research and practice while investigating the impact of these technologies. Two strong approaches to pragmatically solving these educational challenges are LD and TISL that utilize different design thinking and methods involving both researchers and teachers. This position paper argues that we need to zoom out and discuss design with a capital "D" in order to strengthen and leverage stronger methods and knowledge to improve and sustain scientifically informed creative practices in professional contexts. Through better discussions, understandings, and design practices will help enable the community to strengthen research and engage the different users and stakeholders which in turn will result in better processes and products to support education.</p>
<p>Educational technology research suffers from the separation of research and practice compounded with the challenges of providing innovation to complex systems of societal organizations. Twenty years ago, Kaput(1992) argued that the limitations of computer use for education in the coming decades would likely be less a result of technological limitations than a result of limited human imagination and the constraints of old habits and social structures. Therefore, these types of challenges can be described as wicked problems. To characterize these wicked problems, Rittel &amp; Weber (1973) defined two sets of problems using the exaggerated stance that scientific and engineering problems have a clear problem definition and clear solution whether or not the problem is solved, and thereby these problems are considered tame. By contrast, wicked problems have neither of these clarifying traits since they generally fall under the category of human experience rather than natural sciences. Design can be positioned in-between science and humanities, where design bridges the natural world and human experience. This can be accomplished since designers tackle ?ill-defined? problems, their mode of problem solving is solution-focused, their mode of thinking is constructive,and they use an objective language recursively to find solutions (Cross, 2007). Nelson &amp; Stolterman (2003) argue for design wisdom, which is a much richer concept than problem solving because it shifts one?s thoughts from focusing only on avoiding undesirable states to focusing on the intentional actions that lead to states of reality that are desirable and appropriate. Design can be defined as a mix of notions as discussed by Simon (1996) and Morello (2000): design can be actions that people take to change situations into preferred ones through anticipating experiences for future uses. Most research focuses on the first part of this statement, changing situations into preferred ones. I argue that we also need to consider the second part as equally important that our research and practice must take into account how we can anticipate experiences for future uses.</p>
<p>Generally, because of research practice and everyday classroom work, we chunk down these ill-defined problems into testable problems that do not really address the larger context. By stepping back and considering what we mean when we talk about design can enable us to become better designers and provide ways to bridge the gaps between research and practice. One method to be explored is to apply a more discursive science of design approach that attempts to anticipate future uses for inventions and innovations by exploring how LD and TSIL interact.Krippendorff (2006) defines the science of design as the necessity of both a science of making and a philosophy of realizing artifacts with and for others. In order to establish and investigate the synergy between LD and TISL a strong science of design stance needs to be taken in order to anticipate the future of context, practice, and change. Therefore, I am arguing for integrating more precise design thinking and practice into LD and TIS. In order to carefully build up design skills for supporting the notion of teachers as collaborative designers and for different research activities to consider a design as success criteria. The sooner we start talking about design, the easier it will be to argue for rich design wisdom enabling states of reality that are desirable and appropriate.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Well, I've worked out that I haven't structured this as well as I might have done. Really, I should have created a new blog artefact and linked to it from here. Instead, it looks as though I'm going to have many clouds - they don't lend themselves to long entries, so individual musings per day. Why don't I create a blog? Because I already have a couple and I simply can't be bothered to set up yet another blog, particularly as it won't get used after the OLDS MOOC experience. Does that sound cynical? I reckon it's realistic. I know how I operate: I've had a lot of experience working with me and I don't feel the need to share my OLDS MOOC thoughts on a long term basis. I'm beginning to get the hang of this thing, I feel and I'm starting to consider the design aspects but maybe more from the point of view of what works for me rather than more generally. On the other hand, what this suggests is that the environment is sufficiently flexible to allow me to take my preferred approach, so maybe the mercury-like tendency to slide away when you think you've pinned it down is a benefit rather than the annoyance it feels like at present. Back to my question of yesterday - is a MOOC just a collection of loosely (or more tightly if there's an overarching goal) related collection of PLEs? And are these really PLEs or are they constrained by the artefacts suggested by the designers... A semi-structured VLE, maybe? So far, I haven't seen anything innovative or even new about this environment, We were doing similar things years ago but they didn't have a label! At least the fog is lifting, and that emphasises my view that it's essential to experience a tool or environment to design in a manner appropriate to it. This is not to promote technology-driven design; rather, it's a reflection that too many designers develop learning activities unsuited to where they take place. This may be something as simple as providing an instruction using inappropriate terms, but there's far too much of it about in my experience. It would be so easy to check things out before designing...</p>]]></description>

<h3>My  design project proposal is to design a framework which could be used to  construct a truly innovative 21st century curriculum/course, i.e. one  that is distinctively and obviously not of the 20th Century. This  framework would describe a design, a set of criteria, possible  components, technologies, pedagogies etc. It would be generic, i.e. it  could be used for any curriculum/course, at any level. The framework  would enable others to "hang" their curricula/courses from it in order to  re-design them for their 21st Century learners. It would provide a model  from which to design new courses that have no legacy to hamper  innovative design.</h3>

<p><strong>STELLAR Grand Challenge 2: Orchestrating Learners</strong><br /> Key research questions related to this challenge include:</p>
<ul>
<li> What is the role of the teacher/more knowledgeable other in  orchestrating learning and how does this relate to collaboration and the  knowledge of students? </li>
<li>What is the role of assessment and evaluation in learning and how can technology play a role? </li>
<li>From the point of view of the learner what is the relationship  between higher-order skills and learning of a particular knowledge  domain and what is the role of technology in this respect? </li>
<li>How can we identify the current learning trajectory or a person?  Would it be beneficial to make them aware of trajectory switches? </li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<p>Although the widespread use of social media reflects how Web 2.0 technologies have become embedded in our lives, there are still significant challenges in harnessing these and their related practices for learning. One expectation is that they will provide the means to reconcile informal and formal learning to allow for a more seamless transition between meaningful activity inside and outside of educational institutions or the workplace. But how do we support such processes or progressions? The approach adopted in this symposium is to see <em>design</em>, or <em>learning design</em>, as the key paradigm to address this challenge. But designing for this constantly evolving technological landscape creates new problems and complexities. This symposium will present different approaches to design from experts who specialise in the field of social software for learning, and who are concerned with both bridging informal and formal learning and questioning what we consider to be legitimate learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Will design really make a difference to practice?   
<ul>
<li>Role of theory?   
<ul>
<li>Tensions with practice?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are your own experiences of using social media for learning-teaching?</li>
<li>What social media tools do you use in your practice?</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>New technologies have immense potential for learning, but the sheer variety possible also creates challenges for learners in terms of navigating through an increasingly complex digital landscape and for teachers in terms of how to design and support learning interventions. How can learners and teachers make informed decisions about what technologies to use in the design and support of learning activities? This presentation will consider this question and present a new methodology for design &ndash; &lsquo;learning design&rsquo;, which aims to shift the creation and support of learning from what has traditionally been an implicit, belief-based practice to one that is explicit and design based. Learning design research at the Open University, UK has included the development of a set of conceptual design views, a tool for visualising designs (CompendiumLD) and a social networking site, for sharing and discussing learning and teaching ideas and designs (Cloudworks). An overview of this work will be provided, along with a discussion of the perceived benefits of this new approach to educational design.</p>]]></description>

<p>The aim of this research programme is to explore the impact that an increasingly &lsquo;open&rsquo; technologically mediated learning environment will have on learning in the future. In a world where content and expertise is often free and where services are shifting to the &lsquo;cloud&rsquo;, what are the implications for education? This paper describes the research programme, which takes a particular position on the notion of &lsquo;openness&rsquo;, considering it from a broad perspective covering each major phase of the academic lifecycle: design, delivery, evaluation and research.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2762</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Complex spaces for learning: theory and practice in design, co-design and re-design</strong></p>
<p><em>Peter Goodyear, Yael Kali and Sue Tickner</em></p>
<p>Plan is to produce a report out of the event, want people to feel free to be frank.</p>
<p><em>Peter Goodyear</em></p>
<p>A central challenge that emerges from the changing landscape is about working out how we can make pedagogical sense of these changes. Can we view design as a means of managing this change, what would this look like? Spaces for learning &ndash; physical, virtual are becoming more complex. Couple that with a notion that students will and should be more actively involved in reconfiguring their own learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience of co-design with students and also re-design</li>
<li>Design as imaging other people&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>Activity distributed in complex ways across time, space, tools and people</li>
<li>Students and teacher co-configuring activity relationships and learnplaces</li>
<li>Extended concept of self-regulation: activity relationships and tools/resources</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lassez-faire&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Instructional design</p>
<p>[loose vs. tight structures]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not just about managing activities but the social interactions., also how to make good choices about tools and resources.</p>
<p>Is design too complicated &ndash; should we just let students get on with it??? Some argue from the position of students as experts anyway, aligning with Prensky&rsquo;s notions, whereas now most don&rsquo;t subscribe to that position. In reality students&rsquo; digital habits are very varied, they may not know how to use these technologies for learning</p>
<p>Alternative approach to help students find their way through this space, need classic application of instructional design and more rigour, discipline, etc.</p>
<p>In reality it&rsquo;s probably somewhere in between.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Teaching as design</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diversifying student needs and expectations</li>
<li>Rising expectations abut graduate capabilities</li>
<li>Intensification of pressures on teaching staff</li>
<li>Accelerating technological change</li>
</ul>
<p>Increasing stress on traditional teaching processes</p>
<p>Accumulating research evidence about learning and teaching</p>
<p>Activity-centred design &ndash; design cannot be content focussed, must be on what the student does. It&rsquo;s the alignment between the desired learning outcomes and the activities we want the students to engage with. A key element of the design challenge is designing the student tasks. Of course students will interpret what we ask them to do (for good or bad). There is a gap between the tasks we set and the activities the students do.</p>
<p>We must remember that learning is physically situated &ndash; there are multiple learnplaces and this is fundamentally important and shapes the quality of the activities the students do.</p>
<p>Also learning is socially situated, groups, teams and communities + virtual teams, groups, and communities</p>
<p>Accelerating interpenetration of the digital and material worlds</p>
<p>Ubiquitous computing/ambient intelligence</p>
<p>Rise and rise of personal technologies</p>
<p><strong>Three inter-related components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Outcomes</li>
<li>Activity &ndash; place is a part of this, as is community. We must remember we don&rsquo;t control these spaces </li>
<li>Task</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need to think about scale &ndash; macro, meso and micro. For each we can think about tasks, tools and people. A lot of what we do as teachers is at the meso level. Design of a single task, mapped to a single coherent activity. Timeframe days or weeks. The set of tools, spaces and other resource needed for the learners works on a specific activity. Usually the concern of a teacher or programme team, may be co-configured by the learner(s). People: arrangement into working groups that persist for the length of the activity.</p>
<p>Teaching as design is indirect because of</p>
<ul>
<li>The legitimate and unavoidable gap between tasks and activity</li>
<li>Co-configuration of the complex mix</li>
<li>Autonomy exercised by students in making choice about who to work with and how but needs careful scaffolding</li>
<li>Plus alignment up and down the system macro &ndash; to micro-</li>
<li>Against this can we support teachers design work?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sue Tickner</em></p>
<p>Imaging learning: enabling design</p>
<p>Design/learning</p>
<p>Action (Revised design) &ndash; feedback &ndash; opportunity to respond (feed forward)</p>
<p>Dialogic process to reach a mutual understanding &ndash; when design is collaborative there are more opportunities for feedback and so learning</p>
<p>Levels of collaborative design?</p>
<ol>
<li>Reacting to feedback on existing design &ndash; adaptive</li>
<li>Designing for student contributions to and flexible use of environment we provide tools and resources and opportunities</li>
<li>Handing over (parts of) the design to the learners</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>On the fly, rapid changes according to feedback. In the moment imaging the immediate learning needs, they need new space for this, just in time, highly responsive contextual, at extreme, similar to formative testing, rapid prototyping, labs observation, on going support. Examples &ndash; one-click surveys within a course, watching their intros in labs, group discussions need to come back together, add a new whole class one. Also process &ndash; design stems from philosophy and values, reflected in methods, the &lsquo;teachable moment&rsquo;</li>
<li>Negotiated marking criteria/assessment rubrics. Co-constructed bibliographies and resource banks. Evaluation criteria for group processes. Spaces for students to create/share their own resources. Examples role play scenarios, resource bank wiki. Educ 230 Wikis, blogs, negotiated assessment criteria, self-assessment, group process critique. Self and peer assessment, criteria and review. Orientation course &ndash; chat, RSS feeds, practice wikis. Self, group, lecturer-reflection. As locus of control shifts during the shared assessment process, there is also a greater appreciation that all learners are teachers and teachers continue to be learners.</li>
<li>Students co-construct teaching resources in groups using whatever of the available technologies/resources they choose. Then create teaching spaces and co-teach. Students create resource banks and presentations to share. TLT group smart classrooms. Communication and making connections, sharing resources, encourage learners to interact spontaneously. Wheatley and Frieze *2006 using emergence to take social innovation to scale </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Yael Kali</em></p>
<p><strong>Redesign as a strategy to create, refine and share design knowledge gained in an iterative design process</strong></p>
<p>Approach to design &ndash; methodological approach &ndash; design-based research and strategic approach the use of the design principles and the design principles database (DPD)</p>
<p>Methodological approach &ndash; Barab and Squire 2004, Collins, Joseph and Bielaczyc 2004, The design-based research collective 2003</p>
<ul>
<li>Iteration 1</li>
<li>Iteration 2 Enactment of the revised version of the features, data gathering, data analysis and conclusions</li>
<li>Iteration 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Design Principles Database</p>
<p>Edu-design-principles.org Create an infrastructure for the community of educational technology designers and learning scientists to capture synthesise and discuss design knowledge</p>
<p>Structure is hierarchical have over 100 examples. Features then pragmatic principles (general guidelines about design, but also connected to learning theory) and then meta-principles</p>
<p>Example: web-based jigsaw activity: philosophical perspectives</p>
<p>Specialization groups in online discussions (progressivism, existentialism, essentialism), the knowledge sharing in home groups, then individual application of the knowledge in a new context (using perspective to analyse a school)</p>
<p>DP1: engage learners in peer instruction. Rationale &ndash; taking the role of instructor can encourage sutdents to depend understaning of content, increase motivation etc Topping 1996 Linn and His 2000 But trade off main contribution to those who instruct and less to those who learn</p>
<p>DP2: reuse students artefacts as resource for further learning</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iteration 1 &ndash; First version was unstructured discussion, found very low application of the knowledge in a new context, Students focussed on the perspective they had specialised in.</p>
<p>Iteration 2: Provided them with a tool. Collaboratively constructed table as attachment in the forum. Found application of knowledge was even lower!!!</p>
<p>Iteration 3: Used the same table, but this time students didn&rsquo;t download, it was in a wiki format. This made a big difference, because when they completed their rows they could see what others had contributed and could compare and contrast. Also enabled them to edit each others&rsquo; contributions. So a better application of DP3 and DP4</p>
<p>DP3: provide knowledge representation and organisation tools</p>
<p>DP4: Employ multiple social activity structures</p>
<p>Lessons learned &ndash; redesign as a strategy to create, refine and share design knowledge gained in an iterative design process. Design based research approach provides insights about the use of technology to apply design principles</p>
<p>Design knowledge gained in this process can become part of the design principles (tips: tradeoffs, pitfalls, limitations)</p>
<p>Comments on the presentation</p>
<ul>
<li>Small tweaks in redesign can have a huge impact on the success of the activity.</li>
<li>Interesting that between iteration 2 and 3 the major change was in the tool rather than the tasks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Learners can be initially quite reluctant to edit their co-learners contributions, need to encourage and support that</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>What do you do when people don&rsquo;t agree about the edits in the wiki, one delegate has a forum alongside the wiki so there can be a negotiation about how the wiki is edited</p>
<p><em>Issues </em></p>
<p>Co-design: Think about situations where you have handed over to the students, so there is considerable autonomy given over to the students. Think around tasks, tools, or how they work with others. Wants us to concentrate on the latter two rather than tasks.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>One example with masters&rsquo; students. Give flexibility to choose their research questions and focus and which databases to use, but they wanted to be guided more.</li>
<li>Cancelled all lectures once and told students to go and look at the materials online.</li>
<li>Students working in a global context and had to negotiate a project. They all abandoned the learner management space and took their discussion to a private space.</li>
<li>P/g e-learning course, last year moved to more flexible approach, allowed them to take over certain parts of the course and they choose the tools they wanted to use and moderated the space.</li>
<li>Put students into a public social networking site and asked them to share they professional practice and some interesting debates occurred in the communities.</li>
<li>Another example got the students to write a chapter around their subject area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Re-design: Has anyone got examples they can share of good re-designs? It's not just about re-designs which are based on solid data but also scholarly practice - teachers often have a natural, intuitive understanding of what works and what doesn't. Iterative re-design is surely an inherent part of teacher practice.</p>]]></description>

              <title>What is a Design Atelier? </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2715</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Prompted by an interesting discussion at a JISC Cluster Meeting I have created this cloud to explore further what a Design Atelier actually is?&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Background<br /></strong>The <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearning/curriculumdelivery/atelierd.aspx">ATELIER-D</a> project takes as its starting point the centuries-old methods of learning and teaching in the studio of a master artist or craftsperson. The project brings the spirit of the atelier into the 21st century. It develops the notion of the &lsquo;virtual design studio&rsquo; using ICTs to create powerful learning and teaching environments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In his keynote presentation at the OpenLearn conference&nbsp;30-31st October 2007 at The Open University (OU), John Seeley Brown used the term &lsquo;atelier&rsquo; to characterise an emerging form of learning and teaching based on social networks, a distinct participatory approach by learners and teachers and pedagogy rooted in practice. Seeley Brown drew on his experience in architecture education but many in the parent domain of design education will recognise the well-established and powerful approach offered by the atelier (see link below).<br /><br />As part of the JISC funded ATELIER-D project the OU are researching how a virtual atelier can be created using the latest Web 2.0 tools that support a wide range of distance learning designs students.<br /><strong><br />This cloud<br /></strong>This cloud seeks to promote discussion about what you think a Design Atelier is?</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the key attributes that make up a Design Atelier?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>What makes it so special?</li>
<li>Is the nature of the physical space important?&nbsp; Should it be large and open or small&nbsp; and private?</li>
<li>What type of teaching methods should be used?</li>
<li>How can communication be used to support learning?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>This link&nbsp;below takes&nbsp;you to a short video clip to prompt the discussion. <br />Your thoughts and views are most welcome.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Survey</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Survey looking at staff perceptions around learning design in the OU</li>
<li>It is becoming harder to understand how all the parts of planned learning and teaching fit together. Ca. 60% agree this is true</li>
<li>The advent of e-learning is making the process of creating courses more complex. Over 70% agree</li>
<li>Technologies available today offer great potential for enhancing student learning experience. Ca 80%</li>
<li>Technologies will deliver great enhancements in student learning experience. Less than the above, i.e. confidence in it making a different is less</li>
<li>Do you believe that more use of visual representation could help students better understand and plan their study. Over 70% agree</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process/product&hellip; design solution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s about the process of problem solving, with the product being more about analysis, evaluation and sharing. A lot of the representations are of the design solution. Would like to explore more how we represent the problem</li>
<li>Lee and Nelson, 2005 Many studies have been conducted to investigate influential factors on problem-solving performance and relevant approaches that support successful problem solving. &hellip; importance of knowledge representation that is a solvers knowledge and the structure.</li>
<li>There have been a number of attempts to represent at the task level &ndash; such as the AUTC swimlines of resources, tasks and support. The CompendiumLD task swimline representations as well. </li>
<li>Have been working with a course team T100 at the draft stage of course development. Once the course has been drafted then often it goes out for developmental testing. And finally looking at a course in production. </li>
<li>Using Cmap as a means of mapping this. Interested in using this to map at the block level. At the top have prior knowledge and skills and at the bottom is where you want the students to end up in terms of learning outcome. Mapping learning and understanding to what students actually do. </li>
<li>Enables you to see the dependencies between different components. </li>
<li>Moving away from the sequential temporal task sequences. </li>
<li>Have an activity that enables people to see the value of representing things visual. Takes a week of learning from our H808 course.</li>
<li>An interesting activity is to look at a visual representation of this and then consider whether or not the learning outcmes had been met and how long will the activity take.</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>From the AECT website: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;                                     His presentation will start by summarising outcomes from recent research on how university students approach complex inquiry-based learning tasks that involve significant use of educational technology. The research reveals significant variations in how students make sense of such challenges, how they negotiate between their own and their teachers&rsquo; goals, and how environmental factors influence the nature and outcomes of their learning activity. The discussion will focus on some of the ways in which students&rsquo; conceptions of learning, and other beliefs about learning, interact with their technological choices and with their use (or non-use) of the various kinds of support that their teachers provide. This picture of students exercising autonomy in their learning, but making choices that are not always optimal, will then be used as a backdrop for explaining a conception of university teaching called &lsquo;teaching-as-design&rsquo;. Peter will sketch a model of teaching-as-design and then focus on forms of knowledge and ways of knowing that stand a reasonable chance of improving teachers&rsquo; educational design activity. Finally, he will draw out some implications for an educational technology research agenda that is fit for the purpose of improving the integrative challenges of teaching-as-design.</p>
<p>Professor of education and co-director of the CoCo Research Centre, University of Sydney, Senior Fellow, Australian Learning and Teaching Council</p>
<p><strong>Three parts to the keynote</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Research into students experience of learning in blended learning contexts</li>
<li>Concept of teaching as design</li>
<li>Forms of knowledge capture, ways of sharing expertise for design between teachers involved in designing for students</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1. Learning through inquiry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inquiry learning is about - all forms of educational activity that give a central place to students ingvetigattive work. For example problem-based learning,&nbsp; project-based learning, or&nbsp; collaborative knowledge building</li>
<li>It may be Individual&nbsp; or group based, and often involves discussion for coordinated as well as knowledge building</li>
<li>Draws on: 
<ul>
<li>Important in terms of development of graduate capabilities &ndash; Argyris, C (1998) "Teaching smart people how to learn" &ndash; Harvard Bus Review on Knowledge Management, Cam MA</li>
<li>Boulton G and Lucas C 2008 "What are universities for?" <a href="http://www.leru.org/">www.leru.org</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning to deal with complexity, helping students to deal with this</li>
<li>Goodyear and Zenios 2007 BJET 55 (4) discussion collaborative knowledge work and epistemic fluency</li>
<li>Researching university students experiences of blended learning from a phenomenographic perspective 0 students conceptions of learning, students approaches to study &ndash; strategies and intentions.Undertook a set of In depth interviews n = 20, open ended survey n = 50 and likert scale instruments n =100</li>
<li>New book Ellis and Goodyear Routledge, 2009</li>
<li>Taped and transcribed &ndash; each read independently by 3 researchers &ndash; illuminating phrases and main themes noted and compared, further reading, categories, comparison, discussion, final agreement</li>
<li>Three areas: conceptions, f2f approaches, online approaches</li>
<li>Adv in Health Sci Educ (2008) 13: 675-692</li>
<li>Concepts of PBL a way if developing independent clinical reasoning and problem solving abilities through to more restricted views as a way of covering topics to answer problems, a way of followig a predefined process. Get a lot of variation between the students in terms of what they think they can get out of PBL</li>
<li>Approaches &ndash; deep vs. surface. Find that very few of the students are actually adopting deep learning approaches</li>
<li>Distribution of conceptions and approaches &ndash; the majority are not adopting richer notions of PBL or deep approaches, there is a mis-match between the teachers intentions and what they students are actually doing. Translates through to end of course grades</li>
<li>Students should make choices in HE need to become autonomous, about how they respond to the tasks set for them, what tools and resource to use</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>But their choices are less than optimal. The patterns we see are familiar from 30 years of HE research, but we are picking it up in contexts where technology plays a role too.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Students are looking to us &ndash; their teachers for guidance&rsquo;s even about the educational use of technologies</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What form should design guidance&rsquo;s take when it needs tow ork in participatory/co-design/co-configuration context?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Teaching as design</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The decline of the compliant learner &ndash; in HE there isn&rsquo;t a systematic approach to instructional design/learning design. The challenges teachers are facing now are incredibly complex, to try and help students benefit from the opportunities need a more systematic approach need to use some design tools. Some of ideas of instructional design have assumed a compliant learner &ndash; they will do what they are set. This is not true in HE and we don&rsquo;t want them to be compliant. We want them to be creative, to interpret the task, to appropriate it. Design more about the crafting of affordances than the determination of activities.</li>
<li>The architecture of productive learning environments</li>
<li>Educational design as the crafting of affordances</li>
<li><em>From sage on the stage to guide on the side</em></li>
<li>Teaching as telling towards teaching as facilitation</li>
<li>Learning by listening to learning by doing (more activity-based learning)</li>
<li>But we also need to include &ndash; teaching as design&hellip; <em>ie to the team with a scheme</em></li>
<li>C21 learning is different and we need to adapt our design methods to better reflect this&ndash; learning to think for a living, teacher-researcher, extended professional</li>
<li>Multiple intended learning outcomes tasks &ndash; lead to activity &ndash; leads to outcomes</li>
<li>Distinction between task (what the teacher sets for the student to do) and activity (what the students actually do)</li>
<li>Legitimate (re)interpretation of task: creative, personalised, &ldquo;satisficing&rdquo;</li>
<li>Learning is physically situated &ndash; &ldquo;learnplaces&rdquo; and is socially situated &ndash; groups, teams and communities</li>
<li>Then design centred on student activities &ndash; people, community and tools, resource and infrastructure, social relations, place. With the tasks as the &ldquo;rules&rdquo;</li>
<li>Indirect approach to design &ndash; learnplace, social space and tasks</li>
<li>We need to design these design components (task, tools, people) from the micro, meso and macro level. We need to better integrate across these as well.</li>
<li>Teaching as design &ndash; indirect because legitimised by the students gap bet task specified and subsequent student activities</li>
<li>Co-configuration of the complex mix of material and digital tools, resources and places</li>
<li>Autonomy exercised by students in making choices about who to work with and how</li>
<li>Plus alignment up and down the system &ndash; macro to micro</li>
<li>Against this backdrop how can we support teachers&rsquo; design work?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Capturing and sharing experiential and evidence based knowledge for design</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Goodyear and Retalis, forthcoming edited collection on current research on pedagogical patterns. &ldquo;Technology-enhanced learning design patterns and patterns languages&rdquo;</li>
<li>A pattern is a solution to a recurrent problem in a context Alexander et al., 1977</li>
<li>A pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a millions times over</li>
<li>Structure: context, essence of the problem, rationale, the solution (which is action orientated), smaller patterns</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Pedagogical pattern: Umpire</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Defines a role that is useful in a umber of group task patterns</li>
<li>Lively discussion can generate emotion and someone will occasionally say something offensive&hellip;</li>
<li>Solution make it responsibility o the group to deal with offensive comments, give one or two students the role of umpire</li>
<li>Lower level patterns &ndash; scribe and wrapper and whistle</li>
<li>These fit together in a pattern language</li>
<li>Course, inquiry task, planning group _ problem scenario, umpire + scribe + wrapper</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Design patterns and pattern languages: take home points</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Design as intimately involved in balancing competing forces</li>
<li>Contextualised guidance vs. universal principles</li>
<li>Linking rationale to action-oriented guidance including students</li>
<li>Rationale can draw on experience theory empirical data etc</li>
<li>Performance support balance with professional development</li>
<li>Giving names to useful recurrent forms is a significant contribution (for example the jigsaw pattern)</li>
<li>Linking design patterns to software etc</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>
<p>Students are active interpreters of task requirements</p>
<p>Educational designs need to have ways of helping us talk abut design of good tasks</p>
<p>In relation to tasks, tools and people, students will need to exercise significant autonomy in their choices, often make sub-optimal choices, there are things we can do to help with this, better scaffolding, changing the culture</p>
<p>Major practical challenge &ndash; managing the interface between increasing smart and ubiquitous technologies and the local infrastructure</p>
<p>Transforming knowledge so that its application by time poor undertrained teachers and in local contexts</p>
<p>Having a shared sense of the architecture of what we are trying to create can really focus outputs from research in educational technology/learning sciences &ndash; a clearer sense of the users of research and the specifics of their needs</p>

<p>From the article<br />Cog-Learn is a pattern language aimed at supporting the design of learning material for e-learning systems. Here, we describe Co-Learn and discuss the patterns' identification and formalization processes through two case studies in which a set of cognitive strategies was applied with the goal of better organizing the content seen by the student. The purpose is to facilitate the student's interaction with the material's interface and, consequently, improve the learning process.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The short course design challenge&hellip; are you up to it???</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br /> Curriculum design has never being more challenging or potentially exciting:<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;New technologies offer a seemingly endless range of possibilities in terms of use of engaging digital media to support core course material to exciting and authentic communicative and collaborative opportunities<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Modern students are more and more diverse with higher expectations of courses and more diverse needs from formal, work-related possibilities through to learning for informal, personal reasons<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Employers are increasingly demanding evidence of students having developed a diverse range of social skills and competences to meet the challenges of the modern workplace<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is now a range of educational models that can be applied to help foster different pedagogical approaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one-day workshop has been developed to introduce course teams to  using a learning design approach. The example below (originally used at  Brunel University in 2009) uses the OULDI learning tools and activities  but we have successfully tried slotting in tools and activities from  other projects (especially the Viewpoints project) and the format holds  well. For a list of other activities and tools you could use try the  learning design toolbox. These and other examples of the template in use:</p>

<h2>The Challenge...</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Design  Challenge&rsquo; is intended to be an intense  but fun means of illustrating a  range of resources, tools and ways of  thinking about course design.  Participants are introduced to a range of  tools and techniques by means  of access to advisors who will help them  along the process. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the afternoon each team  presents their ideas. A  panel evaluates their work and select the  strongest designs. The  session concludes with a reflection on the  usefulness of the event and  on which of the ideas, resources and tools  participants might wish to  pursue further. <br /> <br /> Although designed  as a fun activity, the event gives an awareness of  the latest in  thinking innovatively about curriculum design and is  designed to be  proactive rather than being composed around an  uncontextualised set of  one-to-many presentations. The time-limited  challenge enables  participants to make a preliminary assessment of  which of the ideas,  tools and resources are useful and gives them some  feel for what might  be possible in a longer, term real course  production process. Hopefully  the challenge will open avenues for  participants to pursue this further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>Paper  and pens (hard copies of tools if appropriate - A3 best)</p>
<p>'Stalls'  facilitators</p>
<p>Two laptops per team (can also bring their own  but should be networked)</p>
<p>So that your teams can export the CompendiumLD maps and save any    other work done on workshop laptops, please ensure that they bring at    least one USB memory key with them per team.</p>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>11.30 &ndash; 12.00</strong> <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/view/2599">Activity: Design review</a></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->We will introduce 3 tools which can be  used at   various points in  the design process to represent, inform and  reflect on   designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;   
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jiscdesignstudio.pbworks.com/w/page/OULDI:-Pedagogy-Profile">Pedagogy  profile</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jiscdesignstudio.pbworks.com/w/page/OULDI:-Course-Dimensions">Course  dimensions</a></li>
<li>Ruin a course checklist (created during the first activity)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Each team will use these tools to evaluate  their   designs and inform  their design decision making.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>12.00 &ndash; 12.40</strong>&nbsp; <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/view/2600">Activity: Stalls activity</a></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Teams will split in to focus groups.  Individuals,   with the support  of expert facilitators, will explore  one of the following   themes (examples from Brunel University  workshop):</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;   
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/view/2557">Library, media services  and accessibility</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/view/2556">Open Educational  Resources</a></li>
<li>Pedagogy (including assessment)</li>
<li><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/view/2555">Visualisation and  representations</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Individuals will then rejoin their work  teams,   share findings and  consider what the impact of these findings  might be the   emerging  designs. The expert facilitators will be  available to offer support    for the remainder of the workshop and will  upload links and resources to    Cloudworks as appropriate.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>12.40 &ndash; 1.30</strong> Lunch</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>1.30 &ndash; 3.00</strong> <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/view/2601">Activity: Visualising  designs</a></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Using all the online and physical  resources   available, teams will  draw up a more detailed  representation of their module.   These  representations are likely to  include i.e. sequence, learning outcomes,    outlines of activities,  technologies used, assessment strategies etc.  Using   Compendium it is  also possible to create links to specific OERs,  tools and   resources.  Designs and discussions around design problems  and decisions will   be  added to the Cloudworks site &ndash; allowing for  collaborative discussion    between teams and opening up discussion  beyond the workshop.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>3.00 &ndash; 3.15</strong> Tea and  coffee</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>3.15 &ndash; 3.45</strong> <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/view/2602">Activity: Design  Evaluation</a></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;This activity will provide an opportunity  to view   and review the  designs of other teams and give and receive  feedback. It is   recognised  that designs at this stage will contain  detail but will not    necessarily be &lsquo;finished&rsquo;.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>3.45 &ndash; 4.30</strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/view/2603"> Activity: Next steps,  action   planning and evaluation</a></p>

We kijken naar de toekomst omdat de “nieuwe” media zich steeds sneller ontwikkelen; en daarmee ontwikkelen zich ook nieuwe mediatoepassingen. In dit vak kijken we vanuit toekomstige media naar de nieuwe vormen van communicatie. Voorbeelden van de impact van media op de huidige communicatie zijn natuurlijk het internet, maar ook mobiele communicatie, computer games, webgemeenschappen en ook computer games. Als we de recente voorspellingen over de nieuwste gadgets serieus nemen dan staan er ons heel wat veranderingen te wachten in communicatieland. Het is de bedoeling dat je in dit vak actief met ideeën speelt over hoe communicatie er over drie á vijf jaar uitziet. Na een aantal ontwerpfasen maak je een geavanceerde web site waarop je demonstreert hoe jouw voorgestelde mediatoepassing in de toekomst er uit ziet en hoe ze gaat werken.</span></span></strong><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial" lang="NL"><o:p></o:p></span></h3><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #534741; font-family: Arial" lang="NL">In dit vak wordt in groepen van vier studenten gewerkt aan het (her)ontwerp van een nieuwe mediatoepassing vanuit een communicatiewetenschappelijk perspectief <o:p></o:p></span><span style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><o:p><span style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--> </span></o:p></span>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Many professional disciplines, such as engineering, architecture and design, require students both to understand theory and to apply it through technical skills in practical situations. To help students make the link, this course adopts the metaphor of a professional journal: issued online fortnightly, ie six issues over the semester.
<p>
Each issue is devoted to one theoretical topic. As well as articles and an online tutorial in technical skills, it contains an editorial page – to which students contribute reflective submissions on the topical question posed – and a case study page – to which students contribute notes on their ongoing work for their own case study projects. The editorial and case study contributions count towards the students’ continuous assessment.

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/278</link>

              <description><![CDATA[Collaborative learning entails students taking responsibility for assessment of their own learning processes. In this course, which aims to give students teamwork experience relevant to their future employment, self and peer assessment is formalised into a regular weekly structure.

Here, the student teams are developing a multimedia product and associated documentation, and the team roles typically include project manager, instructional designer, graphic designer, programmer. However, the principles are widely applicable.

Each team negotiates the exact responsibilities of each member (their deliverables, hours of work, expected quality) and signs a contract to record their agreement. Every week during development, each student completes an online form, rating themselves and the other members of their team for success, quality and time management. The tutor uses this information to moderate the marks for individual students.

For details of the self and peer assessment tool, follow the link and click the Cross-links tab on the case study page.

              <description><![CDATA[In classroom teaching, students can be hesitant to participate especially in demanding activities such as those requiring critical evaluation.

This sixth-form college course in ICT uses VLE activities as preparation for classroom work. For example, where students are asked to critically evaluate a web-based resources, they post their observations to a discussion board over several days. In class, their contributions are discussed and the tutor provides feedback. This has led to more participation, and more reflective and deeper contributions.
