              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Producing 45 minutes of online multimedia activities</strong><br /><br /><strong>To What End:</strong> Teams of three working to create a series of short, simple set of e-tivities. <br /><br /><strong>By what Means:</strong> &nbsp;Introduction to the activity. Collaboration to achieve goal in resources-limited conditions. Reflection on team work, authoring the content, time management and perceived effectiveness of the resource. Day long workshop approach, 2 hours before lunch, 3 hours in the afternoon with ample room for breaks. Expect 15 participants. <br /><br /><strong>Total session time: 300 minutes. 5 Hours.</strong> <br /><br />9.30 am Registration<br />10.00 am Start<br />11.15 am Break<br />11.30 am restart<br />12.30 LUNCH<br />1.30 pm Afternoon Session 1<br />2.30 END<br />2.30 Afternoon Session 2<br />3.30 END<br />3.30Afternoon Session 3<br />4.30 END<br />5.00 Reflection<br /><br /><strong>TLA 1: Introduction to the activity time allotted =55 minutes</strong><br /><br />Instructor presents the session activity, including the objective to achieve, the materials available, the restrictions, and the rules of winning. The task is to create a 45 minute multi-media module using a variety of formats using only Xerte or Wordpress, an accessible power point like platform or a versatile blogging platform and tool. <br /><br />The winning team is decided by peers. (Read Watch Listen - &nbsp;25 minutes)<br /><br />Instructor breaks the whole class into small groups, asks students to introduce themselves to group members and to other groups, and to ask any questions about the activity. (Discuss - &nbsp;30 minutes)<br /><br /><strong>TLA 2: Collaboration to achieve goal in resources-limited conditions time allotted =180 minutes</strong><br /><br />Groups of students work together to complete the task; the instructor walks around the room to monitor the interactions and draft outputs, noting issues for the class discussion; gives 10-minute and 5-minute warnings. Each group makes their finished e-tivity available for the other groups to evaluate.<br /><br />Three iterations of 45 minutes each - with 15 minutes in the hour to break. (Produce - &nbsp;150 minutes)<br /><br />The &lsquo;smorgasbord&rsquo; of activities on the chosen platform might be between 6 to 9, though some of these would be very straight forward - read text, watch and take notes from video, comment on set of pictures or interpret a chart, while others might be more complex, for example creating a set of plausible and valuable multiple-choice questions that both in form and test the participant. Similarly scripting, shooting, editing and loading a short piece of video (aim for under 90 seconds) would take the full 45 minutes allocated. <br /><br />Instructor invites each group to decide on their own criterion for judging what other groups have produced, then to inspect all the others and award 1st 2nd and 3rd prize according to their criterion. (Collaborate - &nbsp;30 minutes)<br /><br /><strong>TLA 3: Reflection on team work time management, criteria formation time allotted =65 minutes</strong><br /><br />Instructor chairs a class discussion about the process, the criteria they have chosen, and prompts them to reflect on their experience of managing time. (Discuss - &nbsp;45 minutes)<br /><br />Instructor sums up some of the key issues for achieving a 45 minute multi-media module using a variety of formats, and the time-management principles that emerge; circulates copies to the class. (Read Watch Listen - &nbsp;20 minutes)<br /><br /><strong>Notes - Post session - Each student is given a similar task to work on independently within a specified time period.</strong><br /><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.33710866514593363"><br /></strong></p>]]></description>

              <title>&#39;Learning Design&#39; experience - OLD-MOOC 2013</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7796</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Every week I 'design' a programme of learning when I take, one after the other, four groups of swimmers at my local swimming club. </strong></p>
<p>Some 12 years of doing this, training and CPD means that I no longer prepare a programme in advance, rather I know the stroke and skills we are covering each week and have in my armoury a set of activities. These build from warm-up over 5-8 minutes into a variety of drills tailored to fixing problems with a stroke. The pattern whole-part-whole is used - to swim the stroke, spot problems, then put in a series of drills and exercises, typically involving only the legs or only the arms - as in 'part'. There are then advance 'whole swim' drills and any number of complementary fun activities. Diving or racing typically ends the session.</p>
<p>Often I draw on sets of images from 'The Swimming Drill Book' to show swimmers poolside what I want them to do - so a sequence of actions or a particular arm, body or leg position. Used in this way these sets of images can become like a set of cards that can be placed in whatever order I feel is appropriate as we go along.</p>
<p>Planning a programme of work for a squad is akin to creating a curriculum that runs from September through to the competitions season that runs through the Spring and Summer.</p>
<p><strong>Creating e-learning for corporate clients - compliance on health and safety, data protection, graduate induction and so on, might follow a remarkably similar pattern.</strong></p>
<p>The 'warm up' is an introduction, ideally something to grab their attention. Headliners on the banking crisis, a news piece on a data protection scandal, a criminal banged up (CPS induction) or a young person (actor) having an asthma attack. Like the swimming session these modules typically run for an hour, so 12 modules at five minutes each isn't unusual. There will be introductions to themes and ideas, following by activities to check learning or integrating an activity with fact finding.</p>
<p><strong>It isn't all online - learners might have to figure something out on paper and then return to the screen.</strong></p>
<p>It may also be personalised, so going into the system to generate something like a holiday request as per the instructions in the learning activity. Whilst the swimmer is observed and various skills checked off, in the e-learning experience the ticks relate to an activity successfully completed. This is not always linear, sometimes it is more exploratory, or can be done out of sequence, but the goal is to get everything done and demonstrate knowledge. At some stages a follow up set of questions will be issues to keep the information fresh.</p>
<p><strong>The outcome is primary - what are you trying to achieve.</strong></p>
<p>It is either state bluntly or apparent from the activities that day.</p>
<p><strong>GOAL </strong>- To ensure that all swimmers keep their hands in front of their shoulders when swimming competitive breaststroke.</p>
<p><strong>GOAL</strong> - To ensure that all graduate lawyers starting with the CPS can visualise a file as a defendant/law breaker - a person on whom all kinds of institutions and other people impact as their case comes to trial.</p>
<p>I have always used a communications industry brief to spec out the project and to help focus on the ideas that are required. On a single sheet of paper respond to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the problem?</li>
<li>Who are you speaking to?</li>
<li>What do you want to say?</li>
<li>How do you want them to respond to this?</li>
<li>What else do we need to know?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Swimming ideas come from formal courses, from colleagues, from resources online and books. You see something that works, so you give it a go. You show what appears to be an intractable problem with others and they offer a solution.</p>
<p>In e-learning the ideas are developed in a lengthy workshop - the client(s) and several team members strip down the creative brief, draw on the knowledge of an experience L&amp;D manager at the client end, may include a subject matter expert, but certainly includes a learning designer and project manager. Flip charts and post-it notes are used.</p>
<p>A number of creative problem solving or idea generating activities can also be used - moderating and leading techniques compiled, trialed and explained by VanGundy, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Marker pens on large sheets of paper - typically on sheets of A1 Flipchart paper - sometimes these are taped together. </strong></p>
<p>My personal preference is for wallpaper backing paper as the long strips mean that people around a table can all contribute. These sessions need to be carefully choreographed ... and at various points the outcomes stated, written down so that everyone can see and agreed.</p>
<p>Once done the Learning Designer takes it all away and compresses it into a form that can be shared digitally - typically a PowerPoint, with the warning that this should not imply a strict linear expression of the learning. Other programmes can be used, usually something built by the agency or a licensed commercial product.</p>
<p>Other learning experiences I have 'designed' - linear and interactive video to support facilitated learning, run to some 50. These followed a far less collaborative process of taking a brief, brainstorming ideas alone ... sometimes using an interactive tool called 'Ideafisher' then producing a synopsis, treatment and script. When other professionals come in to produce the learning the design stage is complete. For interactive learning the video is scripted as a number of components that are an integral part of the learning journey.</p>

              <title>Week Two Summary Contextualisation (Sue Watling DIY Multimedia)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Less about DIY Multimedia and more reflections on the contextualisation of OLD</p>
<p>Learning and isolation are poor partners. Focus on the learner context enhances the process of OLD through revealing motivations as well as potential barriers. Context can reveal attention hot spots e.g. ease of access to materials, availability of support, the loneliness of the long distance online learner, guidance on specific design criteria e.g. the variety of activities, collaboration with peers and tutors, interaction with content, formative and diagnostic assessment opportunities etc. Context assists the designer make appropriate choices, in particular providing mechanisms for customising learning to suit individual preference e.g. providing information in alternative formats. All this runs in parallel to theoretical approaches to LD for example constructive alignment (Biggs and Tang, 2011).</p>
<p>Scenarios,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/personas.html" target="_blank">Personas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/representations-and-languages/force-map" target="_blank">Force Maps</a>&nbsp;are useful approaches to OLD. Context can be presented in textual formats but also displayed through mind mapping or diagrams where a visual approach can offer an effective overview of key issues. Constructing context encourages sharing practice; drawing on own experiences and incorporating those of colleagues to bring key issues together. Doing this online rather than round a table can in itself reveal areas of online learning design which need attention.</p>
<p>For my own practice inclusion is a key concern. Without attention to access, the application of theory to practice becomes diluted. Effective OLD takes into account the diversity of ways people access learning resources and opportunities, this is particularly important where there are no face to face clues or opportunities for discussion. Identifying potential barriers to access and participation are key to retention and success.</p>
<p>In the future I will be looking to building a collection of contrasting scenarios for future reference and experiment with alternative ways of presenting these e.g. diagrammatically.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p class="Body1">Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com" target="_blank">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p class="Body1">This is about a day-long workshop, on three-scene storyboarding, for teachers and other careers workers, for their programme managers and for interested academics.&nbsp; In advance of the workshop participants can access two sources...&nbsp;</p>
<p class="body1" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">an illustrated account of underpinning thinking<br /></a><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbstrybrd.ppt">an animated workshop presentation</a></p>
<p class="Body1">The process starts with a question:</p>
<ul>
<li>what do you hope for from this?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">That opening-up question becomes a continuing conversation.&nbsp; But, to start with, participants are introduced to the process of creating a storyboard.&nbsp; They are asked to recall a turning-point episode in their own life, or of some other person with whom they can empathise.&nbsp; In work-table groups of 4-5, they compare that storyboarding experience.&nbsp; They can then revise their storyboard, or abandon it and start again.&nbsp; In forming and re-forming groups for this work they are encouraged to work with people they have not met before today.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">Throughout the day they are asked variants of four questions...</p>
<ul>
<li>what do you now hope for from this workshop?</li>
<li>what question do you have on how to work with storyboarding?</li>
<li>what reservations do you have about it?</li>
<li>what potential can you find, or not find, in it?</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">Their ideas engage cross-flowing interaction in the whole group - the questions become...</p>
<p align="center"><em>...who has similar ideas?</em><br /><em> ...who has different? </em><br /><em> ...who has contrary? &nbsp;</em><br /><em> ...who has something not yet mentioned?</em></p>
<p class="Body1">At some point during the day everybody has said who they are, and have shown what they have to contribute.&nbsp; Sources of peer help are identified and professional links are made.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">All ideas are flip-charted for continuing review. &nbsp;And, here&rsquo;s the point, that on-going conversation makes it clear that some parts of the presentation need close examination, some can be skipped over, some can be ignored. &nbsp;There is a lot to storyboarding; we were never going to cover it all - but we don&rsquo;t need to.</p>
<p align="center">____________________________</p>
<p class="Body1">Whatever learning up-the-front experts might anticipate, it is never identical to the learning that out-there experienced participants actually get.&nbsp; The back-and-forth learning between everybody in the place makes the workshop an innovative research-and-development event for us all.</p>
<p class="Body1">I&rsquo;ve set out five headings for what that exchange gave us.</p>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>1. hopes for how storyboarding might help people</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">helping them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>express a sense of identity</li>
<li>say what they need to say, that is what lies underneath what they do say</li>
<li>take charge of their own expression, and be calm where there is stress</li>
<li>enable people for whom language is not a tool but a hurdle</li>
<li>find and engage active learning-to-learn</li>
<li>find a focus in the complexity of contemporary life</li>
<li>help to visualise and recognise possible ways forward</li>
<li>be able to say it all out loud, meaning it becomes their commitment</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>2. ideas for how it might develop education professionalism</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">helping professionals to:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn a new tool for improved effectiveness</li>
<li>find new perspective for professional expansion</li>
<li>see how to recognise when storyboarding will, and will not, be useful</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>3. how-to-do questions</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">practitioners need to know more about...</p>
<ul>
<li>whether the turning-point has to be positive</li>
<li>whether it is for other peoples&rsquo; stories or only for the person&rsquo;s own</li>
<li>whether &lsquo;futuring&rsquo; (storyboarding&rsquo;s narrative form of action planning) runs from where the person was in the episode or from where that person is now</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>4. professional reservations </strong></p>
<p class="Body1">professionals need...</p>
<ul>
<li>a framework that gives a reason for doing this</li>
<li>to be convinced that storyboarding actually makes a useful difference</li>
<li>a feel for what can be safely shown in a storyboard - not risking too much disclosure</li>
<li>an idea of the policy focus for storyboarding - say for employability or well-being</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>5. ideas for storyboarding potential</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">working in this way can open-up possibilities...</p>
<ul>
<li>we use storyboarding according to whether or not there is a recognisable turning-point to look at</li>
<li>conversations are originated by the storyboard, so there is an ethical equality where both we and they learn from each other</li>
<li>storyboarded episodes must not be ignored - they require action</li>
<li>the &lsquo;futuring&rsquo; process needs to be un-resolved - and therefore open-ended</li>
<li>it means thinking about consequences of the facts, what they mean, this person&rsquo;s purpose</li>
<li>different turning-points, over a period, can reveal helpful patterns in a life</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">_______________________</p>
<p class="Body1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1"><strong>issues</strong></p>
<p class="Body1">I should be clear that I'm the tutor here.&nbsp; But I don't claim I do it well - that&rsquo;s for others to say.&nbsp; I do claim, though, that something like this is required if education professionalism is to be respected, strengthened and voiced.</p>
<p class="Body1">The implication is that there can be no known-in-advance assumptions about outcomes and how they are to be reached.&nbsp; The workshop is a conversation between participants-and-tutor as a whole.&nbsp; And, in the cross-flow of ideas, that conversation is often between the authority of expertise and the authority of experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">It&rsquo;s true that there are unavoidable features of storyboarding format and process that need to be learned.&nbsp; But it's also true that participants need to say where they are, where they need to be, where they are going with it, and what is helping them - and hindering them.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">One of the most telling signs of what is learned is in the way they first design and then revise the storyboards they create.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body1">On-line exchange means that the thinking can be widely and continuously extended and made the basis for innovative action...</p>
<ul>
<li>finding what is critical to the value of storyboarding</li>
<li>realising what needs more thought, more discussion, or more enquiry</li>
<li>signposting needed changes in storyboarding format and process</li>
<li>prioritising future action</li>
<li>saying what I got wrong and whether I got anything right</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is why I'm putting it where there is a space - below - for such comments, ideas and purposes.</p>
<p align="center">_______________________</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">some of the workshop storyboards will be made available at the career-learning caf&eacute; in due course - there will be an alert at...</p>

<p>Hi there everyone</p>
<p>I will start the discussion with a question</p>
<p>Is technology being used for technologies sake in the class room.?..</p>

<p>Or...are technological tools being<em> installed</em> in the classroom for 'technology''s sake but not really used?</p>

<p>thats an interesting observation and something I have seen supported in my own observations in schools.&nbsp; From what I have observed the technology is there and being used but a such a minimal level that it is basically an illuminated blackboard.</p>
<p>The problem that I can see for teaching staff is the vast array of functions that modern technology makes available. To take advantage of this new functionality you have to be a professional programmer or have access to the sort of IT support and development which frankly cannot be found at the average school.&nbsp; When observing I ahve thought of a number of wyas in which a presentation could be made more interactive with a little macro here or bit of code there...but how can you ask an already busy teacher to sit down and learn modern programming techniques.</p>
<p>I think the answer is much better IT support in schools with staff capable of taking on development jobs and building new intereactive solutions within the school. Too often I see technology installed and underused or as a recently mismanaged but inadequately trained IT staff.</p>
<p>My answer is thus better support for teachers from an IT view point and stronger encouragement to pass on development of new presentations to professional IT staff or hight experienced IT / Teaching staff.</p>

<p>I am lucky enough to have a dry wipe board as well as an interactive whiteboard and internet access. I tend to find the PhET website phet.colorado.edu gets used most lessons. Also Southampton Universities "Waves" resource is excellent for moving diagrams. The advantage over other interactive resources is there is nothing to program or install. Students can also use the applets to try things out. The applets and moving diagrams show extra information that you cannot see in real life but help in the learning process. It is also nice to be able to record information from class/group work in text documents or spreadsheets to make it available for later analysis or review. With so the variety of students to accomodate the technology has to be easy to use and reliable. Some technology is amazing if you can afford to give it your full attention but that is not what we want to do. Having someone show you how easy something is helps to overcome the initial reluctance. I would be lost without my technology toys.</p>

<p>Hi Chris - good to see you in this discussion! And thanks for sharing a few subject specific tools (any chance of the links...:-) ) I agree that having someone showing us that creative use of technology doesn't have to be an all or nothing element in our learning designs is really important, and also hearing about the experiences of experienced teachers who can now not think about teaching in any other way.</p>
<p>Prof, I come (like Chris) from FE and my experience of schools education is limited but I'd say that FE does have techie people about the place but that in itself is not enough. My experience is that few IT support folk have the pedagogical understanding to support the <em>teaching</em> part of teaching with technology. I think there is a real need for a defined learning technologist role in schools, as there is is most HE institutions and some FE. Someone who's job it is to keep on top of new ideas and uses of technology for learning and teaching and share best practice.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>If you are interested in social software and how it can be used in vocational education &amp; training and higher education institutions, if you are looking into Personal Learning Environments and how they can help you and/or your students to put some structure into the unstructured world of social networks, learning tools, and educational resources, than you really shouldn&rsquo;t miss this workshop. The workshop will address the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>How have <em>learning and teaching strategies</em> at vocational education &amp; training (VET) and higher education (HE) institutions changed since the advent of new learning tools and Personal Learning Environments (PLE)? How can success stories be identified?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What challenges do teachers and trainers, as well as curriculum authors face in relation to this shift in learning and teaching tools?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What key competences teachers and learners require and develop when learning with social software, new learning tools and Personal Learning Environments?</li>
</ul>
<p>The official title of the workshop is: Reviewing and reviving learning and teaching strategies with the new learning tools (REVIVE project)</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This activity is a variant on the idea of a webquest, it provides a fun ways of exploring the cloudworks site and sharing findings. The aim is to explore the site and to give you an idea of what it contains and how it can be used.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cluster into teams of 3 or 4</li>
<li>If you haven't already done so, create a <strong>Cloudworks account </strong>(you can view anything on the site, but to post comments or add anything you need an account)<strong><br /></strong></li>
<li>Spend a max of fifteen minutes <strong>exploring cloudworks </strong>(suggested stategies - browse clouds and cloudscapes, enter keywords in search, explore by tags, look at individual people's profiles </li>
<li>You may wish to open your search in a <strong>new tab or page </strong>in your browser so that you can easily navigate back to this cloud</li>
<li>If you are new to cloudworks you might like to take a look at our <a href="/cloudscape/view/1911">'using cloudworks cloudscape'</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Activities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How many people with the firstname "Sue" are registered with cloudworks?</li>
<li>How many people are registered with cloudworks from "The Open University"?</li>
<li>How many people are following Rebecca Galley?</li>
<li>Name three of the people Grainne Conole is following</li>
<li>Find an interesting cloud on collaborative learning</li>
<li>Find a cloudscape that was set up for a conference</li>
<li>Find a cloud you thiink is particularly interesting, say why you like it</li>
<li>What can you find in the site on mindmapping tools?</li>
<li>What kinds of clouds and cloudscapes have been tagged with the word "twitter"?</li>
<li>What's the latest cloud that has been added to the site?</li>
<li>What is the latest link that has been added to the flash debate cloudscape?</li>
<li>What three words would you use to describe cloudworks?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And finally...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Write up your findings as a group on the flipchart</strong>, but although feel free to add additional comments/reflections here, but note that anything you post here is open for anyone to see!</li>
<li><strong>Vote</strong> for your favourite cloud or cloudscape using the <a href="http://surveys.polldaddy.com/s/4FECC2CF90277B45/">survey</a></li>
<li><strong>Use</strong> this cloud to record any thoughts or impressions</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Outline of the day</h2>
<p>9.30 &ndash; 9.45&nbsp; Arrival activity Setting personal and team objectives</p>
<p>9.45 &ndash; 9.55 Welcome and introductions</p>
<p>9.55 &ndash; 10.15 Derek K Milligan - Blended Learning at Brunel</p>
<p>10.15 &ndash; 10.35<strong> Activity: How to ruin a course</strong></p>
<p>This activity will focus on the key issues and   strategies that impact on the success (or otherwise) of learning and teaching   within your context. The output of this activity will be a team checklist   which will be used as one of the design evaluation tools in the design review   and at the end of the workshop.</p>
<p>10.35 &ndash; 11.15 <strong>Activity: &lsquo;At a glance&rsquo; course map</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;We will propose 5 key components of a course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidance and support</li>
<li>Information and experience</li>
<li>Communication and experience</li>
<li>Thinking and reflection</li>
<li>Evidence and demonstration</li>
</ul>
<p>and introduce a framework/ tool to begin mapping   out the key elements and &lsquo;flavour&rsquo; of the module/ short course designs. We   will discuss the nature of the resultant representations and explore possible   uses of these.</p>
<p>11.15 &ndash; 11.30 Tea and coffee</p>
<p>11.30 &ndash; 12.00<strong> Activity: Design review</strong></p>
<p>We will introduce 3 tools which can be used at   various points in the design process to represent, inform and reflect on   designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogical profiler</li>
<li>Design decision assistant</li>
<li>Ruin a course checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>Each team will use these tools to evaluate their   designs and inform their design decision making.</p>
<p>12.00 &ndash; 12.40&nbsp; <strong>Activity: Stalls activity</strong></p>
<p>Teams will split in to focus groups. Individuals,   with the support of expert facilitators, will explore one of the following   themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Library, media services and accessibility</li>
<li>Open Educational Resources</li>
<li>Pedagogy (including assessment)</li>
<li>Visualisation and representations</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals will then rejoin their work teams,   share findings and consider what the impact of these findings might be the   emerging designs. The expert facilitators will be available to offer support   for the remainder of the workshop and will upload links and resources to   Cloudworks as appropriate.</p>
<p>12.40 &ndash; 1.30 Lunch</p>
<p>1.30 &ndash; 3.00 <strong>Activity: Visualising designs</strong></p>
<p>Using all the online and physical resources   available, teams will draw up a more detailed representation of their module.   These representations are likely to include i.e. sequence, learning outcomes,   outlines of activities, technologies used, assessment strategies etc. Using   Compendium it is also possible to create links to specific OERs, tools and   resources. Designs and discussions around design problems and decisions will   be added to the Cloudworks site &ndash; allowing for collaborative discussion   between teams and opening up discussion beyond the workshop.</p>
<p>3.00 &ndash; 3.15 Tea and coffee</p>
<p>3.15 &ndash; 3.45<strong> Activity: Design Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;This activity will provide an opportunity to view   and review the designs of other teams and give and receive feedback. It is   recognised that designs at this stage will contain detail but will not   necessarily be &lsquo;finished&rsquo;.</p>
<p>3.45 &ndash; 4.15<strong> Activity: Next steps and action   planning</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is hoped that this practical session will lead   to the design or redesign of modules/short courses and that these will be &lsquo;launched&rsquo;   over the next few months. This activity will give teams an opportunity to   identify the next steps in the design process and what further support they   may need from the University or the OULDI project team.</p>
<p>4.15 &ndash; 4.30 Close of session and evaluation of workshop</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Two laptops per team will be provided but please also feel free to bring your own if you would like to.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;So that your teams can export the Compendium maps and save any other work done on workshop laptops, please ensure that you bring at least one USB memory key with you per team.</em></p>]]></description>

The morning activities have been designed to give you&nbsp; the skills and knowledge you need.&nbsp; By this time you will have considered design questions such as staff to student ratio, balance of physical to online learning, the technologies you will use, assessment strategies, pedegogical approach and accessability issues. You, or someone in your team, will have learnt about approaches to visualisation and representataion too.</p>
<p>We recognise that this is just a one day workshop - and course designing often takes far longer than 6 hours - but we anticipate that by the end of this activity you will have a sound&nbsp; design outline on which to build. Please make proactive use all of the resources that you have to hand.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>In this activity you will move temporarily out of your curriculum teams and into special interest groups (stalls). The groups available for this session are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogy (including assessment</li>
<li>Library, Media services and Accessibility</li>
<li>Visualisations and representations</li>
<li>Open Educational resources</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure a good skills spead in your team, make sure at least 1 person goes along to each of the stalls.&nbsp; An expert will be facilitating each special interest group and the activity you will do in these groups is likely to be discussion based and focusing on some of the practicalities and also some of the issues. You will spend about 20 mins in your special interest group and then have an opportunity to feedback your findings to your team.</p>
<p>Learning outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develops Learning Design networks</li>
<li>Develops individual knowledge in an aspect of learning design/ e-pedagogy</li>
<li>Broadens teams' knowledge base in aspects of learning design/e-pedagogy</li>
</ul>

<p>In this activity evaluation/ reflection tools will be used to review teams' designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogy profile</li>
<li>Course dimensions</li>
<li>How to ruin a course checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>Each tool looks at a different aspect of your design, and each has strengths and limitations. It is intended that they should work effectively together.</p>
<p>1. Use the 3 tools to review your design (no more than 10 mins per tool)</p>
<p>2. Make a list of the changes you will make as a consequence of the review</p>
<p>3. Amend the design, save it to your pen drive and add to Slideshare</p>
<p>4. Update your&nbsp; Cloud with progress update and images as appropriate</p>]]></description>

The tool is text based and built around the premise that key learning design decisions will fall into one of&nbsp; 4 catagories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidance and support</li>
<li>Communication and collaboration</li>
<li>Reflection and demonstration</li>
<li>Content and experience</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'at a glance' representation gives a one-page overview of a module or course and can effectively communicate the 'flavour' or 'vision' of the course.</p>
<p>1. In your team, and using the Word proforma on the pen drive, outline your 'vision' of your module or short course.</p>
<p>2. Save a copy&nbsp; to the pen drive.</p>
<p>3. Upload to the workshop Slideshare account</p>
<p>4. Have a look at the other groups 'at a glance' representations and discuss the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well do the representations communicate the 'flavour of the course'?</li>
<li>Who might find this representation useful and when?</li>
<li>What would it be useful to add?</li>
</ul>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim of this arrival activity is to provide teams with an opportunity to review personal objectives within the team and decide on team objectives for the day. The list will be used at the end of the session to frame reflection and evaluation.</p>
<p>This activity will take place while everyone is settling in, setting up lap tops etc and before the session starts properly.</p>
<p>1. Write down 3 personal objectives</p>
<p>2. Briefly share these with the team</p>
<p>3. Agree team objectives by identifying common themes within the team (no more than 6!)</p>
<p>4. Write these on the flip chart paper provided</p>
<p>5. <em>If you have time</em> add team objectives to this Cloud (by clicking on '<em>add extra content'</em>)</p>]]></description>

<p>The Brunel Blended Design workshop will focus on representing at module or short course level but it should be noted that less work has been done around representing at this level. It is likely that you will take tools and strategies from both the Curriculum and Activity level 'toolboxes'.</p>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1852</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>
<b>Audience</b><br />
Workshop for researchers: OER researchers, learning design and pedagogical patterns researcher
</p>
<p>
<br />
<b>Focus of workshops</b><br />
•    To develop an evolving collective set of research questions and cumulative data for the area [Maybe some data that they can take away and analyse themselves]. Sharing of raw data – a principle of an open resource approach – to share and discuss<br />
•    To develop a shared understanding to define the intersections of the three domains and the benefits of combining them, to include: research questions, definitions, areas of activities, tensions and position, and core principles, what are the key journals and areas of activities<br />
•    To develop a shared research domain definition for this new field
</p>
<p>
<b>Resources<br />
</b>•    Key papers for the field – could we have an evolving list – papers plus discussion and in particular are there ones that are working at the interface<br />
•    Expertise database and funding sources<br />
•    Collective data gathering and reuse which can be mined for different purposes<br />
Data <br />
•    1. Collective share knowledge on key research questions, brainstorm and refine research question<br />
•    2. Data on research questions<br />
o    ‘’How do teachers do about the design process?” Source of data, findings, and then aggregate [Design strategies clouds, LD workshops, interviews with teacher]<br />
o    “What are the barriers to reuse of OER?<br />
•    3. Data mining of cumulative data sources [Could we draw in experts in other fields to help with this?]<br />
•    Existing tools, templates, processes and methods
</p>
<p>
<b>Activities/workshop ideas<br />
</b>•    Brainstorm of what they think are the key papers in the field and why and how they relate to this area – could set up clouds to discuss these<br />
•    Hashtag #olnetkeypapers and short rationale for why to read it<br />
•    Main research domain definitions - what are pedagogical patterns what are peoples perceptions of this – an evolving collective glossary for the field, could set up as a wiki, could have a jigsaw first, then brainstorm etc [Some sub-domains already have definitions, so need to hook into these]<br />
•    Virtual writing groups to develop shared understanding to define the intersections of the three domains: research questions, definitions, areas of activities, tensions and position, and core principles, what are the key journals and areas of activities<br />
•    Build a new social network for OER – share your network (and associated tools and resources) and exploit other people’s networks <br />
•    Thinking of ways of how each community can use each other’s resources – patterns – which OER should we be looking at? How can visualisation ideas from learning design be used in a pattern context<br />
•    Workshop on visualising patterns and metaphors for design <br />
</p>

<b>Overview</b><br />
The workshop will introduce participants to use a range of tools, methods and approaches to designing and evaluating Open Educational Resources (OERs). The session will include an overview of the OLnet initiative which is a new global network of support for researchers, users and producers of OERs. Participants will have a chance to try out some of the tools that have been developed as part of OLnet and to discuss relevance and application to their own practice. See also the related <a href="/node/562">Olnet cloudscape</a> and the <a href="/node/387">OULDI cloudscape</a>, which have additional resources.
</p>
<p>
<b>Outcomes</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>An awareness of the range of resources, tools and methods which are available to support the design and evaluation of OERs – including case studies of good practice, learning object repositories and learning design tools/methods</li>
	<li>An understanding of the OLnet initiative and how it can be used to support the design and evaluation of OERs</li>
	<li>Experience of thinking about the OER effectiveness cycle from different perspectives</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
Is human capital accounting
theoretically possible and practically feasible? Economists estimate
human capital on the basis of years of schooling or formal educational
attainment levels regardless of actual productive capacity. Financial
accounting and reporting ignore even these crude measures, leaving
human capital off the balance sheet for want of rules or conventions. A
review of innovative policies in OECD countries shows that progress has
already been made in moving beyond the poor information provided by
standardized educational certification. Spurred by the emerging
&quot;knowledge economy&quot;, government policy makers, human resource managers,
financial accountants and educators are developing methods for
systematically evaluating and recording knowledge assets acquired
through experience, education and training. This book explains why it
is possible, in terms of economic theory, and feasible, from the
perspective of accounting practices, to implement new human capital
information and decision-making systems.

              <title>Future scenarios for schools</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1363</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1363</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>
This report outlines 4 potential scenarios for the future of schooling. Extract from the introduction:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
	However, as we argue in this publication, there is good reason to think that the first part of the <br />
	21st century could see radical changes in the socio-economic landscape. If this is the case, can schools <br />
	retain such a central, durable, institutional role? Should they? Under what conditions could today’s <br />
	schools play the same roles as in the past? Can the school evolve along with the changing socio- <br />
	economic context, and if so, how? Would schools act as a brake or an accelerator of desired changes?
	</p>
	<p>
	<br />
	In this publication, we address these questions and set out a number of possible futures for schools <br />
	and schooling systems. Our goal is not to generate a single ‘preferred future’, or to offer any kind of <br />
	prediction, but to contribute to the ongoing debate about future schools by helping to extend the time <br />
	horizons within which that debate occurs, and by identifying the possible implications of strategic <br />
	choices that school leaders, policy-makers and others could make in the coming decade. 
	</p>

A summary of the IPTS report on Pedagogical innovations in new ICT-facilitated learning communities (see overview cloud http://cloudworks.ac.uk/node/1326)
</p>
<p>
<br />
<b>Context and motivations for the study<br />
</b>Need for qualified workers<br />
Need for new skills for new jobs<br />
Lifelong learning and mobility<br />
Equity and active participation<br />
Quality and efficiency<br />
Creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship<br />
Lack of transformative impact through ICT in educational systems, although potential exists.
</p>
<p>
<b>Emergence of social computing <br />
</b>Wide take up<br />
Intensive usage<br />
Not only young people!<br />
Not only for leisure
</p>
<p>
Good example for language learning – livemocha ‘a powerful opportunity for people around the world to connect with language partners’
</p>
<p>
<b>Questions<br />
</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Can these emerging online spaces and communities provide learning that is relevant and useful?</li>
	<li>What can education and training systems learn from them?</li>
	<li>How could online communities benefit from lifelong learning and competitiveness in Europe?</li>
	<li>What are the risks and challenges?</li>
	<li>What should and could policies do?</li>
	<li>Online  community?</li>
</ol>
<p>
Preece (2000) an online community consists of 1. People who interact socially, 2. A share purpose that provides a reasons for the community, 2. Policies that guide people’s interactions, 4. Computers systems to support and mediate social interaction and facilitate a sense of togetherness
</p>
<p>
In networked online spaces collective actions also follow from individual activities possibly without shared purpose or sense of togetherness. Also these collective can contribute worth exploring – need for articulating the difference to community.
</p>
<p>
<b>Drivers for participation <br />
</b>1.    Socialising – world of warcract, social networking, YouTube<br />
2.    Production – FLOSS, wikipedia<br />
3.    Organisation – Workplace community, HE online course<br />
4.    Topic – TuDiabetes, Inter VproC, LiveMocha
</p>
<p>
Online platforms and facilities can enable different levels of communities to emerge
</p>
<p>
Often communities accommodation several aspects – especially organisation-based vs. horizontal typically had others drivers as well.
</p>
<p>
<b>Socialisation<br />
</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Examples – media sharing spaces, blogosphere, online social networks, entertainment</li>
	<li>Motivation (from OCLC, 2008) – young people its fun, older people its useful</li>
	<li>Activities (Pew/Internet 2006; OCLC, 2008) – creative expression, share and document knowledge and experiences, manage connections, resources, life</li>
	<li>Individual’s learning – express and build identity, reflect on one’s life when comparing with others (Park et al. 2008)</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Joint production, goal, task<br />
</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Examples – collaborative joint product development, open soure software development, crowd sourcng for a joint task, collaborative resources repository, social knowledge management systems</li>
	<li>Motivation – usefulness for oneself, external requirement, intrinsic interest</li>
	<li>Activiites – collaborative work according to community work model, create concrete products as outputs of work</li>
	<li>Individual learning – learn to work with others, negotiate, collaborate, observe the practices of others, learn from it</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Joint interest, situation expertise<br />
</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Examples – tool-based knowledge sharing, profession based communities, topic based support, personal health, well being, communtities for context and culture</li>
	<li>Motivation – connection and sharing with others and similar situations, need for personal support</li>
	<li>Activities – asking and giving advice, reading and following</li>
	<li>Individual learning – receiving quick and targeted personal guidance when needed, finding and participating in knowledge development for the area</li>
</ol>
<p>
<br />
<b>Organisation based<br />
</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Examples – community model within courses, integrating institutional environment with other resources, lifelong communities set up at institutions, informal workplace communities</li>
	<li>Motivation – requirement, usefulness, avoiding isolation feeling supported</li>
	<li>Activities – striving towards given goals, sharing resources, informal advice and support</li>
	<li>Learning – learn workplace culture to be part of a team, find and create ways for carrying out tasks, change the practices of the organisation</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Conclusion<br />
</b>Online spaces are increasing their importance in people’s lives<br />
Not all online spaces are communities, but they still can support learning
</p>
<p>
Through online communities people can find out, follow and participate much more than was possible before
</p>
<p>
Approaching communities through the member motivations and supported activities (production, topic, socialisation) could help in finding and developing online places and communities for learning
</p>
<p>
Communities within organisations vs horizontal communities can both have specific important features
</p>
<p>
What should and could be the goals and means in educational institutions
</p>
<ol>
	<li>To develop internal communities (learners, teachers)?</li>
	<li>To develop participation in external online spaces and communities?</li>
	<li>To develop horizontal communities?</li>
	<li>To differentiate between communities/online spaces they support?</li>
</ol>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
A website for this <a href="http://ipts.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">IPTS</a> review is available <a href="http://is.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pages/EAP/LearnCo.html">here</a> with the draft report and an overview presentation on the work to date. 
</p>
<p>
The aim of this study is to review and assess the new social and pedagogical approaches to learning that are emerging in new ICT-facilitated learning communities.  In addition to formal education, such communities are increasingly emerging in informal and non-formal lifelong learning environments where learning is happening in a freely organised manner, bring together learners, experts, and other parties.  This study aims to examine these new learning communities in order to find innovative pedagogical and organisational practices that support lifelong learning in different settings and foster innovations in the interaction of teachers, learners and organisations. <br />
<br />
Description: Through desk research, in-depth case studies and expert workshops, the study aims to:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provide an overview and understanding of new learning communities that are characterised as socially and pedagogically innovative and identify what is the innovative dimension;</li>
	<li>Provide an overview and analysis of novel learning and teaching approaches and strategies based on active learning approaches in the communities (such as creative problem solving, discovery, learning by doing, experiential learning, critical thinking and creativity);</li>
	<li>Investigate the specific role and contribution of ICT in developing and enabling new collaboration models bridging various learning settings (formal, non-formal and informal);</li>
	<li>Analyse the relationship between ICT, learning and innovation in view of organisational changes in the delivery of learning;</li>
	<li>Propose avenues for further research and policy-making.</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The short course design challenge&hellip; are you up to it???</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br /> Curriculum design has never being more challenging or potentially exciting:<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;New technologies offer a seemingly endless range of possibilities in terms of use of engaging digital media to support core course material to exciting and authentic communicative and collaborative opportunities<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Modern students are more and more diverse with higher expectations of courses and more diverse needs from formal, work-related possibilities through to learning for informal, personal reasons<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Employers are increasingly demanding evidence of students having developed a diverse range of social skills and competences to meet the challenges of the modern workplace<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is now a range of educational models that can be applied to help foster different pedagogical approaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one-day workshop has been developed to introduce course teams to  using a learning design approach. The example below (originally used at  Brunel University in 2009) uses the OULDI learning tools and activities  but we have successfully tried slotting in tools and activities from  other projects (especially the Viewpoints project) and the format holds  well. For a list of other activities and tools you could use try the  learning design toolbox. These and other examples of the template in use:</p>

<h2>The Challenge...</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Design  Challenge&rsquo; is intended to be an intense  but fun means of illustrating a  range of resources, tools and ways of  thinking about course design.  Participants are introduced to a range of  tools and techniques by means  of access to advisors who will help them  along the process. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the afternoon each team  presents their ideas. A  panel evaluates their work and select the  strongest designs. The  session concludes with a reflection on the  usefulness of the event and  on which of the ideas, resources and tools  participants might wish to  pursue further. <br /> <br /> Although designed  as a fun activity, the event gives an awareness of  the latest in  thinking innovatively about curriculum design and is  designed to be  proactive rather than being composed around an  uncontextualised set of  one-to-many presentations. The time-limited  challenge enables  participants to make a preliminary assessment of  which of the ideas,  tools and resources are useful and gives them some  feel for what might  be possible in a longer, term real course  production process. Hopefully  the challenge will open avenues for  participants to pursue this further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>Paper  and pens (hard copies of tools if appropriate - A3 best)</p>
<p>'Stalls'  facilitators</p>
<p>Two laptops per team (can also bring their own  but should be networked)</p>
<p>So that your teams can export the CompendiumLD maps and save any    other work done on workshop laptops, please ensure that they bring at    least one USB memory key with them per team.</p>

              <title>Integrating Student experience into learning - APEL</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/729</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
We are currently in the process of developing 'supported APEL' routes for our new 60 point courses. These are in fact shortened versions of the 'parent' course with some tutor support, teaching materials and formative assessment. However, we now wonder if there are other more appropriate and efficient ways of recognising prior experience - so that we connect with students' individual needs and make sure that they enter programmes at the best possible place. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
For example we might have a 'starter' assessment course which acts as a diagnostic to suggest where within the rest of the award students might start. This may also mean that courses (modules?) need to be offered in smaller chunks - say 10 or 15 points. This could still be within a 60 point framework if we wished.

Use this cloud to discuss ideas for helping students to develop their information literacy skills: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Level 1: find, select and use information in defined contexts.</li>
	<li>Level 2: find, critically evaluate and use information in a range of contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The FELS Library team will write activities using different approaches to help students' skills progression from Level 1 to Level 2: eg 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>using a familiar source, help students to 'Get more out of Google' with tips on constructing a successful search. (K115)</li>
	<li>using a newspaper database, find a specific article; search by topic for a second article and evaluate the content of both. (SDK125)</li>
	<li>using an e-journals database, follow illustrated guide to plan and carry out a search, view and download results. (E112)</li>
	<li>using a dual-pane frame with the step-by-step activity in the left pane and live view of a database on the right hand side, carry out a search to find a specific journal article or material on a topic. (D170)</li>
	<li>following links and instructions, find and review an article, and then follow link to feedback.(B201).</li>
	<li>using a quizz, test skillls in constructing a search, referencing and evaluating resources (K216)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Three parts</strong>:

<ul>
	<li>Context of e-learning at Sydney</li>
	<li>Cycles of design</li>
	<li>Barriers to teaching as design</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Overarching questions<br />
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Will universities ever be configured to use this stuff – ie tools and design ideas?</li>
	<li>Particularly in a campus based and research intensive university?</li>
	<li>Idea of researcher as teacher – what are the markers of professional identity</li>
	<li>Go write a paper, teach what you research, NOT design what you teach</li>
	<li>Size is an issue – Sydney is a large institution</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
<strong>Cycles of design in relation to ICTs</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Avoidance ca. 40% - too busy, not relevant, no money, no support</li>
	<li>Toe in the water ca. 40% little above information based and minor changes</li>
	<li>Committed approaches to integrated designs</li>
	<li>Barrier to greater uptake are complex</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
<strong>Barriers to growth</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Markers of a legitimate professional identity of teacher/designers (with ICTs) – workload recognition for design, budgets for online tutoring, teaching category of online tutoring,</li>
	<li>Shared design language – linking shared deign language to use of tools for even the technophobic or just slight irritated</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
<strong>How do we overcome the barriers?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Better tools?</li>
	<li>Executive buy-in?</li>
	<li>Faculty demand?</li>
	<li>Student demand?</li>
	<li>Transparent design language?<br />
	</li>
</ul>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/629</link>

<strong>Views from learning and teaching in HE  – some reflections from those with particular expertise in managing and evaluating strategies</strong> <strong>for the enhancement of learning and teaching in HE</strong><br />
<br />
1.    Some questions – apply theoretical perspective to very concrete applications<br />
2.    Teaching as design and changing nature of HE context<br />
3.    Personal change strategies and identities – how and why people might change their practices<br />
<br />
Comment by Peter Goodyear – we need an ethnographic awareness of teachers’ context, its about social context and current social practices and where innovations are introduced and understand how they impact on practice. Constellations, orders of meaning, identity, power relationships
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Questions – developing an anthropological lens<br />
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>How do the new practices relate to current social practices?</li>
	<li>What practices are we expecting people to engage in and how do they relate?</li>
	<li>What codes of signification are evoked by what is being offered?</li>
	<li>What discourse are we using and what are teachers using?</li>
	<li>Power relations – what does it do for teacher autonomy, professionalism etc?</li>
	<li>What are teachers tacit theories?</li>
	<li>Can you leave room for ‘domestification’ – shaping to current practice, domesticating a new technology?</li>
	<li>Who are the users and where are the cultural boundaries?</li>
	<li>Where is the profitability for users and more importantly how can you show them the benefits?</li>
	<li>What is a reasonable vision for the tools we are developing in terms of scaling up – do you want everyone to use it?</li>
	<li>What are our theories for change?</li>
	<li>Discourses of the field give a number of metaphors</li>
	<li>Gift metaphor – offering – need and want</li>
	<li>Marketing metaphor – the product</li>
	<li>Requiring metaphor, co-creating – this is our tool, driver of compliance and sharing</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
Impetus for a more purposive approach to the construction of learning moments, its time has come. Chronic factors are how to create interesting, challenging learning environment for learners, this has been a problem for a long time, coupled with a policy drive and transparency/accountability. <br />
<br />
<strong>Three axes of consideration thinking about teaching and teachers as designers</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>1st axes – policy and professional context. In the UK there is a performative impetrative in HE, foregrounding of it as a set of public practices, teachers are having to talk about what they do and why they do it, students are having to pay for HE process, governments are questioning how much money should be distributed to HE. There is a transparency and accountability thrust. The panoptic – being watched, fears of deskilling, being watched etc – i.e. there are negative imperatives about this as well in terms of teacher perspective.</li>
	<li>2nd axes – the basis on which colleagues in HE might be prepared to change. Drawn from empirical data from evaluation studies around various EU projects. Teachers have embedded theories about change and on what basis they would change. What kind of zeitgeist or frame of mind do teachers need to be in to take this change on board?</li>
	<li>3rd axes – engagement strategies. On what basis would teachers be prepared to take these new opportunities on board. Palette EU project http://palette.ercim.org/ – set of different CoP applying a participatory design methodology (PDM). People found it hard to understand what PDM was, even though they signed up to the rhetoric. Continuum – developers, teachers and learners (and other boundary brokers between these). Notion was that they would be co-constructors of design solutions. At the other end of the spectrum was the one-dimensional notion of a client and developer, little discourse between them. PDM is a really powerful and important approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Personal change theories</strong><br />
This is reflected in the personal change theories Saunders et al have developed. First is a practice-based exemplar. People catch an interesting idea/embodiment and will begin to apply this. The problem is that is a weak theory of change as we don’t know who will take this up and when. There is no theory of engagement. More about them catching it by osmosis. Notion of a demonstrator, a pilot etc. Second is idea of resource dependency. Is strongest way to enact change is attached funding to it. Invite bids against a change programme. Quite a good theory. Third one is the idea of rhetorical support. Need a strong vision statement at a senior level to make it happen. Fourth one, which is one of strongest theories of change. Professional imperative. Looking for interesting and high quality teaching solutions for your learners, which is core to what professional teaching practice should be about. Fifth – to do with technological determinism. Three possible theories. 1. Global marketing – an institution has to engage with new technologies from a competitive perspective and also using the technologies to market their course as well. 2. Students expect the new technologies to be used. Push from student expectation. 3. Affordances of the technologies – what the technologies actually offer. Change in embedded in the technologies. The environment is transformed by them. <br />

(Dewey social experiences)<br />
<br />
Learning/social remembering in a sociocultural and pragmatist perspectives<br />
1. How individuals, organisations and society at large retain information, knowledge and skills, transform them and make them available to new generations<br />
2. The issue of how people come to share the experiences of their society the funded capital of socialisation (Dewey) through various forms of communication and social activities<br />
<br />
Evolutionary ladder of technologies <br />
1.    ABC, ruin stones, other technologies that new generations<br />
<br />
A key process in the development and expansion of human knowing and sharing of experiences is externalisation through the design of cultural tools <br />
<br />
Experiences converted into linguistic/discursive tools (such as concept, categorising practice, narratives, social languages) and material artefacts (technologies)<br />
<br />
The technology provides new forms of access to cultural knowledge, we master technologies as part of social practices without needed to know the details of the technologies themselves, transparency of the technologies give us access to very complex social practices<br />
<br />
External symbolic storages (ESS) – books, libraries, maps and charts, registers, clocks, databases, instruments - embodied practices<br />
Artificial memory systems (AMS)<br />
<br />
Cultural (or re-presentational) tools – inscriptions and processes of reification/fixation of meaning<br />
Externalisation or objectification of<br />
information (texts, spoken narratives, etc), <br />
also seeing now with technologies – externalisation of human thought processes (expansion of social memory through the technologies) <br />
<br />
<strong>Externalisation of cognitive functions</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Computer software – spell and grammar check, statistical analysis packages, etc</li>
	<li>Search engines</li>
	<li>Book keeping programmes</li>
	<li>Graphical and symbol manipulating calculators</li>
	<li>Navigators</li>
	<li>Face recognition devices</li>
	<li>Medical imaging technologies </li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
Technologies come in as cultural and cognitive amplifiers and as access points to cultural knowing<br />
<br />
<strong>Transformations of learning</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>We master complex tasks without understanding the sequential steps</li>
	<li>Technologies function as a black box (trust)</li>
	<li>We increasingly learne from the complex to the elementary</li>
	<li>We understand as part of practices we do not necessarily understand as part of the hierarchically organised knowledge such as the disciplines</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
Interpretatins of learning in a digital age<br />
Metacommunicative and meta cognitive skills (modelling)<br />
Learing becomes increasingly conceptual and procedural but in coordination with material cultural tools<br />
Learning is the ability to transform and recontextualise in manners that are relevant for local needs ie learning is in the performative

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
<a href="http://education.arts.unsw.edu.au/staff/staff.php?last=sweller">John Sweller </a>talking about the evolution of human cognition and its implication for instruction.
</p>
<p>
A lot of what is known in human cognition architecture (HCA) domain is not getting picked up in the instructional design field. <br />
<br />
Categories of knowledge – D. Geary (2007) Educating the evolved mind – conceptual foundations for an evolutionary educational psychology in J.S, Carlson and J.R. Levin Eds) psychological perspectives on contemporary educational issues, Greenwich, CT: Information Age Publishing. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Two types of knowledge<br />
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong></strong>Biologically primary knowledge (BPK) – evolved to acquire over a long time, we can do it easily, rapidly – such as learning a first language, same is true of learning to listen, recognising faces, general problem solving analysis. We evolve to acquire these sort of skills</li>
	<li>Biologically secondary knowledge (BSK)– knowledge that has become culturally important in last 5,000 years or so, we acquire it differently, not easily or automatically or unconsciously, has different characteristics. Educational institutions were invented because of BSK. Reading and writing are obvious example of this. Knowledge needs to be taught explicitly, directly and takes an effort to acquire this form of knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
What aspects of HCA apply to BSK?<br />
<br />
Sweller, J. and Sweller, S. (2006) Natural information processing systems, Evolutionary Psychology 4, 434-458<br />
<br />
Biological evolution is an information processes system – creates information, transmits it across time and remembers it. The processes we use can be mapped to surprising accuracy to the processes used by Darwinian evolution.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Five principles<br />
</strong>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Information store principle: In evolutionary terms, DNA sequences hold masses of information and are central in terms of evolution, the equivalent in HCA is long term memory (LTM)– massive amount of information is stored in LTM, everything we do depends on that huge amount of information held. Chess player master can recognise huge chess moves and configurations. We are our LTM, cognitively at least. If nothing changes in LTM nothing has been learned.</li>
	<li>Borrowing and reorganising principle. Asexual reproduction produces an exact copy, sexual reproduction is the opposite. Cognitive equivalent? Imitating what others do, listening to others, we borrow information from other peoples’ long term stores. Writing can transmit information over a long period of time. Information is reorganised when we take it in. Not an exact copying process. We obtain most of our information from other people. But that information has to be created in the first place. How is it created?</li>
	<li>Randomness as genesis principle. In biological systems – the ultimate base for all biological variation is random mutation. What is the equivalent? How can random generation test give sophisticated complex structures. Firstly its not totally random, we use knowledge to reduce the number of options. Use knowledge as much as possible but at some point if it’s a real problem you cant go any further? The only possibility is to randomly generate a move and test it for effectiveness. If it doesn’t work, try an alternative. We have no choice but to engage in random generation. This has instructional implications.</li>
	<li>Narrow limits of change principle. If we are randomly generate moves, need some mechanism to stop computational explosion. Working memory is extremely limiting in terms of capacity, limited in terms of time span. This only applies to novel information – this also has implications for instructional design. Cognitive load theory – limitations of working memory are central to this theory. Need to take account of this in the design process. Often too much instruction design proceeds as if we don’t have working memory.</li>
	<li>Environmental organising and linking principle. The whole purpose of the system comes down to this. If working memory is dealing with familiar info from long term memory the limitations disappear, its only limited in terms of novel information. Which comes back to information story principle 1, aim is to get information into LTM, that leads to change, to learning. The purpose of instruction is to get material via working memory (which is limited when dealing with novel info) and then get into LTM and then we can do things we couldn’t do before. Changes us, who we are and what we can do. How should information be presented in spoken form, written, diagrams, etc.</li>
</ol>

Peter talked about design aspects related to their course. 
</p>
<p>
Aim was to engage students with concepts and methods from the learning sciences and educational technology research:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>In a blended setting</li>
	<li>Collaborative activities</li>
	<li>Design and research practice</li>
	<li>Using typical representations and tools</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<em>General design decisions</em><br />
1. Scripted collaboration and seeding/feedback
</p>
<p>
2. Using wiki engine + web conferencing – leading to participation and contribution, (Text) quality, group process<br />
<br />
Trac wiki (from open software community – used as a means of managing their own work)– two levels: Planning level (milestones and tickets (tasks)) and task level<br />
<br />
Peter illustrate an interesting range of visual representations they have been using
</p>
<p>
to represent the dynamics of the course. These included: social network analysis and line representations illustrating individual contributions to the wiki over time. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
Use the visualisations to feed back to the teams and also used by tutors to identify problems with the teams<br />
Text contribution features – Glosser (text mining tool)<br />
Process visualisation and decision making <br />
Knowledge maps<br />
Trajectories of learning opportunities over a term <br />
<br />
<em>(Complex) tasks</em>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identify creative ideas and insights in chats and wikis</li>
	<li>Analyse video recordings of technology rich learning and collaborative episodes</li>
	<li>Write collaborative research reports</li>
	<li>Create and compare knowledge maps</li>
	<li>Create and compare topic maps and ontologies</li>
	<li>Extent/augment system dynamic models</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
<em>Theoretical basis</em>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Knowledge building theory Bereiter and Scardamilia</li>
	<li>Gerhard Fischer’s work on designing software tools for end users to change</li>
	<li>McGrath group psychology <br />
	</li>
</ul>

              <title>Workshop formats: World cafe</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/599</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/599</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Not an original notion - but an interesting one. The World cafe concept has been around a while www.theworldcafe.com.</p>
<p>We use this technique often in our workshops (dial-e.net), and at a recent event UTS (University of Technology Sydney) it attracted some interesting comments - so perhaps worth a reminder.</p>
<p>You've done some input, you have some group tasks defined and the groups are all working away. Then there is the dreaded plenary, you've allowed 5 minutes for each group to feedback on their deliberations - but the second group goes on for ages and by the time you get to the sixth round of feedback people feel they have nothing to add.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this workshop model (there are lots of variations) 7 groups of 4 each worked away on the task we had assigned them for 15 minutes, supported by a single sheet of A4 on which to record their comments (having white paper tablecloths and lots of pens works even better). Instead of asking for feedback, each group nominates one person to stay seated at their table and all the other people must get up and move to a new table - with each person from the group joining a new table with none of the original members. (this is a good thing to do after lunch!). Once everyone is settled back into a new grouping, the 'resident' person explains that groups comments and accepts observations from the other groups represented (in this case 3). The actual representation is less important, the intention is to have feedback shared widely and talked about. Participants then return to their original groups and spend some time feeding back on what they have heard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a practical level it makes the facilitators time control task easier, and for participants it makes for a more engaging feedback process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The variations are part of the fun, but it can work well with 16 or 160 !</p>
<p>Been thinking about this given Diana Laurillard's suggestion that the workshop was possibly a suitable foci for the majority of dimensions in the conversational framework.</p>

              <title>Method: A schema for mapping tools and activities to dimensions of learning</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/423</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/423</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Conole et al. (2004) have developed a pedagogical framework that abstracts out three main dimensions of learning. The 3 dimensions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual &ndash; social: i.e. any learning activity can be located somewhere along a spectrum from being an individual, isolated experience to being essentially social in nature</li>
<li>Active &ndash; passive: i.e. some learning activities involve active engagement, whereas other aspects of learning may occur through some degree of passive immersion</li>
<li>Information &ndash; experience: learning activities vary in the degree to which they are information or experience based.</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework can be used as a basis for mapping out the use of different tools. The dimensional basis of the framework means that you can consider the three dimensions as spectral and hence look at tool use along each of these spectral &ndash; i.e. not as a binary decision &ndash; so use of a tool to support an activity does not have to be labeled as simple an individual or a social activity it can lie somewhere along the spectrum of individual-social.</p>
<p>Try to indicate the location of the following &lsquo;tools in use &lsquo;on the three dimensions (or continua) of the framework:</p>
<ul>
<li> A blog as a reflective diary </li>
<li> A blog as a collective resource for collating references within a student group </li>
<li> A web search: i.e. students search the web and collate resources against a given set of criteria </li>
<li> A drill and practice exercise: i.e. students work through a set of resource and then complete a formative self-assessment </li>
<li>A structured online debate: i.e. students choose a side for or against an issue, post their views and read other postings </li>
<li>Use of an e-portfolio: i.e. students gather evidence against learning outcomes in a portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p>A diagram of the framework can be found in Conole (2008), ariadne article, link below.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>You are going to begin by exploring different repositories of resources to find information that might be of relevance to a particular teaching scenario. Start by choosing one of the following scenarios (or outline your own) as the teaching and learning context for you explorations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refresher course for returner nurses, providing skills update and outline of latest changes in legislation, etc. Use an e-portfolio as the main vehicle of students demonstrating evidence </li>
<li>Beginners social work course, large cohort of students, want to encourage lots of communication and ways of students practicing their interpersonal skills </li>
<li>Final year research project in which students need to demonstrate an evidence-based approach </li>
<li>Large cohort introductory statistics course for students in a range of different disciplines</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloudworks is a social networking site for sharing learning and teaching ideas and design. Use the Cloudworks site to help you find useful resources and ideas for your design and suggestions for how you might incorporate different technologies. In terms of specific sites on technologies and how they might be used in an educations context you might want to look in particular at the Educause 7 things you should know about series (see link below). Write down things you like and don&rsquo;t like about the particular resource collection(s) explored. Note the strategies you are using to search in order to locate resources, etc. that are appropriate for your chosen scenario. How useful were the different sites? How useful was the information they provided? What was missing?</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[Go to the CompendiumLD web site, which will provide details of how to download CompendiumLD and get starting in using the tool. Once it is downloaded click on the CompendiumLD icon and explore the software, you will find there is further help within the software itself, include links to various short video slidecasts. Once you are comfortable in general with the software, you can start on the main focus of the activity that is to map a simple learning activity. Now start to map out this activity in CompendiumLD. Reflect on the following questions. Keep a note of what you like and dislike about using this tool and think about how you might use this (individually or within a team) in your own context of practice. Save your design as a jpg. What do you think are its main strengths and weakness? Can you see yourself using this in the future? If so how?
To what extent this visual representation actually represents the original design intentions, what’s missing? Can you think of other ways in which the design could be represented and shared?
