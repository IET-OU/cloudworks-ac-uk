              <description><![CDATA[<p>Since 1974, disabled students in England have been able to apply for non-repayable grants, known as &lsquo;Disabled Students&rsquo; Allowances (DSAs)&rsquo;, to assist with the additional costs incurred whilst completing higher education study (Willetts, 2014). Such grants provided allowances for specialised equipment, non-medical assistance such as note takers and specialised tutors, books and consumables, as well as travel allowances (Disability Rights UK, 2015). In addition to the support provided by DSAs, the introduction of the Equality Act 2010 placed a legal duty on businesses and education providers to take positive steps, referred to as &lsquo;reasonable adjustments&rsquo;, to remove barriers faced by people, due to their disability (Citizens Advice, n.d.). This includes making changes to the ways things are done e.g. provision, criterion or practice; physical features of buildings such as entrances and exits; as well as the provision of extra aids or services such as: induction hearing loops, providing information in alternative formats etc. (Citizens Advice, n.d.).</p>
<p>Despite the reasonable adjustments implemented by higher education institutions (HEIs), the costs of the DSA provision have risen sharply from &pound;101.3m in 2009-10 to &pound;145.8m in 2012-13, an increase of 44% (Weale, 2015). In 2014, the Minister for Universities and Science announced a series of changes to modernise the existing system to &lsquo;rebalance&rsquo; responsibilities for student support. Thus, ensuring that the limited public funding is available to those most in need, and provides the support they require (Willetts, 2014). The changes are designed to move away from a system of individualised support funded by DSAs, to one where HEIs play a greater role in supporting all students, regardless of whether they have a disability or not.</p>
<p>With these changes coming into force from September 2016, HEIs within England have been required to review and, if required, revise their current student support arrangements to ensure they are prepared for these changes and can support learners effectively (McNaught, 2016). Whilst there are many small and simple changes academic staff can take to improve the accessibility of their teaching such as: providing information ahead of sessions, creating learning materials which meet accessibility guidelines and encouraging students to record teaching sessions etc. (Canterbury Christ Church University, n.d.), this does not resolve the underlying issues. As McNaught (2016) summarises &lsquo;[t]eaching and learning pedagogies, practices and technologies can inadvertently create barriers for students with disabilities&rsquo;, to overcome these a different approach is required.</p>
<p>To address some of the challenges raised by these recent changes and the need for HEIs to make anticipatory, rather than reactive changes, this conference presentation will provide an overview and demonstration of a short online course being developed by the author. Built using the Canvas open education platform, this short course aimed at academics working within UK HEIs, will provide a more in-depth overview of the changes to disabled student support, whilst also introducing delegates to two educational frameworks; Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Inclusive Curriculum. Building on research undertaken by Marquis et al. (2016), this course will utilise a flipped learning pedagogy; whereby the learning materials are placed online and classroom sessions are used to enable deeper exploration and discussion of the topics raised (The Higher Education Academy, n.d.).

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently came across this organisation based in Bedford and discovered they have a truly innoavtive approach to reaching into schools and working effectively with young people, parents, teachers and employers. The numbers of young people using the service is impressive i.e. over 230,000. Much of this engagement is achieved through The Foundation&rsquo;s state-of-the art website, b-live.com, which provides impartial, engaging and high-quality careers IAG (information and guidance).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great&nbsp;to find The b-live Foundation has joined the Institute of Career Guidance and&nbsp; works to a code of ethical practice (sometimes&nbsp;overlooked by social enterprises).</p>
<p>Through the site, young people can access personalised careers and learning information, use a CV generator, apply for jobs and apprenticeships &ndash; all specifically created to help young people make informed career decisions and support their transition from education into employment whatever their background.</p>
<p>The b-live has recently been approached by the Cabinet Office to undertake surveys with young people, parents and teachers over a three-four year period designed to find out more about their views of careers education and guidance and the world of work. They plan to launch a new research facility very shortly that will help illuminate the realities of indivduals' views and experiences of 21st century education and employment.</p>
<p>This an exciting initiative which clearly bridges the gap between&nbsp;education and employer opportunities. Each time I ask a question about the work of this organsiation, I learn more and more - &nbsp;it's very clear that listening to YOUNG PEOPLE&nbsp; and&nbsp;CONNECTING THEM TO THE WORLD OF WORK&nbsp;is what really drives this organisation.</p>]]></description>

              <title>HippoCampus and Open Educational Resources</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/918</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/918</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[Generally, there are two targets for OERs- one for students, and one for teachers.<br />
HippoCampus focuses on high school and community college.<br />
<br />
There are basic necessities for an OER- it must be curricular, complete, of a high quality, easy to use, and a teaching tool.<br />
<br />
Essentially, it must be as simple and effective as opening a text book.<br />
<br />
NROC is unique in that it fuses content for high school and higher education; it has complete foundations for entire courses, and can be made flexible to the needs of the teacher.<br />
<br />
Quality is of a very high concern- expectations are high for both students and teachers using this content.<br />
<br />
When introduced to the state of Oregon, the content was met with widespread acceptance.<br />
<br />
Flexibility can be brought to the teacher, district, or state- this makes the high quality content easier to use, no matter what the needs may be.<br />
<br />
One of the first steps in integrating content with the repository is completeness of the curriculum- no holes left for teachers to fill in themselves.<br />
<br />
This will phase out the need for textbooks, such as was done for history courses in Oregon.<br />
<br />
Overall, there has been great success with both students and teachers alike.<br />
<br />
 Unfortunately, the biggest hurtle is sustainability- how can content that is given away for free continue to be updated?<br />
<br />
 The answer is administrators, teachers, and users coming together to support the OER.<br />
<br />
The variety of ways to customize and utilize HippoCampus include customized sites and accessibility options (such as from an iPod).<br />
<br />
The pacing can also be tailored for the needs of anyone- mildly autistic, ADHD, or students who simply need more time with the content.<br />
<br />
This content can be adapted for pencil and paper use- exercises are embedded in the content itself, and parts can be utilized in presentations as the teacher sees fit.<br />
<br />
OER success is measured by usage, so the ultimate goal is expanding the amount of usage.<br />
<br />
<br />
