              <description><![CDATA[<p>LUCERO (Linking University Content for Education and Research Online &mdash; <a href="http://lucero-project.info/">lucero-project.info</a>) is a collaboration between KMi, the OU Library and the Faculty of Arts, working in partnership with many other parts of the OU in order to apply linked data technologies and principles to public information from the OU. Linked data relates to the principles and technologies to make data which might usually sit in dedicated repositories accessible and linkable on the Web. The aim of LUCERO is therefore to build, sustain and exploit a linked data platform exposing linked data from OU's repositories and research projects: <a href="http://data.open.ac.uk/">data.open.ac.uk</a></p>
<p>In this presentation, we will introduce the technical and organisational challenges related to setting up such a platform and populating it with data from a large variety of sources (Study at the OU, ORO, OpenLearn, Podcasts, databases from research projects, etc.) More importantly, we will discuss the benefits brought by the use of linked data in this context, both internally through better access to inter-connected information, and externally, through making our data reusable by others and better connected to others. We will in particular detail some of the applications that are being developed to support OU students and researchers with their use of public data.</p>
<p><strong>Presenters</strong>: Owen Stephens (Library) and Dr Mathieu D'Aquin (KMi).</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a panel session on <a title="LinkedData.org" href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Data</a> which sounds good (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data">on Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>I'll be live blogging...</p>
<p>Linked Data panel, 11:00 16 February 2011.<br /><br />Panel, left-to-right:<br />* Alex ?, OpenStreetMaps, OpenOxford.<br />* ? works with Alex.<br />* ?<br />* ?<br />* Steve Owen, Lucero Project, OU.<br />* Ton Hirst.<br />* Adrian ? Lincoln university - we aren't doing linked data, but we are doing lots of JSON, ...<br />* ?<br /><br />--<br />'Open' - if there is no open license, then people can't build a business plan around your data - too risky<br /><br />Use 'data' specific license - or Public Domain.<br />* Don't use a Creative Commons License.<br />* Except CCZero / ...<br /><br />Open Knowledge Foundation<br />* Maximum of Attribution-ShareAlike.<br />* Can't say 'NonCommercial'<br /><br />Universities - 2 types of data:<br />1. Products of research (products of teaching?)...<br />2. Infrastructure - where my buildings are, where to get coffee...<br /><br />Attribution can be difficult, messy espec. for mashups...<br />* So, PublicDomain + an attribution norm. - so make a requirement for every data-item in a mashup.<br />* An about page for your mashup application.<br /><br />Suggestion - analytics is the point - how is my research data used?<br />* Tony - referer from an about page.<br />* Pingback, as in blogs...<br /><br />The 5 stars - of linked open data:<br />* 1 star - Put it on the web, any way.<br />* 2 stars- Machine-readable, but not proprietary format.<br />* 3 stars- In an open-format - CSV, JSON...<br />* 4 stars- Assign unique addresses to everything - URLs.<br />* 5 stars- Joining up the data.<br />-- Open is more important than linked.<br /><br />So, Alex - Open/Mobile Oxford- OpenStreetMap - 4 stars.<br /><br />** Conclusion - Cloudworks/ CloudEngine API needs an open-license.</p>
<p>An example - Cap Gemini - linked but not open. Apparently, Cap Gemini produce and consume linked data internally each day as part of their business processes. However, it is private, and so not open.</p>
