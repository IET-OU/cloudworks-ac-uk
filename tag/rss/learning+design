<p>Tricky Topics is a practice-based application of the threshold concept theories identified by Meyer and Land (2003). This lightning talk provides a quick update on the Tricky Topic approach's current applications; from its use in designing and evaluating teaching interventions and innovative technologies to its use in learning design. In particular the three-staged process to identify, capture and assess difficult knowledge is detailed, with links to the website and a Badged Open Course co-authored with Oxford University.</p>

              <title>Are you driving blindfolded? A longitudinal mediation analysis of learning design, student behavior, and retention</title>

<p>In the past five years, the field of learning analytics has seen a growing body of literature in developing predictive models from students' log files data. While the accuracy of these models are constantly improved with advanced statistical techniques, the ability to derive interventions from the findings has been rather limited due to the lack of pedagogical contexts. Thus, there is an increasing interest to align Learning Analytics with Learning Design, as the former facilitates the transfer of tacit educational practice to an explicit rendition, while the latter provides educators with pedagogical context for interpreting and translating LA findings to direct interventions. Previous empirical evidence has confirmed a strong association between the way teachers design the course, pass rates, and student behaviors. However, little attention has been paid to the chain effect: learning design-student behavior-retention. Therefore, this paper investigates how student behaviours on Virtual Learning Environment mediate how learning design affect dropouts rate in 55 modules and their 45K students.</p>

              <title>Understanding distance learners’ academic and social adjustments: evidence of best practice from a South African context</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10482</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Firdevs Melis Cin, Ashley Gunter, Dianne Long, Clare Madge, <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/jm37279.html" target="_blank">Jenna Mittelmeier</a>, Paul Prinsloo, Parvati Raghuram, <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/kjr77.html" target="_blank">Katharine Reedy</a>, <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/bcr58.html" target="_blank">Bart Rienties</a> and <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/jr23979.html" target="_blank">Jekaterina Rogaten</a></p>
<p>The proportion of students studying in international distance education programmes has risen dramatically in the last decade, particularly in developing countries (UNESCO, 2012). One such example is South Africa, which has become a regional hub for international students with over one-third studying distantly. Previous research demonstrates that distance students show low degree attainment (Prinsloo et al, 2015) and learning design affects their retention and satisfaction (Rienties and Toetenel, 2016). However, relatively little is known about international distance learners&rsquo; educational transitions, including academic and social integrations. Although there is a wide body of literature on international student adjustment and integration, this research often makes the assumption that students are physically located at the host institution, and there is a scarcity of research on distance education experiences. <br /> <br />The International Distance Education with African Students (IDEAS) project aims to address these gaps in knowledge through a research collaboration between the Open University and the University of South Africa. The project explores international distance student experiences across Africa, including their educational transitions through higher education and the role of learning design in academic and social inclusion. At the CALRG 2017 conference, we will present the initial findings from a cross-cultural comparison of learning analytics data from domestic and international distance students at UNISA. We will also describe the academic and social adjustment patterns of 500 international distance students across Africa.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Tracey Adams’s design narrative: Advanced clinical assessment protocol workshop</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10351</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10351</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>I was asked to assist a group of senior clinicians in discussing a complex clinical assessment protocol for their country.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>The proposed learning event was a one day workshop. I hadn&rsquo;t met the clinicians before or visited their country so had limited knowledge of the key personalities involved and the healthcare provision available.&nbsp; I was not given information about the room, the number of people attending but I was assured that they were &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; and needed a critical &rdquo;deep dive&rdquo; of information rather than introductory basic lectures.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The key actors were my colleague, the Country manager (who invited me) and the team manager of the clinicians. In addition there were clinicians from independent clinics attending (that is to say there were a mix of internal and external staff present). </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>From the information I received I was under the impression that the clinicians had a belief that there was a protocol available, that they should be following it to be able to better advise potential patients, to get better value for money by improving patient selection and a desire to provide the best possible care for their patients. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>According to my research there is no published standard protocol available globally however the group assembled feel that a protocol should be provided. </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>In my experience of this clinical assessment in different countries and from published literature, the clinical assessment protocols vary depending on the age of the subject, the equipment available, the experience and the needs of the clinician (what they are trying to show to whom). </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The task I was trying to achieve was to bring together ideas in the room concerning appropriate basic test criteria to ascertain whether a subject is a candidate for a particular clinical treatment. In order for the outcome to be successful the discussion needed to be owned by the clinicians attending the event and not imposed by me or managers present.&nbsp; To get to that conclusion they must first decide who they are testing, why and what they need to know (for the patient, for them, for funders, for research).</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The measure of success for me would be if we could produce a list of tests that the majority of clinicians present thought were required, appropriate and achievable given the standards of care and equipment available in their clinics.</em></p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>My first task were practical &ndash; finding out about the level of knowledge in the room, the background of the situation and how they had tried to resolve it in the past.&nbsp; I also needed to ensure that simultaneous translation would be available to enable discussion.&nbsp; I imagined that discussion could be stilted by translation and needed to take account of this in the design plan. </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Next I carried out background research on the clinical condition and papers published that showed test protocols. I looked for a Cochrane review of outcomes.&nbsp; I summarised these findings in a brief introduction lecture and used one of the key evidence papers to show typical test methods.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>A discussion workshop was then planned around discussing this paper and the tests used. The plan was to come up with a gold standard of test protocol and a second more practical one. I expected the discussion to be amongst small groups with the groups summarising and leading to a joint plan. Having not met the clinicians or worked in the country before it was difficult to judge whether large group discussion would be inhibit discussion as it does in some cultures.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Due to the level of the English that the local responsible manager had it was difficult to get clear ideas about the clinicians or how the workshop would run.&nbsp; The organisation was not clear, the timings variable and the set up unknown. This was frustrating but is not unusual. As a result I needed to be prepared to adapt the workshop to suit the needs of the audience as the day progressed.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The workshop was planned with timed goals along the way and submitted to the manager responsible for the region.&nbsp; In order to legitimise the discussion I asked for the clinicians to submit case studies that we could discuss.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>I had not considered the set-up of the room layout. It was too small for breakouts. The teacher at the front and the introductory lecture could have led the attendees to feel that the invited expert will tell us, I should have considered what the layout of the room would infer to the learner or as Michael Wesch puts it: &ldquo;what does our classroom say?&rdquo;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Small discussions were not possible because of the layout and because unless the speaker held the microphone I could not understand (through translation).&nbsp; This stilted the conversation flow and led to a more formal turn taking that I had envisioned.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>This made the introduction extremely important; I needed to encourage discussion from the start, to set the expectation that they would be co-collaborators rather than pupils. Fortunately the group were happy to share their opinions (many were extremely vocal) and this made the large group format successful. It could have failed if this had not been the case. </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Case studies were not submitted but they did bring them on the day. I did not get to review them and had to look at them without preparation. This format was not unsuccessful, although stressful for me, as we looked them as a group in relation to our proposed protocol and made adjustments, suggestions and comments as a group.&nbsp; In hind sight this flowed very nicely and was in the main accepted (that I wasn&rsquo;t going to give an answer, only my opinion along with everyone else) and once the group got into this it worked much better than I expected.&nbsp; It could have failed if none of the group offered ideas or asked questions.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Because the discussion was more formal it took less time than originally planned and the local manager asked me to give another presentation, this one on a deep technical dive into the key clinical tools available to adjust the hearing instrument for complex recipients. This was rather off topic and much more in a lecture mode but to keep them engaged I tried to provide clinical patient stories and asked them to give their own experiences for each tool.&nbsp; This was not ideal however and I felt it detracted from the key aims of the day.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Although the aim had been to provoke a discussion that would result in a protocol proposal, an additional outcome was that the group realised that they had all the information they needed and an organised workshop had led them to come up with the protocol. On summing up my main conclusion points were that all the answers were in the room and that they had designed the protocol and could have similar discussions to review it after a period of use.</em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>I should spend more time on finding out about the audience! I know this can reduce my stress levels (as I don&rsquo;t have to adjust agendas and rely on my ability to adapt and the task can be better designed to suit the situation and learner).&nbsp; I feel like I&rsquo;m asking the impossible when I request this type of information so I must not be explaining myself or why I need the information properly.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I did not plan the outcomes well, my aims were very limited. An outcome was that the bones of a good clinical protocol were established but no method agreed to take it forward and flesh it out.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>On reflection I should have spent more time looking at how they could provide this level of interaction (without me there to run a face to face workshop) and move the project forward. I would have liked to introduce the Delphi technique (Hill et al 2012) which involves collaborative agreement on statements and has been successfully used in setting up clinical protocol.&nbsp; I should have also spent more time discussing the technology required to enhance this discussion (Padlet or Google Docs) and making concrete action plans to move the project forward. As a result I have been left with finishing the project, and being separated geographically from the participants it is now hard for me to get their further collaboration.</em></p>

              <title>Emre compares representations: 4Ts vs DPD</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10327</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10327</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>i want to compare the 4Ts model with the DPD model on this example of Healthy eating design for H800. i have chosen these two because i think they present/represent different facets in planning the same activity.</p>
<p>first, the 4Ts:</p>
<ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1490703106708_152" class="oucontent-bulleted">
<li>its &lsquo;readability&rsquo; (i.e. the ease with which you understood the content)</li>
</ul>
<p>it is relatively easy to understand the concept and how to use it. especially looking at the schematic that had been provided, one feels that one can start using this representation right away.</p>
<ul class="oucontent-bulleted">
<li>its expressiveness</li>
</ul>
<p>this representation covers pretty much everything you need to know about the designed activity at the very moment you look at it. all relevant features (the 4Ts) are clearly defined and expressed.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="oucontent-bulleted">
<li>its utility (i.e. their usefulness in communicating important aspects of the design).</li>
</ul>
<p>there is a clear advantage to this representation in regard to its utility, which applies to the designs communicatibility as well as its reproducibility. i can imagine that had we distributed this design schematic to different tutor/student pairings, each and everyone would end up pretty much performing the same activity and achieving very comparable outcomes.</p>
<p>and now the DPD:</p>
<ul id="yui_3_17_2_1_1490703106708_152" class="oucontent-bulleted">
<li>its &lsquo;readability&rsquo; (i.e. the ease with which you understood the content)</li>
</ul>
<p>this representation is fairly easy to understand as well, although, not as much as the 4Ts. we have the table with the 4 principles, which are paired with features in the activity.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="oucontent-bulleted">
<li>its expressiveness</li>
</ul>
<p>this representation foretells the designer what to do and why. this why component was not very strong in the 4Ts representation but assumes a definitive &nbsp;role here. i think this allows for or may be better applicable to backward planning of such events; i.e, you delineate your principles first and decide upon the technologies and features that would correspond to these principles in the second phase. we konw what we want to achieve, it is up to us what we do for it.</p>
<ul class="oucontent-bulleted">
<li>its utility (i.e. their usefulness in communicating important aspects of the design).</li>
</ul>
<p>its utility is very different compared to the 4Ts as well. it communicates the principles to be applied but not necessarily the specific tasks and timing. this makes DPD more useful in understanding why you do an activity but much less useful in understanding how to do it. this may create problems with reproducability. looking at the DPD design table for this particular activity, it is easy to visuailse that it can not translate to the same exact time and task allocations when performed by different teams. This aspect may or may not be a disadvantage, depending on the experience level of the tutors involved in the activity.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Title</h2>
<h2>Design Narrative: To better enable English Language learners to read with an emphasis on reading for gist.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>&nbsp;Student English Language Instructor at a language school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>A language school offering English language lessons, this particular class was made up of young adults of intermediate ability English.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Trying to improve reading skills but particularly to put an emphasis on reading for gist and to help improve reading speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>As a lead in the Students were shown a newspaper and an understanding of the body and headline and sub headline were checked. This was a simple activity which involved student participation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students were then put into pairs and asked to find a story they find interesting. They were given 3 minutes for this task. A check question was used to make sure the students understood the task, and duration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students then had to decide on two questions which were &ldquo;what is it about?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why is it interesting?&rdquo; Understanding of the task was checked using questions such as, &ldquo;Are you going to read every word?&rdquo; Students were given 3 minutes for this task. They were then asked about their stories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students were then given a couple of headlines to look at in their pairs and were asked what the stories could be about. After this Students were given a hand-out with some phrases and they had to decide which headlines they went with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a final activity Students were given some stories and all around the level headlines had been hidden, they had to find the headlines and match them to the stories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The lesson was a successful one and the students really enjoyed it, it was a fast paced lesson, but this led to the weaker students finding it quite difficult to keep pace, which was very noticeable at times. Overall the desired outcomes were achieved.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Andy Brooks: H800 Healthy Eating design representations comparison</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10324</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10324</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The 2 representations I chose are the 4 T's model and Web collage.</p>
<p><strong>Readability</strong></p>
<p>The 4 T's model is very readable and follows a linear path which I like, this makes it very user friendly and it is also very easy to see what at which point at a glance. Web collage could suit somebody who likes to visualise more and it is very flexible and can accomodate more complex information on one single representation.</p>
<p><strong>Expressiveness</strong></p>
<p>Both representations are expressive but the web collage lends itself more to expressionas it has the visual elements and allows the user to incorporate many different aspects in the single representation. This could work very well from the perspective of the healthy eating activity as it is spread over many weeks and the web collage represenntaion allows a complete overview. This is not to say the 4 T's lacks expression, but is a lot more simplistic in design.</p>
<p><strong>Utility</strong></p>
<p>Ease of use is the 4 T's strength as everything for that lesson can be seen at a glance and it is very easy to see what is happening, by whom and with what. The web collage is a lot more involved and less user friendly, but its strengths lay in other areas.</p>
<p>I chose the 2 above as they had good contrasting elements, I did, however, really like the e-design for both its simplicity and also the scaffolding features.</p>

              <title>R.Sharp&#39;s design narrative: Personal study plan</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10316</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10316</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is not a typical design narrative as&nbsp;I'm not a teacher, so the learning activity being modelled is a reflection of the design of a personal learning plan.&nbsp; It is a discussion of my own plans and actions for undertaking distance learning study on the OU MA Online and Distance Education.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Narrator/Situation</strong></p>
<p>Prior to joining the MAODE, I had no distance learning experience.&nbsp; I also had no previous direct experience in the field of study therefore wanted a plan to structure my background reading, and to structure my study, note-taking, and research once the course began.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>The challenge in designing a personal study plan for myself involved consideration of:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to manage and structure my pre-course study preparation &ndash; to gain some background knowledge on which to build.</li>
<li>How to organise and create a useful personal resource from my study activity.</li>
<li>Finding ways to build study into and around my normal and working life &ndash; use of materials and systems.</li>
<li>Gain experience of TEL, new tech, and social tech apps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li value="1"><strong>Choose software for organising notes, research and study materials.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I chose the MS OneNote product.&nbsp; This is cloud-based &ndash; which allows for flexible working at various locations, and also is stable and backed-up.&nbsp; I have developed an organisation and formatting style that allows me to distinguish between course directions, quotes taken from sources, paraphrased text, my own notes and comments.&nbsp; Notes can be organised in a structure: Note-Books &gt; Section-Groups &gt; Sections &gt; Pages etc. and the whole resource is searchable and easily navigable.</p>
<ol>
<li value="2"><strong>Build resource of background reading notes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I read the notes for a few of the modules prior to enrolment and purchased recommended texts and others that I noticed myself that seems interesting.&nbsp; I also use OneNote to record notes on books and articles read outside of direct links to the course work.</p>
<ol>
<li value="3"><strong>Gain experience of TEL related apps, social/network apps</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I became interested in Blogs, Podcasts, and YouTube as information sources.&nbsp; I started a blog for writing practice and as preparation for course elements.&nbsp; I looked at social media apps such as Facebook etc. but cannot find a personal use for them that would justify any allocation of effort at present.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li value="4"><strong>Find tech solutions to learning flexibly</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned I use podcasts on academic writing, and also on subjects relating to the module content.&nbsp; These are excellent to fit flexibly into travel and other times.&nbsp; I also convert videos into audio format for listening to on an audio player (if the content does not suffer from the lack of video).&nbsp; The cloud-based nature of the OneNote tool allows me to work in multiple locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As many TMA/EMA assessments are linked directly to course content the building-up of personalised notes, reflections, and additional content can become the perfect starting-point for getting underway with assessments.&nbsp; In this way I am motivated to fully participate in activities, reading, and deep reflection and development of understanding throughout the module &ndash; in the belief that it will save me time and get me started on assignments as they are begun.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>This plan, the structure and format has worked well for me.&nbsp; I felt as prepared as possible at the start of the course and have subsequently at each point in the module/course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This kind of study, rewording and categorisation helps me to develop understanding and construct meaning from the source topic material.&nbsp; The structuring also helps me to organise my thoughts and the materials, and to create a resource to help me to create assessment pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>This method produces a digital and searchable store of reflections and notes, forming a connected view of the topic.&nbsp; I find this method essential to keep up with the pace of study and my work/study balance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is like a digital enhancement to my memory, knowledge, and understanding of the topic, which is necessary to aid in the completion of TMA/EMAs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do find that the method involves quite a bit of work.&nbsp; For instance by the end of week 4 of my current module, I had created over 28 thousand words of material in OneNote.&nbsp; If I had a background in the topic or worked in the field I might have developed a less onerous&nbsp;plan.&nbsp; However, these activities and the plan as a whole support the learning and assessment outcomes of the module &ndash; which are then evidenced in the production of activity postings and the TMA/EMAs, ... and the notes contribute to that output.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Title</h2>
<h2>Design Narrative: To better enable English Language learners to read with an emphasis on reading for gist.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>&nbsp;Student English Language Instructor at a language school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>A language school offering English language lessons, this particular class was made up of young adults of intermediate ability English.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Trying to improve reading skills but particularly to put an emphasis on reading for gist and to help improve reading speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>As a lead in the Students were shown a newspaper and an understanding of the body and headline and sub headline were checked. This was a simple activity which involved student participation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students were then put into pairs and asked to find a story they find interesting. They were given 3 minutes for this task. A check question was used to make sure the students understood the task, and duration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students then had to decide on two questions which were &ldquo;what is it about?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why is it interesting?&rdquo; Understanding of the task was checked using questions such as, &ldquo;Are you going to read every word?&rdquo; Students were given 3 minutes for this task. They were then asked about their stories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students were then given a couple of headlines to look at in their pairs and were asked what the stories could be about. After this Students were given a hand-out with some phrases and they had to decide which headlines they went with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a final activity Students were given some stories and all around the level headlines had been hidden, they had to find the headlines and match them to the stories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The lesson was a successful one and the students really enjoyed it, it was a fast paced lesson, but this led to the weaker students finding it quite difficult to keep pace, which was very noticeable at times. Overall the desired outcomes were achieved.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>The lesson was a positive experience, the main things to note would be, if I were to do the activity again I would pair the students slightly differently, by making sure the weaker students were paired with a stronger student. It should also be acknowledged that the final activity would not be possible in all settings.</p>]]></description>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I was the teacher of a Year 11 GCSE English Literature class.&nbsp; The class was nominally &lsquo;top set,&rsquo; yet many of the class, particularly the boys, had difficulty in thinking and working independently.&nbsp; Essays they produced on poetry showed understanding of the texts, but little in the way of inference and developed interpretation.&nbsp; Several of the class, however, displayed exceptional insight in their responses. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>The class had six hours of lessons per fortnight, made up of four single hours and one &lsquo;double.&rsquo;&nbsp; The default location was the classroom &ndash; this had a whiteboard and projector by my desk.&nbsp; Pupils had a place at a desk, allocated through a seating plan.&nbsp; To encourage collaboration, pupils were seated around desks in mixed-ability groups of 5 or 6.&nbsp; Desires of the pupils ranged from wanting to work hard to get an A* in their exam, to simply wanting to get through an hour&rsquo;s lesson without having to write too much.&nbsp; In this situation, group work was imbalanced &ndash; even when specific roles were allocated, the more able ended up doing more work.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>I was aiming to improve the quality of students&rsquo; written responses to poetry exam past-papers &ndash; success measured by an improvement in marks awarded for inference, insight, and independent interpretation.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>&nbsp;I looked through the pupils&rsquo; practice-exam responses, attempting to isolate a key difference between those who had scored highly, and those who had not.</li>
</ol><ol start="2">
<li>There were a few factors, such as less sophisticated vocabulary, sentence structures, and punctuation &ndash; but the one which stood out was that those who scored poorly had very short explanations of quotations they had used.</li>
</ol><ol start="3">
<li>I thought about possible actions to address this, ranging from teacher-talk to group-work; but I wanted to come up with a way that would combine the benefits of collaboration with the necessity of pupils thinking and writing for themselves.&nbsp; I decided that I would have students working collectively to produce an exam-style response to poetry; one team would produce one essay, made up of contributions of individuals.&nbsp; As a Star Trek fan, this reminded me of the Borg &lsquo;collective,&rsquo; which led to this lesson being called &lsquo;We are Borg!&rsquo;</li>
</ol><ol start="4">
<li>I decided that one of the reasons group-work had not always been successful was that some of the boys were relying on the girls to do the work.&nbsp; To combat this, I split the class into two teams, boys vs girls, a near-even split.</li>
</ol><ol start="5">
<li>I allocated a poem/exam question to each team.&nbsp; I then sub-divided the teams into smaller groups, each responsible for analysing and explaining one aspect of the poem.&nbsp; Some members of the teams were given the task of overseeing the work of the sub-groups, co-ordinating responses.</li>
</ol><ol start="6">
<li>Pupils responded well to the element of competition, and there was a buzz of enthusiasm in the room.&nbsp; However, it was difficult to co-ordinate everything, as it required pupils to move around a lot to share ideas.</li>
</ol><ol start="7">
<li>After the lesson, I decided to combat this using Google Docs, which would allow real-time collaboration without movement.&nbsp; I set up and shared a document for each team, showing their essay question and an outline.</li>
</ol><ol start="8">
<li>The next lesson was in an ICT suite, with girls on one side and boys on the other.&nbsp; I went through the shared document carefully, reminded pupils of the aspect of the poem they were analysing, and set them off.</li>
</ol><ol start="9">
<li>Two of the girls&rsquo; &lsquo;overseers&rsquo; were absent.&nbsp; This meant that I had to spend more time helping the girls co-ordinate everything at the beginning.&nbsp; This meant that I didn&rsquo;t immediately realise a problem the boys were having: even working in smaller groups on one paragraph, it could be confusing having so many writers working at once.&nbsp; I had to narrow down roles further and reduce the number writing at once.</li>
</ol><ol start="10">
<li>Occasionally, Google Docs would disconnect on a computer, not allowing further editing until it reconnected.&nbsp; This slowed the process down.</li>
</ol><ol start="11">
<li>At the end of the lesson, each team printed out a copy of their collaborative response.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The two finished responses were very good &ndash; each paragraph showed evidence of detailed and developed inferences, and the pupils were proud to have an example of a high-grade essay to which they had contributed.&nbsp; However, although the next set of individual responses was much improved, many pupils had failed to produce a complete answer.&nbsp; They had some very detailed individual paragraphs, at the expense of a complete essay.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>I was most pleased by how much pupils enjoyed the experience &ndash; the most significant result was perhaps not the improvement of inference, but in that everybody in the class had seemed motivated and engaged, working hard.&nbsp; However, I think the scale was too ambitious &ndash; having 15 people working simultaneously on a document was difficult to co-ordinate, and either Google Docs or our network struggled.&nbsp; Moreover, as the task was so different from the &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; activity of writing an individual exam response, the outcome was not as successful as I had anticipated.</p>

              <title>Nathan Casey&#39;s representation comparison</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9852</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9852</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>For this activity, i chose to look at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/-healthy-eating-in-the-design-principles-database">Design Principles Database</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/-healthy-eating-in-an-e-design-template">e-Learning Template</a>.</p>
<p>For both representations, the content was easily understood as both presented the information in a structured, sequential way with clear labels. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For the <em><strong>Design Principles Database</strong></em>, the focus clearly seemed to be on presenting a pedagogically sound argument and rationale for each feature of the 'Healthy Eating' lesson chosen. &nbsp;This was presented in a table: the features of the lesson in one column of a table, with the rationale (via comparison with a feature in the Database) alongside it. &nbsp;This approach helped clearly demonstrate the links between the activities chosen and the underlying rationale, as well as explicitly relating this to wider non-domain specific learning experiences / approaches.&nbsp; However, although the rationale was clear, the overall structure and flow of the lesson, and important features of this (such as interaction type, timings, support and additional resources needed) was not.&nbsp; Even though the aim of this representation was to show how a lesson may be evaluated post-planning, these features, presented in a systematic way detailing the relationships between these, would seem to be an essential part of this.&nbsp; In terms of utility, from a pre-planning perspective, it would seem that a designer would need a clear idea of what they wanted to achieve, and an awareness of appropriate ways of scaffolding and structuring learner activity before utilizing this (<em>when </em>is specific type of activity most appropriate).&nbsp; From a post-planning perspective, this is a very useful evaluative tool, although, again, this would necessitate that the designer was aware of, and had structured, relevant and appropriate activity types at various stages throughout the wider learning activity.</p>
<p>The <em><strong>e-Design Template</strong></em> took a similar approach (and resembled a more traditional type lesson plan) with descriptions of activity type, interaction patterns, timings and assessment types collated together under the main principle headings. &nbsp;This afforded a clear, linear, progressive view of the activities throughout the lesson, as well as the level of difficulty / support and expected level of learner autonomy required at each stage. &nbsp;In comparison to the Design Principles Database, this representation clearly helps provide a framework for the wider design of a lesson / learning event, but on a more granular, activity level, would benefit being used in conjunction with another type of tool / representation (such as the Design Principles Database mentioned).&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, although the general scaffolding principles as defined in the headings gave a good impression of the general types of activity / interaction that would be happening at each stage of the lesson, locating specific detail (such as specific interaction type or timing) was more difficult to locate at a glance due to the way that activities were described/ grouped and the table headings chosen.</p>
<p>For both representations, it was unclear what references were / are made to technology within the learning process, apart from the tools that were used to create / evaluate them.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly either of these representations would have helped the design process as described <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9849">here</a>.&nbsp; Their key value for myself in both cases, albeit slightly differently, is that they afford a common framework of reference and vocabulary that can be used in the design process &ndash; something that was sorely needed as miscommunication caused a lot of frustration (and additional work) in the learning design process I described!</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p><em>I was tutoring a teenager one-on-one at home in English.</em></p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>The physical space was a living room in early evening, with a clear space in the middle that was to be used for this exercise, and a table we usually sat at, with notebooks. Socially, it was the home environment of the student and her father was present, though was not an actor in this narrative. The time was a single hour a week in which I provided some help with English to supplement what she learned in school. Intentionally, it was a short-term low-frequency set of meetings in which a very specific goal needed to be achieved, namely, that grammar, especially using verbs, were clarified enough for this student to pass her exam.</em></p>
<p><em>Key actors were the teenager, in her last class in high school, and me, the English tutor.</em></p>
<p><em>The student believed she needed to practice grammar, but was unclear exactly what or how she needed to practice. In addition, she overestimated her understanding when something was explained well enough for her to see the logic and apply it immediately after, &ldquo;I can do it&rdquo;, but swung around to underestimating what she could do when she applied it several days after the lesson and found herself making mistakes, &ldquo;I'll never be able to do this&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>After observing this, I speculated she had a partial understanding of most subjects, but mostly required practice to gain confidence in the application.</em></p>
<p><em>A belief that I suspect also played a role was that textbook and class were &ldquo;enough&rdquo; and the student would magically start to understand it if she &ldquo;just made more of an effort&rdquo;, which I didn't believe to be a problem, since she was highly motivated and organised in the work she did for the class.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>The task was to practice the application of verb tenses in sentences. Specifically, that the student would be able to distinguish when to use which, since she already seemed to know how to distinguish between the different types.</em></p>
<p><em>In order to motivate her, I decided to break from the usual format (explain and practice sitting down) to include a physical element to the exercise, since I'd just seen Total Physical Response used in class, and how well moving in space helps sometimes.</em></p>
<p><em>My measure of succes would be how well she could judge whether a particular tense was wrong in a sentence, based either on stated purpose or time the sentence was supposed to describe.</em></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>Before this class, I printed each of the nine tenses we were to practice in large letters, each on an A4. At the start of the exercise, I placed them on the floor in this configuration, to mimic the passage of time in one direction:</em></p>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"><colgroup><col width="33*" /> <col width="43*" /> <col width="41*" /> <col width="51*" /> <col width="38*" /> <col width="50*" /> </colgroup>

<p><em>The first round of the game was meant to be a recap of the class the week before, and an introduction to the exercise, where I hopped from one sheet of paper to the other, and she needed to change the verb in the example sentence to the correct tense. We used each sentence several times so she could hear the difference.</em></p>
<p><em>I discovered even this was a challenge for her, she only remembered half the tenses unprompted, so rather than practice this with two sentences, we did so with five. For the unfamiliar tenses, we stopped to discuss how to make them, and their purpose. This did mean we discover questions she had that might have gone unnoticed during a regular explanation. Especially when she had two different questions about the same tense.</em></p>
<p><em>The second round, I would take a sample sentence, and then change it, and she would need to hop to the correct tense. This allowed me to see if she really did recognise all tenses. We discovered she still had trouble distinguishing the past simple from the present perfect. Otherwise, this round was relatively easy.</em></p>
<p><em>In order to check whether she understood everything now, we briefly repeated the first round, with another two sentences. It went more smoothly now, so it was on to the next round.</em></p>
<p><em>The third round served as a warm-up for the final one, where I said a sentence and then stepped on a certain tense, and she had to say if the two matched or not. This was more difficult for her than I believed it to be, especially given she could match sentence to tense when asked to do it on paper. Spoken English was a lot harder to keep in mind than a sentence in a test, which was easily reread. After I needed to repeat the sentence a few times, we found the problem was solved when I spoke more slowly, as if I was dictating rather than speaking.</em></p>
<p><em>The fourth round she needed to say a sentence, and I had to hop to a certain tense, and she had to say if it was correct or not. This was harder again, since she needed to both think of a tense, how to say it and then judge if my actions matched her thoughts. This went as planned, and she expressed more confidence in being able to link tense and sentence, by a sense of what was correct, though it was still basic, and future perfect was still a bit nebulous to her.</em></p>
<p><em>In order to check that she really was alright, she now had to think of a sentence and hop to the tense, and I had to say whether she was correct. We did this for three sentences before we could say with some confidence that she got it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><em>A major outcome I had not expected was that in doing something weird, we were able to overcome her insecurity that she couldn't do it as well as the overestimation that she was fine when something was explained. Emotion, in this case enjoyment overcoming uncertainty and bravado, plays an important role.</em></p>
<p><em>Unexpected was also that she had more questions about the tenses that hadn't come up before, so it was good that the unusual setting allowed them to arise.</em></p>
<p><em>Expected was that with some intense practice, she would gain more confidence in using and recognising the different tenses. After one class, her grasp of them was not yet perfect, but she was quicker in giving answers and using them and telling me with some confidence that I was standing on the wrong piece of paper.</em></p>
<p><em>A later unexpected result was that she did end up failing her oral exam because she wasn't using her tenses correctly. Not because she couldn't, it turned out, but because of L1 interference and nerves. When talking about her vacation (the subject she'd chosen), she put most of her sentences in the present perfect rather than the past simple, because it most closely resembles the Dutch sentence structure. And when she was nervous, &ldquo;I have&rdquo; (pause) was her standard answer, and only after she paused did she think about what else she wanted to say. Making the sentence a present perfect almost automatically, regardless of whether that was correct.</em></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>I think a major insight I gained was the influence of emotion on what language people produce, especially when it comes to grammar. It makes people self-conscious, so it's good to find ways to circumvent that self-consciousness and turn it into an enjoyable exercise that encourages participation. And, I had not at all foreseen that my student understanding tenses in regular classes would be defeated entirely by her nerves in class.</em></p>
<p><em>Another was that this break from 'regular' tutoring was succesful. I've become more confident in using exercises I couldn't in a group or formal education since then.</em></p>
<p><em>The last was that in preparation I need to build in more redundancies into the exercise, that people will usually have more questions and understand less than they seem to at first.</em></p>
<p><em>And a good one was that not all trouble with grammar necessarily arises from not understanding or practicing grammar. A person's first language and emotion are just as important, among other things. It's good to take that into consideration.</em></p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Narrator: I was a solo instructor/tutor in this story.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Situation: I was the tutor for a small group of 'returnee' junior high school students in Japan. 'Returnee' students are ethnically Japanese students who have lived for a substantial amount of time overseas and have been educated in overseas (non-Japanese) schools, but now live in and attend school in Japan. They are referred to as 'returnees' even if they have never lived in Japan before (i.e. were born overseas). There are various linguistic, cultural, social, and personal challenges that these students, their families, their schools, and their communities face. The families of these students were worried that the children may begin to 'lose' the English they had known in America because they were now in a very English-scarce environment. Class-work often involved explicit grammar and writing instruction, and outside reading. In general, it was very tutor-centered.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Task: To create a more student-centered environment, especially one in which students could have more control over the content and direction of their learning. To aid in developing this environment we introduced a program featuring student projects and presentations.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Actions: Students were told about the project and presentation program, and that they would be able to choose their own topics. Example topics were provided and 2 types of presentation modes (powerpoint, poster) were modelled. Students submitted their ideas for projects, and with suggestions from the tutor, determined the topic and mode of presentation. Students worked on the projects and presentation planning generally outside of class-time. Class-time was still used for grammar other types of instruction. Every week, some class-time was set aside to discuss how the projects were coming along, any problems or updates, and confirm progress. Student work was screened and class-time given for discussing and practicing presentation skills.&nbsp;From the explanation of the projects to the actual presentations took about 1 month. Students presented their projects to the class.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Results/Reflections: I was very impressed with the work of the students. They were eager to produce and present their own work. They also demonstrated improved behavior and willingness to work in class, even when we were not talking directly about the projects. The students filled out short questionnaires and semi-structured group interviews were conducted. The students gave overwhelmingly positive impressions about doing the projects. They liked the ability to choose their own topics. Many students also like the role-reversal when they were presenting, that is, they enjoyed sharing and teaching what they had been learning. One student described his feelings as &ldquo;I like being the boss!&rdquo;, which I interpreted as a feeling he was not accustomed to having in class settings, and one that helped him to feel positive about learning.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Title: <em>Introducing Quizlet &ndash; an online learning tool &ndash; into my Talmud class.</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I teach Jewish studies for an all-boys Jewish high school in Sydney. The main Jewish topic that is taught is called &lsquo;Talmud.&rsquo; Talmud is a collection of statements, discussions from hundreds of Rabbi&rsquo;s dating back to the beginning of the CE. This topic is very challenging for a variety of reasons. 1) The language used is Aramaic (similar to Hebrew, was used in Babylonia). 2) There are no sentences. There are just huge columns with lots of words and it takes a very skilled learner to know how to read and decipher it. 3) There are many new ideas, concepts and themes that get mentioned throughout the discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>Term 4, 2014 I decided that I wanted to make some changes to my Year 8 Talmud class. The key reason for me was that the boys all loved technology and trying to teach them this topic from a textbook was becoming increasingly harder. Additionally, this class was going to prepare the for the next 4 years of High school which would culminate in Classical Hebrew HSC. So getting my students to really like and enjoy this topic was crucial. All the students have an innate likeness for this topic, for it commentates on all aspects of Judaism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>I heard about a program called Quizlet, which has many cool features that could be used for my class. I spent some time learning how the program operates and decided it would be perfect for the class. The goal was to firstly, get the students to memorise all key words and concepts. Secondly, they should be fully engaged and enjoy every part of this learning.</p>
<p>I way I would know if it works, would be by gauging how many students are involved in the weekly discussions and debates, which include themes and key words that were taught from the Talmud. As well there are tests and quizzes that will clearly allow me assess &nbsp;their knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>So I booked the laptop trolley from the School facilities for the full week. The plan was that every day from 9:15-10:00am I would have the class use the laptop and complete their tasks on it. The class begins at 9:05am, I would outline what tasks I wanted them to do and how they would achieve it through the app called quizlet on their laptops. The way this programs works, is that I upload files (any word in any order I want) and place them in the (virtual) class I made on this program. I then send all the students invites to my class and when they log in to the class they can see those files and then proceed to answer/learn those words.</p>
<p>The first day I tried it was challenging, the boys had no clue how to sign up and get a username. So I quickly Air-played (same idea as projector with out any wires) my laptop on the smart board and showed them step for step how it gets done. Once they have their names and logged into he class they were off and figured out how to use the program very quickly. They loved it and when the class finished they all just wanted to carry on. I realized that this is what they need to master the topic. One issue I had was, how do I know what each student is actaully doing? Despite the many options on quizlet; games, flash cards, test etc. it doesnt tell the class director what is going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;After the class I had to ask each boy to tell me what games he played and how well he did, but that was taxing and I knew it couldn&rsquo;t last. So I researched the program some more and find out that if you pay (a small minimal fee annually) you can be upgraded to higher stats that allows for the teacher to see the class progress, which I did.</p>
<p>The next day, I uploaded three more files to the class. They not only loved the learning, they even had competitions amongst themselves who could have the best time (in one particular game). The best thing for me was, I knew who played which games and how often. As well as it gave me the class percentage of each word (how often it was spelled / answered correctly or incorrectly).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The learning was amazing. All the students performed better in their tests and there were many more voices heard on our weekly Talmud discussion. This reinforced the ideas of lateral learning. The fact that all students can pick from a variety of games gives then the opportunity to learn in their fashion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>I would like to incorporate more gaming style programs in my class. It seemed to me that these boys were natural gamers; they love the individual challenge and the fact that they are competing against a classmate. Also this tool can be used for homework, so before a test, the teacher can just tell the class review files xyz and they can go on the program whenever they want a review through all the games available.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Text from discussion re DPD</p>
<p>It is interesting how slanted the DPD is towards the sciences and science education (at least this is how it appears to me). &nbsp;When I browse and click on specific features these appear to almost all belong to the sciences. The meta and pragmatic principles are more accessible to a non-scientist I think.</p>
<p>Text from discussion re e-Design template</p>
<p>I also like how easy it is to see how the lesson is chunked. There is mention of student-external activity in the paragraph following the table, it is difficult to see where this might be. I think it would be very interesting to see the final or penultimate lesson and see if any activity made it over to the self-organised learner column.</p>
<p>I do think it is early enough in the inquiry not to expect much open activity, though perhaps the case study itself might have missed an opportunity by picking such an early lesson to evaluate?</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Narrator</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Tutor/teacher</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Situation</h2>
<p dir="ltr">OU Live</p>
<p dir="ltr">Web conferencing software</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students have Sense programming software at home and a Sense board (with LED lights and a button)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Level one HE students</p>
<p dir="ltr">One tutors</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some students may have met at dayschool but would expect them not to know eachother.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They may have some sense of community from communicating on the forum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They want to learn programming.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Task</h2>
<p dir="ltr">What were you trying to achieve?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The students may believe that they should use the programming environment immediately before working out a design and developing the logic for their program. I want to give them the tools to enable them to design the logic first which is then translatable into any computer programming language.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What was your measure of success?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The measure will be seen in their approach to the programming problems in the module.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Whether they are able to do the task set and quickly program a solution.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Actions</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Introduce the 3 d&rsquo;s</p>
<p dir="ltr">Firstly by using a mundane situation - taking off wallpaper</p>
<p dir="ltr">Define - define the problem in one sentence</p>
<p dir="ltr">Describe - describe the steps required to be able to create the details for the problem</p>
<p dir="ltr">Detail - write out the algorithm for solving the problem</p>
<p dir="ltr">Introduce the programming problem - setting up LED lights to model traffic lights</p>
<p dir="ltr">Put students in small (2 / 3) groups</p>
<p dir="ltr">report back each &ldquo;D&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students get caught out understanding the difference between describe and detail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tell them that one of the steps in describe needs to be to find the regulations for traffic lights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Make sure they all have the correct algorithm (shared in large group)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ask each student to program their Sense Board</p>
<p dir="ltr">Using simulator do application shares on random students</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Results</h2>
<p dir="ltr">List the expected and unexpected outcomes of your actions. To what degree did you meet your objectives? What additional outcomes did you engender? Provide evidence to back your claims.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Those students who are already able to program find this much easier and need extension activities (using button as pedestrian wait)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Used to group students with an experienced programmer at helm, now make sure that all the non-programmers are together and let the programmers be creative - so split the groups. This is because programmers found it too easy and non-programmers were able to hide behind this.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Reflections</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I will try this out next week because this is a classroom activity we do at Dayschool but should be transferable to the OU Live environment.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Narrator</strong> &ndash; My role is as a marketing tutor in HE. I am to facilitate learning and understanding of the promotion mix and use of marketing communication tools</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong> &ndash; A higher education establishment within an FE college.&nbsp; We are using a computer suite with one PC per student. The group of 18 are mature and diverse and are studying for an FdA in leadership and management. &nbsp;They are a well established group, they have known each other for 6 months but this is their first time in the computer room. This session is important as is relates directly to their next assessment task.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong> &ndash; The students are given a template listed with a number of promotion tools available and some other marketing concepts. They have been instructed to view the website of one organisation and describe examples to fit into the template. For example they might look at Next and look for evidence of relationship marketing. &nbsp;They have been told to work in pairs and discuss what they find in a plenary at the end of the session. The purpose of the task is the help them become more familiar with the promotional tools and examine the strengths and weaknesses of each tool in context. The success will be measured in terms of the population of the template and the quality of the short presentation at the end.</p>
<p>Actions</p>
<ol>
<li>Students put themselves into pairs and log on to PC</li>
<li>Handout template</li>
<li>Students read instructions on sheet (template)</li>
<li>Tutor provides more detailed instruction and advises good orgs to use</li>
<li>Students &nbsp;find relevant website</li>
<li>Students start at the top of the template with advertising and begin to navigate the website for examples</li>
<li>Students jump from one box (on template) to another when they come across relevant examples to add.</li>
<li>Tutor visits each pair to offer help and assistance and encourage students to evaluate what they discover.</li>
</ol>
<p>Results</p>
<p>All students fill out the template and present their&nbsp;findings at the end of the session. One group worked in a group of 4 and divided the work into 2. One person worked alone. &nbsp;All students were engaged and had much anecdotal experience to share. One student wanted to look at game company but found the site blocked.</p>
<p>Reflection</p>
<p>An interesting task which all students can relate to, many pick org they work for such as Halfords or orgs they use such as Boots. &nbsp;Some of them started to consider the implications of the tools used and the impact of them on sales or customer perception of the org. Not all of them noticed the blending of the tools and how they over lap. The limitation of the template is that students try to make all examples fit into a box.&nbsp; Some students started to understand the use of loyalty cards and relationship marketing. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a practical and interactive task. I should have got all the groups evenly matched to create a level playing field and ensuring all students have the some amount of work to complete.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><em>This design narrative describes the redesign of an ICT Functional Skills lesson.&nbsp; Classroom layout was restricted and lessons were often disrupted with students taking a long time to settle down at the start of lessons.&nbsp; In reducing &lsquo;teacher talk&rsquo; for activity instruction and changing the tutor position from the front of class to moving within the group, this enabled more time to be spent in noticing and commenting upon positive behaviours displayed by individuals.&nbsp; The focus and attention were therefore removed from the negative behaviours resulting in changing the classroom atmosphere to be more positive and increasing student productivity.</em></p>
<h1>Context</h1>
<p><em>Students enrolled on a practical, hands-on Construction course were required to attend mandatory ICT Functional Skills lessons for one hour per week.&nbsp; Students were able to take their assessment when they were individually ready to do so.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h1>Material</h1>
<p><em>The setting is a small classroom.&nbsp; Facilities available are a PC and desk for each student with a PC and projector for the tutor.&nbsp; The projector can only be projected onto the front wall of the classroom and all students sit along the two sides and back of the classroom, facing the wall.&nbsp; This can&rsquo;t be changed due to room size restrictions and cabling.</em></p>
<h1>Social</h1>
<p><em>The students are aged 16-19 and attend a Further Education college on a full-time basis.&nbsp; They attend this lesson in the same groups that they are in for their other subjects so know each other.&nbsp; Although the course is full-time, some students have to attend college for this hour long lesson only on a given day due to their personal time-tabling.</em></p>
<h1>Intentional</h1>
<p><em>As this course is mandatory and is in contrast to the practical nature of their core qualification, this lesson can be viewed as &lsquo;not relevant&rsquo; to the group or &lsquo;a waste of time&rsquo;.&nbsp; They enjoy socialising with friends although some relationships between peers are at times tense.&nbsp; Some find it difficult to concentrate in a traditional classroom setting due to factors such as ADD, ADHD and negative previous experiences of education.&nbsp; These negative experiences have a detrimental effect on learning motivation &ndash; &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the point?&rsquo; There is a lot of chat and noise at the beginning of lessons and time is wasted in waiting for everyone to settle down before starting.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h1>Force Map</h1>
<p>&nbsp;I am experiencing problems uploading to Flickr currently but will display my Forces Diagram in the embedded content section as soon as I am able.</p>
<h1>Challenge</h1>
<p><em>The challenge is:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>to enable students to gain an essential qualification to enable progression within their chosen programme</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>to contextualise the learning in relation to their potential future roles within Construction to demonstrate relevance</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>to enable the students to gain a positive experience of learning to replace the previous negative experiences that some may have had.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<h1>Theoretical / Pedagogical Framework</h1>
<p><em>The main part of the challenge was to encourage positive behaviour towards learning in order that individuals could participate in lessons.&nbsp; The plan was to do this using a model of positive behaviour reinforcement. &nbsp;&nbsp;Unless extreme circumstances necessitated this, undesired behaviours were not commented upon with a focus instead of finding opportunities to praise positive behaviours wherever they arose.&nbsp; The aim was to remove negativity from the classroom and replace it with an atmosphere where students enjoyed participating in the activities.&nbsp; The longer term goal was to demonstrate to students with negative previous experiences of education that learning could be an enjoyable process.</em></p>
<h1>Actions</h1>
<p><em>I changed the structure of the lesson and instead of waiting at the front of the classroom, I met everyone at the door, greeting them by name and ensuring everyone got settled at their PC.&nbsp; When asked by some students &lsquo;What are we doing today&rsquo;, I would act quite casually and point at the screen at the front of the room which gave a simple instruction: &lsquo;Welcome to today&rsquo;s lesson, please log in and check your email :)&nbsp;</em><em>&rsquo;</em></p>
<p><em>Students logged into their email to find an email from me giving background for the lesson&rsquo;s activity:&nbsp; &ldquo;Your mission, for today, is&hellip;&rdquo; They were asked to go to Moodle to download their worksheet which contained further details. Their mission was a learning objective treasure hunt of sorts rather than one delivered traditionally by the tutor.</em></p>
<p><em>After downloading the worksheet from Moodle, students could either print out the worksheet or read it on screen.&nbsp; The worksheet listed tasks:&nbsp; a research activity and to create a spreadsheet.</em></p>
<p><em>When the task was complete the final stage was to send me an email, telling me that they had completed the task, complete with a copy of their work as an attachment.</em></p>
<p><em>These tasks linked to the learning outcomes of the ICT Functional Skills assessment and enabled students to practice reading and following instructions.</em></p>
<p><em>While students were working I was able to move freely among the group, who were all working at different speeds, offering individual support as required.&nbsp; The new structure gave me more time to comment positively on the work that they were carrying out rather than focussing on what wasn&rsquo;t being done.</em></p>
<h1>Obstacles</h1>
<p><em>Sometimes login passwords were forgotten and I would have to reset them which took away some attention from the group briefly but eventually everyone started to take care to remember their passwords as they didn&rsquo;t want to get &lsquo;left behind&rsquo;.</em></p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p><em>Some students finished the work very quickly and wanted to leave the lesson early which they weren&rsquo;t able to do whereas others completed the work in the allocated time.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Students responded well to less &lsquo;teacher talk&rsquo; in relation to instruction and the relationship between tutor and students was more relaxed and less tense as I was able to offer individual support and comment positively on the work that was being done as opposed to focussing on the negative aspect of the initial disruption at the beginning of sessions.</em></p>
<h1>Reflections</h1>
<p><em>By changing my own position within the room and not attempting to &lsquo;lead from the front&rsquo;, this removed the initial issue of the inflexibility in room layout.&nbsp; The students couldn&rsquo;t move in order to change the dynamic so I did.&nbsp; This took away a lot of the traditional classroom feel that was learning barrier at the beginning.</em></p>
<p><em>Sessions were less stressful for both myself and the students as the focus was on encouraging and commenting upon any positive behaviours.&nbsp; Due to the increased productivity within the group this led me to expand the activities that were given to include a &lsquo;Step it up&rsquo; task at the end which was a stretch task.&nbsp;</em></p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Four T's Model</strong></p>
<p>My first reaction to this model was one of bemusement. Although technology is quite clearly placed at the centre of this process the diagram appears just to function as a glorified lesson plan</p>
<p>The lesson/session is split into Tasks, Teams, Technology and Time and then represented using a flow diagram to show how the 4Ts integrate and associate with each other. The timings of the activities appear quite rigid and ambitious which makes me think that the need to move on quickly from one activity to the next might stifle collaboration.</p>
<p>Also, the presence of lanes indicate that each activity is somehow exclusive or neutral to one another; it's difficult to see how there would be time to change both the topic and the learning environment so many times.</p>
<p>Overall, there are some useful aspects here but having learnt my lessons from past experience it would be&nbsp;inevitable that I would end up tinkering and simplifiyng&nbsp;this approach.</p>
<p><strong>eDesign Model</strong><br /> <br />I found the graphic for the 4 phases of scaffolding easy understand and it looks logical in its progression of stages. The constructivist pedagogic foundation bears perhaps the closest resemblance to my own learning design described in Activity 1b. This model seems especially suitable for activities structured over a longer period of time. I like the fact that this model can be orientated to fit around a tool, a technology, a skill or a concept.</p>
<p>I would have liked a little more information provided at each stage of the process and you can't really see from the model if the outcome or objective of the lesson have been achieved.</p>]]></description>

              <title>SAT: What gives a tutor the X Factor: Examining the criteria for successful online learning facilitation (Sarah Quinnell)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8556</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8556</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Establishing connection with students has long been acknowledged as an important factor in facilitating learning. Anyone involved in distance education will be familiar with the feelings of anxiety and isolation expressed by students studying away from campus. A close and successful face-to-face relationship with students is considered by many academics to be a powerful aspect of their professional identity, essential for creating meaningful learning experiences and in some cases, a contributing factor in their resistance to e-learning. This paper looks at how we create these personal relationships in an online environment. What does it mean to communicate vitality, conviction and feeling? What does &lsquo;being there&rsquo; with students mean in an online learning environment? What do learners want from their tutors? <br /><br />I identify and examine the factors and criteria that students use to rate the performance of their tutors and look at what it tells us, as e-learning practitioners, about what students value in their relationships with their tutors. Data was collected from four groups of students undertaking two vocational marketing certificates offered by UK organisations. Each group of students was asked to rate their Class Tutor on a scale of 1 &ndash; 5, where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent, after each class for a period of three months. At the end of this period the students were presented with a questionnaire that asked them to reflect upon the reasons for their ratings. A further set of focus groups, undertaken either in person or using synchrous messaging technology, were arranged to discuss the issues further. As both courses have face-to-face and online versions, which delivered the same materials, by the same tutors over the same period of time, I was able to compare criteria to begin to understand how technology impacts upon the relationships tutors have / can build with their students. <br /><br />The research found that online learners place greater importance on what I classify as &lsquo;performance&rsquo; criteria and how much they have been &lsquo;entertained&rsquo; rather than the subject matter being presented. With reference to the impact of technology the data illustrated that in face-to-face teaching technological malfunctions had a negligible impact on tutor ratings, whereas for online students technical malfunctions cause significant negative impacts on tutor ratings. I go on to discuss the impact of these criteria on the implementation and further development of online learning environments, specifically in relation to setting and managing students experiences of online learning. The paper concludes by considering what this means for both learning technologists and tutors in the design and delivery of online learning content. While this paper begins to understand what learners value in terms of the tutors role in delivering online learning, in doing so, it raises a number of questions relating to how we look to meet these concerns and ensure that students expectations are managed and met prior to enrolment, during and after they have finished their qualifications.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <title>Activity: 40 mins: Pen portraits</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8479</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8479</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>In this activity you will write 4-6 pen portraits which describe a series of student personas. You can use these to help inform and guide your design decisions.</p>
<p>1. Begin by finding some pictures of people who could be your students. Remember that if you expect to share these pictures with others you need to ask permission of the individual involved or use a Creatice Commons licenced picture (free to use and share). Having a picture will help you keep you pen-portrait as real as possible.</p>
<p>2. Next,&nbsp;complete in the sections below (add any you think are missing). Be descriptive but keep each section relatively short so that each of your pen portraits fits on one side of paper.&nbsp;Make sure that your personas represent the full extents of your student group (i.e. in terms of motivations, skills, expectations and needs) so that they properly test your design thinking. While these pen portraits are imaginary, it is likley that you will be using your memories of some real students; make sure that no real students can be identified!</p>

              <title>Linda audsley - Design Narrative - Two day coaching programme for engineers</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8347</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is two day &lsquo;introduction to coaching&rsquo; module, delivered as part of a leadership programme to first line managers in an engineering organisation.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>In general, people have heard of <em>coaching</em> although most of the participants have had little experience of either providing formalised work-based coaching or being formally coached (except within sport).</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The outcomes of the task, was to ensure that by the end of the two days, participants would be aware of and have practised &lsquo;coaching skills&rsquo;, recognised and utilised one coaching framework and experienced co-coaching through a range of practical activities including &lsquo;perceptual positioning&rsquo;.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>The steps required to design the programme were to:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Ensure that all the agreed goals and outcomes were written in a measurable form for future evaluation and validation</li>
<li>Draw up a programme that built upon the skills, knowledge and behaviours in logical steps, identifying the objectives of each topic/session.</li>
<li>Draft out rough timescales for each session.</li>
<li>Identify through boardstorming - drawing on experience, a broad range of &nbsp;activities available to meet the session objectives</li>
<li>Select the relevant activities that would meet both individual needs and the session objectives most succinctly and effectively.</li>
<li>Review the programme and adjust activities/timescales accordingly.</li>
<li>Create appropriate evaluation sheet for participants</li>
<li>Write up a &lsquo;trainertrack&rsquo; for future reference for me or colleagues, to ensure consistency.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>Always expect the unexpected</em> is the mantra for all learning professionals, and flexibility is a mainstay for this type of programme. </p>
<p>Once participants have added their objectives to the organisational ones, there is a need to adjust the programme to meet these too, without raising expectations beyond the realistic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As always, there is never enough time, equally the activities that one assumes will take the least amount of time to run, often take the longest and vice versa. Every group is different, so there can be no expectation that the programme will be delivered identically for each group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The organisation&rsquo;s objectives take priority and are always covered (that is what I am paid to deliver) and in this example, I achieved most of the participant&rsquo;s objectives too (mainly because they generally tied in with the corporate ones). Apart from covering coaching skills, in the first programme, we also went off piste and had a brief foray into Transactional Analysis and a little time spent on &lsquo;eye accessing cues&rsquo; (neither or which I had planned to do).</p>
<p>We rarely have the magic number of 12 participants and didn&rsquo;t on this occasion which does make the triad exercises more difficult to manage &ndash; groups of 4 take longer than 3 and groups of 2 suffer from not having an observer to give feedback. None of these are major issues &ndash; just ongoing niggles. The programme content received positive informal feedback during the two days and this was confirmed in the written feedback at the end of the programme.</p>
<p>I cannot quote from the written feedback, however, my request for &nbsp;informal anonymous feedback from the group resulted in an overall score of between <em>8-10</em> out of a top mark of 10 for the two days.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>The biggest difficulty with this type of programme is knowing what to omit. A two day course does not lend itself to covering the topic in substantial depth. It is the problem of superficiality which always leaves me feeling a little frustrated. I can see that most of the participants have gained from the sessions, but I&rsquo;m always horribly aware of what has been excluded to fit the timeframe available.</p>
<p>This is rarely the view of the participants, who &lsquo;<em>don&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know</em>&rsquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s just that I do!</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I decided to compare and review the following:</p>
<p><a class="oucontent-hyperlink" href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/-healthy-eating-in-an-e-design-template">"Healthy Eating" in an e-Design Template</a></p>
<p><a class="oucontent-hyperlink" href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/scenedit-healthy-eating">"Healthy Eating" as an ISiS model</a></p>
<p>&lt;!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?--&gt;</p>
<div>Edesign template- easy to read, communicates the idea and type of activity well. It's a standard table really so not sure if it expresses&nbsp;much visually.&nbsp;It also did not feel sequential even&nbsp;though&nbsp;activities are numbered but more of an "sorting shapes" in box excersise.&nbsp;I don't see how this template caters for edesign as it incorporates common elements of any lesson plan?</div>
<div>This would&nbsp;for&nbsp;instance not&nbsp;support me to transfer my lesson into a&nbsp;vle .There are no&nbsp;timelines&nbsp;, no interactive elements&nbsp;to include; nothing terminology wise to encourage you to think in terms of eLearning.&nbsp;I &nbsp;expected the template to be use&nbsp;learning&nbsp;specific headings like tools /forum/interaction etc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Isis model &amp; ScenEdit- as a contrast this model works well for an eLearning situation as it is very task focused. However the &nbsp;greatest&nbsp;advantage is that it works visually. Through the Scenedit software you have a workable mix between storyboarding&nbsp;and interaction designing. It makes the design explicit. I therefore think this model would work with my information&nbsp;literacy&nbsp;lessons.&nbsp;The&nbsp;benefits as I see it would be the visual element granting a "walk&nbsp;through" of the lesson highlighting maybe any issues. On the downside the Isis model on its own is to theoretical in my view and would not work as effeciently for me.</div>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3 dir="ltr">Narrator</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I am the Training Officer for a final year apprentice electrician who failed to pass the &lsquo;Inspection and Testing of an Electrical Installation&rsquo; &nbsp;section in his Final Integrated Competence Assessment. &nbsp;(FICA is the assessment that all apprentice electricians in Scotland need to pass to upgrade to the role of electrician). &nbsp;My role was</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to provide feedback on the apprentice&rsquo;s performance to the apprentice and his employer</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to liaise with the apprentice on what skills he needs to develop prior to his re-sit</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to arrange with the employer the means by which the apprentice might gain the skills he needs</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to arrange an appropriate re-sit date that suits both the apprentice and the employer</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="ltr">Situation</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I met with the employer and the apprentice at an address where they were working together. &nbsp;This is the normal arrangement which causes minimal disruption to the employer&rsquo;s business. &nbsp;The location transpired to be the new house of a friend of the employer. &nbsp;The employer was switching his interactions between me and his apprentice, and his friends.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Under normal circumstances I will have met with the apprentice and employer on numerous occasions over the apprenticeship but on this occasion I have only met the employer once, and the apprentice on two occasions before this meeting. &nbsp;I have only recently taken over this area and don&rsquo;t really have a relationship with either of them. &nbsp;The apprentice has been in employment with this contractor for over four years, &nbsp;This timing turned out to be significant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Initially they were both very cautious about discussing the situation. &nbsp;I suspected this would be the case from the context that I describe below. &nbsp;However there was something more that I didn&rsquo;t understand and whilst the employer was disappointed that the apprentice had failed a section of FICA there was an awkwardness about their personal &nbsp;interaction that I didn&rsquo;t understand. &nbsp;I thought that the apprentice was embarrassed, and that because they both didn&rsquo;t really know me they were being over cautious. &nbsp;This was not so, and only became apparent later.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Task</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I was trying to achieve a number of solutions and outcomes to this situation.</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I was trying to provide a quality of service of support to both the employer and the apprentice. &nbsp;With regard to the employer this is somewhat mercenary in the hope that the employer will recruit a new apprentice when his current one completes the course. &nbsp;Secondly, the employer had already made the claim to me in an earlier telephone conversation that his apprentice had been placed under undue pressure by a member of the test centre staff and was considering making a complaint. &nbsp;I was aware that both the employer and the apprentice were unhappy at the (alleged) performance of my colleague.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Outwith the diplomacy of the above I was trying to facilitate a number aspects of learning. The first was learning on my part. &nbsp;I wanted to identify whether the apprentice had sufficient knowledge and understanding about the subject of &nbsp;inspection &amp; testing (the failed section) that might make their claim of undue pressure justifiable.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The second learning objective that I was trying to achieve was one that</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">ensured that the apprentice gained sufficient on-site training in the inspection &amp; testing subject area so that he would</p>
</li>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">be in a position to pass his re-sit</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">be in a position to perform inspection &amp; testing as part of his role as an electrician.</p>
</li>
</ol></ol>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s a generally held belief in my workplace that the most appropriate place to learn is in the authentic workplace. &nbsp;I arrived at this location and situation with this assumption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before arriving on site I had a clear idea of what would be successful outcomes. &nbsp;These were</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">that the employer and the apprentice were content with the service my employer provides;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">that the apprentice would be informed about his performance at FICA; and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">that training would be agreed upon that would make possible 4a and 4b</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">As the meeting progressed these outcomes it became increasingly obvious that these aims were unlikely to be met. &nbsp;It was only after the meeting that I understood why.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Actions</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I started by reviewing the diagnostic report of the apprentices first attempt at FICA. &nbsp;This allowed me to get oral testimony of what the apprentice had done during the assessment. &nbsp;This was firstly designed to allow me to guage the apprentice&rsquo;s &nbsp;overall knowledge about the subject and secondly to suggest areas where he might have lost marks during the assessment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was quickly clear that the apprentice knew very little about one of the tests in question (the second out of 6 in total). &nbsp;His employer, witnessing his confusion, tried to assist by reminding the apprentice about what the test entailed. &nbsp;Unfortunately it was clear that the employer knew just as little about the test in question as his unfortunate apprentice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was when I had to correct the employer that he himself admitted that he had trouble understanding the topic of inspection and testing. &nbsp;This effectively put the sand in the engine of my learning plan, and &nbsp;I was now making it up as I went along. &nbsp;I suggested that I approach the local college with a view to them providing the apprentice with some training. &nbsp;The employer was only happy with this arrangement when I agreed that we would fund the training.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When we got onto the topic of when a re-sit could take place the employer told me that it had to take place before a certain date the following month to ensure that he would be able to claim funding should the apprentice be successful. &nbsp;I was unaware of this necessity and this placed an unexpected time-limit on the apprentice&rsquo;s college supported training.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With this new on-the-hoof plan agreed I took my leave of the meeting and the apprentice walked me back to my car which was parked at the other end of the street. &nbsp;It was at this point that the apprentice told me that he has never received any on-site training on this subject because the employer 'doesn&rsquo;t have a clue' about electrical testing. &nbsp;The apprentice also told me that the previous Training Officer had been aware of this and had numerous discussions about this with the employer. The apprentice had assumed that I knew this.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Results</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">An expected outcome was that the apprentice would gain the training to prepare him for his FICA resit. &nbsp;The outcome wasn&rsquo;t achieved in the way I had planned though</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Whilst I think that it is possible that the college training will provide the apprentice with the training to perform well in his resit, i suspect that there is very little chance that I will meet the objective to allow the apprentice to perform inspection &amp; testing as part of his future role as an electrician.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">An &nbsp;unexpected outcome was that my employer was now going to have to pay for this additional college training and which, if successful, will result in the employer receiving a &pound;1000 grant.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I had hoped that I would leave the meeting with the complaint possibility becalmed and the good name of my employer restored. Instead as the meeting went on I began to feel like a character in a Pinter play who allows suppressed tensions to become manifest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">Reflections</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I was very pleased to read recently that John Seely Brown described learning as messy. &nbsp;This messiness isn&rsquo;t just down to the difficulties of putting something as complex as learning into words but includes an understanding that learning involves financial motivations, personal tensions and resentments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The assumed expectation in a Community of Practice, in which an apprentice moves from the periphary to full membership of a discourse, is that the gatekeeper is sufficiently competent to be a gatekeeper. &nbsp;This situation has caused me to reflect on the value of a discourse that can allow the gatekeeper to be without competence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The situation has also shaken my confidence in the value of assuming that the workplace is the site of authentic learning. &nbsp;Since, in this situation, the FICA assessment itself takes place in the inauthentic setting of a test centre then perhaps the &lsquo;inauthentic&rsquo; setting of a college workshop is actually the most authentic place to learn.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><em><br /></em><strong>Creating Science4CE as a revision resource</strong></p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p><em>In my role as Head of Science in a prep school, I was responsible for getting my Year 8 pupils through their Common Entrance 13+ Science examination, using whatever revision resources I regarded fit for the task. I decided to create my own.</em></p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>At the time, around March 2006, I was Head of Science &amp; ICT at Rose Hill Preparatory School, in Alderley, near Wotton-Under-Edge. I was aiming to create revision notes for my Year 8 pupils in preparation for their Common Entrance (CE) 13+ Science examination. In the build up to the CE exam, which consisted of Biolgy, Chemistry and Physics papers, I wanted to give the pupils the best possible resources from which to revise, hoping that this would reinforce their understanding of what I had taught them since the start of Year 7. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>Although there were many resources available, I was keen to create a resource that the pupils could easily refer to, something that was clear and simple to understand and 'to the point', as much of what was around at the time presented far too much information, rather than just the key concepts they needed to understand. I also wanted to produce something that I could make available online, for those who preferred to use the internet for revision.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Started the design of the revision notes with the aim of fitting one topic per page, to keep things simple - it soon emerged that this would not be possible as there was too much content to include, so I decided to slip each topic over as few pages as possible. Design included topic title in the middle with information in logical groups around it - as much graphical content as possible in the form of images, diagrams etc.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Drafted the first computerised version of the notes using Apple 'Pages', with the topics separated into Biology, Chemistry and Physics sections.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Obtained images and diagrams from a wide range of sources - some hand/computer drawn, some open source, some photos taken by me, some images purchased.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Completed computer-produced version of the revision notes and error-checked. I then converted the whole 'Pages' document into a pdf document.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Complete set of revision notes was printed out and distributed to Year 8 students.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->The start of the following year all of Year 7 and Year 8 were given the notes for on-going revision.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Created Science4CE.co.uk website and used screen-shots of revision notes as content on the site.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Created 13+ CE revision questions on Yacapaca.com, for use in revision quizzes to complement the notes. Created a link on science4ce.co.uk to Yacapaca using a specially generated code, which allowed visitors to science4ce to immediately access the science quizzes I had created on Yacapaca.com. Originally this had been a problem as pupils had to register on Yacapaca using an email address, but yacapaca changed this and allowed pupils to register without an email address and use the code to link to specific quiz sets. Yacapaca was a free resource at this time.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Updated science4ce.co.uk layout and navigation for easier access. Split revision notes into separate topic sections and uploaded them to Scribd.com - this allowed me to display the revision content in an easier, more eye-pleasing way using scribd.com's embedding codes. This also meant that any changes I made to the revision notes only had to be updated on scribd.com, without changing anything else on science4ce.co.uk, with the format staying the same.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Expected results: </em></p>
<ul>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->My pupils used the revision notes leading up to the Common Entrance exams and also accessed the science4ce website, making use of the yacapaca questions.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->The results recorded on yacapaca.com showed an improvement in the pupils' knowledge of the subject matter over time.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Ongoing use of the revision notes took place for the following 3 years (until Rose Hill School closed in July 2009).</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Unexpected results:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Common Entrance Science results at Rose Hill improved each year from 2006-2009 and were, in fact, the best CE results out of all subjects at the school in 2007-2009. This, of course, may have been down to the pupils' ability, rather than the resources!</em></li>
<li><em>When I moved schools in September 2009, the Science department at my new school adopted the revision notes I had created, for use with their Year 7 and 8 pupils, although I wasn't Head of Science at the school.</em></li>
<li><em>The Science4CE website took off - it started to receive hits from all over the world, most, obviously, from the UK. Analytics show that it currently receives between 1300-2400 hits per month from September to June, which then tail off to approximately 600 hits per month during the Summer holidays.</em></li>
<li><em>The use of the quizzes I had created on Yacapaca rose significantly throughout the prep school community; users of the quizzes now include actual prep school science departments as well as individuals revising for Science at CE level.</em></li>
<li><em>I received many requests by teachers in other prep schools to download my notes for use with their own classes.</em></li>
<li><em>Yacapaca started charging for their service after years of being free - a problem I am yet to solve.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>The whole project went from something intended to be quite small and meant for a small group of students to something fairly large, viewed by many thousands online. The project is still ongoing and there are necessary changes I need to make in the future, including:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>making the content of the Science4CE website more interactive, for the benefit of the students using it</em></li>
<li><em>delivering quizzes in an alternative format to Yacapaca, as the costs involved in maintaining use of Yacapaca, now that it is no longer free, are too high</em></li>
<li><em>changing my paper-based notes into an ebook, downloadable <em>&nbsp;to any mobile device&nbsp;</em>via the website - the increase in popularity of study via mobile devices in schools demands this.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>From striving to achieve my initial goals with the project, I certainly gained an insight into web-based educational resources and what people want from this kind of service. I also recognised the need to implement cost-saving features and that this kind of resource cannot stand still; online educational resources must develop alongside the available technologies.</em></p>]]></description>

Actions and objectives are included in circles and squares, and it is easy to drag ones&rsquo; eye across what needs to be done. This would be very easy for the experienced teacher/instructor to refer to during the lesson as it is colourful and states what needs to be done e.g. working out how many students need to be in how many groups. The only drawback would be lack of space to add further detail/list comments or stimulation of further learning design processes such as details of social interaction to look out for, pedagogy and recording of results.</p>
<p><a title="4sppices model" href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/4sppices ">Healthy eating as a 4sppices model</a><br /><br /> This web based resource has a lot of additional features such as tagging, sharing and tabs to split up different areas. It is also easy to see at one glance the process, with the addition of allowing additional text /comments unlike the 4TS model. However the P1, P2, P3 labels might&nbsp; be a tad confusing and colour/shapes might better represent this function. <br /> <br /> These models would be adequate for expressing my learning design as it would ensure that I stick to a learning design that has been agreed prior, and enable me to go through the stages in the actual lesson without going off task. I would also be able to store and share these models with colleagues and other students and keep a solid record of proceedings. If I was able to add student details, comments, photos and films, even better.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Amanda Everitt’s design narrative: raising awareness between deaf and hearing students</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8261</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I worked as a Participation Officer for deaf young people and my role was to engage with this audience and find out their interests, thought and their obstacles through fun and interactive activities, and to use this as a vehicle to influence organisational change from a child-centred perspective.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>This 1 hour long activity took place within a school classroom with 5 deaf and 5 hearing students aged 11-18. All the participants knew of each other having seen each other around school, however only two were friends. Students were initially awkward with one other there being a wide range of ages and communication factors present such as students who signed, students who spoke but still needed communication assistance to understand full instructions. The presenter was deaf, and relied on the British Sign Language interpreter to translate the comments of the hearing students, and the BSL interpreter was also on hand to translate the comments of the deaf students to the hearing students. To encourage full disclosure, no other classroom teacher was present. The classroom was of a good size, however tables had to be adjusted from rows to a horseshoe shape so that the deaf students could see and lip-read the hearing students better. Students had access to felt pens and coloured post-it notes so that thoughts and comments could be jotted down. All the students were interested in contributing to improve communication and awareness between deaf and hearing people within the school.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Developing a new resource pack containing films and lesson plans to educate hearing students about deaf students and how to communicate better with them. The measure of success was getting positive feedback on how the students wanted the films and resources to look, and to see improvement in awareness and communication within this group of students to be passed on to other students within the school.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Objectives were met and interesting thoughts and comments were gained from the students to influence the creation and design of the resources.</p>
<p>The group dynamics were interesting as there was such a wide age range, older students talked more than the younger students and the younger students had to be encouraged to share their thoughts. It might have been better to have a separate session focusing on the look, feel and style of the resources, audio and subtitle access.<br /> However access to the students was limited. <br /> <br /> Due to limited time, evaluation of the session in the form of a short questionnaire was sent to the teacher to do with the students, and questions included if the students had talked to each other after the event, and if they had shared some tips from the session with their classmates.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Further sessions were held with deaf and hearing students separately, however it would have been beneficial if several sessions were held with the same group together and separately so as to glean more articulate thoughts and suggestions as deaf students may have been reluctant to share communication difficulties with hearing students.</p>]]></description>

Human focus on everyday practices and a wiki space as common working scenario, are essential tools in interpreting the complex implications of culture as prosumer of globalized values, as much as designers and users, in a social understanding of 21st century interplay of our technologically mediated culture and designer&rsquo;s observation.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>Where are you coming from? What is the context in which you are working and participating in OLDS MOOC?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>This is an incomplete narrative as I wanted to get something up to show that I have been doing something not just lurking....ther's loads that needs adding but anyway....</em></p>
<p><em>I am an e-learning consultant and trainer.&nbsp; When I enrolled on the MOOC, I was e-learning facilitator (aka learning technologist) at Staffordshire University, with particular responsibilities for the Faculty of Health Sciences.&nbsp; We have just (two days ago) moved to Birmingham so am no longer working at the University but hope to gain work at a local University as soon as I have time to regroup! </em></p>
<p><em>My participation in the MOOC has been in the middle of designing and implementing a complete lifestyle change.&nbsp; Now that the kids are all grown up (mentally independent if not fully financially independent!) we decided it was time to have some fun and move to a city into a 2-bed apartment (from a&nbsp; 5-bed house) which we did on Wednesday this week.&nbsp; So, what with the move and work and everything else, I have only been able to dip in and out but have been reading all the emails and surfing (or is it lurking) in the clouds.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>What did you hope to achieve? What were your goals in joining OLDS MOOC?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I wanted to participate in the OLDSMOOC for experience of a MOOC and to learn about learning design as I can use my learning when facilitating course design in my work.&nbsp; The expectation of technology has always been that it will &lsquo;transform&rsquo; learning and teaching and I want to &lsquo;transform&rsquo; my own ways of thinking about designing courses and here&rsquo;s a thing....as I write this I have a sudden revelation that we have been talking about learning design and not course design which I have realised already has worked in changing the angle at which we were coming at this learning from.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>What did you do? What were the main events, interactions, practices and activities in which you participated?&nbsp;What were the obstacles - and how did you tackle them?</em></p>
<p><em>This is a hard one, because the honest answer is not as much as I wanted with the lame excuse of pressures on time but I think I will forgive myself as I was trying to fit in an awful lot of events into a short space of time &ndash; decluttering 12 years worth of accumulated possessions, moving and job-seeking being a few of them.</em></p>
<p><em>Having got involved in two linked projects from many that were interesting and enticing, the outcome was being involved in one project (sorry Alan) on creating a course on learning design for further education teachers, topslicing through the research and evidence provided in the MOOC.&nbsp; This was simply because I was able to jump on and help build on the work already started by the project members, Elisabetta Lando and Dan McCafferty, further education learning and teaching is an area I have experience and supported some of the other work I was doing at the time.</em></p>
<p><em>The idea was to create a learning design course in Moodle for FE teachers using only a few of the essential resources, frameworks and models discovered and debated in the MOOC.&nbsp; This was so it was manageable and didn&rsquo;t involve too many forays into the myriad of tools available.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><em>What were the outcomes of your participation? Did you meet your goals? What went well, what didn't? What unexpected outcomes did you notice?</em></p>
<p><em>The outcome to date is the beginnings of a learning design course based in Moodle for FE teachers following on from a toolkit flowchart created in Lucidchart.com.&nbsp; The flowchart was based on the 7S model of design for experiential learning and then converting this into a course with suggested tasks and activities for individual or group learning using the templates, resources and links discovered in the MOOC.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/4e55-dbd4-51099474-a8b0-0bff0a005798&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The deadline for the prototype is May when we will encourage a group of FE teachers to evaluate the design by working through the course.&nbsp; Once it has been tweaked (!) it can be made available (not fully thought out how) as an open course.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>What did you learn? What advice could you give others?</em></p>
<p><em>The simple answer here is &lsquo;loads&rsquo; but not as much as I could have if I had given it the time it deserved.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>Whilst making and giving time is important, don&rsquo;t let it put you off because whatever time you can give to it adds to your learning.&nbsp; </em></p>

              <title>Week 8 - the journey so far (Sheila MacNeill)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8135</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8135</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Well it has been quite a journey.&nbsp; I started the course with great intentions. This would be just the focus and stimulus I needed to build a "real" learning design.&nbsp; I've been involved on the learning design community for a while, but as I'm not an actual teacher or designer I don't get much opportunity to build real designs. &nbsp;<br /><br />Week one started well, I had my idea of using a PgCert module on curriculum design which I "guest presented" at last year, and extending it with some examples of learning design tools. There seemed to be a few people interested and a some similar ideas. A team was formed, google hangouts were hung out. Along the way I got distracted and started to think about my learning context and in particular Cloudworks. From previous work I knew that alternative views of cloudscapes was possible e.g. viewing it as a mind map (see the link above for my oldsmooc cloudscape mindmap).&nbsp; But what else was possible. Tony Hirst rose to the challenge and some really fascinating experiments around network visualisations started to appear.&nbsp; I kept returning to these and they provided the foundation for my experiments in the prototyping week. &nbsp;<br /><br />I decided that I needed to try and at least create one cloud per week so I could use that as a basis for sharing my learning journey, connections and content which I've managed to do.</p>
<p>I experienced feelings of almost inherent guilt for not always sticking to the planned activities for each week.&nbsp; My confessional clouds I called them. Then earlier this week, near the end of week 7,&nbsp; whilst catching up on the evaluation convergence session something clicked. Briar asked the team what there measures of success for the course were. Amongst the replies Yishay said something along the lines of: we need to redefine what success means in MOOCs as opposed to traditional measures of success. This is a project based course, there is no certificate so if you get one thing that you can put into practice then that is success.<br /><br />Guilt lifted almost immediately.&nbsp; I have been gaining a huge amount from the course both about learning design, and different approaches to it. No, I've not done all the tasks, but that doesn't matter, I'm not being assessed on that and as the course content is open I can always revisit bits as and when I need.<br /><br />I've also started to clarify some nascent thoughts about using SNA/learning analtyics approaches from a learner centric point of view. But also, and I think more importantly for me, I've learnt so much about being a learner in a MOOC. Context and confidence are key. There's a bit more about this in my week 7 cloud and it's something I will be returning too and reflecting on more over the next 2 weeks.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Back in my confessional space this week!&nbsp; I haven't really engaged as much I would have liked this week.&nbsp; Partly because of travel and other "stuff" but also because initially I though that I might not be able to do much as I still haven't created a proper learning design.&nbsp; However, on reflection I did do a bit of crowdsourced evaluation with my week 5 protoype for a redesign of the cloudworks profile page.&nbsp; I did get feedback both on my blog and the cloud from students and the course team which was encouraging as they seemed agree with my overall ideas, and contributed their thoughts.&nbsp; I also had an email exchange with Juilette Culver the developer of Cloudworks, which as useful. Juliette has also posted to my prototype cloud giving some feedback and refelction on what is actually possible.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was at a workshop for the wid@t widget tool, which I shared as part of the toolbox activity way back in week 3 I think.&nbsp; And as I was working through their design template, I was reminded of personnas again and realised that if I was to take my prototype design forward I really need to think about a personna. I implicitly based my ideas on my "oldsmooc student persona", but I think if I had taken some more time to make that more explicit and get views of others that would (and still could) help to explain my design rationale more clearer. Which in turn would help conversations with developers like Juliette who have to balance my needs/wants of the site as a learner on an course, with the other users and help to prioritise any potential developments. A lot of my ideas do require quite a major redesign. So, I've found this week has connected some of the earlier topics.</p>
<p>I've just been catching up with the convergence and it was really interesting again to hear the team and Briar talk about what success means, and redefining it from measures associated with traditional courses. Yishay made a very good point about drop out not being a failure if you have got something out of the course.&nbsp; That is a key message for MOOCs, which relates to learner control and confidence and I guess literacy too.</p>
<p>I think Briar also made a good point about the pace of the course and meeting deadlines. I've made a concerted effort to do "something" each week. That something is sometimes more involved than others, but just creating and writing up a cloud each week has been really helpful for me own sensemaking.&nbsp; Again that's one of the motivations for looking at Cloudworks in more detail as I think it provides a really useful dedicated, contained, linked and social space for learners to reflect.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>After a spur of activity last week I'm back to my usual confessional  stance in the cloud. Not seeked or deployed but maybe this is a minor  launch.</p>
<pre id="embed"><a title="Wordle: Untitled" href="http://www.wordle.net/show/wrdl/6388236/Untitled"><img style="padding: 4px; border: 1px solid #ddd;" src="http://www.wordle.net/thumb/wrdl/6388236/Untitled" alt="Wordle: Untitled" /></a><br /><br /></pre>
<p>It's Wednesday and the convergence session has just finished. Very interesting hour and I created the wordle above from my very rough notes of the topics covered.</p>
<p>I've not really engage this week, partly because lots of people I work with do lots on OER and I have a bit of a passing interest in it too. However I did take some time yesterday to watch all the videos Dave and Marion made. Really useful set of resources for anyone new to the whole OER thing.&nbsp; Again what has been highlighted for me this week is the contradication of open practice, sharing and the reality of using/creating OERs. One the one hand both are undeniably "good things" but practice around using and creating open resources still needs to be developed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The convergence session was particularly useful I thought in terms of discussing the practicalities of creating open resources, licence issues, fair use, closed and open learning classrooms/environments. Also in terms of raising issues of open practice and general digital literacy skills around sharing and citation and using licences.</p>
<p>Context again came through strongly in terms of the question on the google doc about protecting the integrity of your design when using content not specifically designed for it, and also just generally in terms of finding appropriate content.&nbsp; But this issue isn't just confined to OERs - it applies to all content.&nbsp; It can take time to find content that is appropriate to use, and searching can take you down many cul-de-sacs and dead ends.</p>
<p>I'm enrolled on 3 MOOCs at the moment - all of which are using OERs but all have different levels of access. #oldsmooc is probably the most open in terms of accessing the course content and structure, #edcmooc is part of Coursera so you have to register to login to see the course content and structure (although all the resources are openly available) Conversely&nbsp; #LAK13 although using the Canvas VLE has openly available pages with the links to its content and course strucutre (no log in needed).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things that are running through my mind are "open by default", "degrees of open-ness" and developing ways to encourage teachers to be confident about sharing and re-use. Not just in terms of confidence in finding/usign appropriate licences but more generally in terms of sharing their designs and thoughts. Which I suppose is at the heart of what this course is all about.</p>
<p>Also brought to mind this post I wrote last year after a wee "open education" spree I had</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>For one of my projects we've gone straight to our University's open educational resouyrces repository because we knew they were there!</p>
<p>To give myself a little more of a challenge I thought I'd carry on with one of my other current design challenges, the Moving on with Moodle training course which I prototyped last week.</p>
<p>I used Xpert.nottingham.ac.uk first (which is for searching OER), and then Jorum, which is an actual repository.&nbsp; There I found a lot more basic resources, but also a couple which might come in handy for advanced Moodle training:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dspace.jorum.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/16026">Moodle Quiz training</a> (from LSE)&nbsp; <a title="Licence" rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://dspace.jorum.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/16026/license_url?sequence=11?iframe=true&width=75%&height=75%">Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales</a>&nbsp; (Although it mentions both 2.5 amnd 3.0 licence versions in the text of the item)</li>
<li><a href="http://dspace.jorum.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/16272">How to add questions to a Quiz activity</a> from York St John&nbsp; Licence <a title="Licence" rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://dspace.jorum.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/16219/license_url?sequence=2?iframe=true&width=75%&height=75%">Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dspace.jorum.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/16220">Moving Question banks&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>licence: <a title="Licence" rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://dspace.jorum.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/16272/license_url?sequence=2?iframe=true&width=75%&height=75%">Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these allow amendment.</p>
<p>Also looking into how to make my own publicly available Moodle training materials and helpsheets available as OERs.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Week 5 is prototyping week. I have to say it's not quite what I was expecting.&nbsp; I think I was expecting more work on the design and not so much on prototyping but I can sort of see the logic of spending time seeing how your design would work in action. In a previous life I was a "proper" learning technologist who actually designed courses and worked with web developers so I'm quite comfortable with my ability to discuss sytsem and design requirements.&nbsp; So, instead of prototyping a design/system this week, I've decided that the best use of my time would be to go back to some of the thoughts I had in the first couple of weeks of the course about the layout and alternative visualisations of Cloudworks itself.&nbsp; I spent some time yesterday (Sunday) and today (Monday) exploring Balsamiq. I know a number of people who have really liked using this mock up software so this was a really good opportunity to try it out for myself. I've created a mock up page and this morning created a little video walk through explaining it in a bit more detail</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I particularly like tools for creating learning objects which are so easy to use that you can prototype right inside them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Powerpoint can be used for prototyping, then using Xerte Online Toolkits would be a next logical step. It would bring a storyboard to life. Because it already has a lot of learning activities and functions built in, it is of course possible to create the whole learning object in it - and if it doesn't quite do everything needed, it would at least provide a learning-oriented prototype which could then be developed by a programmer (perhaps in the parent development tool Xerte itself).</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/S-iRSsnQJsxy5BnfKqOCc9MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-nmMN-qWw0dk/UQtXxCe5RCI/AAAAAAAAi1Q/9wfCtderi5A/s800/JENGA.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I love the simplicity of <a class="zem_slink" title="Jenga" href="http://www.hasbro.com/games/en_US/jenga/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Jenga</a>. </strong></p>
<p>Simplicity has a purity about it. Don't knock it. Behind its functionality and its look and feel there will be some hard thinking. Keep it simple, stupid (<a class="zem_slink" title="KISS principle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">K.I.S.S</a>) may be a training cliche but there is considerable truth in it. I've now had three years here at <a class="zem_slink" title="Open University" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.025,-0.705555555556&spn=0.01,0.01&q=52.025,-0.705555555556 (Open University)&t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">the OU</a> and here on this Student Blog platform (short of five days). I've been working on my ideas regarding learning and e-learning design in particular. Courtesy of THE OU hosted <a title="OLDS Mooc 2013" href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course">OLDs MOOC 2013</a> (Online Learning Design - <a class="zem_slink" title="Massive open online course" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Massive Open Online Course</a>) I'm experiencing what feels like undertaking an 8 week written examination - the contents of my brain are being pushed through the cookie cutter. And out comes this: <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Il Buono, il Brutto, il Cattivo.)" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/good_the_bad_and_the_ugly" rel="rottentomatoes" target="_blank">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a>.</strong> <em>(Of course I had shut down for the gadgets for the day and was brushing my teeth when this came to me).</em></p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/D2bXDdrcCSYGhwT0f3LEiNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0Ce0f0Wpyi8/UQtY6oKjJ5I/AAAAAAAAi2c/-b5CsHcMBoQ/s288/The%20good.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<p>Learning events or activities, moments that make the participant smile, think, reflect, nod in agreement, understand, be informed and generally feel good about the world and this particular learning experience. Hit them with some of this, as the say so succinctly across the Atlantic - at the 'get go'.</p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xUqWmeLuB0QOqucJi6k559MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zR7R8ogXYIc/UQtZAD_QDfI/AAAAAAAAi3Y/aeF3UVn7Dfk/s288/The%20bad.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<p>The effort required and built into the learning. OK, we want them to love this too, and you can if you're 'in the flow', have done your work, have wrestled with what you didn't understand, asked for help, listen to fellow students, gone out of your way to do extra reading and research until you have it, one way or another.</p>
<p><strong>There needs to be assessment.</strong></p>
<p>An assignment is a soft assessment to me - though like everyone I have terrible days when the thing just slips through my fingers like a snowball on the beach. A dissertation or end of module assignment is tougher, but tough and 'bad' in a certain way - like commitment to a triathlon. And a good analogy as working on and developing three issues at 2,000 words a pop is about right. And you won't get far if you leave training to the week before. It's a slow burn.</p>
<p><strong>The 'bad' has to be the written examination.</strong></p>
<p>They have to be hated and feared, and like learning lines for that school play, you have to get it right on the night (or day). And what do you do if you act? You have good lines to learn, you learn and rehearse your lines and you practice, and do a test run or two. The curtains going up is the equivalent of your turning the examination paper over. I feel the fear from a year ago - April 2012. I hadn't sat a written exam in 30 years. All my undergraduate and school-boy fears came back. I used rusty techniques that had last seen service during my first degree. Bad is good. You want to do everything not to feel like you are naked on stage - a dream we all have when faced with such an 'exposing' test? <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/wWqqYfaV0PTh72j4OhD1ldMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IvhCwe5Layc/UQtZGBhaShI/AAAAAAAAi3g/Q-hkvFUPdk8/s288/The%20ugly.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Ugly</strong></p>
<p>Shock 'em. Not scare the witless. Have up your sleeve some smart stuff. Whether an idea or the technology offer a creepy and certainly memorable surprise. Boring a student into making a fact or issue stick is like throwing mud at a brick wall - it'll stick, it'll coagulate and build up, but is easily washed away in a shower and destroyed in a storm. Use storytelling techniques perhaps, better still, follow the pattern of a ghost story. Scare them? I'm back on fear I guess. We humans are fearful of many things and will go out of our way to avoid, run away or confront our fears. As I said, the idea here isn't to lose your students, but to empathise with them, understand the ugly side of their learning experience then help them confront their worst fears. It is ugly having to tackle the parts of a subject that stink, but inevitably these are the blocks at the base of JENGA.</p>
<p>My primary colours for learning design, not red, blue and yellow, but good, bad and ugly. We'll have to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So can I apply it? And can I go back to bed now?</strong></p>
<p>Which leads me to another theme - we no longer simply bring work home with us, we take it to bed and sleep with it. If this pisses you off then let me introduce you to 'working with dreams'. If you are prepared to get up for an hour in the dead of night, or can flick on a light without invoking divorce then scribble stuff down to catalyse the thought in the morning. Can work wonders, can produce nonsense, can just be some things you need to put on the supermarket shopping list ... or another dream of being naked on the stage, not knowing your lines and needing the lo but all the exits are locked and the orchestra has stopped and you have to say something. <em>Which, courtesy of the wonders of the mind, has me in the front row of a performance of The Tempest at the University Theatre, Newcastle when I was 13 or 14. Caliban was naked, covered in mud and wearing a prosthetic erect penis.</em></p>
<p><strong>HORROR!</strong></p>
<p><em>P.S. And give me 20 minutes searching the Internet and I will be able to name the actor, date the show and possibly even find a picture. Perhaps you'd like to have a go. But before you do so, be very fearful of what the search terms you use might throw up. </em> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>P.P.S. I've given up (for now). It may have been David Suchet or Jim Carter. The production was in 1974 at the University Theatre.&nbsp;</em></p>]]></description>

              <title>My week 4 learning objectives and reflections (Sheila MacNeill)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7920</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7920</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Week 4 - Connect</p>
<p>Well after a good start with the webinar from  Diana introducing the planner tool, my week hasn't really progressed.  It's Tuesday afternoon and I'm going to try and spend some time with the  tool and also look at the work my fellow #oldsmooc-ers have contributed  already. As expected the tasks for this week are very explicit and well documented which is on the one hand great, but also slightly intimidating if you have fallen behind. However there is a lovely synergy this week about exploring the specifics of course design and planning as the Georgia Tech Coursera course on online learning had to fold - primarily it woud seem because of poor course design which I've blogged about.</p>

<p>So a bit of last day activity I joined the convergence session today (Wednesday 6 Feb)  which provided a useful overview to the week's activities. Starting with a nice overview and  analogy of PPC to a scientific journal - a place for community knowledge building and sharing, about making ideas explicit. It was also mentioned that patterns tool could be seen as akin to a  literature review ie a  good place to start to review and discover teaching patterns and practice.</p>

<p>The PPC team have found working with teachers that they do pick up the tool and concepts relatively quickly, so in one sense it is easy to use. However there was recognition that it isn't a "just in time" tool - and the fact that the output can't be automagically exported into a VLE is still a downfall that they are working on, and have an on-going relationship with LAMS. I wondered if maybe as well as working with teachers, team should work with VLE/learning technology teams too ,that might help to develop some integrations into VLEs.</p>

<p>Again I was impressed by openness of the team in terms of sharing their original design rationale, and now reflecting on the experience of running it.  Lots of issues about transient nature of MOOC participation came through the tweet chat. Dipping in and out key motivator for participating but it is hard to design for.  What are levels of expectations for course design teams? What can they just let go? Also from a more personal point of view, I think organising online team work can be quite challenging. I have my oldsmooc buddy and we did have a google hangout/chat on Sunday but neither of us really felt we were at the stage of being able to work with the planner in a meaningful way yet and we were both a bit unsure about how we would do it. However I have been impressed by fellow #oldsmooc-ers who have persevered and done just that. I have been wondering if this week and last should have maybe been a bit longer in order to do all the tasks, but I'm  not sure.  Hindsight is a great thing.  I have been time poor this week, and aslo because I am somewhat familiar with the planner tool, maybe subconciously I've felt that I can do more dipping out that dipping in this week.  It was good to get re-assurance that it would be easy to dip into next week even if you haven't done other weeks of the course too.  I've also been participating in the Edinburgh #edcmooc, and there is a huge cross-over in terms of concerns about technology, scale,participation, motivation and reward/recognition. </p> 

<p>So although I haven't followed the course activites this week it again has been really useful in my growing contextualisation of designing for and participating in MOOCs. </p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>@JeffWaistell sent me a tweet suggesting that learning design was even more messy, iterative, dynamic and political than the models and frameworks we are introducing in week 3 of the OLDSMOOC might suggest - and I didn't disagree. My view is that at the heart of our learning design practice is our view on what learning is for - and that is highly political.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff response was to ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"So learning design can = mind control? How to avoid? How to balance learning agenda by involving key stakeholders and views?"</strong></p>

For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.&rdquo; - Albert Einstein <br /><br />As we wrote in our <a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/blog/week3weekendround-up">weekend summary</a> (OLDS-MOOC week 3), we have been struck by the creative response to the tools we have offered up this week and levels of enjoyment some of you have expressed in using them. One of the messages that has come out loud and clear from our own research is that staff involved in the curriculum design process in institutional settings do not generally find the process very creative, and they feel that their ideas get tied down too early. We'd argue that from a learning design perspective, the balance and tension between creativity and precision is an important one. Where do you sit on this? Is creativity actually more important than precision? What is the relationship between precision and creativity?</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[Slim pickings so far in terms of records of my learning or reflections on this MOOC. S far, it's been too much just trying to keep up with the activit it's each week, and staying in contact with my superb project group.  

In week 2 we worked on scenarios and personas for our nascent project, guidance materials for DIY multimedia. For me, as I suspect for other people, this was an opportunity to convey what we hope to get of this project by ideating typical scenarios. That's what I think I'e done anyway.  I think, however, that its helped the group to work on something concrete and several ingesting issues have come up around the convergence between learning design and inclusive design of multimedia. 

Already behind on week 3, I'm trying to get to grips with some of the material to do with scenarios, before I get further behind with new material. In the true style of this MOOC, what I'm reading (http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/personas.html) was suggested by a team member. It's potentially an intensely useful tool for thinking about student moodle inductions and how these can be embedded further into the curriculum. Totally irrelevant to the issues at hand and possibly something to explore elsewhere. ]]></description>

              <title>Scenario for DIY MUltimedia Project Group</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7859</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7859</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[My drafted scenario, written partly as a brainstorming activity for the DIY MUltimedia project group. here, I've tried to bring to life some of my ideas for why I like this project, and how it could be relevant to my work.

Actors: Ellie is a lecturer in Sociology at a university. She teaches a core module on social theory to a large undergraduate course.

Goals: She wants to use video to explain and illustrate the theories she teaches on the course. These videos should briefly summarise the theory and then put it into context by creating and illustrating an example of the theory in practice. The videos should also prompt students to think about how this made- up example relates to the required reading each week.

Settings: Ellie imagines students using the videos at home, at the start of the course or during the week in between lectures and the seminars. She will create the videos over summer before the course starts in the autumn term.

Objects: Ellie expects students would use the videos outside of class times so they would need a device to playback the videos - laptop, PC or tablet etc. Ellie would need equipment to record and publish the pieces: a handheld camera or screen capture software and a webcam/USB microphone. She would need access to a podcasting service or a similar online service to store and host the videos.

Actions: Ellie has tried searching YouTube, TED and other resources for similar videos but has decided she needs to create her own because she needs the videos to be short, focussed and to link together. She begins writing the script of the first video.

Events: Ellie finishes the script. It is 3 pages long and will be about 10 minutes when read out. She then creates a powerpoint presentation intending to us a screen capture system to record herself talking over the powerpoint slides. She finds a free online service and begins to make the first recording. It is really difficult to get through more than a couple of minutes without making a mistake but the software only allows one-shot recording with no facility for editing.

Results: Ellie realises she will have to use a different process for creating the videos. She needs to be able to sequence several different shots into one piece. She also needs a learning design approach which will encourage students watching the video to ask themselves questions as they watch.

Your design: Ellie needs technical advice on how to create the videos, but also needs a pedagogic framework which can help her make these videos into learning resources.

2) Develop a narrative scenario/s
Introduce actors and goals, describe the settings, put the events in order...

Ellie is a sociology lecturer teaching a core module to first year undergraduates on social theory. She has found in previous years that students find the reading for the course challenging, much of the required reading for the course is dense theory and students have difficulty imagining how such theories might be used to explain “real life” examples.

She decides that for the coming year she would like to try using multimedia to illustrate and explain the concepts covered on the course. She happened across some videos of interviews with leading academics discussing economics and would love to find something similar for sociology. However, after a lot of searching online she can’t find anything completely relevant to the topics covered in her course. She wants these videos to help students understand the reading for the course, not to seem like extra reading in themselves, so it is important that the videos are focussed and relevant to the content of the course. She decides to create the video resources herself.
The course reading list, module guide and lectures are already prepared and will need little adaptation for the coming year. Ellie therefore decides she just needs to script the videos, prepare the made-up examples to illustrate each concept, and record them.

One week later she has scripted the first video and devised the example which will feature in it. She has also created a powerpoint presentation which she envisages will show in the video as she talks. She finds some free online software to use for screencapture and makes a first attempt at recording the video. It is very difficult; she finds it hard to talk without making mistakes and has to continually start over again. There is no facility for online editing. Also, Ellie feels that in this format the videos are more like recorded mini-lectures whereas she imagined them being more like short films almost a bit like documentaries. She wants to build in questions to the students watching the videos and isn’t sure how she can do this with the current set up she is using.

Ellie needs technical advice because she realises that each video may have to be made up of several different shots or takes and she’s unsure how she could achieve this. However, beyond technical advice she also thinks she needs some advice on scripting and structuring the videos because there is the potential for them to be less useful to students as she first hoped. She wants the videos to help bring the theories “to life” for students and encourage students to think about them in real-world examples.


3) Scrutinize your scenario & revise as necessary

What claims are you making: for your designs? about context? about the people involved? etc...

Do these hold up? Summarise your claims below particularly those that you feel need more support. 

Questions:
- The design needs to give practical advice on two fronts: what tools/equipment would be best for this project? How should these videos be scripted to avoid passive watching, and to encourage the kind of learning the lecturer wants to take place?
- Can an individual with little or no experience creating multimedia realistically achieve this project?
Is her knowledge of the subject matter enough or will she need to work with a colleague, perhaps an instructional designer or learning technologist?]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7796</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Every week I 'design' a programme of learning when I take, one after the other, four groups of swimmers at my local swimming club. </strong></p>
<p>Some 12 years of doing this, training and CPD means that I no longer prepare a programme in advance, rather I know the stroke and skills we are covering each week and have in my armoury a set of activities. These build from warm-up over 5-8 minutes into a variety of drills tailored to fixing problems with a stroke. The pattern whole-part-whole is used - to swim the stroke, spot problems, then put in a series of drills and exercises, typically involving only the legs or only the arms - as in 'part'. There are then advance 'whole swim' drills and any number of complementary fun activities. Diving or racing typically ends the session.</p>
<p>Often I draw on sets of images from 'The Swimming Drill Book' to show swimmers poolside what I want them to do - so a sequence of actions or a particular arm, body or leg position. Used in this way these sets of images can become like a set of cards that can be placed in whatever order I feel is appropriate as we go along.</p>
<p>Planning a programme of work for a squad is akin to creating a curriculum that runs from September through to the competitions season that runs through the Spring and Summer.</p>
<p><strong>Creating e-learning for corporate clients - compliance on health and safety, data protection, graduate induction and so on, might follow a remarkably similar pattern.</strong></p>
<p>The 'warm up' is an introduction, ideally something to grab their attention. Headliners on the banking crisis, a news piece on a data protection scandal, a criminal banged up (CPS induction) or a young person (actor) having an asthma attack. Like the swimming session these modules typically run for an hour, so 12 modules at five minutes each isn't unusual. There will be introductions to themes and ideas, following by activities to check learning or integrating an activity with fact finding.</p>
<p><strong>It isn't all online - learners might have to figure something out on paper and then return to the screen.</strong></p>
<p>It may also be personalised, so going into the system to generate something like a holiday request as per the instructions in the learning activity. Whilst the swimmer is observed and various skills checked off, in the e-learning experience the ticks relate to an activity successfully completed. This is not always linear, sometimes it is more exploratory, or can be done out of sequence, but the goal is to get everything done and demonstrate knowledge. At some stages a follow up set of questions will be issues to keep the information fresh.</p>
<p><strong>The outcome is primary - what are you trying to achieve.</strong></p>
<p>It is either state bluntly or apparent from the activities that day.</p>
<p><strong>GOAL </strong>- To ensure that all swimmers keep their hands in front of their shoulders when swimming competitive breaststroke.</p>
<p><strong>GOAL</strong> - To ensure that all graduate lawyers starting with the CPS can visualise a file as a defendant/law breaker - a person on whom all kinds of institutions and other people impact as their case comes to trial.</p>
<p>I have always used a communications industry brief to spec out the project and to help focus on the ideas that are required. On a single sheet of paper respond to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the problem?</li>
<li>Who are you speaking to?</li>
<li>What do you want to say?</li>
<li>How do you want them to respond to this?</li>
<li>What else do we need to know?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Swimming ideas come from formal courses, from colleagues, from resources online and books. You see something that works, so you give it a go. You show what appears to be an intractable problem with others and they offer a solution.</p>
<p>In e-learning the ideas are developed in a lengthy workshop - the client(s) and several team members strip down the creative brief, draw on the knowledge of an experience L&amp;D manager at the client end, may include a subject matter expert, but certainly includes a learning designer and project manager. Flip charts and post-it notes are used.</p>
<p>A number of creative problem solving or idea generating activities can also be used - moderating and leading techniques compiled, trialed and explained by VanGundy, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Marker pens on large sheets of paper - typically on sheets of A1 Flipchart paper - sometimes these are taped together. </strong></p>
<p>My personal preference is for wallpaper backing paper as the long strips mean that people around a table can all contribute. These sessions need to be carefully choreographed ... and at various points the outcomes stated, written down so that everyone can see and agreed.</p>
<p>Once done the Learning Designer takes it all away and compresses it into a form that can be shared digitally - typically a PowerPoint, with the warning that this should not imply a strict linear expression of the learning. Other programmes can be used, usually something built by the agency or a licensed commercial product.</p>
<p>Other learning experiences I have 'designed' - linear and interactive video to support facilitated learning, run to some 50. These followed a far less collaborative process of taking a brief, brainstorming ideas alone ... sometimes using an interactive tool called 'Ideafisher' then producing a synopsis, treatment and script. When other professionals come in to produce the learning the design stage is complete. For interactive learning the video is scripted as a number of components that are an integral part of the learning journey.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Week 3 Learning outcomes</p>

*Conceptualise the learning design process from different perspectives

*Apply some learning design resources, tools and methods to your design

*Critique a range of pedagogical approaches and the role that different technologies play

*Review, share and discuss the theoretical underpinnings, benefits and limitations of design representations across educational contexts

*Develop an innovative storyboard, learning activities and a structure for implementation

*Opportunity to gain the 3 Weeks and Resource Gatherer badges (tick)

<p><b>Sunday 27 Jan</b></p>
<p>I think these week clouds are becoming more and more like a confessional space for me. I am reminded of what I should be doing and the learning objectives of the week, and then reconciling that with what I am actually doing/ have done.</p>

<p>I had a bit of time of Thursday so after a look at the overall structure for the week started with the toolkit.  I'm very fortunate that I have been able to follow the development of the OULDI and Viewpoints projects so am familiar with them.  The toolkit was useful in terms of just seeing a representation of a small number of tools/resources/activities in the one place. I also added a couple of resources and updated one (the CogenT learning outcomes tool).  Getting the badge was an added bit of fun, and as I said on twitter weirdly motivating</p>

<p>Of course, being me got distracted again by the "list" layout and the potential for some alternative representations, having thrown down the gauntlet of data challenges in the previous 2 weeks, there was demand for more:)  This week was a bit simpler as I think there just needs some tweaking of the list view which should be relatively simple as there is a simple (manual) categorization.  The storify (see link) captures some of the conversation.</p>

<p>Now off to trying and contribute to at least one discussion, try and think a bit more about my design. Ironically I don't think this week I'm going to be able to do much with my team, I think it will be more of an individual effort, but that's OK</p>

<p>#oldsmooc forgive me, it's been 3 days since my last entry into this cloud.  I have spectacularly failed to move forward from Sunday.  However in my defence as I said before I am familar with quite a few of the tools already. I have had a look at the discussion and sharing spaces and the responses just seem to confirm the appeal of visual design aids such as the card sort activity.  I was also pleasantly pleased that a couple of the additions (the WIDE design template and the Widgat tool) I'd put into the toolbox were commented on, and most impressively used by a team. (http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7785).  I've been able to share this with the team at Teesside who developed the tool and they have now joined cloudworks and invited the team to an event they are running at the end of Feb.  I've also made my first contribution to discussion forums.</p>
 
<p> My response to the feedback questions:
<br> What three words describe this week's activities?: practical, focused, challenging</br> 
<br>What did you like about this week?: I was really looking forward to this week as it was more focused, however due to other "stuff" I haven't had the time I'd like to spend on it. But I did like getting the resource gather badge:-) and also a sense of helping others on the course as they used one of the tools I'd shared.</br>
<br>What could be improved? I am wondering if there was just a bit too much to do in one week?  Ironically this is the first week I've not really had much contact with my team. Or maybe I'm just lazy.</br>

<p> Despite not moving actually moving my design idea forward the way the design of the week encouraged, I found that the time I have been able to spend on this has  really helped me to think about what how the resources particularly the dream bazaar and the toolkit could be used in a short, focused webquest to dicover tools and design ideas.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Less about DIY Multimedia and more reflections on the contextualisation of OLD</p>
<p>Learning and isolation are poor partners. Focus on the learner context enhances the process of OLD through revealing motivations as well as potential barriers. Context can reveal attention hot spots e.g. ease of access to materials, availability of support, the loneliness of the long distance online learner, guidance on specific design criteria e.g. the variety of activities, collaboration with peers and tutors, interaction with content, formative and diagnostic assessment opportunities etc. Context assists the designer make appropriate choices, in particular providing mechanisms for customising learning to suit individual preference e.g. providing information in alternative formats. All this runs in parallel to theoretical approaches to LD for example constructive alignment (Biggs and Tang, 2011).</p>
<p>Scenarios,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/personas.html" target="_blank">Personas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/representations-and-languages/force-map" target="_blank">Force Maps</a>&nbsp;are useful approaches to OLD. Context can be presented in textual formats but also displayed through mind mapping or diagrams where a visual approach can offer an effective overview of key issues. Constructing context encourages sharing practice; drawing on own experiences and incorporating those of colleagues to bring key issues together. Doing this online rather than round a table can in itself reveal areas of online learning design which need attention.</p>
<p>For my own practice inclusion is a key concern. Without attention to access, the application of theory to practice becomes diluted. Effective OLD takes into account the diversity of ways people access learning resources and opportunities, this is particularly important where there are no face to face clues or opportunities for discussion. Identifying potential barriers to access and participation are key to retention and success.</p>
<p>In the future I will be looking to building a collection of contrasting scenarios for future reference and experiment with alternative ways of presenting these e.g. diagrammatically.</p>

In part this may reflect different approaches to teaching and different institutional cultures. Spend 10 minutes thinking about the last time you needed to design a learning experience (for other learners or for yourself) and post your thoughts on this Cloud (below), or on your blog, via twitter (#oldsmooc_w3), or on the thread on Google Groups called <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/olds-mooc-open/sdXOas6KEoA">Different approaches to design</a>.

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7674</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only started by doing the rough outline to my scenario as I still have to think about the actual design. This is the hardest part as I have to start from scratch. May ideas are floating about, but they have to be realistic within the context in which it is intended. As I am using a very real situation, this may prove to be more of a challenge than I have bargained for, but I am going to try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The large number of students and the unreliable internet&nbsp;network are the main problems to try to overcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /> <strong>1) Brainstorm components of your scenario</strong></p>
<hr size="2" />
<p><br /> <strong>Actors: </strong>Eve, 48, a lecturer in English. She is frustrated because her expertise is not utilized fully in her workplace. She is particularly eager to develop online learning.</p>
<p>Ahmed, 49, with a Moroccan/Scandinavian background, is Senior Manager for Engineering programme at the college. He is not happy with his employment terms and conditions and is considering returning to Europe after the current academic year. He wants to improve the level of English among the engineering students.</p>
<p>Khalil, 55, Head of the engineering Department at the college. He is mainly interested in that students complete their studies well, including their written projects. His English proficiency is limited.</p>
<p>Caroline, 34, from the Philippines, is a lecturer in the Engineering Department. She was hired at the beginning of the current academic year and is considered the star in the department by Ahmed, who hired her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Goals</strong>: Eve wants to improve her job satisfaction by getting involved with curriculum development involving IT, and reduce her teaching duty.</p>
<p>Ahmed wants to improve the standards of engineering students&rsquo; English proficiency to enable them to produce better written work.</p>
<p>Khalil wants the engineering students to be assisted with their English writing for engineering assignments.</p>
<p>Caroline wants her students to be able to complete assignments better, especially by improving their writing and academic skills in English.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Settings:</strong><em> </em>The action happens in a Higher College of Education in Oman. The Engineering programme at this college is the only one of its kind offered in the country. There are over 120 students enrolled in the programme; their first language is Arabic. None of their teachers are native English speakers, but from Arabic countries, India and the Philippines, some with fairly limited English proficiency. All teaching is supposed to be conducted in English, all course material is in English and all the work by students must be presented in English.</p>
<p>The college has an LMS (Blackboard), computer suites, wireless connections throughout the campus, but the network is extremely unreliable, as internet connections are often disrupted on a daily basis. Most students have smartphones with internet connections, and many have their own computers, but they do not bring them to college regularly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><br /> <strong>Objects:</strong><em> </em>computers, mobile phones, overhead projector, webcam<br /> <br /> <strong>Actions: </strong>Eve has a chat to Ahmed one day and he tells her that not only he but also the Dean is concerned about the poor standard of English. Ahmed suggests that he will talk to the Dean about developing a support programme of English for the engineering students and that Eve should be involved. To be able to support the number of students involved Eve suggests a blended learning approach.<em> </em><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Events:</strong><em> </em>Both the Dean and the Head of Engineering must be convinced that a process is necessary to put in place, not just a &lsquo;quick fix&rsquo; where English lecturers proofread work by engineering students and corrected. A questionnaire will be prepared to ask both lecturers and students in the Engineering department to establish perceived difficulties, needs and possible solutions. A suggested strategy will be outlined and then discussed with all concerned. A pilot project will be implemented before rolling out on a larger scale. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Results: </strong>The desired result is that students improve their subject-specific English proficiency, and that they acquire writing skills to be able to write assignments, but also that they learn how to do it, so that they can also do it in their future workplace.</p>
<p>Eve will hopefully have more job satisfaction. Students will achieve course requirements better.<br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>Your design: </strong>The design will be an integral part of engineering studies. It aims to expand subject-specific vocabulary, academic writing skills, especially for writing reports, description of processes relating to engineering.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

              <title>Learning Design for Learning Design (HE): Clare&#39;s Scenario #3</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7652</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7652</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a start on another potential scenario/persona involving a new online course developer called "Joan". Note that this is based on the ideal scenario!&nbsp;:</p>
<p>Joan (40) lives in Dublin. She is a busy mother-of-two who has recently achieved a Computer Science doctorate and is doing a small amount of part-time lecturing. Her reputation as an enthusiastic &amp; impressive lecturer precedes her so she has been approached to develop online learning materials for an online programme which has been running at her institution for some years. She knows there&rsquo;s been a lot going on in educational technology recently but she hasn&rsquo;t had time to investigate as much as she would like. She figures that becoming an online course developer would be an opportunity to learn more about online learning and might help advance her career. Truth be told, she is also pleased at the prospect of earning some extra money which will help pay off some of the debt incurred during her studies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After she has signed the contract, Joan shortly receives an email from Patricia, the programme&rsquo;s instructional designer, pointing her to a series of tutorials that introduce important Instructional Design theories and practices. She is asked to complete these tutorials &amp; associated exercises before a forthcoming Design &amp; Development workshop. Being very diligent and motivated, Joan does exactly as requested! As she digests these tutorials, she realises that there&rsquo;s more to online learning than she originally thought...for example, she realises that she didn&rsquo;t really know what instructional design was about, she hadn&rsquo;t really thought about the importance of promoting learner interaction online, and she had no idea so many new free tools were emerging that could be applied in education. This is bigger than she thought and she thinks she will have to tightly manage her time to meet the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, at a Design &amp; Development workshop, Joan participates in a lively discussion on potential tools &amp; technologies for online learning. She then works alongside a fellow online course developer, Peter, on a design-related activity specially created for new eLearning designers. During this activity, she explores design visualization tools that are new to her and then begins to sketch out an initial design incorporating a variety of instructional media. She shares this draft design with her developer colleagues and the other members of the project team, seeking feedback and suggestions for improvement which she subsequently considers and implements. The resulting storyboard provides a blueprint for a design that Joan refines further over the weeks ahead, as time allows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Actors: Joan is a busy mother-of-two who has recently achieved a Computer Science doctorate and is currently working as a part-time lecturer. Her reputation as an enthusiastic lecturer precedes her so she has been approached to develop learning materials for an online Master&rsquo;s programme which has been running at her institution for some years. She has just signed a contract to develop her first online module and is excited at the prospect of what she will learn. Although she has never developed learning for online delivery previously, she is willing to give it a go and is ready to start work in a month&rsquo;s time. The extra stipend she will receive for performing this work is also attractive in the current financial climate.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->For the duration of the project, Joan will work with a project team including a part-time instructional designer who will provide feedback on drafts and a senior academic who will advise on required content and provide additional subject matter expertise.</div>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7619</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7619</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h3>Scenario</h3>
<p>Learners have paid $30 and are told they will take apart a desktop computer, learn what each part does, then put the computer back together again. They get to keep their computer.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Setting</h4>
<p>Learning activity is in the "Build Room" at Free Geek Twin Cities in MPLS, MN. USA on a Saturday morning at 10 am.</p>
<h4>Actors</h4>
<p>There will be at least one facilitator present who is a volunteer and might not have teaching experience. Learners have varied skills and handicaps/challenges. Challenges we've seen include the blind, quadriplegic, immature 10 yr old, autism sprectrum/aspergers, drug addicted felons/thief, having allergic reaction to mold, language deficit non-english speaking,attention deficit&nbsp;hyperactivity&nbsp;disorder, and a Mulslim female reluctant to interact with males.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Aims</h4>
<p>Free Geek Twin Cities mission is to recycle or reuse unwanted computers and to help reduce the digital divide by providing learnig experiences that allow participants to be more digitally literate. This courses goal is that learners will understand their computer well enough to fix it when it does not seem to work.</p>
<h4>Objects</h4>
<p>The learning environment, a computer, monitor, mouse, keyboard, screwdrivers, example parts (CPUs, RAM, etc.), a working computer with internet access, a facilitator, and a learning activity instruction booklet (also available via a website).</p>
<h4>Action</h4>
<ul>
<li>connect a mouse, keyboard, and monitor to a desktop computer</li>
<li>connect the computer to a power source and turn it on</li>
<li>disassemble the computer into its component parts and put it back together again</li>
<li>be able to name the parts of the computer and what they do</li>
<li>be able to install an operating system &#40;OS: Linux Xubuntu&#41; from an install CD</li>
<li>be able to update, personalize, customise, and add extras to their OS</li>
</ul>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>The participant will have their own computer for a minimal cost. The learner will be more self confident in using their desktop computer and if it doesn't work, may be able to fix it.</p>]]></description>

              <title>My week 2 learning objectives and reflections (Sheila MacNeill)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7500</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7500</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>So list of the "official" objectives and outcomes</p>
<p>From the week 2 overview page:</p>
<p>Design Outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore and represent context in relation to your design challenge.</li>
<li>Communicate and receive feedback on your analysis of context for your design challenge.</li>
<li>Gain insights into your design challenge by applying one or more contextual learning design approaches</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning Outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review & revise your understanding of learner context and it's relevance to learning design.</li>
<li>Increase your awareness of approaches to context for learning design.</li>
<li>Evaluate the relevance of contextual approaches to your own learning design practice.</li>
<li>Plan further learning about contextual approaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well first few days have been distracted by thinking about potential of cloudworks and visualistaion to make it a more useful and contextualised learning space (more on blog post of 18 January)</p>
<p>Looked at context slide presentations - and lots of the quotes there are just confirming my hunch that cloudworks itself coud provide a really useful context for learning - although in its current state, and with the other techs/systems/spaces being used in this course I can't help feeling that lots of learning is taking place "despite" the context of the overall implementation of the learning design.</p>
<p>Have arranged for another online meeting with my team for Sunday. </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>

<p>Preparing for team meet up  on Sunday 20th, and looking at persona cards, and watching the #øldsmooc team videos from their planning day, was reminded of the Widgat project. Although primarily concerned with buillding widgets they have develope a nice design template http://arc.tees.ac.uk/WIDE/Widget-Learning-Design-Template.ashx  </p>

<p>Wednesday 23rd. So managed to have a quick chat with Clare on Sunday (still having issues with google hangouts on my ipad). We both agreed that even virtual face to face contact was really re-assuring. We agreed to develop a persona/scenario each - Clare did a far more comprehensive job than me and I really enjoyed reading her scenario.  During our chat we were talking about guilt, time pressures etc and I mentioned that I had been half thinking about writing a "blaggers guid to mooc-ing", and in true distraction from doing the real course work fashion I wrote "how to succeed at Mooc-ing without really trying" (http://blogs.cetis.ac.uk/sheilamacneill/2013/01/20/how-to-succeed-at-mooc-ing-without-really-trying/).  I was slightly nervous about posting this on my work blog, but it has had a very postive reaction and hopefully brough a bit of much needed humour to things.</p>

<p>It's always difficult to "plan fun" -particularly on-line but I think in moocs when there is so much going on and everyone is feeling a bit overwhelmed, a bit of fun and "let's not take it all so seriously" is needed.</p>

<p>I've found the daily summaries particularly useful this week as I just haven't spend enough time in any of the oldsmooc spaces this week.  I'm not quite sure how Josh has had time to do anything this week - he's even left comments on my clouds.  So the whole issue of staff time for MOOCs has been on my mind too in terms of mainstreaming of MOOCs,  in terms of design of activities, faciliation and management strategies.  Massive commitment seems to be key here.</p>

<p>I took part in the weekly convergence session (unfortunately due to work commitments could only make it for half an hour). Again it was great to see some fellow students and hear their points of views and see their work.   Again was impressed by the honesty and openness of the course team in the  part of the converstation about context, and the impact of design context and just how hard it is to design for "massive" - you're never going to get all the personas.</p>

<p>I started the week thinking about my personal context/learning space, and as the week draws to a close, I'm still pondering. In terms of MOOCs maybe getting students more comfortable with their learning context more important than "traditional" online socialising activities. I'm thinking of Gilly Salmon's five stage model - perhaps the online socialisation part of that needs extended to have much more emphasis on contextualising multiple learning spaces. Something I hope to explore more in the 7c's next week.</p>

<p> So I probably not stuck exactly to the over-arching plan for the week, but I'm quite comfortable with what I have been able to do.  Next week I'm going to make a concerted effort to engage in my 'scary spaces' - google discusion groups:-)</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The situation</strong></p>
<p>I've recently taken on the role of coordinating and leading&nbsp;learning and teaching support teams that are focused on enhancing faculty colleagues' capacity to adopt a more genuinely online model of teaching and learning, where students are engaged in meaningful activities online as well as the usual downloading, reading and forum contributions.</p>
<p><strong>My dream</strong></p>
<p>That the majority of my faculty colleagues feel comfortable and capable to design meaningful student experiences online.</p>
<p><strong>Bringing about that change</strong></p>
<p>I think our support model is a step in the right the direction. Our support teams include learning designers, and digital media and technical support staff, which brings the power of the team to bear. Our challenge is to quickly find and generate good practice models so our faculty colleagues can see what good practice looks like.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Lesley&#39;s learning journey, 15th January 2013</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7389</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7389</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Today I:</p>
<ol>
<li>forgot there was a synchronous event so didn't attend (wouldn't have been able to anyway, as a last mnute lunch invitation came up and it would have been rude to take my tablet with me)</li>
<li>discovered Cloudworks' formatting is editable on my laptop - I've been tending to use my tablet to write reflections. So, back to reformatting earlier clouds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both useful lessons; I should have a) made a note of the event rather than muttering to myself about 'need more notice than this' and b) checked out the affordances offered by tablet and laptop sooner than this rather than muttering, 'bah, can't format, what use is that...'</p>
<p><strong>Note to self</strong>: strive to be a 'glass half full' person.</p>
<p>And now, some thoughts about learning design... I need to relate these to the MOOC experience, I feel, but that's for another day, another musing. For now, some thoughts on experiences that have fed into my view of successful learning design over the years... I find it helpful to include examples as they remind me of why I've come to certain conclusions. You may prefer to do it another way, but please bear with...</p>
<p>What have I learned about learning design so far? What do I think it is? Well, to answer the second question first, I think this has been answered quite eloquently elsewhere, particularly in the post that says teachers do it all the time, the implication being that there isn't a need to formalise it. And I suppose that leads me to the question about whether learning design can be 'taught' formulaicly? Isn't there a possibility that we could end up with inflexible templates? Or even templates that are faintly flexible but all have the same aftertaste? Is that what we want? Brings me back to my question about individuality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been pondering on what it was about the pedagogy of teacher I remember that made them memorable. It seems that the teacher I remember best - for the right reasons - was the one who, if a child asked a question such as, 'How long is a piece of string?' would encourage them to find out for themselves. &nbsp;She'd give us the tools, suggest how we might get started and then stand back, ready to provide support if we couldn't take it further ourselves. She introduced us to 'learning how to learn', not popular in the very early 1960s! So, for me, to some extent, learning design is giving learners the tools - artefacts, approaches, a spirit of enquiry and scaffolding them as they develop as learners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that takes me to something a friend of mine once said in a keynote. She knew, she said, that she'd succeeded in creating a successful learning experience when students complained not about the technology, not about the lack of navigation aids, not about the lack of support; instead, they'd say, 'It's all very well, but we're doing all the work What are&nbsp;<strong>you</strong> doing?'</p>
<p>Learners thought they were doing everything themselves because they couldn't see the huge amount of work that had gone into making this experience seamless; invisible scaffolding and ghostlike support, leaving them to develop in the directions that suited their learning goals, whether self-defined if they were aware of things they wanted to achieve of 'guided' if they weren't.</p>
<p>I like that view of learning and learning design. I strive towards it. I'm not there yet, but I'm getting there, I think.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Darren Gash: My Dream: Learning Design Project Proposal: Redesign of a level 6 mentorship module for blended and online delivery</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7307</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7307</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h1>Darren Gash: Redesign of a level 6 mentorship module for blended and online delivery&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>Your situation</h2>
<p>The Mentorship module is a 15 credit level 6 module accredited by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), and run by Surrey University&rsquo;s Health and Social Care faculty. The module focuses on mentoring and the enhancement of coaching, assessment and facilitation skills, through a &ldquo;reflective and supportive approach&rdquo;. Out of the 150 notional learning, there are 30 taught hours over 5 days, 30 hours practice learning activities and 90 self-directed study/learning. The module runs over a period of 16 weeks, with approximately 60 students per intake and 10 cohorts per year</p>
<p>The VLE has previously been used to distribute course materials. Since Surrey moved over to a new VLE in 2012 (from WebCT to Desire2Learn) materials have not been transferred across and are currently distributed by email.</p>
<p>The programme leaders for the module are keen to transfer the module content across to the new VLE and to develop the module for SurreyLearn to make better use of the technology on offer. This would be initially as a blended offering to be offered from June 2013 onwards, however they would also like to offer a fully online option for students in the future.</p>
<h2>The Change you would like to see (challenge)</h2>
<p>For me the primary challenge is to redesign the module so that it is blended in the truest sense of the word, i.e. a combination of seamlessly integrated face to face and online activities aligned with the module outcomes. The programme leaders&rsquo; initial aim was to simply transfer the course materials across to the new VLE, i.e. use it as a repository for storing materials to support face to face activities only. Adopting a more blended approach is vital as I believe this will be easier to then offer a fully online option that is comparable in terms of experience and outcomes to the blended option, as well as the NMC who will need to validate the online version.</p>
<h2>How you might go about bringing that change</h2>
<p>What I first need to do is get a more detailed picture of the current offering, e.g. the type of students doing the course (I will ask the programme leaders to provide a couple of user case scenarios), the pedagogical approaches used to deliver course, what works, what doesn&rsquo;t work, areas they would like to change or improve in particular.&nbsp; In terms of technology, Desire2Learn has the usual VLE type tools that can be used to support learning, including forums, blogs and an e-portfolio.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m an adult literacy tutor and I live on the West Coast of Ireland. I'm also a very recent graduate of St. Angela's College, Sligo where I completed an M.A. awarded by NUI Galway in Technology, Learning, Innovation and Change.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in digital literaciesand social learning, which ideally I'd like to teach online in a Higher Education or professional development context. For that reason I'm developing my skills and knowledge in relation to online pedagogy and instructional design; that's why I&rsquo;m glad to be here taking part in OLDS MOOC "Learning Design for a 21st Century Curriculum"</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[Here I will post regular reflections on how this is going for me. Currently I'm a little lost but hope that feeling disappear soon!

I work in academic development and regularly assist teaching staff with learning design. I've just started a project to teach bookkeeping through a storytelling approach and we have just finished filming the ten videos that will tell the stories. My son, a film maker, is currently making them for me and I can't wait to see the finished product! I will then design all the support structures to go with those films and PebblePad is my chosen place for student reflections and recording of activities this will be accompanied by an iBook made using iBook Author and embedded into iTunesU. I'm hoping that's not too many tools for students as I feel a bit lost with all these different tools; I guess this will help me think through strategies to alleviate these problems. ]]></description>

Grammar teachers in my department are still using materials and textbooks that are 20 years old, and our deptment just gave up 20 hours of computer lab time because the grammar teachers admitted to not using the labs for the grammar curriculum. I would like to branch out on my own and develop an online learning course that focuses on grammar for academic writing and presentation skills for learners who need to move beyond conversational English and email and basic anecdote composition skills.<br /></td>

              <title>Daniel Staemmler: My dream: Design a webinar on how to design an engaging webinar</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7197</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7197</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>My situation:</strong></p>
<p>Most of our online education happens by using webinars which are held at a certain time live. The lecturer/ professor sits in front of his computer with the webcam on and presents his PPT-slides while the students are watching. Our students are professionals working during daytime and taking part after work in the lectures. For now we are using Adobe Connect as a virtual classroom platform. Most of the lecturers are busy with their regular day to day jobs and don't have much time to think about the difference of presenting in&nbsp; an online environment to a regular f2f classroom setting. Most live sessions last 90 minutes and the PPt slides are being posted on our internal student website. There also is a task posted for the students to recap the live-session and think about what they learned.</p>
<p><strong>The change I would like to see:</strong></p>
<p>I would like the webinars, which are pretty long with 90 minutes length to be more engaging and interactive for the students. Hereby needs to be taken into consideration that the students can only chat with the lecturer and maybe use other functions of the virtual classroom software. the challenge is that the students don't have the option for now to use audio and/ or video to converse with each other nor with the lecturer.<br />I also would like to see that lecturers are being briefed accordingly and take the time to consider the options the software offers and others to keep the students engaged.</p>
<p><strong>How I might tackle this to bring the change:</strong></p>
<p>Develop a curriculum for lecturers/ techers/ professors that shows them what has to be taken into consideration delivering a presentation as a webinar. Also familiarizing them with the options available that the software has they are using. More so, to keep the outcome of this proposed project generic, giving them some pointers on how to keep students engaged and incorporate them during a 90 minute presentation.</p>
<p><em><strong>I hope that some of you are interested in working together with on this project. To state your interest please leave a comment below. </strong></em></p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm an educational technologist at City University London and this is my second MOOC. I heard about the course on Twitter and there seemed to be a real buzz around it, plus the topic of learning design is something I've dabbled in recently, so it seemed like good timing to get involved in this course and meet some like-minded people.</p>
<p>My main (work) research interests right now are in learning spaces, lecture capture, electronic feedback and constructively aligned assessment. At work I'm particularly interested in engaging academic staff in the use of multimedia e.g. video, podcasting.</p>
<p>What I really want to get out of the OLDS MOOC is the experience of taking part in a collaborative, constructivist MOOC. I'm here to learn, but it's the format and setup of the course that really attracted me. </p>
<p>See you out there!</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>OK so for week 1 I aim to:</p>
<p>Complete the tasks as outlined (http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course/week-1)</p>
<p>So set up cloudspace/reflective journal - tick</p>
<p>join the google discussion group and introduce myself - tick</p>
<p>create/share/review "dream learning design" - tick ( and luckily found very quickly another two participants who are thinking of much the same idea as me)</p>
<p>team up</p>
<p>as of Sunday this seems to be happening</p>
<p>** 16 Jan update**</p>
<p>have managed to team up with Helen and Claire (despite my home broadband chucking me out of our google hang out) see http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6981</p>
<p>brainstorm - not quite managed to get to grips/ find time to engage with the design mind map.</p>
<p>reflect - have posted some early reflections on my blog (see link below).&nbsp; Overall first week has been quite chaotic, but I think things will settle down a bit more now.&nbsp; I feel that the teaming up aspect was slightly easier as I already know a few people taking the course so one less hurdle to overcome.&nbsp; I've also been impressed by the "openness" of the the team, particularly Yishay, Simon and Peter who have been very candid about the difference between the designing of the course and the "messiness" of the reality of it when in is running. I didn't mange to get to the google hang out yesterday but listened to most of it today. I have also been slightly distracted by the potential for representing cloudworks in different ways ( as outlined in my post) and the potential of SNA techniques for visualising cloudscapes as shared learning spaces/communities.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <title>My dream learning design project: practical learning design for PGCert/ peopl interested in trying out LD tools</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6990</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6990</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I would like to design a short module (or perhaps series of short sessions) which provided some scaffolding for PGCert in Academic Studies (or similar) to combine the theory of course design with some more practical/pragmatic experience of using some of the learning design tools which are now availalbe e.g. LAMS, LDSE. This would hopefully encourage students to take their ideas and actually use (and share them). It would also be useful as a stand alone resource for anyone with a spare half hour or so.</p>
<p>Outline of exisiting course outline:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Course (re)Design module:</p>
<p>Aim: to&nbsp; provide participants with the necessary educational understanding and pracitcal skills to desing an effective coures in their discipline.</p>
<p>Objectives: course particpants will:</p>
<ul>
<li>explore the thinking underpinnng teaching, learning and assessment with your discipline including drivers and opporuntities</li>
<li>Critically evaluate an existing design&nbsp; in relation to current educational ideas drawn from research and practice</li>
<li>Design or re-design a course to effectively meet the needs of learners and to satisfy disciplinary and institutional requirements</li>
<li>Reflect on the quality and effectiveness of your (re)desing from both an educational and pragmatic perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assisgnments - 3 x written submissions ( 1 x 500 word outline, 1x 1500 essay word design and reflection on design, 1x 1500 essay design of learning task and crical reflection on its educational potential.</p>]]></description>

My learning goals for this week:

- To learn more about the design of a MOOC - this Mooc
- Learn about the tools used
- Structure my thoughts about Learning Design (as I have been very much stuck with the IMS LD version of it).]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>In starting to write out ideas about Learning Design / Course Design that stem from practice and principles across a number of years, I turned to blogging and imaging last year.  These, then, are the starting places from which I'll work outward across the OLDS MOOC:</p>
<p>Thinking about multicultural/inclusive learning and teaching - which I call MILT: (1) The start of a Learning & Teaching Philosophy statement in a PechaKucha-like format; still a work-in-process, the images and initial statments in the Notes field have been finalized, while the notes accompanying each slide are in active editing phase: http://www.slideshare.net/alexa032/multiculturalinclusive-learning-teaching-philosophy.  And (2) a blog post where I set out a set of initial ideas for a group of PGcert students working through a module on technology and diversity in higher educaiton teaching - http://morelearning4morestudents.com/2012/11/04/diversity-and-inclusion-with-usalford-altsep12-in-mind/</p>
<p>Finally, initial posts about course design / learning design, what these encompass in terms of frameworks and practices: http://uminntilt.wordpress.com/?s=backward.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Teacher Inquiry into Student Learning (TISL) in an Upper Secondary School in Norway</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>by Cecilie Hansen and Barbara Wasson</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This position papers presents research that we are carrying out on the use of a teacher inquiry into student learning (TISL) method developed in the EU Next-TELL<br />project. As a first step in this research we carried out a focus group study with the<br />aim to discern teachers&rsquo; current practices in understanding their students&rsquo; learning at<br />an upper secondary school in Bergen, Norway. We found the focus group method<br />and the TISL method (reference needed from Brock), together, produced a rich<br />understanding of current practice and identified ways in which tools being developed<br />in the Next-TELL project can be used to support their TISL work. Thus we think this<br />combination could be an interesting approach to provide input to learning design<br />(LD). Figure 1 gives a short portrait of the study. Then a short description of the<br />study and our findings is given.</p>
<p><br />Study format: Three focus groups; one with TESL teachers and two with STEM teachers.</p>
<p>Aims: (1) Analysis: To know more about how teachers investigate student learning in order to develop and changetheir teaching. (2) Development: Generating ideas on how to implement the TISL Method at a Norwegian school</p>
<p><br />Output: (1) 3 models on how teachers collect, document, analyse, share data on student learning for professional development. (2) Knowledge on how Norwegian teachers investigate student learning in order to develop and change their<br />teaching.</p>
<p><br />Country: Norway</p>
<p>School type: Upper Secondary School</p>
<p>Participants: 10 teachers, 2 researchers</p>
<p>A focus group (Morgan 2010, Malterud, 2012) study of how 10 teachers reflect on<br />different aspects of teacher inquiry into student learning (TISL) was carried out at an<br />Upper Secondary School in Bergen, Norway. The teachers were divided into three<br />focus groups, based on their teaching subject - Science (STEM) or English (English).<br />The session began with a presentation of the idea of research on own teaching<br />practice and a description of the four stages of the TISL method developed in Next-<br />Tell. The four stages comprise: collecting data; analysing data; sharing data; and,<br />further developing teaching and assessment based on data.<br />After the presentation the teachers were presented a series of 8 questions, one at a<br />time, related to TISL and were asked to discuss, within their group, each question for<br />5 minutes. These questions related to the TISL method are:<br />1. Do you collect data on student learning? Why (not), and how?<br />2. Do you analyse data on student learning? Why (not), and how?<br />3. Do you share data on student learning? Why (not), and how?<br />4. What do you do with collected, analysed and shared data? Why (not), and<br />how?<br />5. How do you further develop teaching based on collected, analysed and<br />shared data? Why (not), and how?<br />6. How do you document the collected, analysed and shared data? Why (not),<br />and how?<br />7. Is technology used to document, analyse and share data? Why (not), and<br />how?<br />8. Is modelling used to plan teaching? Why (not), and how?<br />After the last question the teachers were asked to draw a model of their teaching<br />inquiry based on their discussion.<br />During the focus group a number of data collection methods were employed<br />including observation, notes, digital sound recordings and teachers modeling.<br />Analysis of the data shows that the teachers do collect and share data in order for<br />them to develop teaching practices, exchange experience, and to help students<br />develop. However, they admit that they do not document these changes in a unified,<br />systematic and structured way. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a shared<br />understanding or a common method for collecting, sharing and using data on student<br />learning for further professional development of the teacher. Assessment data and<br />observations are used to adapt teaching to the group of students. By doing so they<br />further develop and make their teaching their own way, however, as each class is<br />different. Sharing of teaching methods happens though the learning management<br />system, but this kind of sharing it is not in a unified structure. In the discussions, the<br />teachers were also unsure if and how they collected data and tied this to teaching<br />situations as to what ideas that worked and the results of those ideas.<br />The teachers further discussed how professional development not only is based on<br />analysing and sharing data from students' learning, but is also a tool for teachers to<br />adapt the teaching to the different the groups of students. However, there does not<br />seem to be a consistent practice on how to the collect, analyse and use data on<br />student learning in order to systematically change practice. One of the teachers<br />explained how he believed that teachers should become much better at reflecting on<br />their own teaching and to use assessment results more in the sense of how to<br />change teaching practices. Use and collecting of data from student assessment,<br />connecting it to best practice is very unstructured. There is little analysis of their own<br />teaching, based on data on student learning, and analysing best practice. Teachers<br />should become much better at reflecting on their own teaching and to use<br />assessment results more in the sense of how to change teaching practices. There is<br />little focus, and a long way to go when organising student data in relation to what<br />knowledge one is interested in using for further development of teaching. Use and<br />collecting of data from student assessment and connecting it to best practice is, at<br />present, very unstructured.<br />References<br />Bloor M, Frankland J, Thomas M and Robson K (2001).

              <title>REFLECTIONS ON DEVELOPING A TOOL FOR CREATING VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS OF LEARNING DESIGNS </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6635</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Over the past four years we have been developing CompendiumLD, a software tool for designing learning activities using a flexible visual interface. It has been developed as a tool to support lecturers, teachers and others involved in education to help them articulate their ideas and map out a design or learning sequence. CompendiumLD is a specialised version of Compendium, a tool for managing connections between information and ideas, which has been applied in many domains including the mapping of discussions and arguments. As most of the core knowledge mapping facilities provided by Compendium are included within CompendiumLD, it can be used for learning design, and&nbsp; applied it to other information mapping and modelling problems. Evidence gathered since CompendiumLD&rsquo;s first release has shown the many conditions in which it is likely to be applied and appreciated by users. It appears that the need for visualising learning designs may continue to grow given we have found that over half of staff now agree that it is becoming harder to understand how all the components of planned learning and teaching fit together. Furthermore, the use of technology is making the process of creating courses more complex. We explore these challenges and conclude with some reflections on the developments in visual representation needed to further facilitate the modelling of today and tomorrow&rsquo;s complex learning situations.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Towards a map of existing representations for learning design </title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>by Pozzi F., Persico D.,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designing a learning activity (whose granularity may vary: it can be a small unit, a course module or a whole &nbsp;course) is one of the most crucial activity a teacher is required to do. Representing the product of the design process, that is the &ldquo;design&rdquo;, basically responds to the need of <em>communicating</em> the design to &lsquo;others&rsquo;; where &lsquo;others&rsquo; may be: students, who need to be informed about what they are supposed to do; other teachers, who need to coordinate their work with&nbsp; a class; other practitioners and designers, who may wish to reuse or and share existing practices;. researchers, who may be interested &nbsp;in piloting educational interventions oriented to test some kind of innovation in a class; a computer, that may be able to &ldquo;read&rdquo; a formal representation and thus automatically configure a learning environment where the activity can be enacted; and, last but not least, the teacher herself, who may need to use representations during the design process as a &lsquo;maieutic tool&rsquo;, to help her make the rationale behind the design decisions explicit.</p>
<p>As a consequence of these different communication needs, there is a variety of existing representations, which differ for type, purpose, end-user, etc.. In this rich panorama it may be difficult for practitioners and novice users to orient themselves. This paper is an attempt to make order out the chaos of the existing design representations, even if the borders between the different categories identified is rather blurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this contribution a framework of dimensions is proposed and illustrated, mainly with the aim of classifying different approaches and to design representation as well as identifying and discussing the areas where more research work is needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="right"><em>A hands-on research workshop at the</em>, <em>January, 28 &ndash; February, 1st 2013</em>,&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Villard‐de‐Lans, Vercors</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning<em> design</em> is <em>the</em> keyword for an effective (e)Learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I maturated this position after mostly 25 years in research and practical work with technology enhanced learning (videotape, videodiscs, CDs, CBT, distance learning, eLearning, etc...) and 10 years (the last 10) of researches on eLearning quality.</p>
<p>In Italy most of university teachers implementing eLearning as part of their courses have in mind a very traditional model of eLearning, based on the transmission of knowledge and on the download of (textual) documents, with a very limited use of other resources, particularly environments that allow a dialogic approach (. Therefore, it is not surprising that eLearning courses are seen by the students as second choice courses (with some appreciation, anyway, by the students that work, and that do not have time to participate to the faculty life)</p>
<p>Only with the support of instructional designers and/or with the exposition to some examples &nbsp;of "good" teaching online the teachers are able to switch to a more constructivistic teaching framework, based on student collaboration, co-construction of multimedia materials, intensive forum use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;In my 25 years of educational technology work I was instructional designer and coordinator of a group of designers in two different universities in Italy (Milano and Trento), setting up in both cases an university level eLearning project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In both the Universities my main concern was:</p>
<ol>
<li>to prepare a group of instructional designers that could help the faculty in designing (mainly) constructivistic&nbsp; eLearning courses;</li>
<li>to promote the new possibilities offered by the educational technologies (i.e. showing&nbsp; to the different faculty professors examples of "non old-style" eLearning courses)</li>
</ol>
<p>My focus in the last 10 years has been quality of eLearning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;During 4 national level research projects (PRIN) I tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>to better understand what quality eLearning is at the different level (University, faculty, single course) and for the different stakeholders (university managers, dean, teachers, students) (P. Ghislandi, P. Calidoni, F. Falcinelli, C. Scurati, 2008). We adopted the 5 points Sloan-C model, especially concentrating in the "learning effectiveness" point </li>
<li>to build/validate/promote specific tools to help the teachers in designing &nbsp;more effective eLearning (P. Ghislandi, 2012) as key dimension of quality.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;I am now in this second phase, and I am managing (for Trento) a research that see the collaboration of Catholic University of Milan, State University of Milan Bicocca, University of Pavia, University of Verona,&nbsp; with the title: <em>Evaluation for the improvement of educational contexts. A research involving University and local communities in the participatory development of innovative assessment models.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My research group about quality in eLearning include a Chinese PhD student (Nan Yang) and an Argentinian post-doc researcher (Juliana Raffaghelli). We work a lot in an eResearch basis (N. Yang, P. Ghislandi, F. Cumer, 2011)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are now reflecting on which qualitative research methodology&nbsp; (Partecipative Action Research?, DBR-Design Based Research?, Grounded theory?, Mixed Methods?) will be the best to reach our goals that are:</p>
<ol>
<li>promote , in a case study in our own faculty, university professors&rsquo; reflection on (e)Learning design as key dimension for preparing &nbsp;effective (students learn) courses . In order to support this reflection, we provide university teachers with tools that <em>mediate </em>the process of reflection (Ghislandi &amp; Raffaghelli, 2012) </li>
<li>involve the university professors in participatory action research (the concept id very near to what you call Teacher-led Inquiry into Student Learning (TISL) about quality Technology Enhanced Learning), as a mean to promote the expression of their <em>agency </em>as professionals of education, understanding eLearning as part of &nbsp;a context of educational shift where they are engaged (Ghislandi, Raffaghelli &amp; Yang, in press)</li>
</ol>
<p>But perhaps the most important thing is that I have always implemented what I suggested: a socio-constructivist approach to my academic courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was very well impressed when I read the call for expression of interest about the <em>Workshop on Teacher-led Inquiry and Learning Design</em>, because I immediatly thought that this will be a marvelous opportunity to:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>share our ideas and gain new perspectives with people that are working/researching in similar fields and <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>learn on other approaches to support the introduction of eLearning at University Level, in general, and Learning Design as strategy to promote university teachers&rsquo; reflection on&nbsp; technological and pedagogical issues concerning the implementation of eLearning courses. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The aims of the workshop are really significant to me!</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish a new area of research in Education, synergizing LD and TISL, and focusing on context, practice and change</li>
<li>Network to build a new community around this research theme</li>
<li>Produce 5-6 draft papers for a special journal issue</li>
<li>Potential for new significant research grant proposals</li>
<li>Archive the work outputs from the workshop activities as a useful resource to other practitioners</li>
</ol>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This position paper is situated in the context of mathematics teacher education as practiced in university settings. It involves the use of animations and slideshows that represent classroom interaction and an on-line platform--LessonSketch.org--in &nbsp;which such rich media representations of practice can be discussed and created. The position paper provides context on video-based resources in teacher education and then provides a short description of the LessonSketch environment. It then provides an initial description of a plan for supporting groups of mathematics teacher educators in inquiry and design cycles that result in modules for use in teacher education. Finally, the paper sketches dimensions of a needed research design to study this process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Contemporary developments in mathematics teacher education</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>University-based mathematics teacher education in the United States is at an important crossroads. The past decades have seen the development of important new representational tools for mathematics teacher educators. At the same time, there have been increasing criticisms of university-based teacher education in the United States and concomitant calls for changes in how it is done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of representational tools, as argued in Brophy (2004), there has been great enthusiasm for video in teacher education and professional development. The current ease in capturing video of classroom interaction and sharing it with others over time provides teacher educators with an important resource in preparing pre-service teachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much more than other technologies, videos convey the complexity and immediacy of teaching with a richness that approximates that experienced by observers actually present in the classroom&hellip; It is as if one has been taken to the classroom of a particular teacher to observe a particular lesson. One can see students, hear their voices, look at their work, and even hear their teachers reflect on the lesson afterwards. The experience has been captured and can be replayed and transported to other locations. (Brophy, 2004, pp. 9-10)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The promise of video in teacher education plays out against the backdrop of long-term tensions around university-based preparation for professional practice. On the one hand, universities are seen as places where new developments in teaching might originate; on the other hand, universities do not seem well-suited to replication of existing practice (For a discussion of this issue, see Herbst, Chazan, Chen, Chieu, &amp; Weiss, 2011).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, in the United States, the Common Core State Standards are an initiative (corestandards.org) of the states and their governors to move a decentralized system toward a common, national set of standards. With respect to mathematics, these standards include a set of standards for the nature of classroom mathematical practice. These standards envision a kind of classroom mathematical practice that is not common. In an effort to flesh out this vision, the Illustrative Mathematics Project (<a href="http://illustrativemathematics.org">http://illustrativemathematics.org</a>) is creating representations of teaching practice that represent the desired classroom practice, and the involvement higher education faculty has been actively sought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, recently, under the banner of &ldquo;practice-based teacher education&rdquo; (see teachingworks.org, for example), there have been a number of calls to shift greater attention to the capacity for action of teacher education candidates when they leave their programs. Teacher education programs are criticized for focusing on foundational issues, rather than on providing candidates with methods that will serve candidates well in their initial years in teaching. With the increasing capacity to link teachers to learning gains of their students, it seems likely that in the future teacher education programs will examine program efficacy by judging relative impact on student achievement. And, if it turns out that professional education outside of the academy is more effective on this measure, then support for university-based teacher education may erode further. It is thus crucial for professional schools of education at universities to find ways of combining their academic customs with a focus on practice (Ball &amp; Forzani, 2009).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responding to this desire for practice-based teacher education, Grossman, Compton, Igra, Ronfeldt, Shahan, and Williamson (2009) undertook a cross-profession study of preparation for practice. Their study suggests that in preparation for practice pre-service professionals are engaged with practice in at least three ways. Their mentors use resources like video to represent practice as described by Brophy (2004). But, in addition, in preparation for practice, mentors break practice into smaller pieces creating <em>decompositions</em> of practice that help pre-service professionals observe particular aspects of practice. And, finally, mentors create <em>approximations</em> of practice that allow candidates to practice particular aspects of their profession in a sheltered context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Related to these notions, we in the Thought Experiments in Mathematics Teaching project (ThEMaT) have explored technological developments related to the authoring of video. We have been exploring the affordances of animations of possible classroom interaction rather than video of actual classrooms. We believe that such animations can operate both as representations of practice and as decompositions of practice. In addition, we have been exploring an on-line environment for interaction between preservice candidates and these sorts of video-based artifacts of practice. The LessonSketch.org environment is a website within which teacher educators can ask preservice candidates to interact with animations and within which preservice candidates can be asked to create their own comic strip depictions of practice. Some early adopters across the United States have begun to explore the affordances of this environment and these representations for practice-based teacher education, particularly to support interaction outside of the classroom and in blended learning settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Modules for mathematics teacher education: Supporting inquiry and development</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the current resources in LessonSketch are of use to early adopters, for LessonSketch and its affordances to have a larger influence on teacher education, other teacher educators will need prepared materials that are prepared to help them meet their goals. The project we are contemplating proposes to energize a national network of teacher educators to develop and share curricular materials for teacher education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Influenced by the experience of curriculum developers (e.g., the Connected Mathematics Project) in producing materials for middle grades classrooms, we are envisioning the creation of short modules of activity that might be used over 2-3 class sessions with outside of class assignments based on existing LessonSketch materials, instructor developed materials, and publicly available video. We would like to explore the use of these materials in a wide range of teacher preparation contexts: subject-matter content classes, instructional methods (or didactics) classes, adolescent development classes, content area reading courses, observation semester interactions with mentors, during student teaching (with support for interns, mentors, and field instructors).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key to the proposed activity will be the support of teacher educators as they engage in an inquiry and design process to create these modules. We imagine supporting this process in three steps that involve: <em>early adopters</em> who design and create prototype modules, mathematics teacher education <em>inquiry groups</em> that develop and refine these modules, and then <em>on-line groups</em> of mathematics teacher educators who participate in further inquiry around the achievement of the goals of the modules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first step in the process will involve interaction between Thought Experiments in Mathematics Teaching Research group and a small group of initial collaborators excited about the potential of LessonSketch as a tool in teacher education. In concert with the ThEMaT research group, these early adopters will identify key mathematics teacher practices around which mathematics teacher education has important goals. They will design modules that involve both the use of animations and video, as well as including assignments that involve pre-service candidate created slideshows. The research group will support these early adopters with the development of additional materials in the LessonSketch environment. These materials will include a library of mathematics teaching practices, as well as a library of student mathematical conceptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the next stage, each of the early adopters will recruit 6-7 colleagues to become a mathematics teacher education inquiry group. The focus of each group will be on the development in pre-service teachers of the mathematics teaching practices at the heart of the newly-designed module. Participants in the inquiry group will use the module in their program and adapt it to their contexts. The LessonSketch environment&rsquo;s resources for sharing data from the use of the module and for sharing comments about the nature of the module will be used to support the work of these inquiry groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the final stage, each of these inquiry groups will launch their module as a resource for mathematics educators more broadly. The inquiry groups will then operate as the authors of a set of materials for use by other teacher educators, as well as the convenors of on-line conversations and explorations about how to achieve the goals of their module more effectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Researching the development and use of a teacher education environment </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LessonSketch provides a set of tools and resources for practice-based, media intensive, online interactions. Teacher educators come to it not only with their goals but also with a wealth of face-to-face activity structures and assessment ideas. Their mutual accommodation requires learning and design. Teacher educators need to learn how to use available tools and resources, while the LessonSketch design team will learn about the goals and expected practices of teacher educators. Teacher educators will design and create applications of LessonSketch tools, while the LessonSketch design team will improve user interface and functionalities to support better use and implementation. The process we anticipate is one of institutional design. Our research plan will investigate how this design proceeds. The idea is to do research around the interaction between teacher developers who use media and have a practice-based orientation and the designers of the LessonSketch environment as they attempt to incorporate some elements of a basic set of technology resources into teacher education. The research would include learning how they use those technological resources and determining how the system can better track that use so as to produce instructor and student feedback. The research would also include learning about other activity structures used that could be supported by technology and determining what kinds of technology supports could facilitate this work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data that we envision to be collected for this project is diverse. On the one hand, in depth interviews of teacher educators and observations of their work with teacher candidates could lead to case studies of needs, affordances, solutions, etc. On the other hand log data studies of what they do with their students could serve to evaluate features and discover errors.</p>

<p><strong>Paper Abstract<br /></strong>Around the globe both country-specific and international organizations have been exploring the potential of sharing digital resources for education, including learning designs. Repositories are created and used for a variety of reasons ranging from efficiency to innovation and even financial gain. While some commercial repositories have met with success in certain countries, few -if any- open access repositories have achieved sufficient critical mass to fully realize their goals. While research literature exists that can help specify characteristics of effective open access learning design repositories, we severely lack sufficient insight into how to design and launch for sustainable repository use that is consistent with the initiative&rsquo;s goals. This paper presents observations and critical reflections with the aim of stimulating research that can help bring the repository vision to life in ways not yet achieved.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of this paper is to present a research proposal as a response to the need for inquiry on new participatory approaches of learning design in the field of higher education. Learning scenarios are required that better connect with the skills and interests of specific groups of students, both in regard to the methodological strategies and the uses of supporting technological tools proposed. In the next pages we expose the arguments of our research approach, drawing on existing literature and proposing cross-overs among the fields of learning design, participatory design, inquiry-based learning and student participation. Our assumption is that it is necessary to rethink the learning design processes at the university on the basis of the collaboration between teachers and students in the creation of new learning scenarios. These scenarios should empower the student in the learning process, through a personal, deep and transversal use of technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results obtained in various recent studies (Lorenzo, Oblinger y Dziuban, 2006, UCL-Cyber Group, 2008; Duart, Gil, Pujol and Brown, 2008;) show that university students, also called digital natives, do not generally incorporate in their academic practices a mature use of ICT, which improves their learning quality and depth. In general, the uses of technology are rather basic and directed by teachers through knowledge transfer activities. It has also been observed that the preferences and skills for ICT academic and "intellectual" use vary depending on the students characteristics, under the influence of factors such as the area of study, gender, age, etc. The research of Kennedy et al. (2006) for instance showed the lack of homogeneity with respect to ICT use among first year university students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been involved in a R+D national project on the uses of ICT by Spanish university students. Our results confirm those obtained in previous studies conducted in different countries, showing that although university students may have sufficient digital skills to use ICT in their everyday life, they use them to a much lesser extent for academic purposes, and this use is often relegated and restricted to teacher instructions. This fact contradicts the evolution that ICT use is experiencing in other areas, the increasingly complex digital skills that it represents as well as different cognitive and social skills that it puts into play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several authors have referred to the gap between the technology potential and its actual exploitation in educational contexts (Conole, Dyke Oliver, Seale, 2004; Strijbos, Kirschner, and Martens, 2004), as well as to the need to provide guidance in the design of learning, the selection of the right tools and how to use them from certain pedagogical approaches (Conole, Oliver, Falconer, Littlejohn and Harvey, 2007; Conole, 2008).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the role of university as an enabler agent of future professionals as lifelong learners is socially put into question. In Europe, the changes proposed by the EHEA do not seem to have the desired effect in terms of methodological change, intensive use of ICT and students involvement. Trinder et al. (2008) argue that while formal education persists in the use of pedagogical models based on the transmission of knowledge, the boundaries between formal and informal will persist. Only changes in the pedagogical orientation will be able to bridge both worlds allowing the exploitation of ICT uses and learning processes in everyday situations in academic contexts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From our perspective, inquiry-based learning can contribute to improving learning through the use of technology enhanced environments, providing a stronger link between the use of technology in informal situations and with learning purposes, either in academic or other contexts. The approach of learning through inquiry is a broad label that covers various pedagogical approaches but all of them have in common the student in the role of the researcher, providing him a greater control and responsibility in the learning process. This way of understanding the academic activity blurs the traditional division between teaching and research. In fact, recent studies have suggested that one of the most powerful ways to promote deep learning is to involve students in research activities as contexts of inquiry-based learning (Brew, 2006).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning through inquiry represents a significant contribution to the experience of university students as it provides situations that stimulate their ability to solve problems, require their active role in authentic contexts, involves knowledge construction processes and triggers reflection and deep learning. However, teaching from this approach is not easy. Research on this topic (Ellis. et al, 2005; Ellis and Goodyear, 2010) indicates that teachers need support in the design and implementation of this kind of learning activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several authors (Reigeluth, 1999; Ellis and Goodyear, 2010) have argued that although education has always involved planning and design, the need to invest efforts in the systematic design that clearly and constantly establishes and guides student activity, may be especially high in networked learning situations. On the other hand, Trigwell et al. (2000) state that in order to achieve the implementation of academic knowledge in real practice, teachers need to be informed of the theoretical perspectives of learning and teaching, reflect on their practice through systematic research, present their results to their peers, etc. This will create a breakthrough in understanding how to achieve deep learning (Kreber, 2003; Trigwell and Shale, 2004).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the initial focus of &ldquo;learning design&rdquo; was on learning objects, in recent years, its attention has shifted to learning activities, their description, parameterization and representation (Conole, 2008). In this sense, the design of the scenarios (including socio-cultural, pedagogical approach and learning objects) in which these activities will be developed allows to elicit learning processes intended to be facilitated and promoted among students. The field of learning design or &ldquo;design for learning&rdquo; has developed in recent years and now offers as a good set of tools, systems, patterns and models (McAndrew and Goodyear, 2007; Masterman and Vogel, 2007; Craft, Brock and Mor, 2012) that can empower teachers to design scenarios that provide richer learning experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participatory design or, also named, co-design methods have been used in the last years in the educational domain learning design purposes. Those experiences have typically involved teachers, researchers and developers as partners in educational innovation processes. Co-design has often implied participation in design and deployment of technological tools aimed at supporting learning processes (Mor and Winters, 2006; Roschelle, Penuel, Schechtman, 2007). In the co-design method the active and joint participation of different actors enables the traceability and the interpretation of the phenomena associated with the use of certain methodologies and technological tools. It is usually based on teachers&rsquo; active participation in the process of the innovation design, as well as in its implementation and ongoing evaluation in daily practice. This procedure ensures the connection and orchestration of theory, models of practice, tools and participants perceptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking as its fundamental point of reference the needs of the stakeholders, the co-design method retains many similarities with the approach of student-centered learning. This approach recognizes the "student voice" to their circumstances, abilities, interests, learning style, etc. as a focus and starting point for the design of learning situations. It proposes further responsibility and active engagement of the student for their own learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, different authors have proposed methodologies in which students and teachers participate in "co-generative" talks, aimed at sharing their perspectives and jointly reflect on how to improve the practice of teaching and learning (Roth, Lawless and Tobin, 2000). More recently, direct involvement of students as learning "co-designers" has started to be explored in different educational contexts (Scanlon et al., 2009; K&ouml;nings, Brand-Gruwel and van Merri&euml;nboer, 2011; Cameron and Gotlieb, 2009; Cameron and Tanti, 2011). Some results show that this approach can promote deeper learning among students and also provide key elements and opportunities to guide teacher intervention. However, there are still few studies addressing the effects of this approach in higher education. Moreover, some of these studies have found different points of tension that may hinder the co-design process (Penuel, Roschelle and Schechtman, 2007; Scanlon et. al, 2009; Brand-Gruwel and van Merri&euml;nboer, 2011). On the other hand, students&rsquo; involvement is often limited to specific workshops and not allowed along the whole design process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that co-design processes participated by teachers, students and researchers may have a positive impact both in enhancing student engagement in learning and in improving teachers understanding about learning and teaching processes. The results obtained in research-based teaching and learning activities and projects have been promising (Neary and Winn, 2011; Wieman, 2004 and Brew, 2006). However, although the literature comprises a range of rationales for students&rsquo; participation in curriculum design, there is still little systematic evaluation on its real impact and specific dynamics (Bovill, Morss and Bulley, 2009).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project aims to make progress in the research about methodologies based on inquiry learning processes with technological support in higher education. The purpose of the project is to study the application of a model based on inquiry pedagogy to generate learning scenarios in universities that can be adapted to different training contexts and student profiles. To do this, the elements that configure those contexts and profiles will be identified, such as the area of knowledge, the academic level, and students&rsquo; competence in ICT use for learning purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These scenarios, generated from a co-design process involving teachers, students and experts in instructional design, will be based on a more mature, self-managed, and transversal use of technology, in order to allow the intersection among different contexts and activities in which students develop learning processes beyond the university Virtual Campus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project intends to contrast the proposed learning scenarios with students&rsquo; actual interests and learning perception. It is also the purpose of the research to develop tools and patterns that support the representation and the explanation of the designs. Acting as mediating artifacts among participants those patterns and tools could scaffold the co-design process (Scanlon et al., 2009) and at the same time facilitate the sharing of the design scenarios and its transference to other areas (Mor and Winters, 2006). The specific objectives of the project are formulated as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To study and propose the inquiry based model to inform the design of new learning scenarios in the university, identifying the elements that allow its adaptation to different contexts of practice and student profiles.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To develop and analyze a co-design strategy of learning scenarios involving, as key players, teachers, students and techno-pedagogical design experts.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To design and analyze learning scenarios based on deep, transversal and autonomous ICT use by students from the inquiry model.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To propose and use tools and patterns to represent and explain the co-design process and the resulting scenarios, so that they can be shared, repurposed and reused by other teachers.</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To validate and systematize the used inquiry model as well as the instruments and the proposed design strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study will apply the methodology of design-based research as the most appropriate and consistent with the project theoretical framework and the set research goals. The design of the investigation is iterative, situated, and led to the intervention but underpinned by theory. Research is not defined by the methodology (quantitative or qualitative) but by its object, which is essentially to explain and to support a process of change. The object of study is therefore the very process of designing the learning scenarios, taking as key agents both the teachers and the students to whom those practices are addressed to. A mixed approach (quantitative and qualitative) will be used for data collection, analysis and interpretation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that this research proposal can contribute in different ways to the field of learning design by providing a new insight on participatory design processes based on teacher and student led inquiry.</p>

              <title>Learning Design and Monitoring in CSCL Scenarios: Emergent Synergies</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6595</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Background</strong><br />Day by day, learning scenarios are gaining complexity with the combination of individual, group and whole-class tasks as well as face-to-face or distance activities. Furthermore, the integration of a wide range of technologies such as virtual and personal learning environments (VLEs/PLEs), web 2.0 or mobile tools is becoming increasingly common. These changes have made the management of technological-enhanced classrooms highly demanding. There are many tasks to be carried out by teachers to orchestrate [1] a real classroom, such as intervening at any time to change activities, modifying the deadlines, re-structuring groups, etc. Besides, the number and complexity of these tasks increase when active pedagogies are used, such as in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) or Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) scenarios.</p>
<p>Since orchestration implies making interventions in response to the specific context and emergent eventualities, one crucial aspect is to provide awareness tools that show what is happening in the learning scenario. For this purpose, monitoring students&rsquo; computer-mediated interactions may be very helpful in order to show what is &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; behind the technology.</p>
<p>Considerable efforts have been done in order to support CSCL scenarios, developing tools for design, enactment and evaluation purposes. For instance, scripting and monitoring are two long discussed techniques in the research community aimed to foster effective collaboration [2]. On the one hand, CSCL scripting structures the learning scenario and provides students with a set of instructions that guide potentially fruitful collaboration; on the other hand, monitoring the collaboration facilitates the intervention of the teacher in order to redirect the group work in a more productive direction.</p>
<p><strong>Linking Pedagogical Intentions with Monitoring Support</strong><br />Previous research has pointed out that synergies may appear when monitoring and learning design are aligned [3]. Learning design would benefit from taking into account the special requirements posed by monitoring, and, moreover, the integration during the monitoring of reminders on issues from the design could help to obtain results better tailored to the teacher&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>Thus, even though it is one important factor in building effective collaborative learning, having a &ldquo;plan&rdquo; is not enough to ensure that the desired collaboration occurs:&nbsp; eventualities and contingencies require modifications of the course of the learning&nbsp; situation, leading teachers to adapt the original design. At this point, monitoring the&nbsp; learning scenario and comparing its actual and expected states may provide useful information that the teacher can use to regulate collaboration [8].</p>
<p>Conversely, in CSCL research, monitoring has been mostly focused on detailed interaction analysis methods, which provide highly detailed accounts of the collaboration. However, in authentic scenarios, teachers need simpler and easier to interpret feedback so they can react on time if needed. Indeed, the use of diverse ICT tools in the classroom would require participants to integrate monitoring data from all the tools and environments where the learning process takes place. To address these problems, the information from the designed script could be used to guide the data gathering and to contextualize the monitoring results, taking into account elements such as the deadlines, the group structuring and the tools involved in each activity.</p>
<p>Despite the benefits that the combination of scripting and monitoring could offer, no integration has been observed into mainstream CSCL practices. As Martinez et al. explain in [3], the combination is not straightforward. There are several problems that hinder the application of monitoring in real CSCL scenarios. Among these problems, some have a technological origin and some depend on the decisions taken during the design of the learning situation. That lack of attention to the monitoring issues when designing learning scenarios often causes that the technological context is not suitable to be monitored. This reasoning leads us to think that the learning design must take into account the special requirements posed by monitoring at design-time.</p>
<p>Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to provide non-expert teachers with design and enactment tools capable of linking pedagogical intentions with monitoring support for orchestrating blended CSCL scenarios. To achieve this goal, we have defined three partial objectives:<br />1. Support non-expert teachers to identify and include the monitoring issues of pedagogical significance throughout the design process of CSCL scenarios.<br />2. Provide teachers with coarse-grained information about the evolution of the CSCL scenario, based on the constraints obtained from the learning design.<br />3. Support the automation of the data gathering and integration tasks in technologically distributed and heterogeneous CSCL environments.</p>
<p>In fact, although our proposal focuses more on CSCL situations, we believe that similar benefits could be obtained from applying it to teaching in IBL scenarios.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Viability: Preliminary Results</strong></p>
<p>Several tasks have been already done in relation to each one of the objectives mentioned in the previous section, and multiple exploratory studies in authentic learning scenarios have taken place so far. In [7], we found initial evidence that being aware of the pattern used in a script increases the opportunities of detecting critical situations when the script is put into practice. This way, monitoring process is more efficient, since the critical points are identified in advance, and monitoring can focus on detecting them, instead of on modeling the whole collaborative process.</p>
<p>In [4] we delved into the problem of data gathering in DLEs for monitoring purposes. A solution was proposed to add monitoring functionalities to an existing architecture devoted to integrate virtual and personal learning environments (VLEs and PLEs) with external tools, named <a href="http://www.gsic.uva.es/glue">GLUE! (Group Learning Uniform Environment)</a>. Initial evidence was obtained on the capabilities of the proposed architecture to gather relevant information about the users&rsquo; actions during the learning process.</p>
<p>Currently, our efforts are focused on the formalization of both the learning design and&nbsp; monitoring process, and the monitoring model. The first steps done in this direction may be found in [6] [5]. We expect to provide further insights and evaluation data on these topics during the workshop.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Learning Design&rdquo; (henceforth LD) is one misleading term of the educational research vocabulary, for two reasons at least. Firstly, it takes for granted that learners&rsquo; activity can be fully designed, or prescribed, in advance by teachers or instructional designers. As Wenger (1998, p. 229) pointed out, &ldquo;<em>Learning cannot be designed</em>: it can only be designed <em>for</em>&mdash;that is, facilitated or frustrated.&rdquo; (original italics) Secondly, and mostly because of the first reason, LD activities are actually the mere definition and planning of <em>teaching</em> activities, than of learning ones. The actual rule of thought for LD research might be formulated as follows:</p>
<p><em>Rely on predetermined action schemes (or objects, etc.), organized at a higher level in scenarios (or scripts, etc.), and use them to help teachers design their teaching and (hopefully) foster the intended learning activity.</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A way to insure that learning properly flows and occurs is to enable and instrument <em>Teacher inquiry into student learning</em> (henceforth TISL). This activity occurs <em>during and after </em>the learning process whereas LD mainly occurs before. Since both LD and TISL are exclusively teacher-driven, associating them to improve instruction entails a major problem: it leaves learners out. This concern has other side effects often debated in the literature: LD languages are not &ldquo;agnostic&rdquo; (Nunes &amp; McPherson, 2007), that is, depend more or less on the pedagogical assumptions of their authors (expressiveness, see van Es &amp; Koper, 2006). As a consequence, teachers hardly use LD-like formalisms to design their teaching because they can feel themselves too constrained by it (for attempts to address this point, see Emin, Pernin, Aguirre, 2010; Emin, Pernin &amp; Gu&eacute;raud, 2009).<strong></strong></p>
<p>Three arguments support our position: firstly, (socio-)constructivist situations have become one of the mainstream models and leave some freedom to the learner (Duffy &amp; Cunningham, 1996); secondly, self-regulated learning, that is, the way learners regulate, inflect or even inquire by themselves their activity flow is more and more often studied (Dettori &amp; Persico, 2011); thirdly, recent computer-based environments enable sophisticated feedback that can direct, at least partially, the learner&rsquo;s activity (Narciss, 2008). So we consider <em>delegating</em> a specific role to the learner and, in so doing, proposing to rephrase the original TISL framework as &ldquo;Teacher <em>&amp; Student</em> Inquiry into Student Learning&rdquo; (T&amp;SISL), and to propose an alternate rule to the aforementioned:<strong></strong></p>
<p><em>Rely on cognitive models of learner activity determined from theory and cognitive task analysis, and use them to provide learners with open environments that deliver feedback prompts to (hopefully) foster the related learning activity.</em><strong></strong></p>
<p>Our approach is to leave as often as possible the activity of design to the learner after, of course, this activity has been carefully modeled (Karagiorgi &amp; Symeou, 2005). When immersed in an environment, a learner can design by herself the workflow she needs for learning. The design actually <em>emerges</em> from the learner&rsquo;s task and the learner <em>intentionally</em> achieves learning in the environment (Martinez, 1997). Nonetheless, the identification of patterns of use in this environment is still possible (Wilson, 2008). We formulate some principles and a procedure that helps define a new environmental and intentional LD perspective, as shown in Table 1.</p>
<p>This procedure will be illustrated by the presentation of <em>ReaderBench</em> (Dessus et al., 2012; Trausan-Matu, Dascalu &amp; Dessus, 2012), a system that helps teachers automatically select texts according to their textual complexity automatically and analyses the pupils&rsquo; self-explanations after reading narrative texts in order to detect their reading strategies. Eventually, some theoretical and empirical implications of this LD-T&amp;SISL approach will be presented and discussed.</p>

              <title>Using Interaction Design Methods for Learning Design</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<p>Design research and practice in human-computer interaction is called Interaction design. Interaction design is guided by a collection of methods proven useful for inquiry, exploration, composition and assessment in designing interactive systems (Löwgren and Stolterman 2005). Examples of these methods are:&nbsp;future workshops, scenarios, paper prototyping and testing, thinking aloud and hi-fi prototyping and testing.&nbsp;Löwgren and Stolterman (2005)&nbsp;views&nbsp;design work as guided by a collection of design methods rather than having a framework structuring the entire design process. Learning to choose between these methods in any given design situation is about developing into a reflective practitioner (Schön 1983).</p>
<p><br />In this position paper we discuss how interaction design methods can be used for guiding the learning design process.&nbsp;Throughout an interaction design process special representations are used both in designing and evaluating design suggestions. We believe that many methods and representations from the practice of designing interactive systems are equally applicable to learning design.</p>

              <title>Learning design and learning analytics</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6573</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6573</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Exploring the synergy between learning design and learning analytics.</em></p>
<p>Learning design consists of a cycle of activities: &lsquo;challenge definition, conceptualisation, elaboration, enactment, evaluation and reflection, and back to remodelling&rsquo; (Craft &amp; Mor, 2012). The tools that support the first stages of this cycle are not necessarily aligned with the later stages &ndash; a design narrative of a carefully designed learning activity may reveal significant flaws but lack a clear way of re‐connecting with the original design tools (Learning Design Grid, 2012).</p>
<p>Learning analytics offer a way of connecting different stages of the cycle. These analytics involve &lsquo;the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimising learning and the environments in which it occurs&rsquo; (Siemens et al., 2011). They can be employed at each stage of the design cycle.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate potential correspondences between learning design and learning analytics, I draw on work on EnquiryBlogger, a blogging tool based on Wordpress, which was developed to support the Authentic Enquiry design for enquiry‐based learning (Ferguson, Buckingham Shum, &amp; Deakin Crick, 2011). There is not a perfect match here between design and analytics &ndash; the project was developed in a different context &ndash; but the links between the two suggest what could be achieved in the future.</p>
<p><em>Authentic Enquiry</em> is a theoretically and empirically grounded design for personalised, authentic enquiry. It is an eight‐stage process that starts from a topic of interest to the learner and progresses through observation, question, uncovering narratives, mapping, connecting with existing knowledge, interfacing with curriculum requirements to final assessment. This design that has been used successfully in settings from primary to postgraduate level on four continents (Deakin Crick, 2009). It is used in conjunction with the <em>Learning Power</em> framework, which focuses on students&rsquo; current learning dispositions (Buckingham Shum &amp; Deakin Crick 2012).</p>
<p><em>EnquiryBlogger</em> adds three learner plugins to a Wordpress blog, giving visual feedback on progress against the eight core activities of the Authentic Enquiry design, how many times blog posts have been categorized by a learner using the seven dimensions of Learning Power, and a visual &lsquo;mood graph&rsquo; showing the peaks and troughs of how the learner feels about their work. The plugins are also used to navigate quickly to related posts, by clicking on coloured dots. For teachers and mentors, there are three dashboard widgets displaying all learners&rsquo; plugins in their group.</p>
<p><strong>The Learning Design Cycle</strong></p>
<p>The initial challenge here was to develop a design for personal enquiry that could be employed in a variety of educational settings. Drawing on previous research, the design was conceptualized as an eight‐step learning journey. These steps made up an iterative process, so they were represented within EnquiryBlogger as an Enquiry Spiral. Mouse-over text above each step elaborated for pupils what was involved at each stage, while more detailed teacher notes elaborated on the process for teachers.</p>
<p>Learners recorded each day in their EnquiryBlogs how they were enacting their Authentic Enquiry. By the use of tags, they recorded their progress on the eight‐step learning journey and how they felt this reflected their learning dispositions. They were also able to record their feelings on a Mood Graph. Their enactment of the learning design was thus closely tied to reflection on their progress, and these reflections were represented visually by widgets sited beside their EnquiryBlogs. The teacher&rsquo;s dashboard view provided opportunities to initiate reflective discussion with individual pupils and with the class as a whole, as well as supporting reflection by the teacher.</p>
<p>This example shows that learning analytics can be interwoven with learning design. In this case, dashboards and widgets provide a focused view of data within the students&rsquo; blogs, and this view supports implementation and refinement of the learning design. Future possibilities for the combination of learning design and learning analytics include use of data about student activity to generate recommendations to learners and teachers, to represent progress, to identify possible study partners, to flag which problems have not been addressed and which tools have not been used, and to support both reflection and evaluation.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Inquiry of Design for Learning</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6477</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6477</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The overarching aim of the proposed research is to solidify the theoretical foundations of the field of Learning Design, construct a comprehensive methodological framework on these foundations, and develop a set of tools to support this framework.</p>
<p>Learning Design is the act of devising new practices, plans of activity, resources and tools aimed at achieving educational aims. Concepts central to the discussion are context, practice, and change. The context of learning design encompasses the material, social and intentional factors which define the space in which learners and educators operate. Practice includes both epistemic practice (&ldquo;How we learn&rdquo;) and pedagogical practice (&ldquo;how we teach&rdquo;). Finally, design always aims to change existing situations into desired ones. There is a need for formalisms and methodologies that allow a scientific and operational articulation of these elements.</p>
<p>The proposed research will integrate three existing constructs - design narratives, design principles and design patterns, and propose a fourth form &ndash; design scenarios. Design narratives describe a concrete practical challenge in a defined domain, the actions taken to resolve it and their unfolding effects. Design principles are imperative statements which synthesize the findings of scientific research in a manner accessible for practitioners and summarise insights from practical experience to inform scientific discourse. Patterns are generalised narratives, offering a canonical description of a common challenge, the characteristics of the context in which it occurs, and a possible method of solution. Scenarios complete the picture by projecting design claims into the future as hypothesized narratives.</p>
<p>The objectives of this research will include:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Articulating conceptual and operational formalisms for capturing context, epistemic and pedagogical practice, and models of change.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploring methodologies, situated in defined domains of practice, for eliciting such representations and utilising them effectively in supporting educational innovation.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhancing existing software tools to support these methodologies and facilitate the activity of a vibrant researcher and practitioner community committed to them.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establishing a culture of practitioner design inquiry in TEL, in which educators use the representations, methodologies and tools above to sustain scientifically informed creative practices in their professional context.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The 'map my programme' tool employs a set of free google apps to graphically display all the hand-in dates for each course /unit/module and display, in real time, the types of assessment used across a programme and the effect of that assessment has on the learning journey of the students at any one point as well as the marking load for the academic. It can also be used to see if there is duplication of effort, or synergy bewteen courses. Core to this process are the dates when formative and summative assessments are set and subsequently submitted – students do not want to have a bunching of coursework and staff need to manage their workload! You can download guidance materials and request a trial at: http://www.mapmyprogramme.com/</p>
<p>There is no charge for using this tool but you will need a google account. </p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>There has already been some discussion about what models and tools we might use to help us review and articulate the design problem space in advance starting of any MOOC design work proper. So far the models on the table are:</p>
<p>Simon Cross's <a href="http://latestendeavour.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/the-lattice-model-for-designing-learning-defining-the-design-problem-space-and-guiding-the-design-solutions/">Lattice Model</a> and Yishay Mor's <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BneOQmlmG6ZQFUIjVWehA487g7-_-Gpi36-d41rzlwY/edit">Scenario/ Force map</a> tool</p>
<p>To summarise our discussions so far, I think that we feel that Simon's lattice model is too complicated to use in an activity, so we think we will probably use Yishay's activity and then review activity outputs using the Lattice Model (correct me if I'm wrong anyone!) so that we can begin to locate priorities and concerns.</p>
<p>Do you know of any other learning design tools we might use to define the problem space at this early stage? Please join in :-)</p>]]></description>

<p>After  consultation with many of those planning to participate or present, we have also  confirmed the start and end dates for the OLDS MOOC.&nbsp; The MOOC will run from  <strong>10<sup>th</sup> January &ndash; 13<sup>th</sup> March 2013</strong>.&nbsp; This is slightly later  than originally advertised, but takes into account that October and November are  often busy times for Further and Higher Education professionals and allows those  commencing post-graduate courses to settle into those  first</p>
<p>The course  website is currently being built and you will be able to see the course taking  shape over the next few months at <a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/">www.olds.ac.uk</a>.&nbsp; There will be monthly updates on  the website blog and the course has a Twitter account at  OLDS-MOOC.</p>
<p>We are  grateful for your continuing interest in this free, open online course on  curriculum and learning design.</p>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL PRESS RELEASE: </strong>The Open University&rsquo;s Institute of Educational Technology  is leading the first Open Learning Design Studio MOOC (Massive Open Online  Course) focusing on the theme of curriculum design with OERs, to be held in  Autumn 2012.</p>
<p>This course will be valuable for anyone seeking to develop their  professional skills and experience in curriculum design, learning design and use  of OERs in education. In particular the course will appeal to new and  established HE and FE lecturers, to those completing professional certificates  in teaching, and to researchers and managers of teaching and learning  innovation.</p>
<p>The course aims to (1) provide a rich open learning  experience for teaching and learning professionals (2) build greater skills and  understandings of Curriculum and Learning Design theories and frameworks, with  an emphasis on the reuse of OERs (3) help participants appreciate the need for  careful educational crafting of learning experience and associated curriculum  structures and (4) empower participants to become more effective educators and  change agents in their own context.</p>
<p>Eight core themes will provide the focus for weekly  activities, speaker presentations, discussions and postings of useful resources  and tools. It will give access to, and the opportunity to learn from, successful  UK JISC and HEA projects in addition to some of the best of European  initiatives. The resulting aggregate resource will remain online for future  use.</p>
<p>The term MOOC stands for &lsquo;Massive&rsquo; Open Online Course and  we expect to achieve an educational equivalent of this by offering truly open  opportunities to introduce new themes, debate topics and self-select material.  In addition, a basic underlying core pathway will offer an entry route for those  new to open courses or who have limited time.</p>
<p>Further details regarding how to get involved, start  dates, and core themes will be announced during the summer. In the meantime,  please register your interest here: <a title="blocked::http://goo.gl/j5jIe" href="http://goo.gl/j5jIe">http://goo.gl/j5jIe</a> (or use the embedded form below) so we can keep you informed.

<p>Embedding Information Literacy: Information literacy is a key component in the development of the student as an independent learner.  Where students are guided from the outset in developing IL skills they  will be better able to find, evaluate and use material to support their  learning, and to carry on learning throughout their employment and life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Using the cards: </strong>These  cards have been developed by the Open University's Library Services  Unit in collaboration with OULDI-JISC project (2011) and are designed to  help you consider how to effectively integrate information literacy  into individual modules and/ or whole programmes. They are grouped according to the 4 skills areas covered by the IL Levels Framework:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Understand the information landscape</li>
<li>Plan and carry out a search</li>
<li>Critically evaluate information</li>
<li>Manage and communicate your results</li>
</ol>&nbsp;Each skill area has 4 cards, one each for 1st, 2nd, 3rd and Masters level. On the front of each card you will find the broad skill area, and on the back the outcomes for the relevant level.  Use these cards in module team meetings, workshops and staff  development sessions, or to help explain IL to employers, tutors and  students.
<p><br />The cards will help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>decide on learning outcomes, teaching and assessment of IL skills at a particular level</li>
<li>think about IL skills across an entire programme and about how progression can be built-in</li>
<li>ensure that IL skills are explicit within learning and teaching,  thus enabling you to better articulate, teach and assess these skills</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/OULDI/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Library_Faciltation_Cards_v6.pdf" target="_blank">Printable pdf version of the cards</a></p>
<p>or access the Open University IL Levels Framework online: <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/ILLFramework">http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/ILLFramework</a></p>
<p><strong>Please note: </strong>The PDF contains 15 pages.  Print all 15 out back to back on a duplex print and then simply cut out  each card - the card will have been printed with the appropriate back. Guidelines to cut the cards are given. One printing of this document will give you:</p>
<ul>
<li>One each of 4 Level 1 cards</li>
<li>One each of 4 Level 2 cards</li>
<li>One each of 4 Level 3 cards</li>
<li>One each of 4 Masters Level cards</li>
<li>An overview card</li>
<li>A title card (slightly larger than the other cards)</li>
<li>An A4 (larger text) handout version of the overview card</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yandim/presentation-of-the-web-collage-tool">Web Collage</a> pattern-based tool is presented. This tool allows practitioners to produce IMS-LD compliant learning designs, instantiate them, and eventually deploy them (through Glue!PS) in a Virtual Learning Enviroment (such as Moodle, Wiki or LAMS).</p>
<p>The tool (in its latest version of Web Instance Collage 2) can be <strong>accessed</strong> on-line at <a href="http://pandora.tel.uva.es/wic2/">http://</a><a href="http://pandora.tel.uva.es/wic2/">pandora.tel.uva.es/wic2</a><a href="http://pandora.tel.uva.es/wic2/">/</a>.</p>
<p>A brief <a href="http://youtu.be/0C_AVMQ51Q8">video</a> can be seen at Youtube that describes the complete lifecycle of a learning design using Web Collage (and Glue!PS).</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yandim/implementing-the-pyramidbased-educational-scenario-using-wb-collage-worksheet">Worksheet</a> is provided to guide the <strong>production of the learning design</strong> corresponding to the sample pyramid-based educational scenario.</p>
<p>Another <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yandim/worksheet-of-deploying-a-learning-design-produced-by-web-collage-in-moodle">Worksheet</a> presents the way the derived learning design of the sample educational scenario is <strong>deployed</strong> (through Glue!PS) in the Moodle Virtual Learning.Environment.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>To start the challenge, I summarised the learning design for the Microclimate topic as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Activity 1: Students read summary material in 'Find my Topic' section. Students write own overview of what they will be focussing on.</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Activity 2: Students write hypothesis in 'Hypothesis' section</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Activity 3: Students read information on data and write own plan for data collection</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Activity 4: Students collect data using method chosen and enter in 'Collect Evidence' section</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Activity 5: Students view data using graphs etc in 'Analyse' section</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Activity 6: Students write conclusions in 'Respond' section</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Activity 7: Students share conclusions with others and discuss. Write summary in 'Share and Discuss' section</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Activity 8: Students write comments on investigation in 'Reflect' section</li>
</ul>
<div>There were insufficient details in the nQuire learning design to comment on the timings of the activities, the types of interactions and the assessment. However, it was possible to identify different levels of scaffolding of the activities and they have mapped easily to the template.&nbsp;</div>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5861</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5861</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><a title="WebInstanceCollage LD tool" href="http://pandora.tel.uva.es/wic/" target="_blank">WebInstanceCollage</a>&nbsp;is a web-based learning design authoring tool, which builds upon the idea of <a title="CLFPs @ EduTech wiki" href="http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Collaborative_learning_flow_pattern" target="_blank">collaborative learning flow patterns</a>&nbsp;(e.g. Jigsaw, Pyramid...) and assessment patterns, enabling and guiding teachers in building complex collaborative activities using graphical metaphors for these patterns, and combining and nesting them in various ways. &nbsp;The resulting designs can be exported using IMS-LD (level A).</p>
<p>The tool also allows for the particularization (or instantiation) of the designs to different particular situations, allowing for the definition of the number of groups and the participants in each of these groups (which can be extracted from existing LMSs).</p>
<p>When using this tool together with the <a title="Official GLUE! website" href="http://www.gsic.uva.es/glue/" target="_blank">GLUE! architecture</a> for integration of LMSs and external Web 2.0 tools (e.g. GoogleDocs, MediaWiki), a teacher can now design this kind of complex activities and deploy them in multiple LMSs like Moodle (see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCLw9sf68kA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCLw9sf68kA</a>).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Installation instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a title="WebInstanceCollage LD tool" href="http://pandora.tel.uva.es/wic/" target="_blank">WebInstanceCollage</a> is a web-based tool, so no installation is required (only a very simple registration is needed to use the tool).</p>

              <description><![CDATA[From the website: CADMOS is a learning design tool, that has been created in order to be used by novice learning designers, i.e. practitioners with basic computer skills and knowledge of learning standards. It is compatible to the IMS LD Level A/B standard and in the same time has a friendly interface by hiding any technical details from the designers-users.
Its characteristics are:
It can be used by practitioners with basic technical skills
It has a visual notation
It offers guidance to the designer
It describes different objects of the learning design, such as activities, resources, rules
The learning activities are described from different views (conceptual/flow model)
It can convert the learning design that is created with its own notation system, to an IMS-LD level A/B manifest file, which can be played by an IMS-LD compatible player such as RELOAD
It can import an IMS-LD manifest file and convert it to its own notation system

<p>The second example is a "template" version of the example above where the physics content has been removed, but all "generic" content for the POE structure is retained. Advice is provided in the template to assist an educator in adapting the template to their chosen topic area.</p>
<p>You can explore both designs in LessonLAMS.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>LessonLAMS is a new hosted version of LAMS that allows educators to</p>
<ul>
<li>Preview Learning Designs (ie, view as a learner)</li>
<li>Open/view/edit Learning Designs as an author, including a new simplified one page editor</li>
<li>Run Learning Designs with student groups of up to 30 students (using a URL + login code, or teacher-managed student accounts).</li>
</ul>
<p>A related feature to LessonLAMS is the new "Embed" feature, which allows a LAMS sequence which has been shared through the LAMS Community (http://www.lamscommunity.org/ ) to be "embedded" into a webpage (eg, blog). The embedded design can then be openned directly into LessonLAMS to allow for rapid editing or launching with students. For an example of a blog with embedded sequences, see http://jamesdalziel.blogspot.com/</p>
<p>For an example of an embedded sequence (based on the Predict Observe Explain example mentioned in Diana's lightning talk), see below:</p>

              <title>Criteria for Effective Learning Design: Review of models and methods</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5691</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5691</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Criteria sets or statements form the backbone of any benchmark or assessment methodology. The Capability Maturity Model, for example, has been used for enhancing the management of software production projects and is based on the idea of a staged method that promises to lead organisations from a position of immaturity to maturity makes a series of statements that define each &lsquo;level&rsquo; or &lsquo;process perspective.&rsquo; This has since attracted more widespread interest with the <a href="http://www.p3m3-officialsite.com/P3M3Model/P3M3Model.aspx">Portfolio, Programme and Project Management Maturity Model</a> or P3M3 (version 1: 2006, version 2: Sowden, 2010),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.utdc.vuw.ac.nz/research/emm/">E-Learning Maturity Model</a> (Marshall, 2006), <a href="http://d20ea7mklpzlrr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/OPAL-OEP-guidelines.pdf">Open Educational Practices Maturity Matrix</a>, (OPAL, 2011) broadly following in principle and structure. Also check out JISC's <a href="http://elearning.heacademy.ac.uk/weblogs/ea/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/bandpglossyfinal_update19mar09.pdf">E-learning Benchmarking and Pathfinder Project</a> and related <a href="http://elearning.heacademy.ac.uk/weblogs/benchmarking/">blog</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, this is a particular representation and method of how to understand the process of teaching and learning design and delivery. Each methodology&nbsp;will offer benefits such as useful techniques or ideas for criteria that define valuable processes or practices. For example, the maturity model identifies seven very useful aspects of management processes and ideas for constituent parts and has the scope to develop quite fine&nbsp;criteria/measures that&nbsp;promote greater&nbsp;clarity and transparency. Equally, each will have limitations - for example in this case some may consider the maturity model&nbsp;as too time consuming to implement, too simple a model of how complex systems evolve,&nbsp;or too prescriptive focusing on process rather than practices.</p>
<p>Reflecting on our experiences&nbsp;may help us to combine approaches and guard against too narrow a view of Curriculum Design audit and review.&nbsp;For example, when I was working recently on a project seeking to establish measures for benchmarking good assessment practice&nbsp;(<a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/22928/">Cross &amp; Whitelock, 2010</a>), two potential&nbsp;issues considered with a broadly maturity model approach were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potential for a &lsquo;false horizon&rsquo; &ndash; where a desire to achieve a maturity in <em>processes</em> becomes the goal rather than the aim of achieving the best, right or most effective practices, procedures or outcomes.</li>
<li>Importance&nbsp;of taking in to account multiple&nbsp;perspectives on a process. Basing a maturity benchmark on the written down processes or management reports could hide fragmented realities and perpetuate the &lsquo;it&rsquo;s-all-going-well&rsquo; narrative so an approach would need to mitigate for this. For example, we&nbsp;found that different stakeholders may have very different views about how well a process is working. By asking two or more questions relating to the same measure/indicator (about <em>both </em>process maturity <em>and </em>other things such as effectiveness, sufficiency, etc.)&nbsp;you can begin to triangulate perspectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>This cloud is the counterpart to a second which asks for your contributions to a bank of criteria for monitoring, managing and evaluating curriculum and learning design. We would encourage you to use that cloud to suggest specific criteria or measures and this cloud to discuss how these could be used - the pros and cons of particular methodologies (such as the maturity model).</p>
<p><em>We look forward to hearing your thoughts and reflections.</em></p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Work in progress - we would really value your thoughts...:-)</em></p>
<p>We are looking to help facilitate the creation a set of criteria for effective curriculum design<em>.<br /></em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5690/comments#contribute"><strong>Go straight to discussion</strong></a><br /></em></p>
<p>Over the last year or two many have voiced a need for a better definition of what a &lsquo;<em>good</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>effective</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>useful</em>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<em>right</em>&rsquo; curriculum and learning design is. We believe the first hurdle is to create&nbsp;as complete a set of criteria as possible. These criteria&nbsp;could then be used for a variety of purposes such as benchmarking, maturity review, base lining and quality enhancement purposes (just as similar initiatives for benchmarking e-learning, open educational resources or assessment are beginning to do).&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we would like from you are <em>statements </em>that in your experience</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>define good, desirable, even ideal learning design processes or practices and&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>are expressed in such a way as to be measurable or evaluable.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As we are talking about a whole gambit of formal and informal systems, it may help to think in turn about both the <em>processes</em> or <em>practices</em> associated with the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Course Design facilitation</li>
<li>Staff Training and Support</li>
<li>Quality assurance of final product/service</li>
<li>Management control and strategy</li>
<li>Communication of guidelines and support</li>
<li>Stakeholder engagement and involvement</li>
<li>Financial management</li>
<li>Risk and innovation management</li>
<li>Standards, guidelines and responsibilities</li>
<li>Management of resources</li>
<li>Monitoring, measurement and evaluation of processes </li>
</ul>
<p>This list is not definitive but intended to spark your thoughts. Please add to as many suggestions as possible in the comments below (or on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlpQljt8DLyXdHE0dzVLVXkyeXdBYXk5UzdQbFJ4OFE&hl=en_US#gid=0">Google Docs</a> sheet) and,&nbsp;at least every couple of weeks throughout the Autumn, we will be producing an updated compilation for people to review.&nbsp;Your suggestions&nbsp;could be something quite broad, or something quite specific,&nbsp;however do make sure&nbsp;each is phrased as single sentence statement (although feel free to&nbsp;add an explanation afterwards if you&rsquo;d like). Likewise, if you know of existing criteria that could be useful do let us know the URL.</p>
<p>Thank you for your contribution!</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The 2011 Pedagogic Planner meeting will be held in Oxford, UK on Thursday, 29th September.&nbsp; It is a forum for the discussion of issues in Learning Design and Pedagogic Planners. The original concept of these meetings was to bring together Learning Design experts from around the world to explore the concept of pedagogic planners, compare and contrast existing work in this field, and attempt to define future directions for research and implementation. &nbsp;James Dalziel will be facilitating the meeting together with Diana Laurillard and Liz Masterman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an invitation only event for those currently working in the Learning Design field but if you would like make enquiries about attending, please email James (<a href="mailto:james.dalziel@mq.edu.au">james.dalziel@mq.edu.au</a>).</p>]]></description>

The principal intervention made by IMS to achieve this goals has been to develop and publish specifications for eLearning interoperability. The initial focus of IMS was on interoperability of learning objects, and the &nbsp;specifications which they published for this purpose (such as IMS Content Packaging and Learning Object Metadata), together with applications such as RELOAD, &nbsp;made a substantial contribution to the ability of applications to share learning resources.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>In an attempt to use some of my newfound H800 learning I am attempting to make a change to my existing traditional (read boring) lessons to ones which involve the use of a wiki.&nbsp; Based on an idea by a fellow H800er I&rsquo;ve produced a compendium design which I submit to the Cloudworks community for full destructive testing. &nbsp;<br />The activity asks work placement students to each bring an issue/problem (which they are comfortable with) to the wiki, select one for discussion, identify the best solution and then possibly implement solution/practice back to workplace.</p>
<p>Any advice would be much appreciated. Has anyone tried this type of design in practice?&nbsp; Are there flaws to pick up on? Should other technologies/wiki features be incorporated?<br />Thank you<br />Adelaide</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This presentation is going to be part of the HEA Health eLearning Special Interest Group day: <strong>Revisiting Learning Design</strong> to be held at the&nbsp; Open University on 1st March 2011.</p>
<p>The eLearning SIG meeting event page with all the presentations and resources from the session can be found <a href="http://www.health.heacademy.ac.uk/news-events/eventsbox/events2011/elearnsig01032011">here</a></p>
<p><em>This practical session will give  an overview of the work of the JISC-funded Open University Learning Design  Initiative (OULDI) at the Open University and with our four partner  universities: Brunel, London South Bank, Reading  and Cambridge.  The project sees 'learning design' as an all encompassing term to cover the  process, representation, sharing and evaluation of designs from individual  learning activities, right up to whole curriculum level designs. We see learning  design as a conscious, creative and social activity, where tools,  representations and resources of learning design can be used to frame, guide and  mediate discourse between academic programme teams, support units, students and  employers. There will be opportunity both to consider how the approach might be  used in an HS&amp;P setting, and to participate in a short collaborative  learning design activity.</em></p>]]></description>

<p>The &lsquo;Co-generative Toolkit&rsquo; is a package of online resources to  support the planning, design, implementation and assessment of curricula  in higher education.</p>
<p>The toolkit, produced as an output of the JISC-funded <strong>Co-genT Project</strong>, was primarily set up to facilitate the co-generation of curricula by academics and employers <em><a href="http://resources.glos.ac.uk/tli/lets/projects/cogent/index.cfm" target="_blank">more...</a></em><br /> However, the resources are practical and versatile tools which can be  used by education professionals, employers, students, and the wider  public e.g. individuals who are seeking information on higher education  entry levels and provision across the sector.  Some functions are  restricted to registered users, but in general, the databases are  accessible to all.  The site as a whole is moderated by the Co-genT  Project Team.</p>
<p>The toolkit comprises four separate, but interfacing, components.  These are the <strong><em>Vocabulary Builder</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Outcome Builder</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Task Builder</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Design Builder</em></strong>.

              <title>CompendiumLD maps in SVG </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4161</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4161</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I can't make it to the meeting, but here's something that may be of interest. I'd be interested to hear from anyone else who has or is playing with SVG and learning design.</p>
<p>I've linked to a couple of <a title="CompendiumLD web site" href="http://compendiumld.open.ac.uk">CompendiumLD</a> maps in <a title="Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)" href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a> format. These have been created using a new prototype of CompendiumLD which allows SVG format exports of learning design maps. I think SVG is of interest with respect to learning design because</p>
<ul>
<li>it enables the maps to be edited in other graphic design tools e.g. Illustrator, CoreLDraw or Inkscape</li>
<li>it is rendered (displayed) <a title="Browser support for SVG" href="http://www.codedread.com/svg-support.php">by most browsers</a>, and IE support is coming</li>
<li>Web based manipulation (zooming, clipping, editing) of SVG files is possible now, and tool sets are developing (e.g. javascript libraries and browser based tools such as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/">SVG-edit</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The examples I've produced so far only include the visual information to render the maps in a browser. To enable more sphisticated manuipulation of the SVG maps via a browser, further work is necessary to include semantic information about each visual element in the SVG file. By semantic information I mean information to identify nodes and links of being of a particular type,&nbsp; e.g. that a node is a ''Task' node or a 'Tool' node.</p>
<p>By the way, I've linked to the SVG files because Cloudworks doesn't seem to render embedded SVG files. Could be me making a mistake when editting in the HTML view but I did try a couple of times!</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>GLO Maker 2 is an authoring tool for creating media rich learning<strong> </strong>objects. The learning objects can be accessed from the Web or the desktop. Since its release in August 2009 it has been downloaded in some 700 institutions in over 50 countries. The tool is free. It can be downloaded from the GLO maker web site (<a href="http://www.glomaker.org/">http://www.glomaker.org/</a>) which also supplies support in terms of examples, guides (including Camtasia movies)</p>
<p>At the core of good learning objects is good design. The learning designs are expressed explicitly in the tool. They provide the framework for creating new multimedia learning robjects.</p>
<p>The learning objects are easy to adapt to suit local needs and preferences. Simply load a learning object back into the tool, make the required changes and save the new adapted version.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The pace of current technological advancement is phenomenal. In the last few years we have seen the emergence of ever more sophisticated gaming technologies, rich, immersive virtual worlds and new social networking services that enable learners and teachers to connect and communicate in new ways. The pace of change looks set to continue as annual Horizon reports testify (<a href="http://www.nmc.org/horizon">http://www.nmc.org/horizon</a>). Clearly new technologies offer much in an educational context, with the promise of flexible, personalised and student-centred learning. Indeed research over the past few years, looking at learners&rsquo; use of technologies, has given us a rich picture of how learners of all ages are appropriating new tools within their own context, mixing different applications for finding/managing information and for communicating with others (Sharpe and Beetham, forthcoming).</p>
<p>This paper explores the question: &ldquo;What is likely to be the impact of an increasingly &lsquo;open&rsquo; technologically mediated learning environment on learning and teaching in the future? In a world where content and expertise is often free and where services are shifting to the &lsquo;cloud&rsquo;, what are the implications for education? The paper takes a particular position on the notion of &ldquo;openness&rdquo;; considering it from a broad perspective covering four major phases of the academic lifecycle: design, delivery, evaluation and research:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<p>Although the widespread use of social media reflects how Web 2.0 technologies have become embedded in our lives, there are still significant challenges in harnessing these and their related practices for learning. One expectation is that they will provide the means to reconcile informal and formal learning to allow for a more seamless transition between meaningful activity inside and outside of educational institutions or the workplace. But how do we support such processes or progressions? The approach adopted in this symposium is to see <em>design</em>, or <em>learning design</em>, as the key paradigm to address this challenge. But designing for this constantly evolving technological landscape creates new problems and complexities. This symposium will present different approaches to design from experts who specialise in the field of social software for learning, and who are concerned with both bridging informal and formal learning and questioning what we consider to be legitimate learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Will design really make a difference to practice?   
<ul>
<li>Role of theory?   
<ul>
<li>Tensions with practice?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are your own experiences of using social media for learning-teaching?</li>
<li>What social media tools do you use in your practice?</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Institution: University of Bolton</strong><br /><strong>Title of Learning Design or tool: ReCourse Learning Design Editor</strong><br /><strong>Short Description (optional):&nbsp;</strong>ReCourse is a tool to create IMS Learning Design compliant Units of Learning. It is free, open source, cross-platform and extensible. It was developed as part of the European-funded <a href="http://www.tencompetence.org" target="_blank">TENCompetence</a> project.</p>
<p>IMS Learning Design is extensive and complex, and there are very few effective and easy to use tools available which teachers can use to produce Units of Learning which are compliant with the specification. TENCompetence has developed ReCourse to provide learning designers with a solution.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simplified authoring interface. Authors can create the main structure of the Unit of Learning from a single learning flow grid.</li>
<li>Support for authors&rsquo; workflow.</li>
<li>A plug-in architecture has been provided which can link the authoring activity with other tasks.</li>
<li>UOLs can now be published and populated with learners directly from the ReCourse editor. A single click launches the published UOL in a browser. Users can also register themselves on UOLs, if they have permission.</li>
<li>Access to repositories has been integrated, so that authors can find and store the UOLs that they are working on.</li>
<li>Further integration with the Personal Competence Manager 2.0 is currently underway, enabling authors to align UOLs with a competence framework Integration with the runtime system enables users to author services</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Created using: ReCourse is written in Java using the Eclipse Rich Client Platform framework and is open sourced under a BSD-type licence. It is a modular system and can be easily extended by means of Eclipse-based plug-ins.</strong><br /><strong>URL of Learning Design/tool: <a href="http://tencompetence-project.bolton.ac.uk/ldauthor/index.html">http://tencompetence-project.bolton.ac.uk/ldauthor/index.html</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Open Source and available for download, a user guide is also available on the same page.</strong></p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>New technologies have immense potential for learning, but the sheer variety possible also creates challenges for learners in terms of navigating through an increasingly complex digital landscape and for teachers in terms of how to design and support learning interventions. How can learners and teachers make informed decisions about what technologies to use in the design and support of learning activities? This presentation will consider this question and present a new methodology for design &ndash; &lsquo;learning design&rsquo;, which aims to shift the creation and support of learning from what has traditionally been an implicit, belief-based practice to one that is explicit and design based. Learning design research at the Open University, UK has included the development of a set of conceptual design views, a tool for visualising designs (CompendiumLD) and a social networking site, for sharing and discussing learning and teaching ideas and designs (Cloudworks). An overview of this work will be provided, along with a discussion of the perceived benefits of this new approach to educational design.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract<br /></strong></p>
<p>The paper will explore the question: &ldquo;What is likely to be the impact of an increasingly &lsquo;open&rsquo; technologically mediated learning environment on learning and teaching in the future? In a world where content and expertise is often free and where services are shifting to the &lsquo;cloud&rsquo;, what are the implications for education? The paper takes a particular position on the notion of &ldquo;openness&rdquo;; considering it from a broad perspective covering four major phases of the academic lifecycle: design, delivery, evaluation and research:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Open design&rdquo;:</em> what would a vision of a truly open approach to design mean; beyond open educational resources towards a more explicit representation and sharing of the whole design process? A scenario of the future might be as follows: &ldquo;A newly formed course team brainstorm their initial ideas for the course, using visual representations which make conveying and sharing the essence of their ideas easy. They share this opening with others, through appropriate web 2.0 technologies. They invite comments &ndash; from other subject experts, from past students, from potential students. They use the web 2.0 space to continue to develop and refine their ideas, incorporating peer critique and leaving a visible audit trail of their design decisions and development process.&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Open delivery&rdquo;:</em> what would adopting a more open approach to delivery mean? What will be the impact of mixing institutional systems and freely available services? How can a more dialogic engagement for learning and teaching be fostered, starting as part of the design process described above but then carried forward during the delivery process?</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Open evaluation&rdquo;:</em> How can we harness and utilise the data we collect about learners on our course? How can we build on the understanding developed as part of the learner experience research work and the associated new methodologies? What new methodologies and approaches might we develop to gain new insights into the impact of a changing technological context for learning?</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Open research&rdquo;:</em> What will be the impact of the Open Access Movement for learning? How can we capitalise on the rich research data, which is now being made available on a global scale? </li>
</ul>
<p>The paper will consider these four aspects of openness, will suggest some underlying principles to adopting an &ldquo;open&rdquo; approach, reflecting on perceived benefits and challenges. It will draw on research at the Open University, UK. In particular, our work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning Design (where we are developing tools and resources to help teachers design better learning experiences) </li>
<li>Open Educational Resources and in particular articulation of the associated set of Open Educational Practices around the creation, use and management of OER</li>
<li>Changing patters of user behaviour and discourse through a new kind of social networking space, Cloudworks.</li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <title>How to...sharing a CompendiumLD Learning Design on Cloudworks</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3687</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3687</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Sharing, discussing and downloading a CompendiumLD learning design is easy to do using Cloudworks.&nbsp; Ideally Learning Design Clouds should include as a minimum both a picture of the design, a link to the zip file for others to download, and some explaination about the context it has been designed for (and possibly how well it's worked!) You may also choose to embed a video or slideshow, add links to resources such as websites and documents or add underpinning academic references. All of these will help promote discussion around the design.</p>
<h2>Sharing a design</h2>
<p>Cloudworks is not a repository so it is not possible to upload a file directly to a site. In this guide we will assume that you will use<a href="http://www.flickr.com/"> Flickr</a> to store Learning Design .jpegs and <a href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/static.py?hl=en&page=guide.cs&guide=21008">Google docs</a> to store your zip file but you could use other repositories, or even your own website.</p>
<p>Before you start, get a .jpeg (image file) of your design from CompendiumLD by opening the design, clicking on File &gt; Export &gt; Jpeg image file. Save the file and upload to Flickr (for more info go to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/photos/">Flickr FAQ</a>). Then export the learning design in a zip file by clicking on File &gt; Export &gt; Learning design file. Save this to your desktop and then upload to <a href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=guide.cs&guide=21008&topic=21010">Google docs</a>. Make sure that you have allowed sharing by clicking on Sharing &gt; Get the link to share&gt; Allow anyone with link to view.</p>
<p>Then...</p>
<p>Set up a new Cloud by clicking on '<a href="/cloud/add">Create a Cloud</a>'.</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Name your design</p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> Give a quick description of your design and the context in which you have used it. You may also want to explain what feedback or discussion you would like around your design i.e. would you like people to try it out and then tell you how they used it? Would you like suggestions about how to solve a design problem? Would you like technical or pedagogical advice?</p>
<p><strong>Add a link:</strong> Add the link to the zip file that you were given by Google docs</p>
<p>Once you have clicked on 'create a Cloud' you will be asked to add tags (to help others find your design) and then go to the Cloud. When you go to the Cloud, click on add embedded content and add the URL for your design image in Flickr.</p>
<p>Finally add your Cloud to the '<a href="/cloudscape/view/2101">Learning Activity Designs</a>' Cloudscape by clicking on 'Add Cloud to Cloudscape' then searching for 'Learning Activity Designs' and clicking on 'Add Cloud to Cloudscape'.</p>
<p>Done!</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>What is  Learning Design?</strong></p>
<div id="Section2">
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->The focus of  course designers is often first on covering the requisite ground in  a logical structure, second on developing the best possible  explications of difficult areas, and only third on lighting a fire  of inquiry in their students. &nbsp;This fire is nourished when  students are involved and challenged, stifled when they are passive  recipients of knowledge. &nbsp;Planning&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;learning  will happen needs as much consideration and care as <em>what </em>will be learnt. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>Design  Tools</strong></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Modern  technology can be integrated in teaching to give new flexibility in  teaching styles, whether at the level of activities, courses or  whole programmes. &nbsp;It also provides tools to help us extract  the benefits of that flexibility:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->- by making the  pedagogical structure more visible and explicit to students and  planners, thereby promoting understanding and reflection</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->- by serving as  a description or template to be collaborated on, adapted and reused</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->- by sharing best  practices and understanding between those involved in design and  teaching</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>Course  Tools</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>In spite of high expectations and the support given by prestigious funding and educational institutions, Open Educational Resources (OER) have not been adopted widely by teachers and learners in practice. From a cultural historical activity theory perspective, we argue that Mediating Artefacts (MA) such as OER learning design visual representations and rich narrative pedagogical patterns may enable a more effective OER cycle of creation, design, use and evaluation. More specifically, two main arguments are analysed in this paper: first, that making the inherent design of OER more explicit will make them more understandable and hence reusable; second, that offering a small set of simple patterns will encourage new ways to interpret OER and inspire re-purposing in new challenging contexts. A series of successful workshops was carried out and qualitative data gathered which provide initial evidence that a set of CSCL pedagogical patterns were found very suitable in order to repurpose resources intended for individual use and adjust the focus to make them suit new collaborative learning contexts. Interpretation of the data will form the basis for further workshops that aim to extend the idea of using targeted mediating artefacts to guide the design and repurposing of OER.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This activity is a variant on the idea of a webquest, it provides a fun ways of exploring the cloudworks site and sharing findings. The aim is to explore the site and to give you an idea of what it contains and how it can be used.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cluster into teams of 3 or 4</li>
<li>If you haven't already done so, create a <strong>Cloudworks account </strong>(you can view anything on the site, but to post comments or add anything you need an account)<strong><br /></strong></li>
<li>Spend a max of fifteen minutes <strong>exploring cloudworks </strong>(suggested stategies - browse clouds and cloudscapes, enter keywords in search, explore by tags, look at individual people's profiles </li>
<li>You may wish to open your search in a <strong>new tab or page </strong>in your browser so that you can easily navigate back to this cloud</li>
<li>If you are new to cloudworks you might like to take a look at our <a href="/cloudscape/view/1911">'using cloudworks cloudscape'</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Activities</strong></p>
<ul>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2605</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Outline of the day</h2>
<p>9.30 &ndash; 9.45&nbsp; Arrival activity Setting personal and team objectives</p>
<p>9.45 &ndash; 9.55 Welcome and introductions</p>
<p>9.55 &ndash; 10.15 Derek K Milligan - Blended Learning at Brunel</p>
<p>10.15 &ndash; 10.35<strong> Activity: How to ruin a course</strong></p>
<p>This activity will focus on the key issues and   strategies that impact on the success (or otherwise) of learning and teaching   within your context. The output of this activity will be a team checklist   which will be used as one of the design evaluation tools in the design review   and at the end of the workshop.</p>
<p>10.35 &ndash; 11.15 <strong>Activity: &lsquo;At a glance&rsquo; course map</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;We will propose 5 key components of a course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidance and support</li>
<li>Information and experience</li>
<li>Communication and experience</li>
<li>Thinking and reflection</li>
<li>Evidence and demonstration</li>
</ul>
<p>and introduce a framework/ tool to begin mapping   out the key elements and &lsquo;flavour&rsquo; of the module/ short course designs. We   will discuss the nature of the resultant representations and explore possible   uses of these.</p>
<p>11.15 &ndash; 11.30 Tea and coffee</p>
<p>11.30 &ndash; 12.00<strong> Activity: Design review</strong></p>
<p>We will introduce 3 tools which can be used at   various points in the design process to represent, inform and reflect on   designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogical profiler</li>
<li>Design decision assistant</li>
<li>Ruin a course checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>Each team will use these tools to evaluate their   designs and inform their design decision making.</p>
<p>12.00 &ndash; 12.40&nbsp; <strong>Activity: Stalls activity</strong></p>
<p>Teams will split in to focus groups. Individuals,   with the support of expert facilitators, will explore one of the following   themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Library, media services and accessibility</li>
<li>Open Educational Resources</li>
<li>Pedagogy (including assessment)</li>
<li>Visualisation and representations</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals will then rejoin their work teams,   share findings and consider what the impact of these findings might be the   emerging designs. The expert facilitators will be available to offer support   for the remainder of the workshop and will upload links and resources to   Cloudworks as appropriate.</p>
<p>12.40 &ndash; 1.30 Lunch</p>
<p>1.30 &ndash; 3.00 <strong>Activity: Visualising designs</strong></p>
<p>Using all the online and physical resources   available, teams will draw up a more detailed representation of their module.   These representations are likely to include i.e. sequence, learning outcomes,   outlines of activities, technologies used, assessment strategies etc. Using   Compendium it is also possible to create links to specific OERs, tools and   resources. Designs and discussions around design problems and decisions will   be added to the Cloudworks site &ndash; allowing for collaborative discussion   between teams and opening up discussion beyond the workshop.</p>
<p>3.00 &ndash; 3.15 Tea and coffee</p>
<p>3.15 &ndash; 3.45<strong> Activity: Design Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;This activity will provide an opportunity to view   and review the designs of other teams and give and receive feedback. It is   recognised that designs at this stage will contain detail but will not   necessarily be &lsquo;finished&rsquo;.</p>
<p>3.45 &ndash; 4.15<strong> Activity: Next steps and action   planning</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is hoped that this practical session will lead   to the design or redesign of modules/short courses and that these will be &lsquo;launched&rsquo;   over the next few months. This activity will give teams an opportunity to   identify the next steps in the design process and what further support they   may need from the University or the OULDI project team.</p>
<p>4.15 &ndash; 4.30 Close of session and evaluation of workshop</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Two laptops per team will be provided but please also feel free to bring your own if you would like to.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;So that your teams can export the Compendium maps and save any other work done on workshop laptops, please ensure that you bring at least one USB memory key with you per team.</em></p>]]></description>

The morning activities have been designed to give you&nbsp; the skills and knowledge you need.&nbsp; By this time you will have considered design questions such as staff to student ratio, balance of physical to online learning, the technologies you will use, assessment strategies, pedegogical approach and accessability issues. You, or someone in your team, will have learnt about approaches to visualisation and representataion too.</p>
<p>We recognise that this is just a one day workshop - and course designing often takes far longer than 6 hours - but we anticipate that by the end of this activity you will have a sound&nbsp; design outline on which to build. Please make proactive use all of the resources that you have to hand.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>In this activity you will move temporarily out of your curriculum teams and into special interest groups (stalls). The groups available for this session are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogy (including assessment</li>
<li>Library, Media services and Accessibility</li>
<li>Visualisations and representations</li>
<li>Open Educational resources</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure a good skills spead in your team, make sure at least 1 person goes along to each of the stalls.&nbsp; An expert will be facilitating each special interest group and the activity you will do in these groups is likely to be discussion based and focusing on some of the practicalities and also some of the issues. You will spend about 20 mins in your special interest group and then have an opportunity to feedback your findings to your team.</p>
<p>Learning outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develops Learning Design networks</li>
<li>Develops individual knowledge in an aspect of learning design/ e-pedagogy</li>
<li>Broadens teams' knowledge base in aspects of learning design/e-pedagogy</li>
</ul>

<p>In this activity evaluation/ reflection tools will be used to review teams' designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogy profile</li>
<li>Course dimensions</li>
<li>How to ruin a course checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>Each tool looks at a different aspect of your design, and each has strengths and limitations. It is intended that they should work effectively together.</p>
<p>1. Use the 3 tools to review your design (no more than 10 mins per tool)</p>
<p>2. Make a list of the changes you will make as a consequence of the review</p>
<p>3. Amend the design, save it to your pen drive and add to Slideshare</p>
<p>4. Update your&nbsp; Cloud with progress update and images as appropriate</p>]]></description>

The tool is text based and built around the premise that key learning design decisions will fall into one of&nbsp; 4 catagories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidance and support</li>
<li>Communication and collaboration</li>
<li>Reflection and demonstration</li>
<li>Content and experience</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'at a glance' representation gives a one-page overview of a module or course and can effectively communicate the 'flavour' or 'vision' of the course.</p>
<p>1. In your team, and using the Word proforma on the pen drive, outline your 'vision' of your module or short course.</p>
<p>2. Save a copy&nbsp; to the pen drive.</p>
<p>3. Upload to the workshop Slideshare account</p>
<p>4. Have a look at the other groups 'at a glance' representations and discuss the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well do the representations communicate the 'flavour of the course'?</li>
<li>Who might find this representation useful and when?</li>
<li>What would it be useful to add?</li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I have set up this cloud to gather views on different approaches to design in an educational context. This is in relation to the work we are doing at the Open University in the UK in terms of our<a href="http://ouldi.open.ac.uk"> OU Learning Design Initiative</a>. As part of this work we have just undertaken a major baseline mapping of our curriculum design - procedures and policies, as well as different stakeholder perspectives. We would love to gather your views, some questions you might like to consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you think pedagogy is fore-grounded within the work you do and within your institution?</li>
<li>How structured is the way in which you go about designing learning activites and resources for your students and how well it is integrated in the overall institutional production process?</li>
<li>How much focus do you place at the present time on pedagogic quality, cost-effectviness, innovation and fitness for purpose of the designs you produce?</li>
<li>What sense of comunity currently exists at your institution in terms of sharing and discussing learning and teaching ideas and designs?</li>
<li>What demand is there&nbsp; for teaching and learning communiites, for space to share and discuss learning and teaching ideas and designs?</li>
<li>How do you think cloudworks might help in terms of supporting sharing and discussing of learning and teaching ideas and designs, to what extent do you think educators will be willing to engage with the site?</li>
<li>What are your views about current approaches to curriculum design?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What tools and methods are you using to help you improve how you design learning activities and resourcs for your students? </li>
<li>What strategies are in place in your institutions to innovate and reform approaches to curriculum design?</li>

              <title>Talk Conole: Harnessing learning design as a new approach to  rethinking the curriculum</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2581</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2581</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Technologies appear to offer seductive educational possibilities: in terms of new forms of innovation, cost effectiveness, personalisation. The policy and research literature around ICT use in education is littered with discourses that exemplify this: &lsquo;ICT as a catalyst for change&rsquo;, &lsquo;new pedagogical innovation through ICT&rsquo;, &lsquo;the affordances of new technologies&rsquo;.&nbsp; But to what extent is this rhetoric matched by reality? To what extent have technologies in the last decade or so truly transformed learning and teaching? Evidence from the ground is mixed; whilst clearly technologies have increasingly become central in institutional strategic thinking; how much things have radically shifted &lsquo;on the ground&rsquo; is another matter.</p>
<p>The paper considers the issues raised by this conundrum, focusing in particular on the approach being adopted by the Open University in the UK to develop a new methodology for thinking about learning design. It will describe our approach; the tools we have developed to date and some of the issues evaluation findings have raised.</p>
<p>The vision for our work is to enable practitioners to make better use of technologies and pedagogical approaches to provide an enhanced learning experience.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Our approach (<a href="http://ouldi.open.ac.uk/">http://ouldi.open.ac.uk</a>) is predicated on three inter-related facets: gathering of empirical evidence on the design process (including case studies of tool use, interviews with practitioners, and workshops/focus groups), representing/visualising designs (including use of the CompendiumLD tool (Conole et al., 2008a)) and supporting practice through community engagement and sharing (via a social networking site for design &ndash; Cloudworks (Conole et al., 2008b)).</p>
<p>It will also discuss how we are extending the learning design methodology to application in the design and evaluation of Open Educational Resources, through a new initiative (<a href="http://olnet.org/">http://olnet.org</a>) funded by the Hewlett Foundation, started in January 2009 which integrates ourLearning Design approach with the Openlearn initiative (openlearn.open.ac.uk) (a repository of OERs developed from OU course materials). OLnet provides a basis for gathering evidence, developing methodologies, supporting involvement and gain value by aggregating and sharing information through appropriate infrastructure. Its aim is to be a global network for researchers, users and producers of OERs.</p>
<p>We contend that the approach we are adopting offers an innovative and holistic approach to instigating learning design. Rather than focusing on specific staff development activities or the development of a &lsquo;learning design tool&rsquo; we are adopting a multifaceted approach matching evolving user needs with an appropriate set of tools and resources. We see this as important as design is a complex process:</p>
<p>Design is a core part of any teaching or training role; i.e. how concepts can be presented to students to enable them to achieve a set of required learning outcomes. Educational text books might give the impression that there is a simple linear basis to the design process; starting with a set of learning outcomes, based on a particular pedagogical approach, appropriate resources, tools and activities are identified and linked together, assessment acting as the ultimate arbitrator in terms of success or failure. However in reality the design process is rarely so simple. [Conole, 2008]</p>
<p>Some of the key questions the research is addressing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the different forms of representation for articulating learning and teaching practice? How can each representation be used and by whom?</li>
<li>What forms of scaffolding and support can be provided to support the design process, in what ways might technologies be used to enable this?</li>
<li>What are the barriers and enablers to sharing learning and teaching practice? </li>
<li>Why do some social networking services work and others fail? Can we apply the best of Web 2.0 principles to an educational context? More specifically can we use this as a means of shifting teaching practice to a culture of sharing learning ideas and designs? </li>
<li>Can we harness the potential of technologies to create more engaging learning experiences for students? </li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Design in practice: aligning &lsquo;design creativity&rsquo; with &lsquo;design practice&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>New technologies offer exciting possibilities for education: new forms of communication and collaboration, rich, multimedia resources, immersion in authentic virtual worlds and gaming environments. However understanding how to use these technologies and how to design courses which capitalize on their potential is far from trivial. Furthermore, despite the fact that designing learning activities is a core aspect of education, the design process is purely understood and there is a tension between design creativity versus design planning. At the Open University in the UK we have a research and development initiative (the Open University Learning Design Initiative, <a href="http://ouldi.open.ac.uk/">http://ouldi.open.ac.uk</a>) which is developing a range of tools, methods and approached to help teachers and developers make more pedagogical informed and effective use of new technologies. The session will describe the initiative and work to date. In particular it will describe CompendiumLD a tool we have developed for visualizing and guiding the design process and Cloudworks a social networking site for sharing learning and teaching ideas. It will also outline how this work is feeding into a related project, Olnet (<a href="http://olnet.org/">http://olnet.org</a>) which is a global network to facilitate researchers and users of Open Educational Resources.</p>]]></description>

<li>Module or unit</li>
<li>Activity</li>
</ul>
<p>The Brunel Blended Design workshop will focus on representing at module or short course level but it should be noted that less work has been done around representing at this level. It is likely that you will take tools and strategies from both the Curriculum and Activity level 'toolboxes'.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>There are a number of ways in which you can share CompendiumLD maps: as jpeg images, as interactive web maps or as a zipped map. You can then make these available for others to download via the web or you can simply send the jpeg, url link or zipped file as an email attachment or on a usb stick.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use this cloud to share your jpeg images of your designs. </li>
<li>You can then upload the jpegs to a site like flckr or your own server</li>
<li>You can then add the image as embedded content once you have a direct URL for it.</li>
<li>The OpenLearn initiative (which is a repostitory of free Open Educational Resources, has an area called LabSpace in which you can upload and download compendium maps.</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This activity aims to help you make a resource or learning activity more collaborative in nature. It uses the CSCL collaborative pepedagogical patterns language developed at the University of Valladolid by Hern&aacute;ndez-Leo et al. The Appendix attached as a link to this cloud include ten collaborative pedagogical patterns - such as the Jigsaw, Brainstorm and Think-Pair_Share patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a resource or learnig activity</li>
<li>Reflect on how it might be improved (you may want to consider representing the design visually in something like CompendiumLD)</li>
<li>Explore the CSCL collaboraive patterns and use these as a basis for making the resource or activity more collaborative</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This view of a course focuses on the financial aspects. The examples provided are around Open University courses which are divided in two phases: production - where the course is developed and presentation - where it is delivered to students. The OU system has a range of roles associated with these phases - a core course team, supporting staff in other Centrai Academic Units (CAU) and associate lecturers or tutors. However this view could easily be adapted for general use. The key aspects are viewing types of costs, against income and total cost.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This representation enables you to view a course at "a glance". It shows the key components of the course in terms of five main facets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidance and support</li>
<li>Information and experience</li>
<li>Communication and interaction</li>
<li>Thinking and reflection</li>
<li>Evidence and demonstration</li>
</ul>
<p>The first being the support structure provided the next three the types of learning the student does and the last the way in which the learning is assessed.</p>
<p>Three variants of this representation are provided below:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tablular version giving further information about each of the facets, along with examples.</li>
<li>A 2-D map of the OU's KE312 course (created by Mick Jones).</li>
<li>A 3-D version which shows how both the guidance and support, and the evidence and demonstation link to all three types of learning the students does.</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Beetham provides a simple definition</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>"an interaction between a learner or learners and an environment (optionally including content resources, tools and instruments, computer systems and services, 'real world' events and objects) that is carried out in response to a task with an intended learning outcome." (Beetham, 2004)</em></p>
<p>Conole has developed a learning activity taxonomy (Conole, 2007; Conole, 2008) that attempts to consider all aspects and factors involved in developing a learning activity, from the pedagogical context in which the activity occurs through to the nature and types of tasks undertaken by the learner. The taxonomy is based on the premise that learning activities are achieved through completion of a series of tasks in order to achieve intended learning outcomes. The taxonomy was derived by working with practitioners to elicit the stages involved in the design process and consists of three main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>context</strong> within which the activity occurs; this includes the subject, level of difficulty, the intended learning outcomes and the environment within which the activity takes place. </li>
<li>The <strong>pedagogy </strong>(learning and teaching approaches) adopted. These are grouped into three categories &ndash; associative (acquisition of skills through sequences of concepts/tasks and feedback), cognitive (construction of meaning based on prior experience and context) and situative (learning in social and/or authentic settings).</li>
<li>The <strong>tasks </strong>undertaken, which specifies the type of task, the (teaching) techniques used to support the task, any associated tools and resources, the interaction and roles of those involved and the assessments associated with the learning activity. In particular the <em>types of tasks </em>&nbsp;which a student might do as part of the learning activity are described in detail and grouped into six categories; <em>assimilative</em> (attending and understanding content), <em>information handling</em> (e.g. gathering and classifying resources or manipulating data), <em>adaptive</em> (use of modelling or simulation software), <em>communicative</em> (dialogic activities, e.g. pair dialogues or group-based discussions), <em>productive</em> (construction of an artefact such as a written essay, new chemical compound or a sculpture) and <em>experiential</em> (practising skills in a particular context or undertaking an investigation). </li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Conole has developed a learning activity taxonomy which defines the components involved in a learning activity. There are six types of tasks which a student might do as part of the learning activity:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>assimilative</em> (attending and understanding content),&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>information handling</em> (e.g. gathering and classifying resources or manipulating data),&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>adaptive</em> (use of modelling or simulation software),&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>communicative</em> (dialogic activities, e.g. pair dialogues or group-based discussions), </li>
<li><em>productive </em>(construction of an artefact such as a written essay, new chemical compound or a sculpture)</li>
<li><em>experiential</em> (practising skills in a particular context or undertaking an investigation).</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This article describes the cog-learn tool, along with some case studies of its use.</p>
<p>From the article<br />Cog-Learn is a pattern language aimed at supporting the design of learning material for e-learning systems. Here, we describe Co-Learn and discuss the patterns' identification and formalization processes through two case studies in which a set of cognitive strategies was applied with the goal of better organizing the content seen by the student. The purpose is to facilitate the student's interaction with the material's interface and, consequently, improve the learning process.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This activity combines a tradtional reading circles activity with a discussion in chat</p>
<p>Learners are given roles (groups of 3-5 prepare the same role):</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion leaders (think of questions to maintain discussion of text)</li>
<li>Word people (collect useful words and explain how they help you to understand the text)</li>
<li>Passage people (collect 5 useful quotes)</li>
<li>Connectors (find links between the story and real life)</li>
</ul>
<p>Put learners in new groups and they share what they have prepared, with a representative of each role in the new group.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Diana Laurillard and Dejan Ljubojevic at the Pedagoical Planner Summit &amp; LAMS conference, Open University, 6-7th July 09talking about the work they are doing developing a Learning Design Support Environment (LDSE) which builds on the <a href="http://www.lkl.ac.uk/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=174&Itemid=91">LKL pedagogic planner: </a></em></p>
<ul>
<li>THE LDSE project is funded under the EPSRC/ESRC TLRP programme, see the following <a href="http://www.tlrp.org/tel/ldse/">link</a> for more information</li>
<li>LDSE aims to respond to the users&rsquo; requirements</li>
<li>Scaffolds the design process</li>
<li>Aim is to focus on users requirements to enable building on the work of others</li>
<li>Uses computation representations of a learning pattern to interpret thte learning experience it offers</li>
<li>Uses theoretical criteria like the Conversational Framework</li>
</ul>
<p>The system includes the follow sections and things a designer can do:</p>
<ul>
<li> Pathways to designs for a session</li>
<li> Can define: aims, prerequisites, duration, topics, learning outcomes, teaching methods, assessment, alignment &ndash; output validation document</li>
<li> Provides numerous prompts, checking, opportunities for refining: for example check definitions of LOs via prompts (an ontology of learning outcomes), etc select&nbsp; LOs, Select learning activity sequence, define keywords for topics</li>
<li> Can populate LAMS sequence 1 with content assets, preview, evaluate or edit learning sequence</li>
<li>Could select a learning approach &ndash; didactic instruction, collaborative learning, inquiry learning etc</li>
<li> Then type in a learning outcome &ndash; can search on existing set of outcomes to see which ones match</li>
<li> Also want to be able to model the kind of searching tool that the teacher is using</li>
<li> Experimenting with bringing these different tools together and making connects between them, a kind of scrapbook complier &ndash; can find existing resources and edit them and import into the LDSE tool and can annotate them:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; Can link to an authoring environment for creating and editing learning objects such as the GLO tool</li>
<li>Can also drag in LAMS sequences</li>
<li>A link to some existing examples such as iKOPER sequences</li>
<li>Can link into and edit phoebe examples</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Can provide a walk through scenario of what a users might do:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<blockquote><em>Instantiating and mapping to theoretical frameoworks</em></blockquote>
<blockquote>Diana also demonstrated how designs can be instantiated in runtime tools like <a href="http://www.lamsfoundation.org/">LAMS</a> as well as theoretical frameworks. The example she gave was mapping to Laurillard's<a href="http://www2.smumn.edu/deptpages/~instructtech/lol/laurillard/"> Conversational Framework</a>. Can map the learning activities to the learning roles, time taken, the teacher role and elapsed time and then show how that can be instantiated in a tool like LAMS and the&nbsp; interpret that in terms of how it maps to a theoretical framework such as the Conversational Framework <br /></blockquote>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Yael Kali talking about the Design Principle Database tool. From the website:</p>
<p><em>"Whether you are an educational technology researcher, a learning scientist, a designer of web-based learning materials, or a teacher using technology, the DPD is a place for you to learn from the wisdom gained by dozens of researchers who have designed, enacted with students, and studied the use of technology for learning. This wisdom is translated in the DPD into pedagogical </em><em>Design Principles at three grain-size levels, exemplified with </em><em>Design Features."</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.edu-design-principles.org/dp/designHome.php?PHPSESSID=e61fbb4fa0a8a12ac3e1edf4e1782e8e">Design Principles Database</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li> Not an authoring environment, it&rsquo;s a database of ideas, the idea is to collect good design knowledge, we are still trying to find ways to connect the different authoring environments</li>
<li>It's heirachical in structure, at the bottom have specific examples &ndash; CrystalLab, Geo3D, BlockStacking, WISE, Legacy Cycel, Symphony inquiry wheel &ndash; have about 30 design principles associated with 4 meta-principles For example: meta-principle &ldquo;Make thinking visible&rdquo; <br /> Three modes 1. Browse, 2. Participate, 3. Design</li>
<li> Can search and will return examples of features and principles, for example &ldquo;complexity&rdquo; &ndash; one example &lsquo;engage learners in complex projects&rsquo; shows the meta principles &ndash; and &lsquo;make contents accessible&rsquo; and &lsquo;promote autonomous life long learning&rsquo;. Provides a description and some pointers to further references and can see examples of how others have been using it.&nbsp; </li>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1852</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>
<b>Audience</b><br />
Workshop for researchers: OER researchers, learning design and pedagogical patterns researcher
</p>
<p>
<br />
<b>Focus of workshops</b><br />
•    To develop an evolving collective set of research questions and cumulative data for the area [Maybe some data that they can take away and analyse themselves]. Sharing of raw data – a principle of an open resource approach – to share and discuss<br />
•    To develop a shared understanding to define the intersections of the three domains and the benefits of combining them, to include: research questions, definitions, areas of activities, tensions and position, and core principles, what are the key journals and areas of activities<br />
•    To develop a shared research domain definition for this new field
</p>
<p>
<b>Resources<br />
</b>•    Key papers for the field – could we have an evolving list – papers plus discussion and in particular are there ones that are working at the interface<br />
•    Expertise database and funding sources<br />
•    Collective data gathering and reuse which can be mined for different purposes<br />
Data <br />
•    1. Collective share knowledge on key research questions, brainstorm and refine research question<br />
•    2. Data on research questions<br />
o    ‘’How do teachers do about the design process?” Source of data, findings, and then aggregate [Design strategies clouds, LD workshops, interviews with teacher]<br />
o    “What are the barriers to reuse of OER?<br />
•    3. Data mining of cumulative data sources [Could we draw in experts in other fields to help with this?]<br />
•    Existing tools, templates, processes and methods
</p>
<p>
<b>Activities/workshop ideas<br />
</b>•    Brainstorm of what they think are the key papers in the field and why and how they relate to this area – could set up clouds to discuss these<br />
•    Hashtag #olnetkeypapers and short rationale for why to read it<br />
•    Main research domain definitions - what are pedagogical patterns what are peoples perceptions of this – an evolving collective glossary for the field, could set up as a wiki, could have a jigsaw first, then brainstorm etc [Some sub-domains already have definitions, so need to hook into these]<br />
•    Virtual writing groups to develop shared understanding to define the intersections of the three domains: research questions, definitions, areas of activities, tensions and position, and core principles, what are the key journals and areas of activities<br />
•    Build a new social network for OER – share your network (and associated tools and resources) and exploit other people’s networks <br />
•    Thinking of ways of how each community can use each other’s resources – patterns – which OER should we be looking at? How can visualisation ideas from learning design be used in a pattern context<br />
•    Workshop on visualising patterns and metaphors for design <br />
</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The follow diagram is intended to give a flavour of a design cycle for the design and resource of Open Educational Resources (OER). In the centre is a representation of the process of design. Imagine a designer is creating a new resource and mapping their design process in a visualisation tool like CompendiumLD. As they work through the design process they can draw on existing content (from say existing OER repositories) and designs (say from existing design repositories or pedagogical pattern repositories). The use these pre-existing OER and Designs to general a new OER and a new associated design which can then be deposited back into OER and Design repositories.</p>

              <title>Ideas for Olnet activities</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1828</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1828</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[•    What do you think we as olnet should try to do to move this agenda forward (how can we use designs and patterns as an collective/combined approach to get more out of OERs)?<br />
•    The problem we are trying to address is that we have lots of good OERs but they aren’t being used and/or reused?<br />
•    Work in pairs – each person talks for 3 minutes, then reflect back thoughts to the wider group?<br />
Ideas<br />
•    A set of connected face-to-face workshops that might get the knowledge about patterns and learning designs and then try to use this in practice to improve practice<br />
•    Its important to have an expert research base for sharing practices and enable us to move beyond the workshops (cloudworks?)<br />
•    How can we structure the interface of mediating artefacts (tools, designs, patterns, etc) to support the open design process and how do we put these together so that they make sense<br />
•    Have all three things as inter-related <br />
•    Do a survey of real practitioners in the domain we are interested in to find out what is the maximum time they would be prepared today to look at sharing and use that as a constraint for the first set of interventions we develop<br />
•    Look at the way that patterns and the resources and the relationships between them can be summarised and how the visual representations can provide a more efficient way of applying/using the patterns or resources<br />
•    DO a deep analysis of all the learning design patterns that all the groups have produced. 1. Develop a taxonomy of learning patterns – what is used when by whom in what situation. 2. Identify the common bits and the possible relationships between different learning patterns – vision of what I would like to have as a design – I would like to be able to enter a need or a question, I would like to design a 3 week course on x and want to do collaboratively. Then decide step by step which tools, methods and patterns I want to use. Design patterns need to be fragmented as well so it can also be reused. <br />
•    An analysis of existing OERs and also same for patterns. Which patterns are suitable to be applied to which OERs and how does that happen? Also who is the audience – teachers and designers and individual learners. Issue of scalability. How much can we do online rather than in labour intensive workshops.  How do we virtualise a lot of what we do in face to face settings? <br />
•    Rather than solutions looking for problems – OERs (as very expensive “free” hammers)<br />
•    Current situation is separate communities not inter-connected – theorists, researchers, practitioners – need to find ways of making connections more explicit – constant conversation across these different communities<br />
•    Think of some scenarios of some potential new reuse scenarios and then test out some of these<br />

              <description><![CDATA[<b>Research questions</b><br />
•    What is a comprehensive set of tools and approaches for capturing designs?<br />
•    How do teachers and learners currently go about the design process? <br />
•    What would a facilitative design-interface layer between users and content/designs consist of? What tools, methods, approaches and workshop outlines would we need to include? <br />
•    How do we make the products of this work relevance to practice? Criteria for success:  do people use it! <br />
•    What is it that helps people take up and use OER and designs?<br />
•    How are people using our material (or not!)?<br />
•    Three types of actors and associated research questions:<br />
1.    How do we support teachers in the design of OERs or design the use of OERs?<br />
2.    Evaluating researchers in the OER field, how do we support them in the process of identifying, creating and visualising the OER designs and patterns?<br />
3.    What would good learning structures to support the use of OERs by learners look like?<br />

<p>Here's some text from the website</p>
<p><em>"Learning Score is an amazing multimedia lesson-planning and delivery tool that uses a music score metaphor to show the range of planned activities for a lesson as a graphical time line. The software also allows you to embed the resources you will use (pdf documents, video, audio, web sites) in the visual plan itself. Whole lessons can be saved with all their resources and annotations for later use and sharing."</em></p>]]></description>

<b>Overview</b><br />
The workshop will introduce participants to use a range of tools, methods and approaches to designing and evaluating Open Educational Resources (OERs). The session will include an overview of the OLnet initiative which is a new global network of support for researchers, users and producers of OERs. Participants will have a chance to try out some of the tools that have been developed as part of OLnet and to discuss relevance and application to their own practice. See also the related <a href="/node/562">Olnet cloudscape</a> and the <a href="/node/387">OULDI cloudscape</a>, which have additional resources.

              <title>Curriculum design representations</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1486</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1486</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The following are ideas for different types of representation that might be used to describe design at the curriculum level. Ten representations are suggested:</p>
<ol>
<li>Textual summary and keywords </li>
<li>At a glance map</li>
<li>Timeline</li>
<li>Content/topic/curriculum map</li>
<li>Workload &ndash; overall, distribution, breakdown</li>
<li>Principles/pedagogy matrix</li>
<li>Cost </li>
<li>Success criteria tick box</li>
<li>Relationships and inter-dependencies</li>
<li>Process flow maps </li>
</ol>
<p>Further information and some diagrams for each are available at <a href="http://e4innovation.com/?p=312">www.e4innovation.com</a>. A slideshare presentation given at a meeting in Strathclyde University on 21st April is available on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/grainne/jisc-curriculum-design-cluster-c-meeting-1331104">slideshare</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Textual summary and keywords </strong><br /> This representation provides a brief textual overview of the course (akin probably to what is already produced in course descriptions). In addition we would include keywords, which give an indication of the nature of the course. For us keywords might include a description of the type of course it is (in terms of mapping to some abstract model). At the OU we have identified six models: &lsquo;OU classic&rsquo;, bought-in, Web 2.0, wrap around, empty box, and disaggregated curriculum assets. In addition we would include a set of keywords that described the course generally, in terms of discipline, level and pedagogy (problem-based, dialogic, etc.).<br /> <br /><strong> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At a glance map<br /> </strong>This representation would list out all the components of the course. It would be possible to drill down into each component to find out more details about it &ndash; for example what tools are being used, when and for what purpose?<br /> <br /> <strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Timeline<br /> </strong>The timeline would distinguish between activities during the production phase of a course and those during the actual presentation/delivery of the course. In addition, a simplified student timeline (akin to what we in the OU in terms of the course calendar), giving a breakdown week by week of what the student has to do, along with key milestones such as assignment deadlines would be useful.&nbsp; For us for example each course starts with a Business Appraisal (BA), then there are eight &lsquo;stage gates&rsquo; (SG1 &ndash; SG8) over the production and presentation of the course. Other key moments include drafts of material (from D0 a rough outline of content and activities through to D2 a final draft).&nbsp; In terms of the student view &ndash; courses are divided into blocks with each block consisting of a number of weeks; key deadlines include TMAs (Tutor Marked Assignments) and ECA (End of Course Assignment).<br /> <br /> <strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Content/topic/curriculum map<br /> </strong>One way of representing content is showed below &ndash; where the content is organised by a series of themes and sub-themes.<br /> <br /> <strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Workload &ndash; overall, distribution, breakdown</strong></p>
<p>The workload representation would need to identify the stakeholders involved in the course and an allocation of their time involvement/costing across the production/presentation of the course. This could be presented as a simple aggregate of time/costs or broken down into appropriate timeframes (weeks or months)</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Principles/pedagogy matrix<br /> </strong>This representation articulates the pedagogical approach being adopted by the course and the overarching principles. The example we provide uses a schema we have developed previously, more details are available in a recent Ariadne article. It provides a matrix which maps the principles of the course against four macro-level aspects of pedagogy. Principles might be generated/articulated by the course team (for example getting the students to reflect on experience and show understanding or incorporating frequent interactive exercises and feedback across the course) or might be derived from theory or empirical evidence (for example the 12 REAP assessment principles). <br /> <br /> <br /> Furthermore we can then produce a set of &lsquo;Course Design DNAs&rsquo;, which can be used to compare the nature of different courses. Below is an example of two comparative DNAs. One for OpenLearn which is a repository of open educational resources and one for SocilaLearn which is an initiative applying web 2.0 tools and principles to an educational context. <br /> <br /> Variants on the matrix are also possible. For example mapping principles to course activities, or mapping the principles to a different set of pedagogical characteristics (for example Bloom&rsquo;s educational taxonomy, the REAP principles or Laurillard&rsquo;s conversational framework). <br /> <br /> <strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cost <br /> </strong>As with the timeline representation, cost would be broken down into production vs. presentation/delivery costs. As with the workload costs could be viewed across different timeframes.&nbsp; The people cost would be an aggregation of the workload representation discussed earlier, but in addition cost types include resources, media, assessment and administration. <br /> <br /> <strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Success criteria tick box<br /> </strong>This representation tries to articulate what constitutes a &lsquo;good course&rsquo;, what does good mean? At the OU we have identified four broad criteria for good; good in terms of: pedagogy, innovation, cost effectiveness and fitness for purpose/context.&nbsp; For each of these it is then possible to list a set of&nbsp; sub-criteria or demonstrations/evidence of how the course is &lsquo;good&rsquo; in terms of the four macro-criteria. <br /> <br /><strong> 9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Relationships and inter-dependencies<br /> </strong>We didn&rsquo;t really get onto articulating what this might look like but essentially this representation would show relationships and inter-dependencies at the course level. This might include a mapping of learning outcomes, topics and assessment for example, or a representation of media use across the course. Diana Laurillard&rsquo;s London Pedagogic Planner has attempted to do some aspects of this,&nbsp; as did the Media Advisor tool we developed a few years ago.<br /> <br /><strong> 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Process flow maps <br /> </strong>Finally UML-type representations can be used to show the process of curriculum design &ndash; who is involved and when and an indication of data flow across the system.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<b>Layered learning design – Tom Boyle</b><br />
<ul>
	<li>Why layers of design?</li>
	<li>Designs operate at many levels of granularity from small to very large</li>
	<li>We need to make pedagogical design of this design space</li>
	<li>LDSE aims to produce a set of tools and to support the full range of activity across this design space</li>
	<li>Explore productive relationships – with learning object aggregation models</li>
	<li>Delineating the layers – work from 50 years ago design futures of language – why is language so powerful?</li>
	<li>Concerns – conceptual accuracy and adequacy and usability</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
JISC D4L framework <br />
1.    Course design, <br />
2.    Session planning, <br />
3.    Activity design, <br />
4.    Learning object development
</p>
<p>
<b>Articulating the layers: <br />
</b>Module and sessions: simple session (class), module of 12 lectures, but also compound session (lecture plus labs)<br />
Session and learning activity – base-level learning activity, LAMS tools for orchestration of sequences of activities<br />
Where does dialogue based learning fit into this? At the compound level? 
</p>
<p>
Basis of any dialogue is exchange – question, answer, feedback as a base interaction
</p>
<p>
Can also have compound sessions
</p>
<p>
ALCOM abstract reference model for aggregating learning objects – Verbert et al. <br />
Series of levels: .1. Learning object designs (GLOs) 2. session plans 3. module design
</p>
<p>
A learning object is an instantiation of a learning design<br />
<b></b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Helen Beetham – designing for learning: educational sense in digital contexts<br />
</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>JISC Design for learning programme</li>
	<li>Extrinsic design – educational meaning</li>
	<li>In a teaching context are working within a designed context – the space has been designed, the books have been designed, the tools the students use – many of these artefacts were not explicitly designed for an educational context</li>
	<li>Move to intrinsic design – through the digital environment , can take more control of the design you are using than we could in the past</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Why design for learning?<br />
</b>Design 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is intentional purposeful approach to learning (of others)</li>
	<li>Represents intention so that it can be communicated and acted on in new contexts</li>
	<li>Supports structure or scaffolds actions</li>
	<li>Relies on general principles or rules of thumb but leaves room for contingent responses</li>
	<li>Is a skilful reflective evidence-based practice</li>
</ul>
<p>
Pedagogic intention can be articulated and enacted with the support of technology<br />
These articulations can be shared with other people and systems involved in the learning process<br />
•    The people are adopting new roles<br />
•    The systems are likely to be digital<br />
•    The learning process takes place in a TEL context
</p>
<p>
Communicating educational meaning through design<br />
Designer with a design intention who designed something – a mediating object which is delivered to a learner<br />
•    OpenContent, OpenCourseware, OpenLearn<br />
•    RLOs, GLOs, widgets<br />
•    IMS Learning Design, TENCompetence, ReCourse
</p>
<p>
But in reality this design is usually mediated by some other person, different kinds of representation might be needed for this level<br />
•    Communities of practice, Community tools, rules/protocols<br />
•    Ontologies, folksonomies, taxonomies<br />
•    Patterns and patter languages
</p>
<p>
Existing design practice is very varies<br />
Tools are rarely experienced by practitioners as pedagogically neutral
</p>
<p>
Design tools must enable collaborative design<br />
Tensions – diff levels of design, design for learning/design for teaching, representation, structure/flexibility of designs, aggregation/orchestration approaches and tools, the role of face to face interaction<br />
Orchestrating technologies – VLEs etc course or module as base unit, focus on purposes of the designer/institution. Top-down management<br />
But there has been a shift in recent years towards aggregating technologies<br />
Aggregating technologies – feeds, aggregators, drawing on web services, RLOs, widgets and applets, small scale learning outcomes, object or activity as base unit, focus on needs of user, modularity, reusability and interoperability, self-organising systems<br />
•    Old educational users – user requirements, text book ets tv, curriculum,<br />
•    Users 2.0 – agile development – tell us what you want today, searchers, wikis, youtube etc learners are doing the designing<br />
<br />
<b>Liz Masterman and Marion Manton<br />
</b>Pedagogy theory and pedagogic planning in digital worlds<br />
•    What is the value of theory to teachers?<br />
•    Pedagogical planners<br />
•    What do we mean by theory?<br />
•    How has theory has been embedded into three areas?<br />
(Lawes, 2004) Theory gives a framework of understanding that ultimately improves the quality of practice and leads to the transformation of subjective experience
</p>
<p>
Theory can provide a glue between technology and practice<br />
Teachers need help with using technology; the Trojan mouse effect (Sharpe and Oliver 2007). Planner tools can help with this providing advice and guidance about going about the design process<br />
How might we use theory in these planners?<br />
•    Theories – Cook, 2002 a means of understanding and predicting explanatory power<br />
•    Models – such as Kolb’s leaning cycle <br />
•    Frameworks – such as Laurillard’s Conversational 
</p>
<p>
Framework: a structure and vocabulary that support concepts<br />
What theories? Whole load of them –range of names, don’t correspond to each other<br />
What power do we endow their theories – strongly directly or just for device<br />
Comparison of three pedagogical planner tools – DialogPlus, phoebe, LPP<br />
•    DialogPlus – followed Mayes and De Freita classification of learning theories – associative, cognitive and situative. Learning outcomes related to Blooms and linked to tool type Laurillard. Provided context sensitive guidance for creation of learning activities<br />
•    Phoebe – context-sensitive guidance’s planning tool alongside a guidance tool provides just general guidance<br />
•    LPP Distilled theories and principles based on conversational framework
</p>
<p>
Practitioner’s responses to using these tools <br />
•    Many see theory as a cornerstone of professional practice<br />
•    But do teachers consciously espouse formal theories or are they more driven by prior experience and reflective practice?<br />
•    Distinction between theories of learning and e-learning is contentious<br />
•    Volume of explicitly material on theory on Pheobe could be daunting particularly for novice teachers<br />
New work in the TLRP TEL LDSE project<br />
•    Aim is to assemble a web-based environment for teachers – will be researching and trialling a number of tools<br />
•    Theories – Bloom’s taxonomy, Briggs CA, Laurillard CF and Kolb’s learning cycle<br />
•    Show uses how different models result in different kinds of learning experience<br />
•    Challenges – how do we deal with intuitive theories based on reflective practice, local institutional models, what kind of pedagogy model underpins the tool – need to shift from ‘present, practise, produce’ towards. ‘activate, engage, contribute’<br />

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>- factors in understanding/encouraging the take up of new ideas, changing rigid schemas, changing teachers' roles<o:p></o:p></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>- mental models of teaching as design: does it motivate? self monitoring and monitoring others<o:p></o:p></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>- reflection on practice: what form would it take? It would be an additional task, so would need to work out how it wouldn’t be an extra thing (what we understand from student reflection)<o:p></o:p></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>- what role might systemic levers play?<o:p></o:p></span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>- issues of openness and transparency = motivation, ethics (eg. involving student-teachers or early career academics), where are the boundaries, how private/public for individuals, what’s appropriate practice in sharing<o:p></o:p></span>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><em>From the website:</em></p>
<p>WEG's Beehive is an application that allows teachers and instructional designers to create multimedia collaborative learning activities using educational best practices described by <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=educational+design+patterns+goodyear+calvo&btnG=Search">educational design patterns</a></p>
<p>With Beehive, an instructor can create a synchronous collaboration space on the fly, that is optimized for a particular type of online learning activity (ie. group discussion, brainstorming session, debate, etc.) The tools and scaffolding that come together in this specialized space are based on the research-based educational design patterns available for that type of activity. An instructor can go further with advanced options and customize the space for their particular needs, or create their own activity type from scratch. They have a wide array of multimedia tools at their disposal, from video, audio, and text chat to stopwatch, slideshow and notetaking tools. They can also define a collaboration script, which describes how students will collaborate over time within a multiple-activity session.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Towards a research agenda for learning design research</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>What are the overarching goals?</li>
    <li>What are we looking for?</li>
    <li>How can we identify it?</li>
    <li>How can it be re-produced?</li>

    <li>To what extent can identification, production and measurement be automated</li>
    <li>What are the opportunities and limitations/pitfalls of this area of research?</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential actions</strong></p>
<p>1. Work towards a shared ontology for the field and a shared set of definitions</p>
<p>2. Identify the inter-relationship between research areas and where they align and don&rsquo;t</p>
<p>3. Need to try and formualte a set of research questions, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What different design representations are there - what and whom are they for?</li>
    <li>What are the effects of learning design, what differentce does it make to teacher practice</li>
    <li>and to the learner experience?</li>
    <li>What are the theories and different prespectives of design (their capacity and preferences)?</li>
    <li>How are designs interpreted, validated and evaluated?</li>
    <li>Better understanding of the process and issues around sharing and repurposing of designs?</li>
    <li>We need to capture and analyse teachers' design practice?</li>

<p>Learning design sits within the same quadrant<br />
<br />
1. In terms of fundamental understanding the focus of learning design research is: <br />
Teachers&rsquo; design practices<br />
Design qualities<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Valid <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well-specified <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interpreter<br />
<br />
2. In terms of use inspiration, the focus of learning design research is:</p>
<p>Improvement of education through improvement of &lsquo;teaching as design&rsquo;</p>
<p>through provision of better tools and methods</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>There are a number of levels of design &ndash; activity, subject, course, degree <br />
Different learning design tools are valauble at different levels of design</p>
<p><br />
There is a continuum of skills in terms of design and each will be supported by</p>
<p>different kinds of support:</p>
<ul>
    <li>From novice (recipe), experience (scaffold, examples), skilled (best practice)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The LAMS activity planner aims to give just in time support mapped to different</p>
<p>skills levels</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Designs suggested</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Investigating alternative perspectives</li>
    <li>Problem-based llearning</li>
    <li>Equiry-based learning</li>
    <li>Role play</li>
    <li>Project/case study</li>
    <li>Predict, observe explain</li>
    <li>PEEL activities</li>
    <li>Collaborative learning using online discussion</li>
    <li>Learner group activities</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Two layers to pedagogical planners</p>
<p><em>Teacher</em> - using a pedagogic planner</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select template via decision process</li>
    <li>Fill in essential content/tasks</li>
    <li>Preview, iterate, run (share)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Designer</em> - Creating a pedagogic planner:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a decision process</li>
    <li>Create a pre-configured template</li>
    <li>Link to/install decisions and templates</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Stages</em></p>
<p>Stage 1: is for reflection on context, student needs, topic, constraints, etc</p>
<p>Can be a guided process (linear or cyclic), tagged repository etc</p>
<p>Software can this be previewed and run</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Some of the ideas and discussions from the Pedagogial Design Summit, 8th Dec 08, Sydney</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>J. Daziel<br />
</em></p>
<p>Problematising the areas, three key themes</p>
<ol>
    <li>Levels approach to thinking. The level at which you apply the planner &ndash; scale and process LAMS mainly at class level in terms of a sequence, not a 2min activity neither at level of whole course or whole degree. PBL might be a commitment of a whole medical faculty and can then drill down at different levels</li>
    <li>Time. What level of effort do teachers have to put in before they see benefit. LPP captures how much there is in terms of thinking about planning a design. Effective where there are course in process of major redesign. Contrast with opposite where lecturers have no time &ndash; can they have something small and quick and effective. Context and readiness of lectures.</li>
    <li>Patterns. Provide people with some advice and proposed solutions &ndash; they are still at a level of generality &ndash; still need to contextualise and add some level of creativity.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><em>S. Bennett</em></p>
<p>Use of a visual representation adapted from Ron Oliver's work -</p>
<p>in terms of Tasks, Resources and Support</p>
<p></p>
<p>In-depth studies of teachers' design processes</p>
<ul>
    <li>Major influences - their discipline, and what they know or think about students</li>
    <li>Mainly get their ideas from different teachers</li>
    <li>Support units mainly useful in their early years of teaching</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Learning designs as practice</p>
<ul>
    <li>Not templates or recipes</li>
    <li>Are patterns or sequences which captur the design logic</li>
    <li>Should be adaptable and customisable (reusable)</li>
    <li>Not limited to IT-based support systems or IT-supported learning experiences</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Laurillard<br />
</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Mapping LAMS activities to the conversational framework</li>
    <li>To what extent can we represent the pedagogic structure and rationale of a</li>
    <li>learning design in a way that can be compared computationally with other</li>
    <li>designs, formal theories and learner experience?</li>

    <li>Open education and where that is going and how LAMS fits within that</li>
    <li>New version of LAMS V2.2 launched today</li>
    <li>Ideas for new visualisations</li>
</ul>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Open Education</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.capetowndeclaration.org">Cape Town Declaration</a> provides a statement of principles for free sharing for open education.</p>
<p>Everyone should have the freedom to use, customize, improve and redistribute educational<br />
resources without constraint:</p>
<ul>
    <li>free to use (no cost),</li>
    <li>freedom to change</li>
    <li>LAMS is an example of Open Education - open source software and the LAMS community</li>
    <li>Capture and describe good pedagogical approaches</li>
    <li>Make those approaches shareable</li>
    <li>Make it easy to adapt and improve shared approaches</li>
</ul>
<p>[but avoiding closed softeare and file formats]</p>

<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>New <a href="http://lamsfoundation.org/">LAMS foundation website</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Release of LAMS V2.2 - includes branching in v2.2 and optional sequences</p>
<p>4 new activity tools</p>

<p><em>Visualisation</em><br />
Visual presentation of LAMS is a key feature, helps make teachers think differently </p>
<p>Every visualisation is a simplification </p>
<p>New visualisation ideas</p>
<p>Unified modelling language - uses severl differnet visualisations</p>
<p>Some possibilities (tabs to different representations)</p>
<ul>
    <li>Content view</li>
    <li>Annotation view - great out and doodle on it in free form</li>
    <li>Resizable boxes to indicate the importance of different activities</li>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Focus of the LDSE project is</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Need to understand how to foster collaborative learning among teachers as learners about e-learning</li>
    <li>Teachers need to be more like researchers</li>
    <li>They lack the tools and means to do it, to build on each others work, redesign, experiment, share, reflect and collaborative</li>
    <li></li>

<p><strong> User requirements elicited around 6 areas</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><em>Planning</em> &ndash; align components of LD within and between diff levels of course, module etc</li>
    <li><em>Decision-making </em>&ndash; review implications of a decision for other parts of the process &amp; revise</li>
    <li><em>Progressive innovation</em> &ndash; link to relevant advice etc</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>We ran this as a one day event in Sept 08 for our Faculty for Languages and Education. Faculty were put into teams of 8 - we had 9 teams. The challenge was to design a short course in a day. Each team had a table with lots of materials on, flip charts and three internet computers with our visualisation tool for design, CompendiumLD, preloaded. Around the room were a series of resource stalls with experts on hand to provide advice on a range of things: How to find relevant resources on the internet, strategies for design, case studies of practice - how others had used second life, mobile learning, web 2.0 tools etc. Also support staff from educational development, technical support, the library etc were available. The day was structured to guide teams through the process. There was a really buzz to the day and teams reported that they found the stall useful and felt they achieved a huge amount in a day.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/445</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/445</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Here is the abstract:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem of contextualisation is one which has plagued re-use. The challenges of writing content so that it is &lsquo;context-free&rsquo; and blending content from elsewhere with your own content are not trivial. What we once thought was simple now appears to be a persistent problem. Re-purposing content is popular with re-users, but may be perceived as a threat to quality by those offering reusable content. How can we resolve this? There are examples of effective practice, but these often exist within the courses and are not themselves connected or shared.</p>
<p>Perhaps communities hooked into social networking tools are the key? Cloudworks and its development towards &lsquo;cloudscapes&rsquo;, is in development at the OU as a social tool for sharing contextual information about learning design and learning content within and across communities. Where better to explore this and other social systems than within the NDLR communities? Bring a laptop and wifi to start building a cloud during this session, but even those without the gadgets should come prepared to share ideas and examples of contextualisation in practice.</p>
<p>If you are reading this on 2nd December then you may be able to catch the live webcast at <a>http://live.heanet.ie/ndlr.asx</a> (later it will be available from the NDLR site.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Conole et al. (2004) have developed a pedagogical framework that abstracts out three main dimensions of learning. The 3 dimensions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual &ndash; social: i.e. any learning activity can be located somewhere along a spectrum from being an individual, isolated experience to being essentially social in nature</li>
<li>Active &ndash; passive: i.e. some learning activities involve active engagement, whereas other aspects of learning may occur through some degree of passive immersion</li>
<li>Information &ndash; experience: learning activities vary in the degree to which they are information or experience based.</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework can be used as a basis for mapping out the use of different tools. The dimensional basis of the framework means that you can consider the three dimensions as spectral and hence look at tool use along each of these spectral &ndash; i.e. not as a binary decision &ndash; so use of a tool to support an activity does not have to be labeled as simple an individual or a social activity it can lie somewhere along the spectrum of individual-social.</p>
<p>Try to indicate the location of the following &lsquo;tools in use &lsquo;on the three dimensions (or continua) of the framework:</p>
<ul>
<li> A blog as a reflective diary </li>
<li> A blog as a collective resource for collating references within a student group </li>
<li> A web search: i.e. students search the web and collate resources against a given set of criteria </li>
<li> A drill and practice exercise: i.e. students work through a set of resource and then complete a formative self-assessment </li>
<li>A structured online debate: i.e. students choose a side for or against an issue, post their views and read other postings </li>
<li>Use of an e-portfolio: i.e. students gather evidence against learning outcomes in a portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p>A diagram of the framework can be found in Conole (2008), ariadne article, link below.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>You are going to begin by exploring different repositories of resources to find information that might be of relevance to a particular teaching scenario. Start by choosing one of the following scenarios (or outline your own) as the teaching and learning context for you explorations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refresher course for returner nurses, providing skills update and outline of latest changes in legislation, etc. Use an e-portfolio as the main vehicle of students demonstrating evidence </li>
<li>Beginners social work course, large cohort of students, want to encourage lots of communication and ways of students practicing their interpersonal skills </li>
<li>Final year research project in which students need to demonstrate an evidence-based approach </li>
<li>Large cohort introductory statistics course for students in a range of different disciplines</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloudworks is a social networking site for sharing learning and teaching ideas and design. Use the Cloudworks site to help you find useful resources and ideas for your design and suggestions for how you might incorporate different technologies. In terms of specific sites on technologies and how they might be used in an educations context you might want to look in particular at the Educause 7 things you should know about series (see link below). Write down things you like and don&rsquo;t like about the particular resource collection(s) explored. Note the strategies you are using to search in order to locate resources, etc. that are appropriate for your chosen scenario. How useful were the different sites? How useful was the information they provided? What was missing?</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[Go to the CompendiumLD web site, which will provide details of how to download CompendiumLD and get starting in using the tool. Once it is downloaded click on the CompendiumLD icon and explore the software, you will find there is further help within the software itself, include links to various short video slidecasts. Once you are comfortable in general with the software, you can start on the main focus of the activity that is to map a simple learning activity. Now start to map out this activity in CompendiumLD. Reflect on the following questions. Keep a note of what you like and dislike about using this tool and think about how you might use this (individually or within a team) in your own context of practice. Save your design as a jpg. What do you think are its main strengths and weakness? Can you see yourself using this in the future? If so how?
To what extent this visual representation actually represents the original design intentions, what’s missing? Can you think of other ways in which the design could be represented and shared?

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Consider the following questions about strategies for design. If you are not directly involved in teaching or in devising courses, you should think about the modules, classes or programmes that you support in some way. Share your thoughts with others here on Cloudworks</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you (or your teaching colleagues) currently design courses?</li>
<li>How do you and/or your teaching colleagues get new ideas?</li>
<li>What resources and support are used?</li>
<li>What issues do new technologies raise for teaching and learning?</li>
