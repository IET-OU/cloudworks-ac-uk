<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Project Title &ndash; <strong><em>Designing a mini-MOOC for Assessor Training on the verification systems in Further Education&rsquo;.</em></strong></p>
<p>MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have been well established in Higher Education (HE) and for many studies this has been the primary focus (Andreatos, 2015; Evans et al., 2016).</p>
<p>However, few studies have empirically examined the influence of MOOCs in an organisational setting and more research is required to explore how MOOCs affect employee learning and development in the workplace (Dodson et al., 2015; Egloffstein and Ifenthaler, 2017).</p>
<p>With this notion research has shown the transformation of MOOC initiatives progressively moving towards the more corporate training and development sectors (Savino, 2014). According to Savino (2014) corporate leaders and training professionals have become aware how MOOCs can <em>&lsquo;supplement and support corporate training&rsquo;</em> (Savino, 2014, p. 59). Drawing on the study conducted by Savino (2014) the paper examines how MOOCs are used in both HE and corporate training and learning.&nbsp; Further prompting the idea that this method could be used in training employees (Weiss, 2013), I have taken these viewpoints to further add support to my rationale in conducting this activity and the impetus on staff development.</p>
<p>The H818 Online conference theme will focus on innovation and the scope of my idea will discuss the viability of using mini-MOOCs for training and professional development purposes.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to design a mini-MOOC to train assessors on the verification systems used in the context of a Further Education setting. The intention of bridging the skills gap in staff and promoting further development for staff to eventually become internal verifiers for the school.&nbsp; The demonstration will involve discussing elements of layout and themes from an adapted MOOC idea to create a multimedia presentation using Adobe Spark to create slides of my proposed mini-MOOC design. Furthermore, uploading the video presentation to a YouTube platform. There is scope to use Canvas which builds on the idea of teaching and learning with its &lsquo;intuitive&rsquo; interface which increases its adoption and appeal to any developer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically, it has shown that expensive, offsite training had proved ineffective, due to the lack of external support given by some awarding bodies. As Lead Internal Verifier for my centre and providing face to face training, this also presented itself with many challenges.&nbsp; For example, poor staff turnout to the sessions due to work commitments, collaboration not effectively used and some staff reluctant to share ideas.&nbsp; Therefore, due to time and staff commitment issues, looking at openness through the lens of innovation can potentially help to deliver a more innovative form of training and worth exploring.</p>
<p>Training materials will be resourced from the awarding body amalgamated with my own resources to provide the project materials in my design.&nbsp; It is likely that I will be faced with several pedagogical challenges, such as the reluctance for participants to share more openly.&nbsp; Therefore, further research into using situated &lsquo;Design Patterns&rsquo; is paramount to seek possible solutions to such issues (Liyanagunawardena et al., 2015).</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Together Alone: Trello in the art classroom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Monday 18th Feb 2019 at 19:30</strong></p>
<p>This conference presentation will look at the introduction of ‘productivity platform’ Trello (2019) as a technology enhanced learning tool (TEL) to promote inclusion for complex Special Educational Needs (SEN) students. As well as a project management and productivity tool, Trello is currently being ‘repurposed’ (Conole, 2018) to ‘suit’ a different ‘context’ (Agostinho, 2011)  by Further Education (FE) Creative Arts students. The talk will explore how positive personal or ‘expansive’ attributes (Lucas et. al, 2013) contribute to and develop learner experience with Trello as collaborative TEL.  </p>
<p>The inclusive ‘expansive’ area central for this SEN College is ‘enabling independence’ (Treloar’s, 2018) for learners with disabilities. The talk will look at this stimulus for the project: recognising that barriers to inclusion can exist not only within physical but also mental bubbles of isolation within the classroom for these students. It was observed that college cohorts often have more interaction with teaching and support staff than in class peers.</p>
<p>Trello was proposed as a flexible platform to allow this cohort of FE students the scope to work in a visual virtual classroom. The presentation will showcase how Trello gives an opportunity for improved digital literacies. There are opportunities to create digital mood boards, multiple forms of posting functionalities from animated GIFs to YouTube clips to standard blogging textual features along with response functionalities from text comments to virtual stickers. As independence in this context is measured on the scale of support required for students to complete tasks in familiar to unfamiliar situations, the introduction of Trello places these students into an unfamiliar learning environment with mainly peer support. This approach, therefore, rates highly on Independence Learning Plans (ILPs) which are used to support students for life beyond the college.</p>
<p>The presentation will also demonstrate a ‘social emancipatory’ (Nouri & Sajjadi, 2018) model in action. Students have a voice within the investigation and take an active part not only in the pre-project testing of potential tools for use in the project but also key decision making and tracking progress. The project has allowed for input into a ‘situated’ (Brown, 1989) learning design and software implementation with learners ‘modelling behaviour’ (Kallick  & Costa, 2014) from each other and staff during the process.</p>
<p>The talk will conclude by looking at the early results from this six-month project. This will include an extract from an interview with the lead researcher and lead student researcher on status of the project and possible outcomes. The interview will explore researcher views and evidence to date by asking:</p>
<p><strong>·        Will independence increase via ‘acquisition’ of new skills and ‘participation’ with Trello (Sfard, 1998)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>·        Could finding ‘a suitable voice’ (Kerawalla et al, 2008) for learning within digital environments develop digital literacy overall?</strong></p>
<p><strong>·        Is independence via inclusive collaborative TEL for students with disabilities who have historically experienced ‘systemic barriers in education’ (Malhotra, 2015) an achievable outcome?</strong></p>
<p>The full interview will be available after the presentation as an Open Educational Resource (OER) in a multimedia format.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Digitalisation transforms our society in manifold ways and a profession such as Social Work needs to respond to these transformations. Likewise, social work education needs to revisit its curricula and teaching methods. However, the speed at which transformations are happening is often overstraining the capabilities of innovation, adoption and implementation of educational institutions and their stakeholders (Davis et al., 2018). This is especially the case for a discipline like Social Work with a rather uneasy relationship with technology (Taylor, 2017).</p>
<p>My project addresses this complex challenge by implementing a playground learning environment into social work bachelor and master curricula. This playground learning environment is directed towards a twofold purpose: it (a) equips students with skills and competences for their professional practice in the digital world and (b) allows teachers to gain experiences with education technology as well as rethinking their roles as guides and facilitators. Both learning experiences are as crucial as they are challenging (Adams Becker et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Setting a playground learning environment apart from the core topics and related skills and competences of the discipline of Social Work is expected to act as a threshold concept for the second purpose (Meyer and Land, 2003). Rather than comprehensive documentation, such an environment can showcase &lsquo;good practice&rsquo;, enable direct experience with online learning opportunities, and serve as a transparent reference for discussing difficulties among teachers. Thus, it can help overcome preconceptions regarding the digitally mediated interrelatedness of people and content and foster the implementation of education technology in a shifting environment.</p>
<p>At the H818 Online Conference 2019, I will present the project and context in more detail. I am involved in revising both the bachelor and master curriculum in Social Work at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences and will explain strategy, approach and major challenges for implementing education technology at this institution. I will focus on <a href="https://app.webjets.io/p/WYZtFK0GbPVCwBC2yO94kzT3On72/-LWIJn3TkbYZJYx3rlDc" target="_blank">design and purpose of the planned playground learning environment</a>. In order to explore this approach in more detail, a prototype course will be available for conference attendees with a specific interest in this topic before, during and after the conference Based on the experiences running this prototype course, we will discuss opportunities, strengths and weaknesses of such an approach in a workshop. In my presentation I will provide an overiview on the prototype course and findings from running the prototype so far.</p>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11907</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Making the switch to use different technologies and Open Practice can be a massive decision, but, there are many benefits to using Google's G Suite despite its currently small market share compared to Office 365 (Rayome, 2018). Influence on Open Practice is one such benefit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Innovation often comes with big risks attached that requires a metaphorical leap of faith in order for the innovators and early adopters to begin a process of diffusion throughout an institution (Rogers, 2003).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presentation will address initial findings into how G Suite for Education has influenced the agency of Open Practice within a Further Education college that made the leap away from a paper and Office 365 based strategy to Google&rsquo;s package of Apps. The findings will address how practice has changed towards open practices, regardless of intention.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are a number of operational issues that can plague institutions both economically and technologically that can be compounded by relying on application packages such as office 365. Education in the UK has suffered a funding crisis for a number of years that has resulted in colleges having to cut operational costs. Office 365 comes with higher costs and a more individual customisation which requires overhead costs either in internal or external staff to maintain. G suite is completely cloud based requiring only a low level onsite skill-set to maintain the administrator console. (Magnusson, 2018)</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Professor Clayton Christensen (2014), what we should be looking at is to target innovation that can change the way students learn and is more about how technology is applied in a more peer to peer manner. He goes on to suggest many Practices which have similarities to Open Educational Practice (OEP).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The potential benefits and limits of Open Education Practice are widely reported in the literature and explored briefly in this paper. However, there is a lack of empirical data about the use of Open Educational Practices, particularly in institutions without Open Education. OEP is a broad descriptor that includes the creation, use and reuse of OER, open pedagogies, and open sharing of teaching practices (Cronin, 2017)</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is currently very little literature in regards to G suite for education, Google classroom and Google apps in the primary to tertiary (16-19) level (Bartolo, 2017) of enough breadth and depth to be meaningful.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The approach to the project has been to gain an in depth insight to the capabilities and functions of G Suite, beyond that of a simple word processor, spreadsheet, slideshow and Virtual Learning Environment Repository and explore how these functions are being used within a College, both intentionally and unintentionally focusing on Open Educational Practice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project gains insight from a number of sources: G Suite administrator fundamentals MOOC, Online conferences such as ALT-C and Ditchsummit.com, Networking through social media, networking and interviews with Colleagues including the Vice Principal for Learning and Quality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presentation aims to highlight the many practices and changes that have occurred since moving to G Suite particularly regarding Open Practices. The Project does not aim to determine that G Suite is better than other platforms, but inform the audience of its possibilities to achieve strategic aims in a Further Education College.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This presentation overviews and analyses a project in which 121 students from six different year groups, and 28 different nationalities collaborate on a common moral project, creating a website on which they will publish their research findings on the topic of <em>climate change</em> and <em>species extinction</em>.</p>
<p>The presentation will focus on how the use of Web 2.0 and OER have the potential to improve student engagement, hence optimising &ldquo;the student experience and enhance the learning outcomes and development of students&rdquo; (Trowler 2010, 3). It seeks to show that the use of Web 2.0 and OER in different languages can facilitate communication with a linguistically heterogenous group of students and subsequently enhance understanding and learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Established <em>old school&nbsp;</em>teaching strategies-I.e.<em>collaborative</em> and <em>constructivist</em> <em>learning</em> are being mixed with<em> innovative digital learning tools</em>,&nbsp;<em>open educational resources</em> (OER) and<em> blended teaching strategies</em>, to foster the linguistic and academic inclusion of all students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The presentation intends to highlight why it is essential for teachers of all ages to not miss out on the educational opportunities Web 2.0 and OER bear, stimulating the digital literacy of both, students and teachers and offering the opportunity for students to become teachers, suggesting that it is the teacher&rsquo;s rather than the student&rsquo;s digital literacy that is challenged by this process.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I was the teacher of a Year 11 GCSE English Literature class.&nbsp; The class was nominally &lsquo;top set,&rsquo; yet many of the class, particularly the boys, had difficulty in thinking and working independently.&nbsp; Essays they produced on poetry showed understanding of the texts, but little in the way of inference and developed interpretation.&nbsp; Several of the class, however, displayed exceptional insight in their responses. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>The class had six hours of lessons per fortnight, made up of four single hours and one &lsquo;double.&rsquo;&nbsp; The default location was the classroom &ndash; this had a whiteboard and projector by my desk.&nbsp; Pupils had a place at a desk, allocated through a seating plan.&nbsp; To encourage collaboration, pupils were seated around desks in mixed-ability groups of 5 or 6.&nbsp; Desires of the pupils ranged from wanting to work hard to get an A* in their exam, to simply wanting to get through an hour&rsquo;s lesson without having to write too much.&nbsp; In this situation, group work was imbalanced &ndash; even when specific roles were allocated, the more able ended up doing more work.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>I was aiming to improve the quality of students&rsquo; written responses to poetry exam past-papers &ndash; success measured by an improvement in marks awarded for inference, insight, and independent interpretation.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>&nbsp;I looked through the pupils&rsquo; practice-exam responses, attempting to isolate a key difference between those who had scored highly, and those who had not.</li>
</ol><ol start="2">
<li>There were a few factors, such as less sophisticated vocabulary, sentence structures, and punctuation &ndash; but the one which stood out was that those who scored poorly had very short explanations of quotations they had used.</li>
</ol><ol start="3">
<li>I thought about possible actions to address this, ranging from teacher-talk to group-work; but I wanted to come up with a way that would combine the benefits of collaboration with the necessity of pupils thinking and writing for themselves.&nbsp; I decided that I would have students working collectively to produce an exam-style response to poetry; one team would produce one essay, made up of contributions of individuals.&nbsp; As a Star Trek fan, this reminded me of the Borg &lsquo;collective,&rsquo; which led to this lesson being called &lsquo;We are Borg!&rsquo;</li>
</ol><ol start="4">
<li>I decided that one of the reasons group-work had not always been successful was that some of the boys were relying on the girls to do the work.&nbsp; To combat this, I split the class into two teams, boys vs girls, a near-even split.</li>
</ol><ol start="5">
<li>I allocated a poem/exam question to each team.&nbsp; I then sub-divided the teams into smaller groups, each responsible for analysing and explaining one aspect of the poem.&nbsp; Some members of the teams were given the task of overseeing the work of the sub-groups, co-ordinating responses.</li>
</ol><ol start="6">
<li>Pupils responded well to the element of competition, and there was a buzz of enthusiasm in the room.&nbsp; However, it was difficult to co-ordinate everything, as it required pupils to move around a lot to share ideas.</li>
</ol><ol start="7">
<li>After the lesson, I decided to combat this using Google Docs, which would allow real-time collaboration without movement.&nbsp; I set up and shared a document for each team, showing their essay question and an outline.</li>
</ol><ol start="8">
<li>The next lesson was in an ICT suite, with girls on one side and boys on the other.&nbsp; I went through the shared document carefully, reminded pupils of the aspect of the poem they were analysing, and set them off.</li>
</ol><ol start="9">
<li>Two of the girls&rsquo; &lsquo;overseers&rsquo; were absent.&nbsp; This meant that I had to spend more time helping the girls co-ordinate everything at the beginning.&nbsp; This meant that I didn&rsquo;t immediately realise a problem the boys were having: even working in smaller groups on one paragraph, it could be confusing having so many writers working at once.&nbsp; I had to narrow down roles further and reduce the number writing at once.</li>
</ol><ol start="10">
<li>Occasionally, Google Docs would disconnect on a computer, not allowing further editing until it reconnected.&nbsp; This slowed the process down.</li>
</ol><ol start="11">
<li>At the end of the lesson, each team printed out a copy of their collaborative response.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The two finished responses were very good &ndash; each paragraph showed evidence of detailed and developed inferences, and the pupils were proud to have an example of a high-grade essay to which they had contributed.&nbsp; However, although the next set of individual responses was much improved, many pupils had failed to produce a complete answer.&nbsp; They had some very detailed individual paragraphs, at the expense of a complete essay.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>I was most pleased by how much pupils enjoyed the experience &ndash; the most significant result was perhaps not the improvement of inference, but in that everybody in the class had seemed motivated and engaged, working hard.&nbsp; However, I think the scale was too ambitious &ndash; having 15 people working simultaneously on a document was difficult to co-ordinate, and either Google Docs or our network struggled.&nbsp; Moreover, as the task was so different from the &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; activity of writing an individual exam response, the outcome was not as successful as I had anticipated.</p>

              <title>WED: The Fiction of Open Online Collaboration; they want to share, don’t they? (Jim Fanning)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10178</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The conference paper presents a critical discussion of the issues surrounding implementation and development of a voluntary online professional learning community that is set within the context of the Scottish Attainment Challenge (Education Scotland, 2016). It involves teachers who are working on initiatives that have received central government funding to improve attainment. The educators in the community include civil servants, local authority education officers, senior teachers and teachers who were working directly with learners.</p>
<p>The conference paper will make use of a range of project materials and information. This will include government publications that illustrate how online collaboration is supported at a policy level in Scottish education. Yammer is the application in which the community has been built and it is hosted on Glow, the Scottish national intranet for education (Scottish Government, 2016). How the functions of a Yammer group support collaboration will be described, along with the ways in which Gilly Salmon&rsquo;s 5-Step model of e-learning was adapted to promote educator engagement in it (Salmon, 2011).</p>
<p>Influenced by Wenger&rsquo;s work on communities of practice (Wenger, 2007), a framework was developed that defined collaboration as being &lsquo;surface&rsquo; or &lsquo;deep&rsquo; and what each of those elements looked like. That framework has been used to map teacher input in the online community and evaluate the nature and openness of collaboration and how the implementation process, based on Salmon&rsquo;s adapted model, influences this.</p>
<p>In 2015 the Scottish government facilitated a range of stakeholder consultation events for the design of a national digital learning and teaching strategy (Scottish Government, 2015). The consultation provided a range of evidence around teacher cultures and the barriers and enablers to change in the system. That evidence, along with an online poll designed for the purposes of the project, and conversations with a range of educators, has been used to describe the cultural context in which the online community operates.</p>
<p>Whilst each of the educators involved in this project brought with them a range of experiences, knowledge, and expectations of collaboration in an online community, a marked feature of the project has been the reluctance of school based staff to be the &lsquo;first&rsquo; to contribute in comparison to local authority and central government colleagues. A philosophical belief in collaboration and openness has not been matched by practice within the community. There was much evidence of co-operation rather than collaboration and where collaboration took place, it tended to be in a face to face setting built on contacts that had been made through the community.</p>
<p>Understanding the synthesis between implementation strategies and teacher cultures in these online communities is important in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of the Glow based communities. More widely, the development of Web 2.0 has been built around collaboration tools and services that promote sharing and openness. There are numerous examples of these being harnessed for social, political and economic purposes. The reasons why they have yet to become widely embedded in mainstream education may be better understood through this project.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Three Steps to a Collaborative Learning Environment: the discussion continues</p>
<p>&nbsp;My conference input enabled me to explore ways of getting students collaborating and in the process giving each other feedback and comment. Some interesting points were raised by the other participants and I would be pleased to hear what you think about these aspects of collaboration:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Is the resistance to collaborative approaches because of how trainee teachers are trained -- or about their own educational experiences as students? Or something else? Is a change of culture needed if teachers regard feedback as a judgement?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think that if you are not used to working in a way which means you have to comment on other people&rsquo;s ideas and work, it must take a while to get used to it. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong><em>Are schools leading the way?</em></strong><em>&nbsp; </em>One delegate said: &ldquo;I have been amazed at peer feedback activities. They&rsquo;re in every lesson&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Should we assess feedback and collaboration as important 21st century learning skills?</em></strong></p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that as an argument in their favour - I was coming from the belief that peer feedback and collaboration result in more-effective learning. Do you think it is a kind of basic skill?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Do you give students a 'crib' for feedback? </em></strong>I do find that the trainee teachers need to practise giving feedback in the fairly formal setting of the micro-teach, when they feed back on their peers&rsquo; sessions. One of the reasons giving this kind of feedback is valuable is that to give it you have to have a reasonably good grasp of the criteria for judging a session; these are complex and have to be learned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>Is Padlet the best tool for (online) collaboration? </em></strong>I think you have to strike a balance between making use of the many new technologies and running the risk of intimidating some learners. I have had some good successes with getting students to work together on Padlet, but as I said there are many more-accomplished practitioners than me around. My main vehicle are discussion forums, online meetings and swapping slides.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>How do </em></strong><strong><em>you </em></strong><strong><em>get your students working together with each other and with you?</em></strong></p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Online innovations in the form of Web 2.0 tools are ubiquitous, whilst the pace of technological and social change in society appears relentless. How can educators and adult learners embrace these changes to meet the needs of a modern society and workplace? This presentation looks at what is required to create an engaging and collaborative learning environment that meets these challenges.</p>
<p>Workers need to keep skills up-to-date and relevant in the rapidly changing employment market of the 21st Century, whilst educators need to respond to provide them with effective opportunities for life-long learning (Rahimi et al, 2015).</p>
<p>Continuing to rethink the most appropriate way to encourage adult learners, especially those wishing to further their vocational knowledge and skills, is a constant challenge for educators. This project explores the application of research into heutagogy, or self-determined learning. This approach to learning is built on existing pedagogies and which can, according to Blaschke (2012) and others, be especially suitable for distance education where new web technologies are utilised.</p>
<p>There are many online tools which can facilitate the learning process. I draw on recent research, by Song and Lee (2014), that shows how Web 2.0 tools can revitalise learning. Ensuring that the right blend of tools are utilised is an important criterion in facilitating successful learner engagement and I demonstrate a&nbsp;practical application of&nbsp;these&nbsp;tools.</p>
<p>The potential success of openness in education relies on the effectiveness of a sharing and collaborative environment. This can be significantly influenced by what people give and contribute and not just take, which Weller (2011) terms &lsquo;shifted reciprocity&rsquo;: By having an engaging and immersive platform, a positive reciprocal atmosphere can arise.</p>
<p>Whilst social, collaborative,&nbsp; learning can be shown to benefit from the use of Web 2.0 tools, there are clearly challenges within this emerging field of online learning. This presentation offers solutions to some of these challenges, with the ultimate aim being how to develop effective collective learning.</p>
<p>This multimedia presentation, in SlideShare, provides an innovative approach to the interconnections of Web 2.0 tools, open education and the practical application of self-determined learning.</p>
<p>The project artefact consists of a web-platform, Open Turf, which has been conceived as a Collaborative Learning Environment (CLE), to demonstrate the explored interconnections. To further enhance the value of the project I have used the learning requirements of the new Level 2 Apprenticeship Standard developed by the Groundsmanship trailblazer group; the reason being to illustrate how this approach could be applied to&nbsp;any, or most, learning outcomes or courses.</p>
<p>The project artefact and presentation can be used to generate discussion in the areas explored and can also form the basis for educators to contribute in the design and deployment of a comprehensive online immersive learning platform which will engage and enthuse learners.</p>
<p>Key words: Web 2.0, open education, collaborative learning, heutagogy, self-determined learning, online learning, web-platform.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9517</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p class="Body"><strong>Three Steps to a&nbsp; Collaborative Learning Environment: </strong>a module for teachers and trainers in the post-16 sector</p>
<p class="Body">This conference session will be of interest to anyone engaged in the teaching and learning process. It is designed for trainee teachers in the Further Education sector and in the post-16 sector in general but it looks at issues of pedagogy which go to the heart of teaching at any level.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Effective collaboration through openness</strong></p>
<p class="Body">We will consider the impact of some aspects of openness on teaching and learning. I shall argue that implementing Weller&rsquo;s &ldquo;open state of mind&rdquo; is perhaps the most relevant aspect of openness in the context of teaching in the post-16 sector. It is implicit that students and teachers will need to deliberately implement an approach where they are happy to be open about their methods, where they encourage their students to feed back to them about the learning process and where there is an understanding that the teacher is also a learner.</p>
<p class="Body">Have you considered the implications of an environment which encourages sharing of comments on each other&rsquo;s ideas and work? Would such an approach be universally popular and effective? What are the pitfalls of expecting students to collaborate and be open with each other in this way? What has been your experience of sharing drafts on H818? Feel free to exploit the backchannels! Contact me on Twitter @JohnBaglow or in OpenStudio or on <a href="http://johnbaglow.wordpress.com">johnbaglow.wordpress.com</a> so that your views can be incorporated in the conference.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Effective collaboration using technology&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="Body">The Initial Teacher Education (ITE) module will look at how a range of technologies can play a part in the implementation&nbsp; of a collaborative learning environment in the classroom and online. For example, students can collaborate using discussion forums, video conferencing, wikis, online bulletin boards and a host of other platforms. Peer feedback can use the same vehicles and can be almost instantaneous if necessary. There is great scope for achieving a sophisticated and nuanced feedback approach which makes use of screencasts, podcasts, online written feedback and online tutorials. There is the additional benefit that trainee teachers become familiar with these new technologies whether or not they adopt them.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Tailoring your approach to your students&rsquo; needs</strong></p>
<p class="Body">it is fair to say that the student body which my trainees will be teaching is much less homogeneous than that at a university. For example, a colleague reports that written feedback, whether electronic or not, is invariably perceived as rather intimidating by his BTEC students. They much prefer oral feedback, whether face-to-face or in a video clip.</p>
<p class="Body">So whether you are a practising teacher who is keen to increase student engagement in the learning process or are just interested in finding out more about how technology has increased the options for introducing an open outlook in education, <strong>this presentation is for you.</strong></p>]]></description>

              <title>SAT: How forums and collaborative learning impact on oral proficiency in a foreign language class. (Tommy Ruiz)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9504</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9504</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Using a class activity and its inclusive online collaborative component (open educational resources (OER), Moodle and its forums) the teacher recorded students who would not regularly speak during class time. This presentation discusses the importance of collaborative learning, digital methods and how students perceive their educational learning through an online community. Focusing primarily on the theme of inclusion, the interpretivist lens allows the teacher to focus on ethnographic data collected to extract key concepts. The presentation concludes by outlining the importance of collaborative learning and its impact on inclusive learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This presentation explores:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How collaborative learning is implemented in a foreign language class.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How and why it helps oral proficiency.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To what extent forums compliment collaborative learning in a foreign language class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While interest in the voice of students and teenagers has grown, concerns for their oral participation in a foreign language class can still be a daunting experience for some (Hewitt and Stephenson, 2012).&nbsp; For those excluded, the teacher needs to implement a safe, positive learning environment where students can feel at ease. Personal growth is mostly achieved whilst connecting, comparing and challenging your peers&rsquo; work. As a result, carefully structured group work or collaborative learning has been promoted at the international school of Kuala-Lumpur (ISKL) for a number of years. When applied to a foreign language class, collaborative learning creates random conversations. It focuses on shared knowledge and clear communication skills between students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When learning a foreign language, not all students learn at the same pace. Therefore pupils do not have the same learning outcomes. Consequently, a class activity that promotes collaborative learning needs to be tailored for the students&rsquo; individual needs. As a result, critical theory (Curseu and Pluut, 2013) suggests that students should work collaboratively in small groups to fulfil their potential whilst avoiding some of the peer pressure issues. Effective communicators listen, reflect and respect each other&rsquo;s ideas. Students need to take part in conversations to be accepted and thus included in the learning process. Each student should be a creative thinker who can reason critically. They need to defend viewpoints, argue and share experiences. In that context, oral participation is a crucial component towards inclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Placing a similar emphasis on the role of forums, Norvig (2012) views the latter as a platform where communication helps students clarify problems, negotiate meanings, exchange knowledge and share perspectives. Whilst language acquisition is usually linked to input-driven, listening and thus passive learning is as important (Lefkowitz and Hedgcock, 2002). In this context, forums are an extension of the collaborative learning and a reflection tool. Forums allow students to listen to their peers, learn from good examples, engage in critical reasoning and promote a monitored inclusive learning environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This presentation will appeal to teachers who are looking for an inclusive approach to enhance an open scholarly practice, as well as those individuals who would like to learn about the forums in a collaborative online learning environment. The presentation will explore an analysis of participant contributions, survey data, and questionnaires to propose a model for collaborative learning in a foreign language class.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>The Manager&rsquo;s Desk</h2>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: My role was as Media Project Manager</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong>: Workplace, office-based. Key actors were a faculty module team and a production media team consisting of academic authors, course manager, myself, editor, designer, interactive developer (among others). Faculty staff were based in a separate building to production staff or were external consultants in other parts of the UK.</p>
<p>The main driver behind the activity was the module chair who had a clear vision of what she wanted the design of the activities to look like.&nbsp; Our role was to elicit the particular underlying functionality that was needed and make sure that it was usable, accessible and delivered the learning task and outcomes without the technology getting in the way.</p>
<h3><strong>Task:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>The Manager&rsquo;s Desk (MD) was to be the &lsquo;way in&rsquo; for students for involved, problem-based learning activities related to leadership in a healthcare environment.</li>
<li>Students were expected to incorporate several actions without having them spelt out each time.</li>
<li>There was to be one single MD activity per week in the final 4 weeks of the module with each being a standalone activity.</li>
<li>The MD was to simulate a manager&rsquo;s desk in a busy office with information arriving in a variety of forms that would pose and then provide the resources for solving a problem.</li>
<li>Each activity was to provide students with all the resources they might need to resolve the problem posed without having to link to third party material.</li>
<li>When students open the MD activity for each week they were to be prompted to read and email or listen to a voicemail message or something that would kick-start their enquiry-based learning activity for the week.</li>
<li>There were to be different levels of information required within an activity:</li>
<ul>
<li>The event/task &ndash; delivered via email/phone call/text/in person/in a meeting;</li>
<li>Associated documents and context (describing the task)</li>
<li>Hints &ndash; what students might like to think about</li>
<li>Going further &ndash; additional information for the keen student</li>
<li>Feedback/assessment</li>
<li>Use of Manager&rsquo;s Toolkit (another separate development within the same module)</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h3>Actions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>I created a schedule for the different stages of the development, a budget plan and tabled regular progress meetings with all the stakeholders.</li>
<li>I arranged a series of meetings with each author of each of the 4 activities to talk through how they were trying to achieve their learning outcomes.</li>
<li>I held meetings with members of the module team to explore the functionality required behind the activities.</li>
<li>I held various meetings with the production team to pin down the overall design elements and how they would work together.</li>
<li>I created a template grid of the individual elements of the Manager&rsquo;s Desktop for the authors to complete as a step-by-step pathway through their activity using the different elements. &nbsp;This turned out to be a key document that forced them to work through each action that a student might take and why.</li>
<li>I insisted that this section of the module should be developmentally tested prior to its release as it was such a large part of the module and the culmination of the student&rsquo;s work.</li>
<li>I primed the Student Helpdesk by talking them through the activities to see if there were any obvious stumbling blocks for students that they could foresee.</li>
<li>I made sure we created a separate walk-through activity that explained all the functionality and how to use and step through the different items on the desk.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main obstacle I think was sustaining the involvement of the authors once they had written their initial narrative and keeping the purpose of the use of the technology clear.&nbsp; It is very easy to create a flashy-looking visually appealing interactive that is actually simpler to deliver as a straightforward narrative, which is far less engaging.&nbsp; The object of keeping all the student&rsquo;s interactions within a single HTML activity was to present them with a simulation of how tasks might come at them from all directions in a busy office environment and show how they needed to filter and prioritise the information they were given in order to complete and solve a specific problem.</p>
<p>As with all developments of this kind there are always obstacles relating to time and resource availability and a large interactive development of this kind uses up a lot of developer hours which weren&rsquo;t necessarily initially planned for.</p>
<h3>Results:</h3>
<p>The most unexpected outcome from my point of view was the lack of student complaints and calls to the helpdesk.&nbsp; Given that this was quite a radical way to present a whole block&rsquo;s worth of activities and depended on students engaging with a visual interactive simulation put them under some pressure (one author wanted to include a ticking clock with a time constraint but we thought that would frighten people too much).</p>
<p>From the developmental testers we had positive comments, including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;I enjoyed using the Managers desk, it was a great way to step into the shoes of a manager and understand what it feels like to be a manager. &lsquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>&lsquo; I liked that the Manager's desk didn't try to cover up how difficult management in health and social care is; it was very transparent, open and honest ... it actually made me feel stressed like I know an actual manager would feel as I felt as though I had so many things I needed to work through.&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;Additional outcomes are that we have an HTML activity with functionality that could be reused in different contexts wrapped in a different graphic skin, and that would mitigate to some extent the initial cost of the development.</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>Generally this was a very enjoyable set of materials to produce largely because of the collaborative learning that went on in the creation of the design and functionality of all the elements.&nbsp; It used up a lot of time though apart from the interactive developer&rsquo;s budget we came in on budget and on schedule.&nbsp; However the production team felt very pressured at times and would love the luxury of doing a similar development with a lot more time made available in the early stages. I felt that with more prototyping and collaborative involvement with the authors we could have come up with an even better final product.</p>

              <title>Siobhan&#39;s DN: In pursuit of collaboration, and the drive to inform!</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title: In pursuit of collaboration, and the drive to inform!</strong><em><br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p><em>This design narrative captures the observations of a learning designer who attended an online learning event aimed at researchers and communications' professionals. The event aimed to share knowledge about how to develop strategic commications plans, and offered participants the opportunity to share and comment on each other's approaches. The role of the learning designer at the event was to observe the process of learning, and to work with a translation team to create a recording of the event in English.</em></p>
<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Situation<br /></strong><em>Describe the physical, social and intentional factors that define the design space. E.g. where and when did this occur? In what kind of space? Who were the key actors, and what were the relations between them? What where the beliefs and desires which shaped their interaction?</em><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><br /></strong></p>
<p><em>The event took place on April, 2014. The facilitation team used GoToWebinar to host the event, and Skype / Pamela for Skype to create a podcast of the proceedings.&nbsp;The team consisted of a presenter from Argentina and two logistical support personnel, one in Peru and the other in the UK . The Peruvian team member introduced the event and ensured participants were able to connect to the platform. The UK team member worked with a translator to record the event using Skype. The UK team member is a qualified teacher, and familiar with the use of technology to support learning online. The Latin American team are adequately familiar with the tools for online engagment and learning but are sceptical of the benefits of learning in this way. Their experience relates to scholarly research and programme management. This design narrative relates to a second webinar run by the faciliation team. In discussions about how to improve the subsequent webinars, the Latin American team were reluctant to try suggestions, offered by the UK team member, to improve the learning experience by designing activities for increased collaboration. Their attitude centred on the use of technology as a barrier, and asserted that technology-based learning proved difficult in their context. Due to connectivity issues (i.e. low bandwidth) the participants could not participate using voice, but instead used text based contributions. All team members are working on a project aimed at mobilising the capacity of think tanks in Latin America to influence public policy through their research activities.</em></p>
<p><em>The facilitation team had developed a system for capturing the audio in English. This involved using Pamela for Skype to record the event. The microphone was switched off during recording to avoid any background noise interrupting the translation. The UK team recorded the audio using a laptop and viewed the GoToWebinar presentations on their PC. Again, the audio was switched off (i.e the speaker). The voice facility was disabled due to connectivity issues therefore none of the participants were able to use this feature.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task<br /></strong><em>What were you trying to achieve? What was your measure of success?</em><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><em>The purpose of the second webinar was to provide a space for the participants to share experiences and learn from each other about approaches to developing a strategic policy engagement and communication strategy. The first webinar covered the theoretical framework and concepts (e.g. complexity theory and its impact on policy formulation), so the second webinar's measure of success was to provide a space for practical application of the concepts covered in the primary event. This would be measured by the quality of interaction between participants, and their responses to three broad and relevant stimulating questions. The webinar lasted 1.5 hours.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Actions<br /></strong><em>List the actions you took in chronological order, note their effects &ndash; expected and unexpected. Highlight any obstacles you encountered, and explain how you tried to overcome them.</em><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>20 mins (Introduction to the event, introducing topic and the presenter) - slide 1</p>
<p>40 mins (presenter leads on main topic of presentation. Covers aspects such as complexity theory - linking to the previous webinar - and how this impacts on the policy environment. Highights the problems of having a rigid strategic plan, in a complex environment and the advantages of being systematic but fluid in the design process. This activity seemed to cover ground already captured in the first webinar, and was viewed by an observer as boring. The tone and talking speed of the presenter made it difficult for the translator to work. Received a message saying, 'the speaker is very difficult to follow and this is posing a challenge'. The skype connection is lost once but reconnects automatically).</p>
<p>20 mins (Group discussions commence. The speaker post three questions sequentially. The participants were slow to respond to the first question but gathered momentum when the speaker encouraged them to participate. One or two participants shared examples of good practice from their institutions, these were listened to but not commented on by the participants (note they could only comment using text). Limited opportunity for questions and answers between each 'case study'. The second and third question were posed and the group began to participate more. Some participants lost connection to the platform, reconnectivity was managed by the Peruvian team member. There were several moments of silence as participants took their time to respond to the questions.</p>
<p>15 mins (the faciliation team in Latin America begin to close the event, participants are offered 15 mins additional time to exchange ideas and continue their conversations through the chat feature. The event closes with an apology about the technology and a comment about the challenges of learning in technology-based environments. There is a lot of activity now in the chat pane, participants are asking questions and commenting with each other. The presenter is also engaged in these conversations. The translator comments on the challenges of translating the speaker (too fast and occassionally incomplete sentences), and requests resources in advance to help him understand the concepts better).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Results<br /></strong><em>List the expected and unexpected outcomes of your actions. To what degree did you meet your objectives? What additional outcomes did you engender? Provide evidence to back your claims.</em><strong><br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Participants were surveyed directly after the event, however analyses has yet to be undertaken therefore the outcome of the event is currently unknown.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Final 30 minutes of the webinar were moderately interactive. The additional 15 mins saw a rise in interaction and engagment</li>
<li>The facilitation team successfully created a podcast of the event in English (i.e. simultaneous translation)</li>
<li>Moderate opportunities to share experiences, this objective will have to be addressed through additional activities / learning events</li>
<li>An unexpected outcome was the amount of time the speaker presented 'theory' to the group, especially as this was designed as a participatory event</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reflections<br /></strong><em>Reflect on your experience. What transferable insights did you gain?</em><strong><br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Learning online has a negative perception, especially amongst professionals who are not familiar with the technology or 'afriad' to be innovative. This will require additional support from the UK team to increase their confidence and exposure to technology-based models of learning.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A back-ground logisitical support is absolutely essential to maintain the flow of proceedings, and to address issues with the technology as they arise.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The speaker was reluctant to engage with the learning designer to work through ideas for 'innovating' the learning experience. Usually, a speaker is expected to provide a lesson plan or running schedule to the UK team for review. This did not happen. Therefore, it is important in future events that the UK team emphasise the benefits of seeking advice and consultation on the plans.</li>
<li>Having a good translator who is able to work without prior knowledge of the subject, and challenging speakers is critical but not easy to find. In this case, the translator was hired as a 'test pilot' as previous attempts to record simultaneous translation had not worked. In succeeding events, the translator must have the materials in advance, and a pre-briefing from the speaker / trainer.</li>
</ul>

              <title>Tim&#39;s Design Narrative for Online Reading Circles</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8366</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8366</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title </strong></p>
<p>Providing students with the opportunity to engage with communicative reading tasks.</p>
<p>Narrator</p>
<p><em>My role, as an English Language Teacher at the Higher Colleges of Technology, was to <strong>design</strong> an online version of a traditional reading circle for use by foundation (and undergraduate) students. </em>This done my role was to <strong>facilitate and encourage reading</strong> of texts relevant to the learners&rsquo; real-life needs and goals.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>English is the medium of instruction in all government tertiary institutions throughout the UAE and to exit Foundations and proceed to a locally-accredited bachelor&rsquo;s programme students only need an overall Band 5 in the IELTS. However, the majority of students fail to obtain the necessary grade. Emiratis show a clear weakness in demonstrating an affective reading ability in such externally standardised benchmark exams as the IELTS. For the adult learner, reading is a key to success in higher education.</p>
<p>The local culture is often referred to as an oral culture but perhaps a better description would be a non-reading culture! One does not become a good reader unless one reads a lot, this might seem like stating the obvious but it is something that does not seem to occur to my learners. The activity I describe here is designed to help address this lack of a reading culture.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>In line with the college learning outcomes and to help address this &lsquo;<em>non-reading culture&rsquo;</em> the main aims of this activity are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>To encourage student autonomy and independent reading and learning.</li>
<li>To provide students with the opportunity to read extensively and (hopefully) for pleasure.</li>
</ol>
<p>The secondary aims are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To expose students to a variety of texts types relevant to their real life needs.</li>
<li>To help build vocabulary and deeper understanding academic texts.</li>
<li>To begin challenging and evaluating text.</li>
</ol>
<p>The activity is based on the concept of a <em>Reading Circle. </em>This usually takes place face-to-face when a group of five or six like-minded individuals meet to discuss a piece of literature in depth. They share their experiences in a structured discussion which guides the participants to a deeper understanding of the text. Collaboration is at the heart of this approach. Each group member has a specific role and there is group leader whose job it is to develop questions for the group to discuss.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>As we meet face to face in college every day the activity was set up in the classroom via an introductory IELTS lesson in third week of the semester, or once the class size has settled down and all students have been issued with their iPads.</p>
<p>This lesson is staged as follows:</p>
<p>Engage and interest the learners in the topic, set context for the reading, activate vocab and background knowledge. Emphasize the need read more often and on a variety of themes.</p>
<p>The first reading circle text is done in class. This makes it easier to set up the activity, form groups, give clear instructions with examples and then monitor closely to check all students are on task. I then monitor discretely; guiding, encouraging and prompting only when and where necessary. Thorough preparation for the online activity should provide an incentive for more effective participation.</p>
<p>Provide clear instruction of the process with screen shots of the BBL interface and links to BBL&rsquo;s own instructional videos will be the first documents the learners will encounter. I will also set up and &lsquo;sandbox&rsquo; course for the learners to play around in. This will be accompanied by example videos of each of the role cards completed for an example text. I would also create a &ldquo;Help&rdquo; in the discussion board, feedback would be timely but the contract would be that I only answer in office hours.</p>
<p>A &lsquo;spark&rsquo; &ndash;&ndash; the role cards which accompany the text provide the learners with the stimulus, challenge, task or problem. The learners rotate roles so as not to repeat the same role, and therefore the same way of looking at a text. The first five texts are obligatory and run in order but after that, in turn, each student can select form a bank of suitable texts.</p>
<p>Example role cards:</p>
<p><strong>Artist </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your job is to create an image or images based on the text.</li>
<li>Your image(s) can be anything that you want. For example, a picture, a diagram, a cartoon, a flow chart, a graph, etc.</li>
<li>You will need to explain and justify your image(s) to the group.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global Issues Analyst</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your job is to read the text and find information relating to global issues.</li>
<li>This information could relate to social, political, economic and environmental issues that affect us all.</li>
<li>You will need to explain and justify your choices to the group.</li>
</ul>
<p>The learners complete the task on their role cards and post a short video message via Voice Board.</p>
<p>Students have to respond &ndash; the students must respond and comment on at least three other students&rsquo; posts.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>It is now only three weeks into the activity and it is not compulsory it is too early to talk of results. As this activity goes beyond the course boundaries to provide an extra layer of learning for students, only the students who are extremely enthusiastic or who have the extra time are expected to participation.&nbsp;Those involved in the learning activity are assigned different roles when undertaking these tasks. The role cards I have designed are specifically aimed at each of these learning outcomes and the development of the associated reading skills and sub-skills. The initial sequencing of texts before letting the activity become more student-centred as students choose their readings is also an important part of achieving my aims and making the activity a success.</p>
<p>Hopefully, on completing this course, students should be able &lsquo;<em>to read with some independence&rsquo;</em>, being able &lsquo;<em>to select a reading strategy suited to their purpose and the text&rsquo;</em>, and &lsquo;<em>to demonstrate comprehension in a variety of ways&rsquo;</em>.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Again it is too early to reflect on this activity, or lack of activity, the use of BBL for the purposes of recording and reflecting on achievement and the ease with which comments can be made for support, encouragement and continuous formative assessment make it the ideal tool. My initial impulse was for no assessment, as in schools here reading is rarely taught but frequently tested. There are many negative connotations with words such as &lsquo;assessments,&rsquo; &lsquo;grades,&rsquo; &lsquo;wrong,&rsquo; &lsquo;punishment.&rsquo; I wanted to avoid this. However, my students are pragmatic in their approach to learning; they will try to obtain the maximum grade with the minimum amount of effort. So, in reality that would mean that without some sort of assessment, most students at HCT simply would not participate. When discussing with other faculty it seems students make the postings needed to earn marks, but rarely contribute otherwise. What to do?</p>

              <title>Secret Belfast</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8315</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8315</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h3>Joel Kerr&rsquo;s design narrative: Secret Belfast</h3>
<h4>Narrator</h4>
<p>Having just moved to Belfast after three years of university in England I wanted to know more about what the city was about. There was plenty of publicity for the commercially viable activities but I had heard Belfast had a particularly vibrant &lsquo;underground&rsquo; social scene and I wanted to learn more about that.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Situation</h4>
<p>As I was new to the city I had no contacts that could teach me accepted practises of the social scene or introduce me to the community so I realised social networking would play a key role.</p>
<p>Following a few failed attempts at websites and blogs I discovered a Facebook group called &lsquo;Secret London&rsquo; which aimed to unearth the lesser known locations and events in London. I decided to set up a similar group for Belfast. After a few friends joined and a link to the group appeared in their activity feed, friends of friends joined out of curiosity. The group soon went viral and membership grew in thousands.</p>
<p>The description in the Facebook group was to share your Belfast secrets so we could learn from one another. Very soon members were posting news of events, favourite restaurants, creative groups and other projects. They were starting their own discussions in the forums and my role went from influencer to moderator, as the group took on a life of its own.</p>
<p>Due to press interest my role further evolved to organiser as I went from someone on the periphery of Belfast to someone who was considered an expert on what was going on. I got the opportunity to work with local creatives to organise events unearthing talent or activities in &lsquo;secret&rsquo; locations. The group moved from Facebook to include Twitter, a blog and a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>The common goal of each of the key players was to facilitate innovation within Belfast and foster creativity in it&rsquo;s many forms. We each had something unique to offer and we learnt from one another to advance ideas as opposed to achieving goals.</p>
<p>Everyone played a role whether they were an expert in their field, someone who like to spread the word or simply someone who wanted to do something a bit different.</p>
<h4>Task</h4>
<p>The aim was to learn what was unique about Belfast. Every city has big shopping centres, nice restaurants and trendy night spots but they do not contribute to the personality of the location.</p>
<p>Success would be knowing <em>all </em>the things to do and the people involved with them.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Actions</h4>
<p>The actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Curiosity</li>
<li>Experimentation</li>
<li>Discovery of an existing practise that could be replicated</li>
<li>Taking action. <em>This can cause embarrassment as you might mess up through trial and error or people question your motives and laugh at your efforts. Keep plugging on!</em></li>
<li>Successful implementation <em>The project was much more successful than I had anticipated. It required a lot of time and effort in moderating forums, answering questions, facilitating debates, speaking to the press and reacting to peoples requests for collaboration</em></li>
<li>Growth <em>There were a number of additional social channels that I could take advantage of in order to engage more people</em></li>
<li>Collaboration <em>The project would&rsquo;ve fallen flat on its face without enlisting expertise from existing projects, and organisations.</em></li>
<li>Innovation <em>In order to continue engaging people I had to come up with ideas to spark their interest</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The obstacles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Abuse <em>Giving people open access can lead to inappropriate posts. I found that a few sharp words was a better alternative to deleting the posts. It soon stopped</em></li>
<li>Spam <em>Popular online forums are susceptible to unwanted sales pitches. Eventually I had to lock down access and approve people who genuinely had something to share</em></li>
<li>Expertise <em>Because it was my group people assumed I had all the answers so I had to enlist relevant experts</em></li>
</ol>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>Expected outcomes:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn more about the personality of the city</li>
<li>Learn about the lesser known events and activities</li>
<li>Meet the people involved in these events and activities</li>
</ol>
<p>Unexpected outcomes</p>
<ol>
<li>Expertise in using social media</li>
<li>Expertise in organising events and promoting them via social media</li>
<li>Experience dealing with the media</li>
<li>Learning new skills from local experts (videography and audio production)</li>
<li>The ability to quickly launch new projects using my acquired knowledge and influence</li>
<li>The ability to help other creatives promote themselves for free</li>
</ol>
<h4>Reflections</h4>
<p>By acting on my initial curiosity I not only learnt about the city I live in, I became proud to be associated with it and found myself in a position to influence its development from a grass roots level.</p>
<p>I have replicated the process a few times to varying degrees of success. Each time I used the same format:</p>
<ol>
<li>An intriguing title</li>
<li>A focused message</li>
<li>A manageable use of social media</li>
<li>The right tone of voice</li>
<li>The ability for users to actively influence the progress</li>
</ol>
<p>The one obstacle I haven&rsquo;t managed to overcome is people&rsquo;s suspicion at why Secret Belfast is free for them to use, they assume there will be hidden costs.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3>Passionate Participatory Making</h3>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->My dream is <strong>to help create</strong> a MOOC that will <strong>enable world wide</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Digital Literacy.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I envision a&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->map of learning activities</strong>&nbsp;for raising ones&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->digital literacy</strong>&nbsp;<strong>competencies</strong>.</li>
<li>Learners could jump in at any time, anywhere on the map,&nbsp;and find guidance to master that particular skill set.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The map would be dynamic, continually being improved and expanded, much like in wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I was proposing was a &nbsp;"<strong>project based</strong>" "<strong>connectivist</strong>" creation of a <strong>learning space</strong> "<strong>that&nbsp;that if properly designed could scale to&nbsp;world changing proportions</strong>".</p>
<h3>Teacher Presence</h3>
<p>The <strong>daily summaries</strong> by&nbsp;Yishay, Peter and Simon were very important to me. By <strong>pointing</strong> and <strong>naming</strong> participants contributions we were validated and motivated and inspired. Some MOOCs even enlist "<strong>skilled others</strong>" to demonstrate disired levels of performance. <strong>We learn by watching and mimicking.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Making with Peers</strong></h3>
<p>I agree with OLDSMOOC's learning design,&nbsp;<strong>creating personally meaningful projects, together with like minded peers. </strong>Too bad I have yet to enlist any collaborative peers ("I am not a quitter" though, lol). I will try to design my learning space so as to insure everyone has a supportive partner and that every creative work gets acknowlegment/feedback.</p>
<h3>Navigation and Site Map</h3>
<p>Although the OLDSMOOC website had detailed descriptions of what to do during the nine weeks many participants seemed disoriented (or even lost, especially in the clouds). I addressed this by offering a <strong><a title="navigation" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7655">navigation tool/discussion cloud</a>. </strong>The daily summaries were helpful here, too, by pointing to what might otherwise have been missed.</p>
<p>I think in my learning design, I will have <strong>a place where frustrated participants can yell "Help</strong>, throw me a lifeline".</p>
<h3>Wikis, Forums, Blogging, Badges, and Portfolios</h3>
<p>I, too, will design in the creation of these forms of digital artifacts (and identity).</p>
<h3>Networking</h3>
<p>By reading reflections and following links pointed to by like minded participants I have learned first hand how <strong>networking</strong> continually provides me with <strong>new, relevant resouces</strong>, &nbsp;many of which are <strong>still evolving</strong>. I will be using <strong>Mozilla's Open Badges</strong> and still have to go back and mine the <strong>OER repositories</strong>. I will continue to do my part by <strong><a title="digital literacies resources" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8079">sharing resources</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>Partipatory Learning</h3>
<p>I want to especially thank those participants who took time to communicate with me. I realise how this has impacted me. I intend to similarly reach out and participate within the many newly discovered networks that have opened up to me during this course.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3 dir="ltr">Yezin&rsquo;s Engineering Odyssey</h3>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.06367512908764184">Yezin lives in Riyadh and is hoping to study engineering at university. He is in a preparatory year program that includes instruction in English, math and science. Yezin has difficulty reading the articles he is given and is specially worried about the technical vocabulary.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.06367512908764184">Yezin&rsquo;s English teacher suggests that he try using a social-network based glossary application on his phone. First, he scans the article he is reading with his learning set and saves it to text. Then he uses the application to identify several words and enters them into his personal glossary. He tags two words using pre-configured tags and creates his own tag for a third. Using concordance software he finds examples of these new words in the British National Corpus and compares these to his own text. He writes a provisional definition for the word and saves it to his learning space. <br /><br />Later, Yezin scans another text and finds his previously entered words highlighted in the new text. He remembers two of these but has forgotten what the third one meant. He finds it in his glossary, linked to the text where he tagged it. He looks there and remembers what it means. Yezin is impressed and tells other people in his learning set about the tool. He thinks that if he can get them to work with him, they will all benefit by sharing their personal glossaries.<br /><br />Using the application, Yezin and his friends have been able to turn an isolated and dull reading task into a social activity. The application not only helps them learn together, but it helps them learn more quickly by connecting prior knowledge to new tasks, and by connecting their individual expertise to that of the group. &nbsp;They also begin to discover shared areas of interest within their field of study and think they might like to collaborate on other levels too.</strong></p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>New members are welcome to join this project team. Leave a comment if you are interested.</strong></p>
<h2>The project</h2>
<p>The project is to create a fairly simple way for tutors to create authentic simulations that enable and encourage, even demand, collaboration between learners in order to complete the simulation successfully. The simulations should be able to run in real-time if desired, or over a set time of choosing (e.g. hours, days, weeks).</p>
<p>It should include an element of &lsquo;gamification&rsquo; to motivate learner engagement, to have a potential means of assessment, to introduce competition and urgency (where appropriate) and to reproduce real-life situations as closely as possible.</p>
<p>We'd like to create (in the next few weeks):</p>
<ul>
<li>An online environment (Wordpress Multisite plus a selection of plugins) in which lecturers can self-author (real-time or otherwise) simulations for learners.</li>
<li>Some plans, guidance and ideas for educators on how to configure and extend Wordpress Multisite themselves to create authentic simulations for learners.</li>
<li>At least one small but working simulation.</li>
<li>Some ideas and scenarios for potential simulations that other educators could create.</li>
<li>A model (a learning design) that others could copy and adapt.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Current team members</h2>
<h3>Oli Haslam (project 'Dreamer')</h3>
<p>I'm a university course developer/learning technologist doing this as a personal project for fun and my own CPD.&nbsp;I'm interested in both the technical side and the teaching and learning side of this project.</p>
<p>I love the flexibility, reliability and simplicity of Wordpress and feel it is underused in teaching and learning. I'd like to help change that. I also think that simulations for learning are underused, in part because they are complex to author and facilitate. That needs changing too.</p>
<p>My primary motivation for this project is to create something that university lecturers <strong>can and will</strong> use to create realistic simulations for learners. I want it to be free and as easy to set up and use as possible.</p>
<p>I'm keen on authentic learning and would like it to be posible to make 'authentic' simulations that reproduce real-life situations as closely as possible but if people want to create non-authentic simulations with whatever we come up with, that is more than welcome too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like others to be able to use and develop simulations themselves on any topic. I want to use free open source software and&nbsp;to share all the code, content and thinking so anyone can take a copy themselves and continue development on their own.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I  work for the Open University, UK primarily as an Associate Lecturer. &nbsp;I  have worked on a variety of modules, using blended and online-only  learning. &nbsp;Much of my additional work is on online student forums, both  module and faculty wide. &nbsp;I am increasingly working with others in  designing sessions for Elluminate tutorials which is the online  classroom software we currently use. &nbsp;The environment is essentially the  same as Blackboard.&nbsp; These sessions are intended for use by tutors with Level 1 students in pscyhology, though some work for Level 1 science has been undertaken.</p>
<p>Finding tools to plan and illustrate the planning for this unique environment is something I would like to be exploring.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that better visual representation suited to this environment  will aid design and communication between those working on the session  design.</p>
<p><br />The  sense of physical presence, and the experience of that, is easily  neglected as the online classroom is usually treated as a flat  environment. &nbsp;The positive and negative effect of leaving the main  whiteboard area to go into a virtual breakout room and undertake small  group work, or presenting students with external links (such as by linking to other sites on the main whiteboard) needs to be considered in design.&nbsp; The flow of a session is difficult to visualise with the tools readily available at present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done some preliminary work on this and would love to work with others familiar with this environment.</p>
<p>I  have loyalty cards for all the major supermarkets in my wallet ;-)&nbsp; I am  equally unrestricted in pedagogical approach, believing there is more  than one way of doing things because more than one way is needed.  &nbsp;However, I do favour designing more for group work and discovery so  lean towards constructivist.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dream N&deg;1 : online course on social media for learning</strong></p>
<p>I currently teach a 12-week totally online module on social media for teaching and learning, on the<a title="Description of AIGEME Master" href="http://www.univ-paris3.fr/master-2-aigeme-ifd-br-applications-informatiques-gestion-education-aux-medias-e-formation-br-i-parcours-ingenierie-de-la-formation-a-distance-i--26468.kjsp" target="_blank"> AIGEME Masters course</a> for Universit&eacute; Paris 3 Sorbonne-Nouvelle, with an international French-speaking intake of students. I co-teach this module with a great colleague based in Morocco. Until recently, the course was split in two parts, web 2.0 and analysis of educational media.</p>
<p>This year we have revamped the course to improve the integration of the two parts and to get the students using a specific Twitter hashtag for the course combined with content curation via <a title="Scoop.it topic for AIGEME module on social media for learning" href="http://www.scoop.it/t/master-aigeme-web-2-0-et-usages-dynamiques" target="_blank">scoop.it</a>. This revamp was the result of a joint reflection between my colleague and myself, but I would now like to apply what we will be learning in the OLDSMOOC to validate and improve these design choices. I suppose what I'm really looking for is a solid framework and for exchanges with others involved in a similar process.</p>
<p><strong>Dream N&deg;2: improve our staff development programme in teaching and learning innovation through the use of learning technology.</strong></p>
<p>When I arrived at the University of Burgundy a year ago, there was a sound staff development programme already in place, but for the areas dealt with by my department, the focus was mainly on tools (Moodle, podcasts, webconferencing..). We are gradually shifting the focus to 'pedagogical use' and have developed a course we co-run with the pedagogical innovation department, in which the starting point is the pedagogical scenario (project-based learning, collaborative learning...), bringing in the technology as a way of supporting these approaches. The first session is to take place on January 31st, so we still have a bit of time to refine the design, and this is where I hope the OLDSMOOC will come in handy! It will also help us in the evaluation stage. So again, if anyone else is working on staff development programmes in the field of learning technology, then let's team up!</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Tags: Peer-to-peer learning, peer-to-peer evaluation, informal learning, collaboration, knowledge sharing</p>
<p>Context</p>
<p>I'm going to design an online course for 500+ participants where the participants are lecturers and senior lectures at a University of Applied Science. The online course is planned for 10 weeks with weekly activities.&nbsp;The aim of the online course is to learn the participants to design learning design integrating ICT to bachelor students. The learning 'platform' is going to be disigned form open and dynamic technoligies and social media.</p>
<p>The participants are going to read or watch course materials as articles, blog posts and videos and they are going to take part in online discussions with fellow learners and the facilitators/ teachers of the course.The participants create during the course a learning design for his/hers own teaching/lecturing.</p>
<p>Challenge</p>
<p>The particiapants are going to collaborate with felleow learners in smaller groups during the course. The participants are going to make critical reflections and give feedback on each others work through peer-to-peer learning and they are going to evaluate each other each during the course in peer-to-peer evaluation.</p>
<p>Change</p>
<p>I'm very inspired from Grainne Conole's 7C's Learning Design approach. My approach to learning is social contructionstic with a focus on collaboration, knowledge &nbsp;creation, know ledge sharing and peer-to-peer learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope in the OLD MOOC to learn more about and get experience with peer-to-peer learning and peer-to-peer evaluation with fellow learners.</p>]]></description>

<p>I would like to focus more on peer-to-peer activities in formal online courses. My course is a continuing education course delivered by a university for the energy industry. So it's a formal course but I would like to bring in more informal ways to learn. Therefore I would like to bring in more peer-to-peer activities into this learning design for this online course. The course is about energy and is a continuing education course. Participants in this course are busy people! They are in jobs at the same time they enrol in this course. It takes extra efforts for participants to be highly involved when they try to combine job, family and education.&nbsp;</p>

The Learning Platform is not a cloudworks like this, it's a Learning Management System, so my challenge would be how I can arrange activities to be more informal and let participants have more choice to decide people and subject they would like to work with during the course. I help teachers in designing e-tivities for online teaching and now I would like to put more focus on e-tivities which could be more informal and loose (like in this course, where we choose by ourselves which clouds to follow, learn from&nbsp;and involve in). I would like to use peer-to-peer activities which rely more on participants own activity/design.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->In this project the teachers design the e-tivities for participants to engage in. It can be questions in a discussion forum or questionnaries. Also teachers produce learning materials, which can be powerpoints with speak.</p>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->I'm very satiesfield with the five-stage model, which basic idea is to use e-tivities to build up a community so learners will start to share knowledge and collaborate.The teacher is the e-moderator.

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yandim/presentation-of-the-web-collage-tool">Web Collage</a> pattern-based tool is presented. This tool allows practitioners to produce IMS-LD compliant learning designs, instantiate them, and eventually deploy them (through Glue!PS) in a Virtual Learning Enviroment (such as Moodle, Wiki or LAMS).</p>
<p>The tool (in its latest version of Web Instance Collage 2) can be <strong>accessed</strong> on-line at <a href="http://pandora.tel.uva.es/wic2/">http://</a><a href="http://pandora.tel.uva.es/wic2/">pandora.tel.uva.es/wic2</a><a href="http://pandora.tel.uva.es/wic2/">/</a>.</p>
<p>A brief <a href="http://youtu.be/0C_AVMQ51Q8">video</a> can be seen at Youtube that describes the complete lifecycle of a learning design using Web Collage (and Glue!PS).</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yandim/implementing-the-pyramidbased-educational-scenario-using-wb-collage-worksheet">Worksheet</a> is provided to guide the <strong>production of the learning design</strong> corresponding to the sample pyramid-based educational scenario.</p>
<p>Another <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yandim/worksheet-of-deploying-a-learning-design-produced-by-web-collage-in-moodle">Worksheet</a> presents the way the derived learning design of the sample educational scenario is <strong>deployed</strong> (through Glue!PS) in the Moodle Virtual Learning.Environment.</p>

              <title>WebInstanceCollage, a pattern-based LD tool allowing particularization of groups and participants</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5861</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5861</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><a title="WebInstanceCollage LD tool" href="http://pandora.tel.uva.es/wic/" target="_blank">WebInstanceCollage</a>&nbsp;is a web-based learning design authoring tool, which builds upon the idea of <a title="CLFPs @ EduTech wiki" href="http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Collaborative_learning_flow_pattern" target="_blank">collaborative learning flow patterns</a>&nbsp;(e.g. Jigsaw, Pyramid...) and assessment patterns, enabling and guiding teachers in building complex collaborative activities using graphical metaphors for these patterns, and combining and nesting them in various ways. &nbsp;The resulting designs can be exported using IMS-LD (level A).</p>
<p>The tool also allows for the particularization (or instantiation) of the designs to different particular situations, allowing for the definition of the number of groups and the participants in each of these groups (which can be extracted from existing LMSs).</p>
<p>When using this tool together with the <a title="Official GLUE! website" href="http://www.gsic.uva.es/glue/" target="_blank">GLUE! architecture</a> for integration of LMSs and external Web 2.0 tools (e.g. GoogleDocs, MediaWiki), a teacher can now design this kind of complex activities and deploy them in multiple LMSs like Moodle (see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCLw9sf68kA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCLw9sf68kA</a>).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Installation instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a title="WebInstanceCollage LD tool" href="http://pandora.tel.uva.es/wic/" target="_blank">WebInstanceCollage</a> is a web-based tool, so no installation is required (only a very simple registration is needed to use the tool).</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>We are a team of reasearchers who are keen to find out about how Institutes have prepared academics (or are proposing to prepare) for the move to teaching in innovative learning spaces.</p>
<p>Many of these spaces are technology enhanced offering teaching staff the opportunity to utilise the many opportunities and affordances they bring with them. Research has alerted us to the fact that many academics continue to use traditional teaching methods in these spaces because they have not necessarily been prepared for a change in pedagogy or alerted to methodologies that include using technology in a collaborative manner.</p>
<p>We are keen to hear about any success stories, or even those that were not so successful, so we may design a framework for change practice. We welcome your thoughts and research findings on this cloud.</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation, Caroline, Geoff, Trish and Pauline</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Presentation by Pauline Ngimwa at CALRG annual conference 2010.</p>
<p>Academics and librarians often work in 'silos' when it comes to design and usage of digital libraries. This results in development of digital libraries which are not always aligned to the pedagogical needs of the learner, therefore failing to utilise the full potential of digital technologies. New initiatives in the design of digital libraries have highlighte the benefits of having end-users involved in the design and development process. Such benefits include user-centred resources that directly address the needs of users. However, bringing academics and learners (end-users) and librarians together to collaborate in the design process of digital libraries is complex because of their varying needs, contexts and backgrounds.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Shared Thinking points to new areas of research and practice for networked learning. This process developed at University of Glasgow utilises network-based technologies such as voting technologies and interactive whiteboards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The generative dialogical process of Shared Thinking gives rise to a visualisation or representation of the whole group at a moment in time on a given topic. This creates a learning community approach that includes and involves everyone in whole-group enquiry within the face to face classroom.</p>
<p>Not only does Shared Thinking therefore represent a new approach to networked learning it extends and connects ideas of online learning into the classroom environment. In doing so it opens up new possibilities for learning teaching and research.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sociology of Education Intercultural</strong></p>
<p>International blended learning class<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>Course concept</em><br />Our teaching project &ldquo;Sociology of Education Intercultural&rdquo; is a blended<br />learning class that leads undergraduate students to intercultural learning experience and<br />encourages them to study abroad.<br />The blended learning class is embedded in moodle, an international accepted virtual learning environment with learning modules and multiple-choice tests. To communicate with international partners we use a virtual classroom and Skype.</p>
<p>This summer term our students will do their own qualitative research project. They will interview foreign students via Skype about conditions of study and living. The interview outcomes results will be analysed and presented on their own ePortfolios (Mahara).</p>
<p><em>Opportunity to join us</em><br />We&rsquo;re looking for students who would like to be interviewed via Skype. Our students will ask them how they feel as a student in their country. What do they challenge, what do they like and what they would like to change. The interviews will take place as soon as possible until your term ends. It will be in English and last max. one hour. The installation of Skype is for free and very easy (www.skype.org) and allows the students to use a webcam and a headset. You and your students are very welcome to join us and will be informed about our outcomes.</p>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3239</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summary: Part of the <a href="http://olnet.org" target="_blank">OLnet Project</a>'s mission is to investigate the  socio-technical infrastructure that will assist the movement in pooling  its "</strong><a href="http://olnet.org/node/102"><strong>collective  intelligence</strong></a><strong>". We invite feedback from all members  of the OER community on the design storyboard introduced below...</strong></p>
<p>At this week's <a href="http://cmi2.yale.edu/hewlett_conference_2010/">OER conference</a> at Yale University, Hewlett Foundation grantees are considering many  of the big issues, which will be a valuable source of input into our  emerging CI infrastructure.</p>
<p>This cloud shadows the 'birds of a feather' Friday lunchtime&nbsp; session to discuss the design concept we storyboard in the slides and  movie below, but we invite feedback from all members of OER community  via this page...</p>
<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><a title="OER Collective Intelligence storyboard" href="http://www.slideshare.net/sbs/oer-collective-intelligence-storyboard-3612188"></a></strong>So, the idea is that working with you, OLnet develops some  "widgets" (attractive little apps you can embed in your OER website),  which enable us to crowdsource input from the community. These are  channelled back to the OLnet website which pools the data, generates  aggregate views, offers recommendations of related people and resources  to your interests, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What would these widgets do?</strong></p>
<p>OLnet seeks to advance the movement's collective intelligence by  pooling the many different layers of evidence that currently exist in  disconnected forms. We are therefore considering widgets as one way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite your stories, informal feedback, or formal evaluation results  concerning a particular OER (<strong>OER Impact</strong>)</li>
<li>Invite your inside knowledge of how the OER was designed (<strong>OER  Design Methods</strong>)</li>
<li>Invite your experiences and insights on tackling major challenges  facing the movement (<strong>OER Grand Challenges</strong>, e.g.  Organisational Obstacles, Remixing, IP Clearance...)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions for you are therefore...</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>What do you think of this design storyboard?<br /> </em></li>
<li><em>What would make these widgets 'killer apps' for you?</em><br /> ...so that you'd want to have these on your website, e.g. as an OER  educator, learner, publisher, remixer, researcher, funder...? Depending  on which hat(s) you wear, you might ask yourself:<br /> <em>What would I like to know about an OER before deciding to use it  to learn, or teach with?<br /> What would I like to know about the state of the art in a given  debate, before deciding whether to enter it, or fund work on it?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Many thanks,</p>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1554</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
This cloud provides a link to a paper published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology in 2008: Effective Online Interaction: Mapping course design to bridge from research to practice. The paper describes the way in which 'The Environmental Web' (a core course within the Open University Environmental Studies degree) includes a designed sequence of individual followed by group online activity, taken forward into the first assignment on the course. 
</p>
<p>
Students prepare for an online group role play as members of the Association of Small Island States, by searching and analyzing information from the Web about the small island state which they have been assigned by their tutor. Each student makes proposals to their group about the requirements of their small island for actions and reparations by the United Nations. The group has to agree on a statement made as if to the UN about actions and reparations that would be sent from AOSIS representing the needs of small island states in their group. This promotes evaluation of data and synthesis of competing views and priorities around sustainable development. The first assignment gives 35% of the marks for reflection on the process of online interaction and consensus making.

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1553</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p align="left">Summary from the website:<br /> <a href="http://groupscribbles.sri.com/images/screenshots/BirthdaySums.png"><img src="http://groupscribbles.sri.com/images/screenshots/BirthdaySumsThumb.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Group Scribbles enables students and a teacher to scribble contributions on sheets                        similar to post-it notes and to jointly manage the movement of these electronic notes                        within and between public and private spaces.</p>
<p>Using Group Scribbes, a classroom can enact                        a surprisingly wide range of cooperative                        activities with content ranging from simple sketches and annotations to Chinese character,                        mathematical symbols and more elaborate concept maps.</p>
<p>Because Group Scribbles encourages decentralized control and individual initiative within                        a collective framework, students are more involved in both contributing and responding to                        content as well as managing shared visual spaces.</p>
<p>Because Group Scribbles is a flexible medium                        based on a simple and familiar metaphor, teachers and students feel more comfortable in                        inventing their own forms of participatory engagement.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Using a wiki to evaluate individual contribution to a collaborative learning project</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/755</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/755</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>
This paper describes using a wiki for a co-writing activity i.e. an activity which assigns students the task of collaboratively developing a written text. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Advantages of using a wiki for this over e.g. sharing files include the shared responsibility of editorship, easier monitoring for teachers and the way that students can access the writing of other students easily. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>The co-writing activity</strong> 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Used on a course on Network Technology &amp; Human Resources Development at the University of Turin with about 30 students. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Students were asked to write pages on the wiki with summaries of particular subjects with no more than 20 lines per page, linking to new pages if they wanted to include more information on particular topics. </li>
	<li>Groups of students were asked to agree on style guidelines. </li>
	<li><strong>Phase 1: Individual Study.</strong> Students given theme for a short thesis, provided with recommended study materials. </li>
	<li><strong>Phase 2: Co-planning and division of work.</strong> On forums, group required to decide on the sections, subsections and home page layout and division of work. </li>
	<li><strong>Phase 2: Content development.</strong> Students developed the section and linking pages (forming a 'page cluster') assigned to them. </li>
	<li><strong>Phase 3: Linking.</strong> Students asked to browse the entire wiki and link from their page cluster to relevant pages compiled by others. They were encouraged not to leave this until the end. Move from hierarchical to reticular structure via this phase. </li>
	<li><strong>Phase 4: Peer Review.</strong> Students asked to peer review all the pages and make suggestions using the 'comments' function for each page. </li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Assessment </strong>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This is something that often causes difficulty for co-writing activities.   
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This was based on: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The teacher assessing the pages, links and comments to see if students had met the learning objectives</li>
	<li>Peer review by students of the quality of eachothers work</li>
	<li>Assessment of the collobarative process - see below. </li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Assessment of the colloborative process was based on a weighting and normalisation of the following: 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Forum contribution. 3a+1.5b+05c, where a = percentage of total 'content' messages, b = percentage of total 'co-ordination' messages, c = 'percentage of total 'other' messages (and normalised). Also asked students to peer review eachothers contributions with mark from 0 to 5 - close agreement between this and the scores. </li>
	<li>Peer review contribution. Each author scored each comment from 0 to 5 according to how useful they found it. </li>
	<li>Reticularity contribution. Percentage of total links. </li>
	<li>Content contribution. Percentage of pages. </li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Also evaluation of each of the collaborative processes (forum, peer review, reticularity) via incidence matrices showing responses between particular people with each element in the matrix weighted by quantity or quality. Concept of 'Centrality Index' was used here. 
</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
If you work on a large text collaboratively with a lot of contributers you can have a look at the history to see the contributions but you have to decide whether to look what a single person changed or to look what is changed without to see who changed it (when you don't want to follow every little contribution). It would be great to have a wiki with a modified history which indicates the changed parts with colours and the changing person in a context menu when clicking on the colored part. The color could indicate how old the change is and move to black over time.

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/599</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/599</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;Not an original notion - but an interesting one. The World cafe concept has been around a while www.theworldcafe.com.</p>
<p>We use this technique often in our workshops (dial-e.net), and at a recent event UTS (University of Technology Sydney) it attracted some interesting comments - so perhaps worth a reminder.</p>
<p>You've done some input, you have some group tasks defined and the groups are all working away. Then there is the dreaded plenary, you've allowed 5 minutes for each group to feedback on their deliberations - but the second group goes on for ages and by the time you get to the sixth round of feedback people feel they have nothing to add.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this workshop model (there are lots of variations) 7 groups of 4 each worked away on the task we had assigned them for 15 minutes, supported by a single sheet of A4 on which to record their comments (having white paper tablecloths and lots of pens works even better). Instead of asking for feedback, each group nominates one person to stay seated at their table and all the other people must get up and move to a new table - with each person from the group joining a new table with none of the original members. (this is a good thing to do after lunch!). Once everyone is settled back into a new grouping, the 'resident' person explains that groups comments and accepts observations from the other groups represented (in this case 3). The actual representation is less important, the intention is to have feedback shared widely and talked about. Participants then return to their original groups and spend some time feeding back on what they have heard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a practical level it makes the facilitators time control task easier, and for participants it makes for a more engaging feedback process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The variations are part of the fun, but it can work well with 16 or 160 !</p>
<p>Been thinking about this given Diana Laurillard's suggestion that the workshop was possibly a suitable foci for the majority of dimensions in the conversational framework.</p>

              <title>Using a Wiki in L1 Reading and Writing Lessons</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/592</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/592</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The idea is to combine the use of wikis with teaching reading and writing based on the</p>
<p>work of David Rose (Systemic Functional Linguistics) in Sydney who teaches reading in</p>
<p>writing in a very intense collaborative way.</p>
<p>He starts with the context of a text which students should know before they start reading.</p>
<p>From there you can go down to the meaning of the text, the paragraph and sentence.</p>
<p>From here you can look at single phrases and words and how the spelling is.</p>
<p>These words can be used to write own sentences first collaboratively and then individually.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm using wikis (within moodle) in L1 lessons because:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="display: none;" id="1228514434669S">&nbsp;</span>you can use the combination wiki/beamer just like the blackboard but the produced texts are later available over the internet, they can be&nbsp; changed or reused</li>
    <li>if you are working in a room with a beamer you can produce and revise texts jointly to teach students writing</li>
    <li>students like it to write in the wiki visible for all because no one can see their handwriting</li>
    <li>students are more active to improve the visible text because it's easy to change</li>
    <li>you can easily produce pages for each student on which students write their own texts</li>
    <li>student texts can easily be shown for all to discuss them with the class</li>
    <li>students can write texts or read the texts produced during the lesson at home</li>
    <li>student texts or parts of them can easily be put together to a larger texts</li>

              <description><![CDATA[In a first year psychology course, one of two weekly lectures was replaced by online collaborative tasks. Over a three week cycle, students were first asked to define some key concepts in their own words and share and discuss these definitions with other members of their group. 
<p>
During the second week of the cycle, each group member undertook some guided reading. 
<p>In the third week, the members collaborated online to write a 700-800 word essay. 
<p>The course leader picked two or three essays as exemplar submissions and posted them with feedback to the class message board. This conceptual scaffolding spanned six different psychology topics. Students evidenced high levels motivation and improved exam performance with other first year courses adopting similar approaches.

<strong>To make students aware of their assumptions on controversial subjects, ask them questions to which their answers can be displayed on a graph.</strong>
<p>Students are often unaware of their own assumptions until they are confronted with those of others. Sometimes these differences reflect different theoretical approaches in the subject.
<p>
This activity – originally conceived to teach the relationships between learning theories and the design of educational software – starts with learners answering online a series of multiple-choice questions, such as: “In a tutorial, if a pupil makes a mistake, it is best to…” The system then produces a graph, plotting each student on two axes (in this case, from “Teaching” to “Discovery”, and from “System” to “Learner”). The teacher then pairs students who have answered differently and gets them to agree new answers, and to give a reason. Finally, the teacher debriefs and organises the students’ answers into theories.

Without the direction and discipline of a formal course structure, learners can have difficulty remaining motivated and finding materials appropriate to their needs and preferences.
This multilingual resource centre provides friendly support for language students, including guidance for assessing their own level and learning style (and hence selecting suitable resources from its collection of links), tips for overcoming problems and psychological barriers, and discussion board and chat room, for the encouragement and practice of contact with other students.

<b>Students can learn from trying to solve realistically messy and ill-defined problems, given sufficient resources, scaffolding and support. </b>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In this course, students undertake three major four-week activities, in each of which they are given a situation or problem, relating to the curriculum being taught at that time, and they have to come up with an answer or solution.
Their work is guided by scaffolding referred to as “The Approach”. This breaks down the process into stages such as identifying relevant knowledge and experience in the group and generating relevant questions for members of their small working group – or the teacher – to answer before the next class. (External students collaborate using an asynchronous bulletin board.)
Being senior undergraduates or postgraduates, students are expected to conduct independent research and locate their own resources, in addition to those to which they are directed by the course guidance.
Both internal and external students have sessions to introduce them to the nature of problem-based learning and to correct misconceptions.

              <description><![CDATA[Collaborative learning entails students taking responsibility for assessment of their own learning processes. In this course, which aims to give students teamwork experience relevant to their future employment, self and peer assessment is formalised into a regular weekly structure.

Here, the student teams are developing a multimedia product and associated documentation, and the team roles typically include project manager, instructional designer, graphic designer, programmer. However, the principles are widely applicable.

Each team negotiates the exact responsibilities of each member (their deliverables, hours of work, expected quality) and signs a contract to record their agreement. Every week during development, each student completes an online form, rating themselves and the other members of their team for success, quality and time management. The tutor uses this information to moderate the marks for individual students.

              <description><![CDATA[When designing or choosing an asynchronous network-supported collaborative learning (ANSCL) system, what features and functions are essential or desirable? How does an ANSCL system need to be different from, say, a mail system or a news group, so as both to enable and promote collaborative learning?

A detailed model of an ANSCL system, with discussion of how each of its features arises from a particular need or problem in promoting learning, has been created by the University of Piraeus and the National Technical University of Piraeus.

The authors’ description analyses the necessary functionality of a discussion space (posting and reading messages, managing threaded discussion) and a collaborative work space, and the requirements for participants’ awareness of each other’s actions, for group management, and for evaluation.

When sequences are found to be effective, they can be re-used in different contexts, hence helping to reduce teachers’ workload.

The benefits of online activities to learners they believe include improved motivation and conceptual understanding, through encouragement of active learning, reflection, and participation in discussion.

The key design features are: (1) a link with assessment (discussion contributions count for 25% of module marks); (2) use of appropriate technology (synchronous real-time chat for small group tutorial sessions, asynchronous discussion boards for more reflective collaboration); (3) careful moderation by tutors; and (4) diagnostic pre-assessment of students’ ICT skills, followed by training if necessary.

For example, where students are asked to critically evaluate a web-based resources, they post their observations to a discussion board over several days. In class, their contributions are discussed and the tutor provides feedback. This has led to more participation, and more reflective and deeper contributions.

              <description><![CDATA[The online-tutored version of this MBA course breaks up the activities which would otherwise be done in a 3 hour face-to-face tutorial into small tasks, to be done in 15-20 minutes every couple of days over 2 weeks.

Tutor guidelines include dividing students into groups on the basis of their working preferences: eg “early birds”, “just in time”, or those who prefer synchronous or near synchronous communication at agreed times.

              <description><![CDATA[In many professional subjects, students need to learn to apply academic knowledge to their own practice and experience and to develop their fluency in talking about practice issues.

This course on youth work uses video case study material – one DVD featuring young people, one DVD featuring practitioners – as the basis of online discussions towards the end of each study block.

These discussions, each focused into a particular week, involve students sharing their individual answers to questions on the DVD material, building from basic descriptions, through comparisons, to more conceptual challenges.

              <description><![CDATA[Working at dissertation level requires students to be capable of independent study and critical use of primary source material. However, students may need scaffolding to develop these skills, and a collection of primary sources in printed form can be limiting.
<p>
This design proposes the creation of an online database of about 200 wide-ranging primary sources. As an assessed activity, students will select one document and use the VLE to write a critical comment on it. They also write a comment on the commentary of another student in their tutor group, and respond to comments on their own commentary. Later, they will use primary sources from the database to answer a set question for their end-of-course assessment.

              <description><![CDATA[This activity engages students intensely in online cooperative and collaborative work in small groups over a five-hour period on a single day.

It comes towards the end of a course on science communication, where students practice the skills of critical analysis and effective communication which they have developed earlier.

Students have an archive of TV news clips (supplied on DVD) and are given their own research question on which they write notes before the conference. In the morning of the conference day, they discuss their questions and post their answers. In the afternoon, they discuss their answers and work towards a collaborative report compiled by a volunteer coordinator. Finally, they post their report, and they can look at the reports of other groups.

              <description><![CDATA[This language course has successfully run online tutorials using the Lyceum conferencing tool as an alternative to face-to-face tutorials for conversational practice.

Lyceum includes facilities for audio-conferencing as well as a shared onscreen whiteboard, and for dividing students into small groups in separate “rooms” which the tutor can “visit”.

Tutorials are prepared by the course team and therefore more closely structured than the face-to-face equivalents; the first few establish students’ ability to use the software. Tutors are given detailed instructions, including tips on how to deal with potential problems.

              <description><![CDATA[<strong>When studying current professional issues, students may need both to learn from each other and to relate their collective work to their own individual circumstances.</strong>
<p>Collaborative work in areas of professional practice offers opportunities for students to share and to learn from each other’s experience. However, collective products introduce problems for assessment, and do not in themselves require students to apply their collaborative work to their own circumstances.
<p>
This course, on current issues in public management and social enterprise, combines and balances students collaborative and individual work.
<p>
In learning sets of 4-7, students work use a Wiki to produce a joint report, suitable for the senior staff of their organisations, on a current management issue, selected from a list of five. They then write an individual analysis and critique of the joint report from the perspective of its fitness and readiness for their own organisation.
<p>
In the assessment of this activity, the joint report counts for 40% of the total marks (normally all students in a set receive the same mark, with some scope for adjustment if the contributions have been significantly unequal), with the remainder being for the individual work.

              <description><![CDATA[What tools does a teacher need for supervising, moderating or facilitating a student discussion?

George Kahrimanis and Nikolaos Avouris suggest several important features: (1) the ability to supervise easily multiple groups which may be collaborating synchronously; (2) metrics or indicators for the rate or level of participation and collaboration amongst students; (3) evident links between dialogue messages and actions in the shared workspace; (4) the ability to review student actions that have contributed to the group’s final solution.

              <description><![CDATA[George Kahrimanis and Nikolaos Avouris have identified three issues to consider when designing or choosing a tool for collaborative working.

(1)  Should participants be able to have access to the shared workspace simultaneously, or should there be some kind of lock to ensure that only one person is making modifications at a time?

(2)  Should anyone be able to modify any material in the workspace, or should each participant retain ownership of the artefacts they originate, requiring others to get their consent for modification?

(3)  Is it more important to enable intense communication amongst a small group of participants or to support the knowledge-building of a large community?

For their discussion, follow the link and see pp. 106-107, ‘Choosing the optimal means of coordination of participants actions on a shared workspace’; p. 108, ‘Deciding on the rights of participants on object manipulation’; pp. 111-112, ‘Deciding on the nature of NSCL communication’.

              <description><![CDATA[Student discussion can be designed to be more or less structured, according to the choice of tool and the expectations and instructions set by the facilitator. When is free chatting best, and when is it appropriate to impose some form of structure?

George Kahrimanis and Nikolaos Avouris suggest that free chat is most appropriate where brainstorming or divergent thinking is required – for example, in the early stages of a problem solving activity, when students are agreeing strategy and dividing up tasks.

Structured dialogue, such as a requirement to define a category for each message or to use standard sentence openers or forms of argumentation, may be preferable where students need the help of such scaffolding to negotiate conflicting statements or make specific kinds of contributions to the task.

              <description><![CDATA[One of the reasons why discussion can fall flat is that students lack awareness of the alternatives to their own opinions and are insufficiently confident to investigate what opinions are held by other students.

Juan I. Asensio Pérez and colleagues suggest using a survey of student views as a preparation for fruitful discussion. This is not just a strategy for “soft”, interpretative arts subjects: their example is taken from a course on computer networking, and the issue on which students’ opinions are surveyed is about the potential negative effects of a certain communications mechanism.

The idea is that awareness of other points of view makes students reflect on why there are different approaches, challenges their own opinions, and helps them work their way to better-founded views.

              <description><![CDATA[One problem with timed group activities is that some students, or some groups, will finish early and get bored waiting for the others to catch up.

Where this is likely to happen, Davinia Hernández Leo and colleagues suggest adopting an approach from ‘gifted and talented’ education and providing ‘enrichment activities’: not just more of the same, which effectively penalises students for working well, but activities which will (a) extend their experience, (b) develop higher-order thinking, or (c) encourage them to pursue areas of their own choice.

              <description><![CDATA[<p>How do you group students for collaborative learning? All together in one big group, or in a number of small groups? Davinia Hern&aacute;ndez Leo and colleagues suggest some imaginative alternatives.  The &lsquo;jigsaw&rsquo; pattern is suitable for complex divisible tasks. First, each student studies a sub-problem on their own. Then they work with other students who have been studying the same sub-problem, as an expert group. Finally, they work with students who have been studying other parts of the problem to develop a complete solution. The example they give is of forming a collaborative understanding of an academic paper, with each substantive section being a sub-problem.  The &lsquo;pyramid&rsquo; pattern is suitable for complex problems without an obvious concrete solution. Students first work on a solution individually, then in pairs or small groups, then in larger groups, and then all together, developing a an increasingly broad consensus on an agreed solution. The example they give is of proposing a computing system for a client with specific requirements.

              <description><![CDATA[How can one ensure that students collaborate, if they have no previous experience of collaborative learning?

Davinia Hernández Leo and colleagues suggest some strategies, including: (1) assign tasks soluble by a team but not a single person (eg, limiting the time allowed to force division of labour); and (2) holding back from answering a student’s questions to give other students a chance to respond (eg the rule of “three before me” – answer a question only after a student has asked three others for help).

But suppose we want students to develop BOTH, and to be able to combine the generality and flexibility of conceptual thinking with the action-orientation of practical working? How do we assess that?

Sonia Bartoluzzi and Peter Goodyear suggest having students create a tool to support practical working. This will require them to articulate their tacit knowledge of practice and review that against their conceptual knowledge. Students from comparable workplaces can collaborate in developing, critiquing, and refining such tools.

              <description><![CDATA[This course, on environmental studies, is intended to get students involved with debate and action right from the start. The emphasis is on developing the skills for professional practice, and not just professional knowledge.

So the first five weeks of the course are devoted to an extended scenario, based on the Maldives. After learning about the Maldives in general, each student is allocated one of the small island states to represent. Following an activity guide, they gather information about their island and record it in a standard tabular form. They also draft a statement on their island’s environmental vulnerabilities and possible demands.

The tutor group then role plays a meeting of the Association of Small Island States (AOSIS), working online to create a statement to go to the UN, arguing for action to benefit small islands. Later, meeting face-to-face at a day school, they role play an AOSIS meeting with the UN.

For assessment, individual students submit a commentary about how consensus was reached (if it was) on the AOSIS statement and their role in the discussion.

              <description><![CDATA[A major aim of this course is to give professional teachers and managers a better understanding of eLearning by allowing them to experience learning technologies as students and users.

In this activity, students first listen to a selection of podcasts (recommended by the course or located for themselves) and make a podcast themselves, which they upload for other students to access.

They then listen to the podcasts (commenting on a wiki if they wish) and write a critique of at least two of those they have experienced, including at least one from a student, according to set criteria: both technical (eg audibility) and communicative (eg how well the speaker engages their audience).

They can add this critique and their reflections on the activity to their ePortfolio, which contributes to their end-of-course assessment.

              <description><![CDATA[The aim of this activity is to get introductory science students interacting with each other online so as to develop their understanding of scientific methods.

The students post experimental data which they have collected themselves – in this case, daily records of precipitation measured with a home-made raid gauge – using a reporting template.

The tutor stimulates discussion with open questions about their results and their methods: eg how did you measure the depth of water in your rain gauge?

To keep interaction strong and encourage a sense of learning community, students are divided into tutor groups of 20, located in roughly the same geographical area, and posting on this activity is time-limited. Motivation is supported by the inclusion of a question about the discussion in the next assessment after the activity.

              <description><![CDATA[I created a TMA (Tutor Marked Assignment) for the first few years of presentation of the OU's MBA programme (<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/bin/p12.dll?C01B823">B823: Managing Knowledge</a>), which required students to participate in a web search and interpretation exercise, working together in a virtual online team, using a variety of tools (Lyceum VoIP shared workspace; FirstClass threaded forums; phone; email). The required output was a group taxonomy of the web resources, and an individual report reflecting on how well the tools had supported/obstructed teamworking, and other reflections on being thrown together to work in this way, as many organisations now ask employees to.

This worked well in that it provided an immersive experience on which students were asked to reflect. It had the usual complications of groupworking and some technical issues with VoIP (which in pre-Skype 1999, was novel). Tech problems were however grist for the mill: students could reflect on their tolerance of problems, and the impact on their work. This would not be applicable if the focus was not on virtual team technology of course, when problems would be simply annoying.]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[The level 2 course 'team working in distributed environments' previously used FirstClass as the main medium for student interaction. We have now moved to the VLE so that we can provide both forums and wikis for each team. Teams can also use other (external) tools if they wish. If using other tools the team interaction should recorded within the forum, for example by setting agendas, uploading transcripts or posting minutes of meetings. 

Students so far have tended to find using the forums and wikis quite easy, and the tools seems to support team working well. The use of threads within the VLE forum needs some different thinking compared with FirstClass.

              <description><![CDATA[<strong>Cultural differences between learners can be an asset, if learning activities give them shared goals and make them aware of commonalities.</strong>
<p>The Learning@Europe project brought together school students from several European countries to learn about European history and culture.
<p>
Each class was paired with a class from another country to form a team, and this was given the goal of winning learning games and exercises against a second team formed of classes from another two countries; so it would be, for example, Italy and Spain against France and Poland.
<p>
Socialising and working collaboratively within their teams built trust amongst students and made them aware of commonalities; in the online learning environment, their nationality was not immediately apparent.

              <description><![CDATA[European history is a subject in which knowledge is complex, multifaceted and controversial. For the Learning@Europe project, which aimed to give school students in several European countries a deeper sense of European culture and identity, the teachers decided that a textbook approach to the subject, presenting it as if it were fixed and settled, would be inappropriate.

Instead, students were at the outset provided with only some basic historical facts about each country. The core of their teaching came through interviews with academic experts on European history. Encountering different opinions, not only amongst experts of different nationalities but amongst experts from the same country, encouraged them to discuss the reasons behind the experts’ statements with each other and with their teacher, developing a critical approach to knowledge.

See pp. 15-17, ‘Using interviews to experts for encouraging a critical approach to knowledge’.

              <description><![CDATA[Competitive games can motivate participation, but have their dangers: learners may start to play aggressively, and winning strategies may diverge from the intended learning.

To get the benefits of competition without the drawbacks, the Learning@Europe project set up competition between collaborating groups: schools from two countries were paired against schools from two other countries. 

The competition was real, in that the games had clear winners and losers, but teams could not hinder each other; eg in a treasure hunt in 3D virtual maze, players could see their opponents and check their progress but not prevent them from collecting objects.

The game tasks were designed to be closely tied to learning (eg collect from the maze four objects based clues relating to taught content) and to require collaboration (eg sharing knowledge and discussing moves – since each school could have only two players in the maze.)

<b>Get learners to participate in collaborative groupwork by setting a clear task, requiring multiple abilities and more work than anyone can do alone. </b>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Collaborative learning activities have the problem that learners may be inexperienced in group working and may be reluctant to participate.
The Learning@Europe project motivated learners by giving them a clear task and a common goal: eg winning a quiz against another team, or creating a shared product such as a chronicle of historical events.
To encourage learners to divide the work and collaborate, the tasks required multiple abilities: eg the online quiz demanded knowledge of diverse cultural areas plus hand-eye coordination to move in a 3D virtual world; the shared products demanded more work than one person could do and benefitted from multiple interpretations and perspectives.

<b>To get learners to engage and learn from role play, give them clear roles and a clear goal, with activities which will reveal their different perspectives.</b> 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Role-play can be ineffective if learners do not understand or do not engage with the situation. How does one design role-playing in which learners will internalise concepts and situational dynamics?
The role-play in the Learning@Europe project was based on a historical episode learners had already studied, thus enabling them to start from background knowledge. They were given a clear task: as members of a town council, to make a decision on whether or not to surrender the town to an invading army which had taken hostage several of their children. 
The activity was structured to produce deliverable output: working in teams, learners conducted their own research and evaluated the different possibilities, finishing by writing a joint account of the decision process. Finally, the town council was enacted in a 3D online virtual environment, with each group fielding two learners to play one of the opposing parties.
See pp. 8-10, ‘Role-playing as a learning opportunity’. [Franca Garzotto, Caterina Poggi]

              <description><![CDATA[The teaching challenge in this environmental management course was to give students an appreciation of the complexity and uncertainty of real-world decision-making, and the importance of a participatory approach and conflict resolution techniques.

Each student took on one of 21 stakeholder positions on the issue of local water resources management (highly topical in Australia at the time). 

They first prepared and posted online a position paper for their stakeholder (eg dryland farmer, aboriginal representative, independent scientist, agribusiness, fisheries), using a common information base and other resources they found for themselves. They then posted one question from their own position to each of the other stakeholders played by other students in their group.

Finally, meeting face-to-face, the students, in role, presented their position again, responded to the trickiest question they had been posed, and then attempted to reach a consensual decision.

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I helped design and write multimedia resources for Oxford Brookes University’s delivery of the National Training Programme for Gifted and Talented Coordinators during 2000.
<p>
The teachers being trained for this specialist role studied independently through distance learning materials, using a conferencing website to work and share ideas with others in their tutor group.
<p>
The multimedia resources which were part of the materials contained two main components: (1) audio extracts from interviews with experienced G&T Coordinators, and (2) video clips of dramatised scenes showing the problems faced by two fictional G&T Coordinators in their schools. These were edited or scripted to match the curriculum, which was organised around management issues. Each of them was embedded within a learning activity to encourage students to identify the management issues involved in the specific case and relate the example to their own circumstances.
<p>
Assessment of the course was through submission of a reflective portfolio and a report of a small-scale action research project.

              <description><![CDATA[I helped design and write the open learning materials for Marie Curie Cancer Care’s BSc programme in palliative care / cancer care nursing, during 1997-98.

Each course had three face-to-face teaching days, between which the nurses worked on their own, using the open learning materials and library resources. 

We took two critical learning design decisions: (1) the teaching days were to be reserved for activities which demanded students to be present together (eg presentations, roleplay); (2) the open learning materials were to consist ONLY of study guidance and learning activities, on the basis that all the didactic content was available in textbooks and journal articles.

Some of the Marie Curie lecturers, who were our subject-matter experts, took a while to adjust to this. What were they going to do on the teaching days, if not give lectures? What was going to be in the open learning materials, if not a presentation of the teaching content? But they got the hang of it eventually!

This is still the open learning project of which I’m most proud.

              <description><![CDATA[In this activity the concept of a connected document was introduced, ie one that relies on other resources to cover much of the subject, but pulls these together in a cohesive manner. The aim was to show that connectivity can be an answer to time management problems, as well as a cause. Students were given three topics to choose from, they then had to produce a connected document about that topic in a set time. This was broken down thus:
    *Search for online resources - 1 hour. Find a number of resources that you feel contribute to the topic you are covering. You may only have time to skim read them.
    *Produce a connected document - 45 minutes. Using the resources you have found, produce a connected document, adding in your own text to cover areas that haven't been addressed in any of the resources and provide a coherent narrative binding the document together.
    *Revision - 15 minutes. Give yourself some time to check the document over, ensure that it covers the area as you wish and has a coherent style.
They then had to share their document, and reflect on whether they thought it had given them a good understanding of the topic.

              <description><![CDATA[In Chemistry one way in which we used to make teaching some of the boring mundane aspects of the subject was through the use of interactive posters coupled with a group presentation. Students are allocated into groups. Each group was given an element to research. They divided the different aspects up - structure, properties, chemical reactions, medicinal and industrial use etc. Over a period of a month they researched the topic coming together to share progress from time to time. I provided support in terms of how to find and interpret information. The goal was to produce individual posters on each area and a group presentation. The final session was attended by other students and staff and both the posters and presentations were peer marked. Posters then acted as a valuable resource for the next cohort of students. The students rated the experience highly and gained general ICT and study skills as well as learning about the main topic.   ]]></description>
