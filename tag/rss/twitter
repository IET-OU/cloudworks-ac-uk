              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title</strong>&nbsp;<em>Tweeting with teens</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p><em>I was teaching English to a group of advanced students - all teenagers. I was responsible for implementing a project involving digital technology in the class.<br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>It was a small group of about 6 students aged between 15-18. We met twice a week for an hour and a half. They had a great relationship with one another and with the teacher. We'd been together for almost a year and I felt they were the perfect group to try a project, as they'd give me sincere feedback.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>I wanted to work with students' digital literacy and to get them engaged outside classroom hours.</em></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>1. I asked students to create a Twitter account and to follow me and their classmates (I created a second account just for the project). - A lot of students demonstrated then that they weren't really into Twitter.</em></p>
<p><em>2. Every week I posted questions related to the topics we were seeing in class. - Some students posted lots of answers, but most of these were directed to me, they didn't really engage in conversation with each other.</em></p>
<p><em>3. During the classes, I would ask them questions related to what they had posted on Twitter. - A lot of students had not been following the discussions and thus felt "left out".</em></p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><em>I expected students to practise the language learnt in class outside classroom hours, and I was pleased with the fact that they interacted in English only, even with one another. Something else I hoped to achieve was to get them to try a new digital tool and learn how to use it - some students took to it and learnt how to use hashtags, how to do searches and other things.</em></p>
<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>The first lesson learnt for me had to do with the choice of the digital tool to work with. I believe students should've had a voice in the decision and I shouldn't have imposed a tool I chose upon them. Also, I was responsible for prompting students with questions. Maybe if I had asked them to post questions, they would've interacted more with one another and less with me only.</em></p>]]></description>

              <title>Secret Belfast</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8315</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8315</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h3>Joel Kerr&rsquo;s design narrative: Secret Belfast</h3>
<h4>Narrator</h4>
<p>Having just moved to Belfast after three years of university in England I wanted to know more about what the city was about. There was plenty of publicity for the commercially viable activities but I had heard Belfast had a particularly vibrant &lsquo;underground&rsquo; social scene and I wanted to learn more about that.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Situation</h4>
<p>As I was new to the city I had no contacts that could teach me accepted practises of the social scene or introduce me to the community so I realised social networking would play a key role.</p>
<p>Following a few failed attempts at websites and blogs I discovered a Facebook group called &lsquo;Secret London&rsquo; which aimed to unearth the lesser known locations and events in London. I decided to set up a similar group for Belfast. After a few friends joined and a link to the group appeared in their activity feed, friends of friends joined out of curiosity. The group soon went viral and membership grew in thousands.</p>
<p>The description in the Facebook group was to share your Belfast secrets so we could learn from one another. Very soon members were posting news of events, favourite restaurants, creative groups and other projects. They were starting their own discussions in the forums and my role went from influencer to moderator, as the group took on a life of its own.</p>
<p>Due to press interest my role further evolved to organiser as I went from someone on the periphery of Belfast to someone who was considered an expert on what was going on. I got the opportunity to work with local creatives to organise events unearthing talent or activities in &lsquo;secret&rsquo; locations. The group moved from Facebook to include Twitter, a blog and a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>The common goal of each of the key players was to facilitate innovation within Belfast and foster creativity in it&rsquo;s many forms. We each had something unique to offer and we learnt from one another to advance ideas as opposed to achieving goals.</p>
<p>Everyone played a role whether they were an expert in their field, someone who like to spread the word or simply someone who wanted to do something a bit different.</p>
<h4>Task</h4>
<p>The aim was to learn what was unique about Belfast. Every city has big shopping centres, nice restaurants and trendy night spots but they do not contribute to the personality of the location.</p>
<p>Success would be knowing <em>all </em>the things to do and the people involved with them.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Actions</h4>
<p>The actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Curiosity</li>
<li>Experimentation</li>
<li>Discovery of an existing practise that could be replicated</li>
<li>Taking action. <em>This can cause embarrassment as you might mess up through trial and error or people question your motives and laugh at your efforts. Keep plugging on!</em></li>
<li>Successful implementation <em>The project was much more successful than I had anticipated. It required a lot of time and effort in moderating forums, answering questions, facilitating debates, speaking to the press and reacting to peoples requests for collaboration</em></li>
<li>Growth <em>There were a number of additional social channels that I could take advantage of in order to engage more people</em></li>
<li>Collaboration <em>The project would&rsquo;ve fallen flat on its face without enlisting expertise from existing projects, and organisations.</em></li>
<li>Innovation <em>In order to continue engaging people I had to come up with ideas to spark their interest</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The obstacles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Abuse <em>Giving people open access can lead to inappropriate posts. I found that a few sharp words was a better alternative to deleting the posts. It soon stopped</em></li>
<li>Spam <em>Popular online forums are susceptible to unwanted sales pitches. Eventually I had to lock down access and approve people who genuinely had something to share</em></li>
<li>Expertise <em>Because it was my group people assumed I had all the answers so I had to enlist relevant experts</em></li>
</ol>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>Expected outcomes:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn more about the personality of the city</li>
<li>Learn about the lesser known events and activities</li>
<li>Meet the people involved in these events and activities</li>
</ol>
<p>Unexpected outcomes</p>
<ol>
<li>Expertise in using social media</li>
<li>Expertise in organising events and promoting them via social media</li>
<li>Experience dealing with the media</li>
<li>Learning new skills from local experts (videography and audio production)</li>
<li>The ability to quickly launch new projects using my acquired knowledge and influence</li>
<li>The ability to help other creatives promote themselves for free</li>
</ol>
<h4>Reflections</h4>
<p>By acting on my initial curiosity I not only learnt about the city I live in, I became proud to be associated with it and found myself in a position to influence its development from a grass roots level.</p>
<p>I have replicated the process a few times to varying degrees of success. Each time I used the same format:</p>
<ol>
<li>An intriguing title</li>
<li>A focused message</li>
<li>A manageable use of social media</li>
<li>The right tone of voice</li>
<li>The ability for users to actively influence the progress</li>
</ol>
<p>The one obstacle I haven&rsquo;t managed to overcome is people&rsquo;s suspicion at why Secret Belfast is free for them to use, they assume there will be hidden costs.</p>]]></description>

              <title>To tweet or not to tweet? A phenomenological enquiry into the disposition of higher education lecturers towards the adoption of Twitter practices by Helen Crump</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8217</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8217</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>A dissertation submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Technology, Learning, Innovation and Change by Helen Crump. St. Angela&rsquo;s College, Sligo. Awarded by the National University of Ireland, Galway, June 2012</p>
<p>This work is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a></p>
<p>This has been submitted as an OER within the OLDSMOOC project because it was used by Jane Challinor and myself&nbsp; to provide real context to the scenario building phase of our design project, and because the interviews with Higher Education lecturers were used to develop personas for the design too.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>This phenomenological enquiry into lecturers&rsquo; disposition towards the adoption of the disruptive Web 2.0 technology Twitter comprises in-depth interviews with five lecturers in Irish higher education. The enquiry views Twitter as a digital literacy practice and takes a New Literacy Studies perspective to position Twitter as a social practice. Disposition is considered in terms of Bourdieu&rsquo;s contextual disposition.</p>
<p>The enquiry reveals the disruptive affects to long-standing knowledge-making practices and analysis of data, by a phenomenological condensation of meaning method, reveals a range of dispositions amongst the research sample lecturers towards the adoption of Twitter. Analysis suggests that the research sample lecturers are disposed towards its adoption if it affords congruence with the purpose of their practice and the values and beliefs upon which this is based, as well as with their personal beliefs and values too. Nonetheless, as a social practice, the adoption of Twitter does not go undisputed.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3>SORRY - POSTPONED UNTIL 2014</h3>
<h3>Personal learner experiences of multiple technologies during a (massive) open online course (MOOC)</h3>
<p><strong>If you are based on campus please join us for this informal, face-to-face session, have a cup of coffee/tea (with biscuits!) and contribute to the discussion.&nbsp; This event will be broadcast live online for every one to watch and will be recorded for replay.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>This presentation will review how a specific configuration of openly available collaborative and social media tools functioned during the OLDS MOOC Open Online which took place between January and March 2013. The course sought to use a range of existing tools including Cloudworks, Google groups and hangouts, Twitter, Bibsonomy, and personal blogging, principally integrating these through the design and organisation of the learning activities. The presentation will draw upon the a rich evidence base of participant feedback, blog posts and questionnaire survey data to describe how users experienced these multiple technologies and illustrate some of the ways that individuals, by exercising a degree of choice around which technologies to use and how, created more personal pathways through the course. The presentation will conclude by reflecting on the potential tensions between fragmentation and integration and between the personal and collaborative/cooperative experience.</p>

              <title>Twitter: Why you need Twitter for study and research</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5944</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5944</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>If you are not using Twitter for study, here are five reasons why you should give it some serious thought:</p>
<p><strong>1 &nbsp; You get access to different points of view </strong>First, the value of your Twitter experience will depend largely on  the people you follow. Search Twitter for people in your field, authors, experts, practitioners. You will often see links to the author's Twitter feed on blogs, news stories and elsewhere. If they interest you, follow them. Once you have started following, say, 20 people, try searching all of the people they follow and connect with even more contacts in your field or area of interest.</p>
<p><strong>2&nbsp;</strong> <strong>The people you follow will point you to great resources you might not find otherwise </strong>Blogs are only one source of information. For emerging developments, trends, news and information about day-to-day events and practice, Twitter is an invaluable source. White and Green Papers, changes to legislation, book launches, new articles, upcoming conferences and events: these are all things you might expect to come across (via the people you follow) in an average day.</p>
<p><strong>3&nbsp; </strong><strong><strong>Y</strong>ou can consult your followers (and others in the Twitter community)&nbsp;</strong>Your peers are a rich resource for study and research, for testing opinions and your own hypotheses. You can also ask straight questions and seek advice from people with experience and knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>4 Twitter is a constantly updating search engine</strong> To find Tweets on subjects that interest you and to connect with the people who are talking about things you are interested in, try searching Twitter for key terms, as you would any other search engine.</p>
<p><strong>5 Twitter helps you build study and professional networks</strong> You will see some words have the # symbol in front of them, e.g. #highered (or higher education). These are hashtags. You can search Twitter for hashtags to find people who are tweeting on subjects you are interested in. Use them yourself (e.g. #K802) and it helps others to find and connect with you.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Presentation by Tony Hirst as part of the learning analytics sympsium at CAL 2011.</p>
<p>Once the preserve of system administrators, user activity statistics are no longer hidden away in server logs, but are increasingly easy to collect via third-party analytics services such as Google Analytics or by directly interrogating service APIs. Many commercial web operations use activity data to identify how their systems are being used, as well as apparent problems with them. Activity data collected over an extended period of time may also be used as part of recommendation systems that provide added value services to the users of the system.</p>
<p>We describe several informal attempts to gather and interpret user data in a variety of educational settings, from the formal to the informal, using Google Analytics and the Gephi open-source social-network analysis and visualisation tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, we will review:</p>
<p>&ndash; the use of Google Analytics to analyse the usage of online course material in two ten-week-long Open University online courses over several presentations, treating the course materials as if they were &lsquo;just&rsquo; web pages and reviewing the performance of the course materials as if they were &lsquo;just another website&rsquo;. We show how the reports identify progression of study through the course materials, as well as revealing important information about the length of time students appear to be spending in studying the online materials, an observation that can help inform the design of future course materials (Sheikh &amp; Hirst, 2008). The analysis also demonstrates the care that must be taken in reporting website statistics, especially in the treatment of &lsquo;average&rsquo; report statistics.</p>
<p>&ndash; the use of Gephi to analyse the structure of an online Twitter hashtag community that developed around the use of the PLENK2010 hashtag during the presentation of the PLENK2010 Massive Open Online Course, as well as the behaviour of a closed community of students engaged in an Open University design course. For PLENK2010, we will show how the network of friend relationships between regular users of the PLENK2010 hashtag on Twitter may be viewed as a set of connected clusters of users, and how each cluster represents a meaningful organisation of members. For the Open University design course, we analyse the behaviour of students who were commenting on and favouriting each others&rsquo; photos as part of an online design critique activity over an extended period of time, showing various ways in which a network representation can be used to capture different perspectives on the structure of the student community and its behaviour.</p>

              <title>Has Twitter already peaked?</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>A flash debate Inspired by the Week 8 Activity for the Open University H800 course.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://themetricsystem.rjmetrics.com/2010/01/26/new-data-on-twitters-users-and-engagement/">recent analysis of data from Twitter</a> found the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Twitter ended 2009 with just over 75 million user accounts.</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->The monthly rate of new user accounts peaked in July 2009 and is currently around 6.2 million new accounts per month (or 2-3 per second). This is about 20% below July&rsquo;s peak rate.</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->A large percentage of Twitter accounts are inactive, with about 25% of accounts having no followers and about 40% of accounts having never sent a single Tweet.</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->About 80% of all Twitter users have tweeted fewer than ten times.</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Only about 17% of registered Twitter accounts sent a Tweet in December 2009, an all-time-low.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would suggest that perhaps Twitter is a fad, and has already peaked. However, the same analysis found "tremendous loyalty and engagement from those Twitter users who stay on the system after their first week as members."</p>
<p>This suggests two questions:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Is Twitter a fad that has already peaked, and is falling out of favour?</li>
<li>If Twitter is here to stay, will it be only relevant to those in the inner circle of hardcore users, but irrelevant to everyone else?&nbsp;</li>
</ol></p>
<ul>
</ul>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>When does a popular and spontaneous protest become mob rule? Fans of Twitter, the micro-blogging site, have chalked up a couple of notable victories of late. Followers helped to expose a legal injunction against The Guardian and Twitter-led protests generated tens of thousands of complaints against Jan Moir when she wrote a column using the death of Stephen Gately to criticise gay marriage. Is this net-based protest a valuable tool to demonstrate popular opinion or are we sacrificing traditional political engagement for the instant gratification direct action?</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Seems to be a growth of tools for archiving tweets/twitter streams. It makes me wonder how these kinds of tools might be used in teaching and learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the advantages of being able to archive all your tweets as a PDF?</li>
<li>What kinds of activities could you set up around this from a learning perspective?</li>
<li>Does the whole concept of converting tweets to a static PDF negate the whole idea of what twittering is about?</li>

All they need is the special sign-up code that the teacher generates when they create the environment. If a student has already joined another class on Edmodo then they can just log in as usual with their new class assigned to their login".</p>]]></description>

              <title>research ethics for e-learning with popular technologies</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2267</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2267</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm interested in finding out whether members of the group are using popular digital technologies such as Second Life, SMS, Mxit, YouTube, Facebook or Twitter (in fact any digital technologies, hardware or software, that have a widespread appeal) in teaching and learning. I don't mean those technologies that are just purely educational or institutional such as e-portfolios, PRS or VLEs.<br /> <br /> I'm interested because if people are using them for teaching and learning then there must also be people researching or evaluating this education activity.<br /> <br /> It strikes me that such research or evaluation is interesting from an ethical point of view.<br /> <br /> These digital technologies and digital networks are creating more and more places and modes that people can inhabit, where communities can form, where ideas, images and information can be produced, stored, shared, transmitted and consumed: these include social networking technologies such as Facebook, gaming technologies such as World of Warcraft; multi-user virtual environments such as Second Life, augmented reality tools such as Second Sight, context-aware systems using CreatorScape and mobile communities using Twitter.<br /> <br /> I think these technologies, each in their different ways, transform rather than merely reproduce the nature of learning and I suspect educationalists in many subjects and sectors already have several years' experience of using them. Educational research already explores some of their initiatives and opportunities and accounts are entering the literature.<br /> <br /> As I say, I think however there are ethical dimensions to researching these various pedagogies and technologies and these are perhaps lagging behind other aspects of this exciting but emergent and fragmented research area.<br /> <br /> In my view, ethics embraces everything from laws and regulations at one extreme to standards to expectations about language, taste, fashion, etiquette and behaviour at the other extreme.<br /> <br /> Ethics in the first sense is significant and problematic in this field because of the potential gulf or lag between formal institutional and legal expectations and procedures on the one hand and evolving research practice on the other.<br /> <br /> Ethics in the second sense, a more interesting sense I reckon, is important to researchers in this field because of the need to align their methods to the ethical expectations of the communities with whom they work; these expectations are however volatile, tacit, transient, chaotic and local to each community. And of course, the learner's experiences and expectations, their ethical expectations, of these educational experiences is obviously informed by the experiences and expectations they bring within from the 'outside' world where they already use Facebook, Twitter and Second Life.<br /> <br /> I'm interested in hearing whether the ethics, in the sense I've used the word, of researching the educational use of these kinds of environments interests other people in the group.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Prompted by a tweet and post by @mattlingard, I've set up this cloud.</p>
<p>Matt has set up a <a href="http://twtpoll.com/9f890h">quick survey </a>to ask people how using twitter has impacted on how much they blog or not. The results are really interesting. Matt is planning to do a more reflective blog on this, but some questions this raises for me are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If twitter has resulted in a decline in blogging, is this good or bad?</li>
<li>What is the right mix of differnt communicative tools - twitter and blogging have different affordances - one short, quick, community-based, the other more reflective?</li>
<li>In addition to twitter and blogging there are now a plethoral of other social netwokring tools for communication, for sharing information - is this good or bad? Is there a danger of dilution of message if there are too many communcation channels?</li>
</ul>]]></description>

We are engaged in work exploring a number of new to market or 'on the horizon' technology, which comprises of both hardware and software to support informal learning. 
</p>
<p>
The types of technology we are exploring include 7th and 8th generation gaming technologies such as Wii, Wii interface devices including balance board, steering wheel etc., PS3, Nintendo DSi etc.
</p>
<p>
 We are exploring a range of Web 2.0 systems and services, building API's for Facebook, Twitter and other social websites. We are exploring embedding relevent learning content from multiple sources using Drupal, Zend and other PHP Open Source frameworks.

              <title>Using twitter for language learning</title>

<a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> is a microblogging tool. You can post ('tweet') messages up to 140 characters. You follow people and people follow you. The tweets appear as a continuous stream. This <a href="http://www.commoncraft.com/Twitter">creativecommons</a> video gives you a good summary of Twitter and how it can be used. 
</p>

<p>
I have found it really useful to use this as a means of helping my Spanish language learning. I am now following a number of Spanish speakers and find the constant drip of Spanish tweets a useful means of reinforcing my learning. In addition I have used Twitter as a means of seeking help. For example last year I tweeted a query about using Ser or Estar and got three really helpful replies almost immediately.
