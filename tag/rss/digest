<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Audrey Watters; Class Central; Steve Parkinson; Donald Clark]</em></p>
<p>US researchers looking at MOOC enrolments, engagement, persistence and completion report counterintuitive findings that may help us better understand <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/journal_of_higher_education/v087/87.2.evans.html">the drop-out problem</a>. &nbsp;Having analysed 2.1m students&rsquo; participation in 2,900 lectures from 44 (mostly STEM) Coursera MOOCs, their key findings were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students who signed up 1-3 weeks before the course started demonstrated highest levels of persistence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strongest predictor of course completion was the student&rsquo;s willingness to take a pre-survey (12 percentage points more likely to complete)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students with Gmail or .edu email addresses showed worse persistence than students with other email addresses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Videos posted earlier in the week were more likely to be watched than those posted later in the week (although length of video seemed to have no impact on viewing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emails from instructors to students about new course material were ineffective in getting students to watch more</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some students were also asked which of three tracks they intended to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quantitative track (with weekly quizzes and maths based problems)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qualitative track (weekly quizzes and a final project)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auditing (watch the videos but not expected to complete assignments)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Quantitative were 20 percentage point more likely to complete than auditors, and qualitative were nearly 10 percentage points more likely to earn a certificate relative to auditors (and more likely to watch additional videos).</p>
<p>Researchers can now access anonymised <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/03/02/instructure-opens-up-canvas-network-data.aspx">learning data from 238 MOOCs</a> hosted on the Canvas Network. &nbsp;Canvas has taken the initiative to support research on online course design, large-scale informal learning and more, making data available from more than 325,000 aggregate records for MOOCs run from Jan 14 to Sep 15.</p>
<p>Hats off to George Veletsianos and Peter Shepherdson for their <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2448/3655">Systematic Analysis and Synthesis of the Empirical MOOC Literature Published in 2013&ndash;2015</a>, published in IRRODL.&nbsp; Among their findings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Researchers favour a quantitative approach, preferring to collect data via surveys and automated methods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some qualitative/interpretive research was evident (e.g. interviews, observations) but it was often basic and very much in the minority</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is only limited research on instructor-related topics (e.g. motivations, perceptions) or learner sub-populations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than 80% of papers are published by individuals based in North America and Europe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearly half of all MOOC papers are cited zero times</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Coursera is piloting <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/coursera-mentor-guided-courses/">Mentor-Guided Courses</a> where, for $248, you will be able to work with a professional who is current in the industry.&nbsp; Students who sign up get 1:1 project feedback, email/forum support and access to live weekly office hours.&nbsp; There are currently ten mentor-guided courses, each is 3&ndash;4 weeks long and has 50 slots for mentor/mentee guidance.</p>
<p>The proceedings of last month&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293884848_Proceedings_of_the_European_Stakeholder_Summit_on_experiences_and_best_practices_in_and_around_MOOCs_EMOOCS_2016">European Stakeholder Summit on experiences and best practices in and around MOOCs</a> have just been published, containing 44 papers (279pp) covering MOOC pedagogies, management and support; and MOOC learners, expectations and behaviours.</p>
<p>Learning World compares <a href="http://www.euronews.com/2016/03/04/moocs-vital-tools-that-are-shaping-the-future-of-education-or-over-hyped-online/">the MOOC situation in China and the UK</a>, examining how learners are engaging with successful courses and why just a small fraction of these are providing enough inspiration, information and motivation for students to see them through to the end.&nbsp; Donald Clark shunned the allure of China and focussed instead on <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/7-ways-to-design-sticky-moocs.html">Derby</a>, discussing seven ways on which designers made their dementia MOOC more &lsquo;sticky&rsquo;, thus upping persistence and yielding completion rates of around 35%.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t worry if you can&rsquo;t achieve persistence &ndash; Donald contends that <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/moocs-course-completion-is-wrong-measure.html">completion is the wrong measure anyway</a>: &ldquo;775 learners [of the Dementia MOOC] were asked whether they expected to fully engage with the course, 477 said yes but 258 stated that they did not intend to complete. &nbsp;This showed that people come to MOOCs with different intentions.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; The Guardian; University World News]</em></p>
<p>The OU&rsquo;s latest accounts show that it ran up a &pound;7.2m deficit in 2014-15 (2012-14: &pound;16.9m).&nbsp; This was described as &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; but &ldquo;not entirely unexpected&rdquo; as the total number of <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/open-university-posts-ps7m-loss-student-numbers-slump">students signed up for OU courses fell</a> by 13,449 (7.2%) year-on-year, to 173,889.&nbsp; This represents a fall of a third from a high of 260,119 six years earlier.&nbsp; But is there any good news?&nbsp; The OU predicts surpluses this year and next, and PA Consulting&rsquo;s Mike Boxall believes the gradual erosion of the three-year residential degree as the dominant model of higher education could &ldquo;play to [the OU&rsquo;s] strengths&rdquo;, but warned that the university&rsquo;s progress in this area was &ldquo;not very visible yet&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Despite the OU&rsquo;s woes, data from Hesa shows that HE providers in England spent a combined &pound;25.9bn and took in a total of &pound;27.7bn for a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/03/tuition-fees-england-universities-surplus-balance">&pound;1.8bn surplus for 2014-15</a> &ndash; well above the &pound;1.1bn recorded each year in 2013-14 and 2012-13.&nbsp; Fattest of the fat cats were Oxford, with a surplus of &pound;191m, Imperial (&pound;143m) and Liverpool (&pound;65m).</p>
<p>A letter signed by 103 UK vice-chancellors and published in the Sunday Times just after the Cameron/EU agreement last month <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160222154614771">argues firmly for Britain to remain in the EU</a>.&nbsp; It cites easier access to collaborative research partnerships and research funding, plus employment of European academic expertise in UK HEIs as compelling reasons to retain membership.&nbsp; UUK&rsquo;s Dame Julia Goodfellow said, &ldquo;Outside the EU, we risk cutting ourselves off from unique support and networks and undermining the UK&rsquo;s position as a global leader in science and innovation&rdquo;.&nbsp; Universities for Europe calculates that students from other EU countries generate around &pound;2.27 billion for the UK economy and support 19,000 British jobs.&nbsp; Horst Hippler, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/brexit-would-be-catastrophe-he-europe-warn-germans">president of the German Rectors&rsquo; Conference</a> (equivalent to UUK), told THE, &ldquo;To have Britain no longer belonging to the EU would be a disaster for international research in Europe.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Prof Philippe Moreillon, vice-rector of research and international relations at University of Lausanne warns that <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160301160004464">Swiss HE and research suffered</a> following its referendum which supported restrictions on free movement of people from other EU countries, with Swiss universities finding themselves &ldquo;kicked out&rdquo; of EU collaborative partnerships such as Erasmus and the incoming Horizon 2020 research programme.</p>
<p>In just four years, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160302191444908">the number of Indian students at UK HEIs has halved</a>, from 40,000 to 19,500.&nbsp; By contrast the number of Indians studying in the US has risen by 29% since 2010 and increases are also being seen in Canada, Australia, Germany and France.&nbsp; Only two UK universities, Edinburgh and Aston, seem to be bucking the trend.</p>

<p>Amazon apparently plans to launch a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/11/amazon-eyes-up-education-plans-a-free-platform-for-learning-materials/">free platform for educators</a> to upload, manage and share educational materials. &nbsp;Indications are that the platform will be based around OERs but will come with a similar interface and ratings system to its commercial site.&nbsp; Amazon already has a beta platform called Inspire which is rumoured to include the ability to self-publish learning materials and give establishments the ability to upload their digital libraries and users the ability to manage materials of interest.&nbsp; The relationship between these two (or whether they amount to the same thing) is not yet clear.</p>

<p><strong>2016 Look at the Future of Online Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>

<p><strong>Should Instructors Require Discussion in Online Courses?</strong></p>
<p><em>[IRRODL]</em></p>
<p>From last month&rsquo;s IRRODL, <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2342/3647">should instructors require discussion in online courses?</a>&nbsp; One instructor taught the same online course for three consecutive semesters using three different conditions: no online discussion; discussion without instructor participation; and discussion with active instructor participation.&nbsp; For the three components of <em>Community of Inquiry</em> (Arbaugh et al, 2008), no significant differences were found between the three conditions in respect of cognitive presence or teaching presence, but there was a significant difference in social presence for the two discussion groups.&nbsp; However, no significant differences were found between conditions in terms of time spent in the VLE, course satisfaction or student achievement.</p>

<p><strong>Blockchain for Open Sharing of Academic Records</strong></p>
<p><em>[David Vince]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201602/16-0222E/index.html">Blockchain</a> is a distributed ledger technology which works with digital currencies such as bitcoin.&nbsp; However, Sony Global Education has now developed technology that exploits blockchain's secure properties to realise encrypted transmission of educational data - such as an individual's academic proficiency records and measures of progress. &nbsp;This has the potential to create a universal system for learners and their academic results, much like an official version of sites such as LinkedIn, that could allow students to pick n&rsquo; mix credit from several institutions to create their own, personalised, qualification.</p>

<p><strong>Slack</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>In 2013, Richard Saller, Dean of Stanford&rsquo;s School of Humanities and Sciences, argued that teaching the humanities online was nearly impossible. &ldquo;The humanities have to deal with ambiguity [and] with multiple answers,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I doubt that [current platforms] will come anywhere near the quality that we have in our introductory seminars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then along came <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> &ndash; an online communication platform launched two years ago which now has more than 2.3m users logging 100m collective hours on the platform per month.&nbsp; It facilitates an online version of watercooler conversations, enabling people to trade information and chat informally with colleagues.&nbsp; It allows for threads, private groups, direct messages, file uploads, commenting, integration with common social media tools and syncing across devices.&nbsp; Might it be the game changer that online education has been waiting for?&nbsp; Read how +Acumen runs <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-03-04-could-slack-be-the-next-online-learning-platform?utm_content=buffer33495&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">successful online seminars</a> with it.</p>

<p>EdX topped the <a href="http://www.mooclab.club/pages/mooc_league_table/">MOOC platform league table</a> compiled by MoocLab, followed by Coursera, Udacity and FutureLearn.&nbsp; However, of <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-02-02-hardly-anyone-wants-to-take-a-liberal-arts-mooc">edX's top five courses</a> of 2015, only one &ndash; The Science of Happiness &ndash; is unrelated to programming, and none involve the liberal arts, despite 130 of edX's courses fall under &ldquo;Humanities&rdquo; with a further 65 in &ldquo;Arts and Culture&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[Peter Horrocks; The Independent; THE; Wonkhe; The Telegraph]</em></p>
<p>Government figures published at the end of last month, based on a survey of 90,000 organisations, show so-called <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/employers-facing-talent-poverty-as-skills-shortages-rise-130-in-four-years">skills shortage vacancies</a> now make up nearly a quarter of all job openings, having risen by 130% from 91,000 in 2011 to 209,000 in 2015.</p>
<p>The Government's HE spokesperson in the House of Lords, Baroness Evans said last month during a lengthy House of Lords debate that &ldquo;<a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/ouintra/story.aspx?id=29761">adult education and lifelong learning have a vital role in strengthening the UK's economy</a>&rdquo; and Baroness Shirley Williams said &ldquo;[the OU] enables people for the first time, all their lives long, to gain more education, understanding and wisdom&rdquo;.&nbsp; Following the distribution of OU briefing materials, cross-party Peers urged the Government to continue to focus on part-time HE in England and to create Individual Learning Accounts, relax ELQ restrictions and promote credit transfer. Digital skills, the OU's work with the BBC and FutureLearn also received mentions.</p>
<p>UCU&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ucu.org.uk/media/7868/Transparency-at-the-top-Feb-16/pdf/vcpayandparks2016_feb16.pdf">Transparency at the Top</a> report shows university leaders&rsquo; pay rose by around 3% past year compared to 2% for the proles.&nbsp; However, the OU is one of few institutions to show a marked decrease in emoluments for a Bean/Blackman/Horrocks cocktail, down from &pound;412k in 2013/14 (5<sup>th</sup> highest HEI) to &pound;354k in 2014/15 (19<sup>th</sup>).</p>
<p>There has been a record <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/eu-student-numbers-up-by-over-forty-per-cent-at-some-english-universities">11% increase in EU student numbers across the UK sector</a> in 2015-16, with some a number of English universities have increased their recruitment of EU students by more than 40% after the removal of controls on undergraduate places.&nbsp; But funding for EU students, who are entitled to public-backed loans for tuition fees, has been criticised by Eurosceptics who note that continental graduates who return home are less likely to repay their loans than graduates who remain in the UK.</p>
<p>The number of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/number-of-indian-students-at-uk-universities-falls-by-ten-per-cent-in-a-year-a6812716.html">Indian students attending British universities has fallen</a> by 10% over the last year in the wake of concerns about immigration &ndash; a situation described as &ldquo;alarming&rdquo; by the British Council, with spokesman Gordon Slaven noting that, in the same period, the USA saw 10% growth, Australia had 8%, Canada 11% and Germany 7%.</p>
<p>Hannah Pudner, Assistant Director for the OU in Wales, considers the challenges and progress of <a href="http://wonkhe.com/blogs/the-diamond-review/">the Diamond review of HE funding in Wales</a>.&nbsp; Themes emerging so far include: the current funding model is not sustainable; and Government claims about the importance of part-time provision have not been translated into policy implementation or funding.</p>
<p>The Russell Group of universities have demanded that they should be <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/12101122/Universities-could-win-right-to-become-exempt-from-Britains-Freedom-of-Information-Laws.html">exempted from Britain's Freedom of Information laws</a> because they are private institutions and not public bodies, claiming that this undermines their efforts to compete with new privately-run higher education colleges, which are not subject to freedom of information.</p>
<p>University Campus St Albans is offering a <a href="http://www.uc-sa.co.uk/our-courses/ba-honsgraduate-diploma-leadership-and-professional-development/">&ldquo;mini MBA&rdquo;</a> in which students can gain a work-related BA (Hons)/Graduate Diploma in Leadership and Professional Development in 12 months for &pound;5,500.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2016/01/22/4000-lose-jobs-pearson-restructures?utm_content=buffera3e1f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=IHEbuffer">Pearson plans to cut 4,000 jobs</a> (around 10% of its workforce) as part of a global restructuring process due to declining US college enrolments, fewer UK vocational students and a slump in textbook sales in South Africa.&nbsp; The company said it plans to integrate its assessment operations, reduce costs and &ldquo;focus more on adaptive, personalized, online assessment in an era of 'fewer, smarter' tests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason for Person&rsquo;s decline in UK vocational students is explained by last month&rsquo;s damning Ofsted report on its apprenticeship provision which found <a href="http://feweek.co.uk/2016/01/27/pearson-hit-with-inadequate-ofsted-report/">&ldquo;no key strengths&rdquo;</a>.&nbsp; The company provides apprenticeships for around 80 members of staff through its subcontractor Pearson TQ but inspectors report that, &ldquo;Too many apprentices drop out of learning or do not make sufficient progress to complete their programmes within the agreed timescale&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Pearson has notified its approx 110 customers of <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/learningstudio-openclass-end-life-pearson-getting-lms-market/">LearningStudio</a> that it will be shut down as a standalone LMS over the next 2-3 years.&nbsp; This comes on the back of an announcement last Sep that its OpenClass system will no longer be available as of Jan 18.&nbsp; A notice on the OpenClass front page proclaims, &ldquo;While the LMS will endure as an important piece of academic infrastructure, we believe our learning applications and services are truly &lsquo;where the learning happens&rsquo;. &nbsp;In short, withdrawing from the crowded LMS market allows us to concentrate on areas where we can make the biggest measurable impact on student learning outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was announced last week that the <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/3879416-apollo-education-groups-fire-sale">Apollo Education Group has successfully negotiated a $1.1bn sale</a> of itself to the Vistria Group, which is affiliated with Apollo Global Management, and the private investment firm Najafi Companies.&nbsp; The deal is expected to be concluded by Aug 2016.</p>
<p>Beijing-based TAL Education Group has invested an undisclosed amount in adaptive learning provider <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-01-24-tal-education-group-invests-in-knewton-to-integrate-adaptive-learning-engine-with-online-tutoring">Knewton</a> with the aim of integrating Knewton's adaptive learning engine into TAL's online tutoring platform, allowing TAL to develop proprietary digital adaptive content.</p>
<p>A new report from China&rsquo;s Internet Education Research Institute finds that <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/5-chinas-online-education-companies-profit-2015">China&rsquo;s online education market reached nearly US$6bn in 2015</a>, spread amongst around 9,500 native ed-tech companies.&nbsp; However, the report estimates that only around 5% of those showed a profit in 2015, with 10% breaking even, 70% posting losses, and the remaining 15% having gone out of business.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking Online Education in the United States</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>The 13<sup>th</sup> and last <a href="http://onlinelearningconsortium.org/read/online-report-card-tracking-online-education-united-states-2015/">Babson survey of US online education</a> has just been published.&nbsp; Key findings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(Unlike the UK) a year‐to‐year 3.9% increase in the number of distance education students (2014: +3.7%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28% of students (5.8m) now take at least one distance education course, and 2.9m of these are taking all of their courses at a distance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>71.4% of academic leaders rate the learning outcomes in online education as the&nbsp; same or superior to those in face‐to‐face instruction; however, only 29.1% report that their faculty accept the &ldquo;value and legitimacy&nbsp; of online education&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proportion of senior academic leaders saying that online learning is critical to their long‐ term strategy fell from 70.8% last year to 63.3% this year</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the greatest endorsement for online education is the fact that this will be the last such Babson report because the medium is now accepted as business-as-usual.</p>

<p><strong>From Bricks to Clicks</strong></p>
<p><em>[Doug Clow]</em></p>
<p>A new report from the Higher Education Commission, <a href="http://www.policyconnect.org.uk/hec/research/report-bricks-clicks-potential-data-and-analytics-higher-education">From Bricks to Clicks - The Potential of Data and Analytics in Higher Education</a>, examines data collection, learning analytics and the current barriers to implementing better data management and data analytics across UK HEIs.&nbsp; The Commission finds that UK institutions are currently not making the most of the opportunities in this area, concluding that the UK needs to do more to catch up with the US and Australia.&nbsp; The OU&rsquo;s Prof John Domingue can not only see huge potential for tracking student progress and providing study advice but he believes that once students paying thousands of pounds in fees realise the possibilities for their learning, they will start demanding it.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin Launches Revision Assistant</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>Turnitin has launched <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/21/turnitin-expanding-beyond-plagiarism-detection-launches-revision-assistant">Revision Assistant</a> &ndash; an online writing tool that uses machine learning to tutor students as they draft their essays, giving them feedback in four areas: language, focus, organization and evidence.&nbsp; The tool marks the start of a &ldquo;realignment&rdquo; of Tunitin&rsquo;s offering and is based on a product from LightSide Labs, which it bought in 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Distractions</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed; Jisc]</em></p>
<p>Last month&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/26/study-use-devices-class-nonclass-purposes-rise">Digital Distractions in the Classroom</a> report found that students waste about one-fifth of class time on laptops, smartphones and tablets, even though they admit such behaviour can harm their grades.&nbsp; Students are distracted by texting, emailing and using social media on average 11.43 times in class during a typical day.&nbsp; About 63% of surveyed students said they did this to stay connected, but an equally large share of students said they are attempting to fight boredom. &nbsp;Students also overwhelmingly support using devices in the classroom, with about 90% of respondents saying devices should not be banned.</p>
<p>However, data from digital marketing agency Greenlight suggests that 24% of Brits now think that too much time on social media or digital devices negatively impacted their performance at work.&nbsp; Some 6% intend to use apps less, 5% will reduce the size of their social media networks and <a href="http://www.information-age.com/technology/mobile-and-networking/123460811/1-4-british-consumers-want-digital-detox-2016?utm_content=bufferffc57&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">3% are considering taking a full &lsquo;digital detox&rsquo; break</a> where the use of technology is banned.</p>

<p><strong>The Future is &lsquo;Detachable&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p><em>[Business Insider]</em></p>
<p>New Year, new hype.&nbsp; Lenovo has a cunning plan to deal with the continuing decline in PC sales.&nbsp; The company is betting on a new technology trend it calls <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/lenovos-executives-are-betting-big-that-detachables-will-be-the-next-giant-tech-trend-2016-1?r=US&IR=T">detachables</a>, and is making products it calls &ldquo;2-in-1&rdquo; and &ldquo;4-in-1&rdquo; solutions.&nbsp; Instead of having to buy both a tablet and a computer, for example, their products allow users to convert one product into many.&nbsp; Fun facts: the hinge on the new Yoga 900 Laptop is made from more than 800 parts and allows the device to operate in laptop, tablet, tent or stand mode.</p>

<p><strong>Are Paper Books Really Disappearing?</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>BBC Future plots the fortunes of e-books, widely thought to have started when Peter James published his novel &lsquo;Host&rsquo; on two floppy disks in 1993, and wonders if printed books are, &ldquo;destined to eventually join the ranks of clay tablets, scrolls and typewritten pages, to be displayed in collectors&rsquo; glass cases with other curious items of the distant past?&rdquo;&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the conclusion is that it&rsquo;s not that simple because we see that different people engage with different forms of content in different ways.&nbsp; One suggestion is that a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160124-are-paper-books-really-disappearing">bi-literate society</a> will pervade, which values both the digital and printed word according to circumstances.</p>
<p>A separate BBC report notes that the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35441832#?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">use of e-books in UK schools is lower and more sporadic than in the US.</a>&nbsp;However, a recent National Literacy Trust project found that e-book use accelerated reading performance, slightly more so for boys and particularly in the case of &ldquo;reluctant readers&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>GitHub Classroom </strong></p>
<p><em>[Kristoff van Leeuwen]</em></p>
<p>GitHub is essentially a massive repository of code, best known and used by programmers.&nbsp; However, the organisation has now opened an education programme, <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">Classroom for GitHub</a>, which &ldquo;automates repository creation and access control, making it easy to distribute starter code and collect assignments on GitHub&rdquo;.&nbsp; This not only streamlines the process of managing users&rsquo; code but also means they are learning within the environment in which they will eventually work.</p>

<p><strong>OpenLearn Tops Open Courseware Provider League Table </strong></p>
<p><em>[Steve Parkinson; Audrey Watters; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>OpenLearn has topped an international <a href="http://www.mooclab.club/categories/league-tables.169/">open courseware provider league table</a> compiled by MoocLab.&nbsp; The table measures various aspects of open courseware providers including number of courses offered, partner institutions, social tools and features and interface usability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New York-based <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-01-26-panopen-launches-oer-platform-to-reduce-textbook-costs">panOpen has announced a learning platform exclusively based on OERs</a>. &nbsp;The company is running nearly 100 pilots with US colleges and universities, and its platform lets faculty curate and customise peer-reviewed content for free, while students pay $25 per course to access the materials.</p>
<p>According to Rice University, <a href="http://news.rice.edu/2016/01/20/openstax-already-saved-students-39-million-this-academic-year/">free textbooks from OpenStax</a> &ldquo;are now in use at one-in-five degree-granting US colleges and universities and have already saved college students $39m in the 2015-16 academic year&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Computers Widen Testing Gaps in Writing</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>In 2012, the US Dept of Education gave laptops to 10,000 fourth-graders for two 30-minute writing assignments, but a recent report compared those 2012s results with the same tests conducted in 2010 using pencil and paper.&nbsp; Whilst the top 20% of students scored better on the computer, the lowest 20% fared worse because they were less likely to have access to a computer and the Internet at home.&nbsp; There are now concerns about the <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-01-12-federal-study-finds-computers-widen-testing-gaps-in-writing?utm_content=buffer76266&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">impact on America's standardized testing</a> which, in 2015, was conducted on computers in more than half of US states.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Response Systems and Student Engagement</strong></p>
<p><em>[EDUCAUSE]</em></p>
<p>Prof Stephanie Blackmon writes about her experiences of introducing a mobile personal response system, <a href="http://er.educause.edu/articles/2016/1/personal-response-systems-and-student-engagement">Poll Everywhere</a>, to allow students to report anonymously on their learning experiences.&nbsp; She initially found that students would express feelings and concerns via the poll that they had declined to raise face-to-face but, as they saw her responding to these in class, they became more open in expressing themselves.&nbsp; The tool also created opportunities for some simple but timely formative assessment.</p>

<p>Six universities &ndash; Delft University of Technology; Swiss Federal Institute of Technology; the Australian National University; the University of Queensland; the University of British Columbia; and Boston University &ndash; are seeking to establish a new alliance in which each organisation&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/moocs-international-credit-transfer-system-edges-closer">MOOCs are formally accredited by partner institutions</a> in a scheme similar to the European Credit Transfer System.</p>
<p>According to Class Central, <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/moocs-2015-stats">more people signed up for MOOCs in 2015 than did so in the previous three years</a> and more than 500 organisations now offer 4,200 courses to which 35m students have signed up.&nbsp; Coursera remains the largest provider, accounting for around 50% of all MOOC students, followed by edX with FutureLearn in third (275% growth last year).&nbsp; However, when measured by course numbers, Canvas.net (291 courses) knocked FutureLearn into fourth place (239).&nbsp; Business &amp; management tops the list of course titles (705) followed by science (477) and social sciences (453).&nbsp; Computer science (410) and programming (313) have been split this year but, had that not been the case, they would have claimed the top spot.</p>

<p>Udacity has announced a new programme that <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/With-New-Promise-by-Udacity/234911">guarantees its graduates will land a job in their field within six months of completion</a> &ndash; or their money back.&nbsp; However, enrolees are advised to read the small print: the offer only applies to its most marketable topics (machine-learning engineer, Android developer, iOS developer and senior web developer); students must fully complete their course; and they must pay an extra $100 a month for that peace of mind (a total of $299 for each month of course &ndash; typically six to eight months x 10 hours per week).</p>
<p>MOOCs were supposed to help democratise access to education but there has been plenty of evidence and news items to suggest this is generally not the case.&nbsp; Now researchers from MIT and Harvard have investigated <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2015/how-socioeconomic-status-impacts-online-learning-1217">the effects of socioeconomic status on online learning</a>.&nbsp; Using demographic data from 68 HarvardX and MITx MOOCs, they found a correlation between three indicators &ndash; parental educational attainment, neighbourhood average educational attainment and neighbourhood median income &ndash; and performance and course completion, especially among younger students.&nbsp; Those enrolling in HarvardX and MITx on edX live in neighbourhoods where the median income is 38% higher than typical the US norm. &nbsp;And among teenagers who register for a HarvardX course, those with a college-educated parent are twice as likely to complete their course compared to students whose parents did not complete college.</p>
<p>Fortune reports on how an early move into <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/12/22/wharton-online-learning/">MOOCs made Wharton a major player in online education</a>.&nbsp; Most Wharton learners are aged 25 to 44, have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher, are employed full time and, since 2012, some 2.7m have enrolled in Wharton&rsquo;s 18 Coursera MOOCs and the school has awarded 54,000 x $95 verified certificates.&nbsp; Since last April they have also awarded 32,000 verified certificates in Specialization courses, adding to the estimated $5m MOOCs will generate for the School in 2015. &nbsp;Wharton expects to double that in 2016 as it launches at least two dozen new online offerings, including its first three SPOCs on the EdX platform.</p>
<p>Gilly Salmon and chums examined <a href="http://www.researchinlearningtechnology.net/index.php/rlt/article/view/28507">the use of social media (Facebook and Twitter) by participants in a MOOC</a> developed to enable educators to learn about the Carpe Diem learning design process.&nbsp; Based on interviews with 29 participants, 31% used Facebook in connection with the course, 3% used Twitter and 14% used both, but 41% did not use social media at all because, &ldquo;First, they did not believe that there was any learning value in using social media sites, and that it was a waste of their time. &nbsp;Second, they found the social media landscape too confusing and intimidating. &nbsp;Third, they did not want to blur what they perceived as the social-professional divide.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; UWN; Wonkhe; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>New data from HESA show that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35312229">part-time student numbers have hit a new low</a>, with the number of first-year students studying part time in 2014-15 falling by 6% on the previous year, and by 38% in five years &ndash; from more than 428,000 in 2010-11 to below 266,000 last year.&nbsp; The NUS blames much of the decline on government cuts to student funding, claiming, &ldquo;Their commitment to social mobility and widening participation is only at surface level, and they do not realise that part-time education is essential to this agenda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An investigation by The Times found that the UK is suffering a <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160108183149801">cheating epidemic</a> with almost 50,000 students caught in the past three years and students from outside of the EU more than four times as likely to cheat in exams and coursework.&nbsp; For example, at London&rsquo;s Queen Mary University, 75% of those found to have plagiarised were from overseas with a third from China; and at Sheffield, three in four cheats came from overseas, although they made up only 18% of the student body.&nbsp; The article also reports a growth in essay mills, particularly based in India.</p>
<p>Jackie Njoroge writes about the need for better business intelligence and improved competitive insights in UK HE, given the growing importance of efficiency and greater student choice.&nbsp; She has been part of the HESA/Jisc Business Intelligence project which was responsible for the rollout of <a href="http://wonkhe.com/blogs/with-big-data-comes-big-responsibility/">Heidi Plus</a> which will make it possible for decision makers at all levels of an organisation to more easily access, analyse, understand and act on business.&nbsp; However she warns that &ldquo;with big data comes big responsibility&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>What Next for US For-Profit HE?</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; Tony Bates; Phil Hill; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>The Chronicle reports that, at the height of their growth, for-profit colleges enrolled 1 in 12 students at US degree-granting institutions.&nbsp; But those days are over and <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/For-Profit-Colleges-May-Be/234808/?key=FDRAVdqtk3RswdiVh3rC189aM4gXxXgxf1qK1BqNVqFtTFZjblNycWxEQXlCLUYycG85TTNKV0VXRDhobWJvdWR1ZVhtNDNDYnVj">enrolments at for-profit colleges have fallen by 26% since 2009</a> compared with a 9% overall decline in US postsecondary enrolment.&nbsp; Some private providers have folded (e.g. Corinthian) while many others have experienced significant shrinkage: Apollo Education Group (owners of the University of Phoenix) has seen its corporate value decline from $10bn in 2009 to under $800m today, and a look at Phoenix enrolments shows the extent of its downsizing.&nbsp; However, writer Goldie Blumenstyk thinks all is not lost and that there are already signs of providers reinventing themselves, their offerings and their financial models.</p>
<p>CNBC profiles <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/15/a-controversial-education-model-us-is-exporting-to-the-world.html">Laureate Education</a>, the world's largest for-profit HE company by enrolment (~1m students), noting that 84% of its revenue comes from outside the US, thus avoiding intense US government scrutiny.&nbsp; The company notes the demand for low-cost HE far outstrips the supply in such places as Latin America, where HE has traditionally been the purview of Catholic colleges and state-run universities which, although cheap or free, have only limited student places.&nbsp; Critics say Laureate puts too much emphasis on marketing, advertising, executive salaries and recruitment of students and too little on quality education.&nbsp; For example, after it took over Centro Universitario in 2010, the school's quality ranking among small colleges in Brazil plunged from 41<sup>st</sup> place to No 132.</p>
<p>Tony Bates discusses data from WCET that shows <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2016/01/04/in-the-usa-fully-online-enrollments-continue-to-grow-in-2014/">US distance education enrolments continuing to grow</a> slowly but steadily.&nbsp; But a breakdown by provider confirms the Phoenix situation described above: private non-profit enrolments grew by 22% from 2012-14, public by 9%, but private for-profit declined by 11%.</p>
<p>However, the New York Times reports that <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/parent-company-of-university-of-phoenix-could-be-sold-to-owner-of-mcgraw-hill-ed/">Apollo Education Group (Phoenix) is in &ldquo;advanced talks&rdquo; to be purchased</a> by Apollo Global Management, a NY private-equity firm, (similar name, different company), owner of McGraw-Hill Education.&nbsp; NYT believes the deal could be worth about $1bn and an agreement could be reached in the next few weeks.</p>

<p><strong>The Three Laws of eLearning Failure</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Short and sweet descriptions of his <a href="http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/1848/marc-my-words-the-three-laws-of-elearning-failure/pageall">three laws of e-learning failure</a> from Marc Rosenberg, but so very true:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Great e-Learning technology combined with bad content results in more efficiently delivered bad content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When great e-Learning comes up against a lousy learning culture, the culture wins every time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>e-Learning that is compensation for bad documentation, tools, processes, or management will ultimately prove to be a waste of time and money.</p>

<p><strong>Who are the Open Learners?</strong></p>
<p><em>[EURODL]</em></p>
<p>A new IET paper presents the results of a <a href="http://www.eurodl.org/?p=current&article=707">survey of more than 3,000 OER users</a> of three repositories: OpenLearn, iTunesU and Saylor Academy. &nbsp;In addition to demographic data, they report on patterns of use, user profiles, attitudes towards OER, types of materials used and popularity of different subjects. &nbsp;The researchers found that, on the whole, learners were highly positive about their use of OER, their experiences were fairly consistent and they believe they will continue to use them.&nbsp; However, when asked whether their informal studies would now make formal study more likely, some degree of polarization was observed for iTunes and Saylor students (Table 2) but OpenLearners were much more inclined towards future formal study.&nbsp; The authors note that this may be explained by, &ldquo;the existence of planned pathways between OpenLearn content and degree level content provided by The Open University (UK) which are intended to facilitate the transition from non-formal to formal study&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Should Students Be Partners In Curriculum Design?</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>Chris Havergal examines <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/should-students-be-partners-in-curriculum-design">the role of students in pedagogical design decisions</a>.&nbsp; For example, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Bryn Mawr and Haverford colleges have involved about 250 academics and 200 student consultants since 2007.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most people who come into the programme think: &lsquo;What could a student teach me about teaching, and particularly a student outside my subject area?&rsquo;&rdquo; says director, Alison Cook-Sather. &ldquo;They also feel vulnerable that people will be watching them and judging them. [But] what happens for 99 per cent of the people who participate is that they realise it isn&rsquo;t about expertise in a subject area: it is about understanding how the student experiences pedagogy, curriculum and assessment in the class.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Bloom Revisited</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes;</em> <em>TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Bloom&rsquo;s (1956) Taxonomy might be regarded by many as a bit old hat and &lsquo;instructional&rsquo;, but it does offer a useful sanity check for authors and designers of teaching, learning and assessment to consider whether they&rsquo;re pitching things at an appropriate cognitive level.&nbsp; Anderson &amp; Krathwohl&rsquo;s 2001 revised taxonomy improved matters by swapping Bloom&rsquo;s levels 5 and 6 and introducing more friendly action verbs, then I discovered Andrew Churches&rsquo; <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/8000050/Blooms-Digital-Taxonomy-v2-12">Bloom&rsquo;s Digital Taxonomy</a> which links the categories and activities to social media and a variety of digital tools/techniques.&nbsp; And finally, via Stephen Downes, comes Eric Sheninger&rsquo;s new <a href="http://esheninger.blogspot.ca/2015/12/improving-instruction-in-digital-world.html">Rigor and Relevance Framework</a>, which he describes as, &ldquo;an action &shy;oriented continuum that describes putting knowledge to use&rdquo;.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t change the world but it&rsquo;s another useful perspective and, as with the Digital Taxonomy, it helpfully relates the action verbs to relevant learning technologies.</p>
<p>TechCrunch also looks at Bloom&rsquo;s more recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/09/how-startups-are-solving-a-decades-old-problem-in-education/?ncid=tcdaily#.vlxkaj:jmQu">Two Sigma research</a> which showed that students receiving 121 tuition using mastery learning techniques performed an average of two standard deviations better than students who learned via traditional classroom methods.&nbsp; Bloom himself concluded that this is, &ldquo;too costly for most societies to bear on a large scale&rdquo;, but Roshan Choxi considers how educational technology might help to provide or support a similar &lsquo;online mentorship&rsquo; approach.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; The Ed Techie; IRRODL; Kellogg; Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>EdSurge considers the future for edX, which has been less commercial/industry-facing than rivals Coursera and Udacity.&nbsp; The provider has over 90 partner institutions, with close to a third now approaching the end of their three-year contracts, and CEO Anant Agawal is conscious of the costs of producing and supporting MOOCs.&nbsp; He wants <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-11-23-edx-buckles-down-to-offer-credit-for-moocs">edX 2.0</a> to mark a &ldquo;transition from a &lsquo;curiosity&rsquo; platform to an essential pathway for learners in their education&rdquo;.&nbsp; Hence the article describes plans for a Global Freshman Academy, Alternative Credit Project and a now Micromasters.</p>
<p>Martin Weller predicts that <a href="http://blog.edtechie.net/mooc/2016-the-year-of-mooc-hard-questions/">2016 will be (another) year of the MOOC</a>, but that some hard questions will need answering.&nbsp; He suggests five areas will lead to &ldquo;an investment rethink&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MOOC education won&rsquo;t be as cheap for learners as envisaged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Producing MOOCs is expensive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOOCs are usually not effective recruitment avenues for universities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOOCs are not democratising education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enrolments for repeat presentations will drop after the initial burst of enthusiasts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One problem with session based MOOCs can be gaining access to materials during the &lsquo;closed&rsquo; period (and sometimes not knowing when or if a course would be offered again).&nbsp; Class Central reports that 55% of all courses listed on its aggregator site do not have an upcoming start date and that around 300 Coursera and 180 edX <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/mooc-trends-2015-rise-self-paced-courses/">MOOCs are now on-demand/self-paced</a>.&nbsp; However, students report that deadlines are a motivating factor and that forums and peer grading/commentary often do not work well with self-pacing.</p>
<p>IRRODL Vol 16 (6) is a special issue offering a European perspective of <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/issue/view/72">the past, present, and future state of MOOCs</a>.&nbsp; Among the papers is <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2185/3552">Theories and Applications of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs): The Case for Hybrid Design</a> (Anders, 2015) which presents a meta-analysis of the research literature into MOOC pedagogies (nicely summarised in Table 1).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an interesting theoretical perspective and the different hybrid design approaches all have their merits, but I&rsquo;m not convinced that many current x-MOOCs are primarily as devoid of social learning as Anders suggests.</p>
<p>Researchers at Northwestern University investigated the impact of <a href="http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/a-gentle-nudge-can-increase-participation-in-moocs">encouraging interaction and collaboration amongst MOOC students</a>.&nbsp; They sent a survey at the beginning of the second week to all participants, asking for feedback on the first week&rsquo;s material.&nbsp; Those who responded were divided into two groups, one of which received an email reminding them to contribute to the course discussion board.&nbsp; This simple nudge increased visits to the board by 26.5%, increased posts by nearly 97% and made those students about 13% more likely to complete the following week&rsquo;s quiz.&nbsp; In a second experiment, the researchers invited some participants to take part in online one-on-one discussions about the course material.&nbsp; Although only 7% of students took up this invitation, they were 10% more likely to complete their weekly quiz and their scores increased by between 2 and 10% in subsequent weeks.</p>
<p>Chairman Mao: &ldquo;a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary strategist and theorist&rdquo;?&nbsp; Discuss.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/11/17/edx-mooc-courts-questions-about-censorship-and-academic-freedom">Some Coursera MOOCs on Chinese history are raising eyebrows</a>, particularly in the US.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s propaganda,&rdquo; said US Naval Academy&rsquo;s Prof Maochun Yu, who believes the course is &ldquo;part of a larger campaign to export a way of Chinese governance &hellip; China wants to be part of the world, but it doesn&rsquo;t want to be part of a world where Western democracy and capitalism dominate.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, voice of reason Stephen Downes counters that there&rsquo;s rarely such thing as neutral course and that &ldquo;The existence of the perspective itself is valuable&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Universities Have Limited Impact on Students&rsquo; Soft Skills Development</strong></p>
<p>[THE]</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-engagement-survey-universities-have-limited-impact-students-soft-skill-development">HEA&rsquo;s UK Engagement Survey</a> of more than 24,000 undergraduates reports little significant improvement in &ldquo;soft&rdquo; skills such as creativity and citizenship over the course of their university careers.&nbsp; Eighty-three per cent reported a very high or reasonable amount of development in critical and analytical thinking skills, and half reported strong development in becoming an independent learner.&nbsp; However, only about a quarter perceived a very high level of benefit to softer skills such as citizenship, innovation and developing personal values, and there were similar responses for employability skills and the ability to analyse numerical and statistical information.</p>
<p>And a new Jisc report, <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/unlocking-the-digital-potential-of-graduates-02-dec-2015">Technology for Employability: Study into the role of technology in developing student employability</a>, also confirms that universities miss vital opportunities to equip students with the digital skills they need in the modern workplace. &nbsp;The authors suggest institutions can better prepare for supporting good practices in technology for employability in five key ways (Sect 9):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Embedding and aligning technology for employability into polices, plans and processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professional development of staff in relation to employability and technology for employability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology tools, resources, infrastructure and support for employability and student-centred flexible curricula</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving communication and collaboration to drive change in technology for employability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QA and continuous improvement through employability data monitoring, analytics and review</p>

<p>Since 2000, the number of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34902884#?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">European university mergers</a> increased substantially and almost 100 mergers have taken place, according to a report by the European University Association.&nbsp; France currently tops the mergers list, with 15 since 2002, followed by the UK and Belgium with 10 each.&nbsp; Apart from economies of scale, mergers are also a good way of promoting institutions up the world university rankings.&nbsp; The European University Association has produced an <a href="http://www.university-mergers.eu/">interactive map</a> with all the details.</p>

<p><strong>Horizon Scanning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; Will Woods; TechCrunch; Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>The 2016 NMC/EDUCAUSE Horizon Project HE expert panel has just selected the six key trends (e.g. measuring learning), six significant challenges (e.g. balancing our connected and unconnected lives) and six important developments in ed-tech (e.g. learning analytics &amp; adaptive learning) that will be featured in next February&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nmc.org/nmc-horizon-news/submit-your-projects-2016-nmc-horizon-higher-ed">NMC Horizon Report</a>.&nbsp; Now NMC is interested in learning about any kind of research, pilot programs, innovative projects, or faculty work happening at your institution or organization in any of the areas identified, ideally by 4 Jan 16.</p>
<p>Also just out is the OU/SRI <a href="http://proxima.iet.open.ac.uk/public/innovating_pedagogy_2015.pdf">Innovating Pedagogy 2015 Report</a> and, although this has a pedagogic focus rather than the technology drivers of NMC, there are many areas of overlap such as: <em>Blending Formal &amp; Informal Learning &ndash; Crossover Learning &ndash; Incidental Learning;</em> and <em>Learning Analytics &amp; Adaptive Learning &ndash; Adaptive Teaching &ndash; Analytics of Emotions.</em>&nbsp; Also interesting is the ebb and flow of the themes in Innovating Pedagogy over its four-year life (p7), with <em>Extension</em> and <em>Personalisation</em> trending this year while <em>Scale</em> has cooled.</p>
<p>There are also some remarkably close overlaps between some of Innovating Pedagogy&rsquo;s themes and those envisaged by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/28/how-education-will-be-smarter-less-intrusive-and-able-to-respond-to-how-you-feel/">Pearson&rsquo;s Amar Kumar</a>, who believes we are, &ldquo;on the verge of a tide of smarter innovation&rdquo; that will include technology that learns from learners, adapts to how students feel and provides invisible, less intrusive assessment.</p>
<p>But Joshua Kim is sceptical about edtech, &ldquo;we constantly hear about as &lsquo;imminent&rsquo;, but that always seem to fail to arrive&rdquo;.&nbsp; He lists <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/11-edtech-advances-will-not-happen-2020">11 edtech advances that will not happen by 2020</a>, such as a portfolio system that everyone will use, a mobile learning platform that will displace the browser based LMS, instructor accessible analytics that will enable data driven teaching and a learning object repository that is actually used.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oecd.org/education/education-at-a-glance-19991487.htm">Education at a Glance 2015: OECD Indicators</a> claims to be &ldquo;the authoritative source for accurate information on the state of education around the world&rdquo; (all 568 pages of it).&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s report finds that, across OECD nations, over 80% of tertiary-educated adults are employed, compared with over 70% of people with upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education, and less than 60% of adults without upper secondary education.&nbsp; Tertiary-educated adults also earn about 60% more, on average, than adults with upper secondary as their highest level of educational attainment.&nbsp; However, countries are spending less on education and the teaching population is aging.&nbsp; The report confirms that England has the highest university tuition fees and that the <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015/united-kingdom_eag-2015-85-en#page1">entry rate into tertiary education in the UK</a> is 58% compared to an OECD average of 67%, but the UK has the highest proportion of tertiary graduates in the field of sciences among all OECD countries.</p>

<p><strong>Gender Gaps Wider in Print than Digital Reading </strong></p>
<p><em>[OECD]</em></p>
<p>Also from OECD&rsquo;s Education at a Glance: reading tests of 15-year-olds showed that <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2015/11/digital_reading_gender_gaps.html">girls outperformed boys</a> by an average of 38 points on a paper-based reading test (about a year's worth of formal schooling) although this lead dropped to 26 points for the equivalent computer-based test.&nbsp; The researchers note, &ldquo;The more frequently students play one-player video games and collaborative online games, which boys tend to play more than girls, the worse their relative performance on paper-based tests. Frequent video gaming appears to "crowd out" other activities, such as doing homework regularly, that help students to acquire reading and mathematics skills.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The gap between administrators and faculty members widens as instructors &ndash; including those who have taught online &ndash; become more negative about the quality of online education compared to F2F</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faculty members are sceptical about new academic programmes that combine F2F instruction with MOOCs, fearing the model threatens traditional faculty roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of faculty members believe detection software can stop students from plagiarizing, but less than one-quarter believe students have a full understanding of what plagiarism actually is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrators and faculty members overwhelmingly say textbooks and other course materials are too expensive</p>

<p><strong>How Online College Classes Adversely Affect Student Performance</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; The Conversation]</em></p>
<p>Researchers from Stanford and Harvard examined data from DeVry University to investigate <a href="http://cepa.stanford.edu/content/changing-distributions-how-online-college-classes-alter-student-and-professor-performance#.Vif-lrB2lFs.twitter">the effects of online HE courses on student performance</a>.&nbsp; The average DeVry student takes two-thirds of their courses online and the study covers 230,000 students across an average of 10 courses each over four years.&nbsp; The authors found that, on average, online course-taking reduced student learning by one-third to one-quarter of a standard deviation compared to conventional F2F classes. &nbsp;They also claim that taking a course online also reduces student learning in future courses and persistence in college.&nbsp; They speculate that this may be partly attributable to higher levels of procrastination by online students, particularly those who are lower-performing.</p>
<p>Perhaps <a href="http://www.psmag.com/nature-and-technology/theres-no-substitute-for-in-person-lectures">video lectures</a> are the answer?&nbsp; Not according to researchers from the University of British Columbia, who found that students (<em>N=</em>276) who watched a videotaped lecture recalled less of the material, and felt less engaged in the subject, than they did after sitting through a similar live lesson.&nbsp; However, this was not due to inattentiveness because students in a control group reported roughly equal amounts of mind-wandering during the two lessons.&nbsp; For students watching the video lecture, &ldquo;memory declined as mind-wandering increased&rdquo; but this was not true of the students watching the lecture live, suggesting that memory &ldquo;is more sensitive to shifts in attention when the material is delivered online.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Australian researchers believe online courses <em>can</em> work if designed in the right way, finding that students who have access to <a href="https://theconversation.com/online-learning-can-work-if-universities-just-rethink-the-design-of-their-courses-50848">better designed, and more personalised, courses</a> tend to have higher engagement and better outcomes.&nbsp; For example, a 2013 study of 1,200 engineering students showed that the introduction of measures including staff development, adaptive online tutorials and a community portal reduced failure rates from 31% to 7% between 2007 and 2011.&nbsp; Adaptive tutorials also improved student performance on a medical degree course by 56% on standard exam scores.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; eLearning Industry; Martin Weller; Audrey Watters; TechCrunch; ALT]</em></p>
<p>Analysis by MOOC aggregator Class Central shows that the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/moocs-are-still-rising-at-least-in-numbers/57527">total number of available MOOCs</a> has grown from a handful in 2011 to around 3,500 now.&nbsp; Top provider, not surprisingly, is Coursera, with 1386 courses, followed by edX (698), Canvas (282) and FutureLearn (196) &ndash; although there is a big chunk of &lsquo;others&rsquo; (790).&nbsp; Most popular titles are statistics, computer science and business &amp; management; however, the surprise third-most-popular course added in the past year is &ldquo;A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment&rdquo; which, along with most other popular courses, comes from Coursera.</p>
<p>Marisa Keramida considers <a href="http://elearningindustry.com/the-pedagogy-behind-moocs-what-elearning-professionals-should-know">pedagogies and instructional design</a> for &ldquo;massive&rdquo; learning, covering the role of tutors/facilitators, assessment, optional activities, the pedagogic differences between c-MOOCs and x-MOOCs and the importance of keeping learners motivated.</p>
<p>Martin Weller blogs on <a href="http://blog.edtechie.net/mooc/lessons-from-the-mooc-investment-gold-rush/">lessons from the MOOC investment gold rush</a>, ending up with &ldquo;quite a cynical list&rdquo;, but one which seems to be supported by comments from the great and the good. &nbsp;Martin&rsquo;s post was written before news broke of the OU&rsquo;s further <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=29550">&pound;13m investment in FutureLearn</a>, causing <a href="http://followersoftheapocalyp.se/a-brief-note-on-futurelearn-finance/">David Kernohan</a> to try an unpick FL governance and finances.</p>
<p>But &pound;13m is loose change for <a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2015/11/udacity-be-in-demand.html">Udacity</a>.&nbsp; The company has secured a further $105m &ldquo;to scale the business&rdquo;, bringing its value to $1bn.&nbsp; New investors in this round include media and education company Bertelsmann (which buys CEO Kay Krafft a seat on the Udacity board) and Scottish investment management firm, Baillie Gifford.</p>
<p>Harvard has published a report on <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/10/26/garber-edX-financial-sustainability/">the first three years of edX</a>, reiterating their stated goals of improving on-campus learning, expanding worldwide uptake of college-level education and conducting research on learner behaviour.&nbsp; There have been some successes in all of these (HarvardX has more than three million course registrations), although the longer term sustainability of a free model (supported by &ldquo;generous donors&rdquo;) is questioned.&nbsp; Future plans include better support for mobile devices, improved assessments of progress and more flexible course timetables.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve taken, run or produced a MOOC, Sheffield&rsquo;s <a href="mailto:jlittle1@sheffield.ac.uk">James Little</a> is interested in your views and opinions via a new survey of <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.eu/s3/90004833/4fab7ad26f7a">Drivers, Implementation and Impacts of MOOCs</a>.&nbsp; He uis also conducting some interviews and would be delighted to hear from you.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; BBC; WonkHE; The Telegraph; University World News]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/ouintra/story.aspx?id=29527">The OU has re-joined University Alliance</a> to strengthen our partnerships in the HE sector. Part-time study at university level has been hit by recent changes to the way higher education is funded - particularly in England - with a 41% decline in the number of part-time undergraduates over the last five years. However 90% of the UK's current workforce will still be in work in the next decade, and it is predicted that over the next 30 years, there will be 13 million vacancies, but only 7 million school leavers to fill them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34658018#?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">It&rsquo;s the finance, stupid!</a> is a collection of essays on the decline of part-time higher education and what to do about it.&nbsp; Published by Hepi and supported by the OU, writers include the OU&rsquo;s Peter Horrocks and John Butcher, Birkbeck&rsquo;s Claire Callender and ten others.&nbsp; Reflecting on the fact that students starting part-time study fell from 258,885 to 116,025 between 2010/11 and 2014/15, Hepi says two-thirds of would-be part-timers now do not qualify for tuition fee loans because they would have to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>aiming for a qualification that is not equivalent to or at a lower level than the qualification they already hold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>studying for at least 25% of a full-time course</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>following a full course for a specified qualification rather than individual modules&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also published today is a detailed paper from Bright Blue, <a href="http://wonkhe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BBLJ3877_Going_Parttime_09.11.15.pdf">Going Part-time</a>, which explores the possible causes of the decline in PT enrolments.&nbsp; This includes a poll of 1,567 English adults who had considered but ultimately not pursued part-time HE in the past five years. &nbsp;When these &lsquo;considerers&rsquo; were asked the main reason for not pursuing their interest in part-time HE, cost emerged as the major factor (Charts 5.1, 5.2 &amp; 5.3).</p>
<p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies reports that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11987142/Ethnic-minorities-more-likely-to-go-to-university-than-white-working-class-British-children.html">white British children are now the least likely of any ethnic group to go to university</a>.&nbsp; Their five-year research found that every ethnic minority &ndash; including groups that had underperformed academically like Black Caribbeans &ndash; are more likely to go to university than white British children.&nbsp; It also revealed that within social class, poor white British children are substantially behind each ethnic minority group and even wealthy white British children are behind most ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Theresa May is planning to <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/theresa-may-plans-on-making-universities-ensure-overseas-graduates-leave-uk">make universities responsible for ensuring that overseas graduates leave the country</a> once their courses are finished.&nbsp; It is thought that the Home Office intends to use data from new checks on those exiting the country as the basis to force universities to take more responsibility for ensuring that graduates from outside the EU do not overstay their visas.&nbsp; Ms May wrote in a newspaper article earlier this year that the &ldquo;gap between the number of non-EU students coming to this country and departing each year is 96,000&rdquo;.&nbsp; Sanctions for universities with high rates of &lsquo;overstayers&rsquo; could potentially include the removal of their right to recruit more non-EU students.</p>
<p>An analysis of the top performers in the <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20151029192346710">European Union&rsquo;s Horizon 2020 programme</a> has looked at 4,190 projects and 7,804 organisations that have been awarded H2020 grants, finding that the UK has strengthened its position, along with the Netherlands and Ireland, compared with the Seventh Framework Programme.&nbsp; UCL tops the list of EC contributions (&euro;49.9m), followed by Cambridge (&euro;44.6m), Imperial (&euro;43.8m) and Oxford (&euro;40.7m).</p>
<p>Labour is warning that up to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34766970">4 in 10 English FE and sixth-form colleges could close</a> if the government presses ahead with anticipated savings in this month&rsquo;s Spending Review.</p>

<li>
<p>Making it less bureaucratic to <a href="http://wonkhe.com/blogs/the-accelerated-level-playing-field/">establish a new university</a> through faster access to Degree Awarding Powers and University Title</p>

<p><strong>Edtech UK</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>Edtech UK launched last month &ndash;&nbsp; a new strategic body set up to help accelerate the growth of the UK&rsquo;s education technology sector in Britain and globally. &nbsp;It aims to serve as a &ldquo;front door&rdquo; for industry, investment and government and a convening voice for all of the education and learning technology sector.&nbsp; I hope the site improves because I entered the &ldquo;front door&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t find very much inside, not even a link to their first major report, <a href="http://www.ednfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/EdtechUK_LP_report.pdf">Edtech: London Capital of Learning Technology</a> (tracked down via Google).&nbsp; I also can&rsquo;t help wondering how those major ed-tech players based outside the capital (Thames Valley, East Midlands, Oxford, Cambridge, Brighton, Sheffield and elsewhere) will feel about such a London-centric initial focus.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Edtech&rsquo;s Next Big Disruption is The Degree</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; The Age]</em></p>
<p>Aaron Skonnard believes that, by 2020, &ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/29/edtechs-next-big-disruption-is-the-college-degree/?ncid=tcdaily#.vlxkaj:Qqov">the traditional degree will have made room on its pedestal for a new array of modern credentials</a> that are currently gaining mainstream traction as viable measures of learning, ability and accomplishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; He believes the drivers are the rising costs of education coupled with an ongoing need to keep knowledge and skills updated in response to changing technologies and a much more volatile employment market, citing the rise of MOOC-based nanodegrees as evidence.</p>
<p>Linda Kristjanson also does some crystal ball gazing, noting that &ldquo;students are demanding to learn in a way that makes sense to them, which can be very different from the way that students have been taught for decades.&rdquo;&nbsp; She agrees that there will be an increasing focus on work-relevant knowledge and skills, and suggests that &ldquo;As content has become ubiquitous and knowledge more accessible, <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/digital-disruption-and-academia-are-we-ready-for-uberversities-in-10-years-20150930-gjxvor.html#ixzz3od6g0700">the skill of the modern academic has shifted</a> away from being an imparter of knowledge to being an integrator of knowledge, creating more personalised conditions that help students learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Will AI Software Replace Textbooks and Reshape Education?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Slate]</em></p>
<p>Will Oremus takes a look at an implementation of McGraw Hill&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2015/10/adaptive_learning_software_is_replacing_textbooks_and_upending_american.html">ALEKS</a> (Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces) system which is providing personalised learning according to students&rsquo; prior capabilities and ongoing progress.&nbsp; The role of the classroom teacher changes from lecturer to facilitator/tutor &ndash; providing individual support or for small groups with common issues &ndash; and the rate of progress.&nbsp; He also touches on some data protections issues associated with such detailed tracking and analysis of performance.</p>

<p>Latest research from Pew shows that <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/technology-device-ownership-2015/">92% of US adults own a mobile phone</a> (98% of 18-29s), of which almost three quarters are smartphones, and 45% own a tablet (50% of 18-29s).&nbsp; These are the only device types to show growth over the past year, with PCs, laptops, games consoles, MP3 players and (particularly) e-Readers all in decline.</p>
<p>In parallel with this comes <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/uploads/research/census_executivesummary.pdf?utm_source=EdsurgeLive&utm_campaign=ca531c3c78-Innovate+247&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0f1ec25b60-ca531c3c78-292151429">The Common Sense Census</a> which investigated media use by US tweens (8-12) and teens (13-19).&nbsp; On any given day, US teens average about nine hours (8:56) of entertainment media use, excluding time spent at school or for homework, with Tweens slightly lower at 5:55.&nbsp; Watching TV and listening to music remain the most popular media activities but there can be notable differences within and across groups with boys, for example, averaging 56m a day playing video games compared to just 7m by girls.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, multitasking dominates, with two thirds believing that watching TV, texting and using social media whilst doing homework does not impair the quality of their work.</p>

<p><strong>One Year Online Degree</strong></p>
<p><em>[Fiona Harvey]</em></p>
<p>The Digital Skills Academy is offering a <a href="https://digitalskillsacademy.com/honours-bsc-degree">one year online BSc (Hons) in Digital Technology, Design and Innovation</a> for &pound;6750, starting next March.&nbsp; The course is accredited by Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) and boasts working with &ldquo;International virtual team from four continents &hellip; on real-life industry projects [and with] Team meet-ups in your local city&rdquo;.&nbsp; Entry requirements are an Ordinary degree or equivalent qualification in a related discipline, or an Honours Degree or equivalent qualification in a non-related discipline, although &ldquo;Without either of these previous qualifications you may meet the entry requirements on the basis of Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Online Cheating is Now Big Business</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Atlantic]</em></p>
<p>Despite some recent technological solutions, the potential for <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/11/cheating-through-online-courses/413770/">cheating in online education</a> remains high.&nbsp; Derek Newton investigates what&rsquo;s going on and what some leading providers are doing to try and combat fraud.&nbsp; He contacted a company called No Need to Study and received an offer to take an online English Literature class at Columbia University on his behalf, with a guaranteed B grade or better for a fee of $1,225.15.&nbsp; One satisfied customer was Muhammad, who had tried taking an online maths course but &ldquo;the quizzes were just way to difficult&rdquo;.&nbsp; He paid No Need to Study and &ldquo;They absolutely killed my final math and app classes with a 90 percent, and I can definitely tell you I never got a 90 percent before on anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Online-only K-12 Schools Show Poor Performance</strong></p>
<p><em>[Hechinger Report]</em></p>
<p>Seventeen US states allow Charter Schools which provide <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/online-only-schools-show-dismal-performance-what-can-be-done/">K-12 education entirely online</a>.&nbsp; However, a new study by Stanford and others has found that online schoolchildren tend to perform much worse than those in an equivalent F2F institution.&nbsp; For example, some online students showed academic results in maths equivalent to having skipped 180 days of school (almost a full year) whilst in reading, the deficiency was the equivalent of 72 days of school.&nbsp; Whilst there may be some benefits for learners in remote locations, the report concludes that &ldquo;Academic benefits from online charter schools are currently the exception rather than the rule&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, the authors note that online-only schools tend to assign an average of 30 students per teacher as opposed to 20 in traditional public schools, meaning that not all of the problems may stem from online-ness.</p>

<p><strong>Support for Hearing and Dyslexic Impairment</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jisc]</em></p>
<p>Hearing impaired people may be able to benefit from a new LTCCS (Live-Time Close Captioning System) device which clips on to any spectacle frame and uses voice-recognition to accurately translate language in real-time, with <a href="http://www.springwise.com/voice-recognition-wearable-hearing-impaired/">the transcript appearing on a small screen in the corner of the user&rsquo;s vision</a>.&nbsp; The developers are currently crowdfunding with the aim of launching in mid-2016 at a lower price than most hearing aids.</p>
<p>The NHS estimates that dyslexia affect 5-10% of the UK population.&nbsp; Following on from Dyslexia awareness week, Jisc offers some useful advice on technologies and other solutions that can <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/blog/how-technology-can-help-dyslexic-learners-help-themselves-05-nov-2015">help dyslexic learners</a> help themselves.</p>

<p><em>[The Chronicle; HBR; EdSurge; NBC; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Researchers at Carnegie Mellon investigated student behaviour and outcomes on an &lsquo;Introduction to Psychology as a Science&rsquo; Coursera MOOC, comparing those who took it as a traditional MOOC, spending most of their time watching video lectures, with those who combined the MOOC and interactive materials produced by Carnegie Mellon&rsquo;s Open Learning Initiative.&nbsp; <a href="http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2730000/2724681/p111-koedinger.pdf?ip=137.108.145.25&id=2724681&acc=OA&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35.4D4702B0C3E38B35.4D4702B0C3E38B35.B0DA6BDBC96C38D3&CFID=721783522&CFTOKEN=70750076&__acm__=1444911542_af1dea884e2e2e63cf4e3e83aa419e06">Learning Is Not a Spectator Sport: Doing Is Better Than Watching for Learning From a MOOC</a> reports that those in the MOOC-only course scored an average of 57% on the final exam (<em>N=</em>215) whereas those in the combined course averaged 66% (<em>N=</em>939). &nbsp;And when students in the combined course completed an interactive activity, they learned six times as much as those who only read the material or watched a video. &nbsp;&ldquo;When one is watching a lecture or reading material, there&rsquo;s an illusion of learning,&rdquo; says Prof Ken Koedinger.&nbsp; The additional &ldquo;Learn by Doing&rdquo; interactive activities support student outcome achievement by providing feedback targeted to diagnose misconceptions plus robust hints to support students.</p>
<p>A report published in the Harvard Business Review draws on <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/09/whos-benefiting-from-moocs-and-why">a survey of 52,000 Coursera students</a> to look at their motivations and what kinds of educational and career results they are seeing.&nbsp; The report sorted students into two categories and the results are somewhat horoscope-like: of those who described themselves as career builders, 87% reported &ldquo;career benefits&rdquo; from their courses; and of those described as education seekers, 88% reported general educational benefits.&nbsp; When pressed for more tangible benefits, the figures were lower, at 33% (e.g. found a new job) and 18% (e.g. gained essential knowledge for my field of study) respectively.</p>
<p>MIT has announced a pilot project in which students will be able to take a semester of free online courses in one of MIT's graduate programs and then, if they pay a "modest fee" of about $1,500 and pass an exam, they will earn a <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/freshman-year/free-online-classes-mit-can-now-count-toward-degree-n440851?cid=sm_tw"><em>MicroMaster's</em> credential</a>.&nbsp; That cost includes $150 for each of the five (&lsquo;free&rsquo;) online classes, plus up to $800 to take the exam, with the MicroMasters being equivalent to half of the university's one-year master's degree program in supply chain management.</p>

<p>Baroness Sharp writes on the UUK blog of her frustrations over <a href="http://blog.universitiesuk.ac.uk/2015/10/09/the-government-needs-to-support-part-time-study/">lack of government support for part-time study in HE</a>. &nbsp;&ldquo;Whereas we have seen applications from 18-year-olds hold up in spite of the introduction of &pound;9k fees, there has been a huge fall in the numbers of part-time students: 143,000 fewer entrants to part-time undergraduate study in 2013&ndash;14 compared to 2010&ndash;11.&rdquo;&nbsp; More recent figures for 2014&ndash;15 show a further fall, bringing the total to 55% on 2010&ndash;11 numbers. &nbsp;She concludes: &ldquo;It is all so nonsensical. &nbsp;Here is a government that says it is intent on tackling low productivity and skills shortages, and yet is blocking one of the obvious routes to help ease the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A survey by Hefce found that only <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/only-one-in-four-new-degree-courses-attracts-enough-students-study-suggests">28% of new university programmes attracted enough students to be sustainable</a>.&nbsp; However, this is a big step forward compared with an older analysis of 2005-08 UCAS data that showed just one in 10 new single-subject degree courses managed to recruit at least 10 to 15 students (researchers at the time suggested that 15 to 30 was probably the minimum viable figure).</p>
<p>The Economist reports that <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21670045-scrapping-tuition-fees-has-helped-rich-students-expense-poor-ones-costly-promise">the abolition of tuition fees in Scotland has done little to widen access</a> to HE. &nbsp;The proportion of students from state schools entering Scotland&rsquo;s elite universities has fallen since 2011 and although the proportion from non-professional backgrounds has risen by 0.2 percentage points (to 26.8%), the equivalent rise in England was 2.2 percentage points (to 33.1%).</p>

<p>Hefce&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/year/2015/201521/">Differences in degree outcomes: The effect of subject and student characteristics</a> report is well worth some examination.&nbsp; Building on data collected since 2010, highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A wide variation in pass rates across subject areas.&nbsp; E.g. 90% of medicine and dentistry graduates achieved either a first or upper second but, if only firsts are considered, mathematical science graduates are the most successful, at 35%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An average of 75% of full-time graduates gained a first or upper second compared with just 57% of part timers.&nbsp; The researchers attribute four percentage points of this gap to factors such as entry qualifications, but cannot explain the remaining 14 percentage point difference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>64% of mature graduates gain a first or upper second compared with 75% of young graduates.&nbsp; However, if mitigating factors such as entry qualifications are taken into account, mature graduates outperform youngsters by seven percentage points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Males, non-whites, students with disabilities and those from independent schools tend to achieve lower degree outcomes</p>

<p>The OU is set to team up with The British Council to <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=29403">teach English, French and German language skills to approximately 3,000 displaced Syrian refugees</a> who have temporarily settled in Jordan and Lebanon.&nbsp; Around 300 of the highest achieving students will be able to progress to OU accredited online degree courses and there will also be opportunities for at least 400 to continue their studies by taking a short online course on FutureLearn.&nbsp; Syrian refugees now represent an almost 10% increase in the Jordanian population of six million and, in Lebanon, this figure is around 20%.</p>

<p>OECD&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.oecd.org/fr/publications/students-computers-and-learning-9789264239555-en.htm">Students, Computers and Learning: Making the Connection</a> examines how students&rsquo; access to and use of ICT has evolved in recent years, and explores how education systems and schools are integrating ICT into students&rsquo; learning experiences.&nbsp; However, considering there are nearly 200 pages of detailed OECD data, the concluding implications are fairly underwhelming: we should teach and invest in digital foundation skills; raise awareness of the possible harmful aspects of internet use; train teachers and develop coherent plans for using ICT in the classroom; and learn from past experience when making future investments in technology.</p>
<p>A research study report from Prospects College of Advanced Technology (PROCAT), <a href="http://procatdigital.co.uk/resources/PROCAT Student Focus Groups Report.pdf">Technology Solutions for Further Education Learning</a>, investigated students&rsquo; access to and use of technology, as well as student expectations of the college in helping them gain skills, experiences and attributes in the use of technology.&nbsp; Top of their wants/expectations were robust wi-fi, availability of devices (laptops were preferred over tablets because of their keyboards) or the ability to use their own, and access to printers.&nbsp; Some 97% owned a smartphone, 82% a laptop and 69% a tablet.</p>

<p><strong>Student Video Presentations Build Community in an Online Course</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>One of the positive features of Robert Talbert&rsquo;s face-to-face calculus course was student presentations of their work followed afterwards by a whole-class discussion. &nbsp;But when the course shifted online, his solution was to <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/how-student-video-presentations-can-build-community-in-an-online-course/57435">get students to create videos of themselves</a> and post them to YouTube.&nbsp; Each student was tasked with selecting two problems from a list and preparing a video (max 6 min for both) within a week.&nbsp; It was also a requirement that the student&rsquo;s face, voice and handwriting had to be present in the video all at the same time, at all times (i.e. typically an upper body shot of the student presenting at a whiteboard).&nbsp; The initiative has proved successful and Talbert concludes, &ldquo;Possibly the most important thing is that they added a large dose of humanity to the [distance] student experience. &nbsp;Students got to see and hear each other, and suddenly the idea of &lsquo;classmates&rsquo;, even &lsquo;class&rsquo; itself, was no longer an abstraction.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; Audrey Watters; Stephen Downes; Campus Technology; Jisc]</em></p>
<p>Commentators have been promising/threatening that MOOCs will disrupt HE almost since they first emerged, but might <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/08/05/how-nanodegrees-are-disrupting-higher-education.aspx">nanodegrees</a> actually make this happen?&nbsp; Udacity has trademarked the nanodegree and it so far has six running, including the much heralded Android Developer course, created in close cooperation with Google, for which learners pay $200/month but with a 50% refund if they complete within 12 months.&nbsp; Earlier this year, Coursera announced a similar initiative &ndash; microdegrees &ndash; in partnership with Google, Instagram and others.&nbsp; That combination of affordable, certified, vocationally relevant content, developed with and supported by industry, could be the game changer.&nbsp; According to the University of Wisconsin&rsquo;s chancellor, Cathy Sandeen, &ldquo;A growing number of industries are open to the idea of employing people with portfolio backgrounds &ndash; that is, people without four-year degrees who have done different things and can show you what they've done&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Coursera has launched a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/gsi">Global Skills Initiative</a> aimed at bringing top companies &ndash; including Cisco, Microsoft and UBS &ndash; and universities together to produce online courses in fields like data science, computer programming, and finance.&nbsp; Companies will contribute funding for production costs in addition to applied projects, guest lectures, case studies, and other materials that incorporate industry expertise into the course content, with the ultimate aim of developing learners in job-relevant skills.</p>
<p>Zaid Ali Alsagoff has published a blueprint for <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cQ7rXmFI4kOHrkiv5-j6bf1l8oxy5wWR-RWde8wWcQ/edit">NOOCs (Nano Open Online Courses)</a> which he hopes to launch next month.&nbsp; Each NOOC will be just a few hours in duration, which means &ldquo;Instead of having to do the whole course, I can now focus on the juice (I want), get assessed, and be certified (or Badged) on it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sound plausible, although Stephen Downes wonders whether it really constitutes a networked &lsquo;course&rsquo; or is simply &ldquo;another way to present content?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec Couros and Katia Hildebrandt describe and discuss <a href="http://educationaltechnology.ca/couros/2603">a framework for teaching open courses</a>. &nbsp;They identify seven elements of course design they have used in their own open courses before suggesting possible strategies for building a framework for open courses that might lead to more positive student involvement.&nbsp; The first of these is the semi-structured course environment, described by Douglas Thomas and John Seely Brown thus: &ldquo;The new culture of learning actually comprises two elements. The first is a massive information network that provides almost unlimited and resources to learn about anything. &nbsp;The second is a bounded and structured environment that allows unlimited agency to build and experiment with things within those boundaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As of last week, Coursera&rsquo;s &ldquo;Verified Certificates&rdquo; will be renamed <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/125545067462/coursera-update-a-new-name-for-verified">&ldquo;Course Certificates&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Simon Nelson talks to Jisc on <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/the-free-learning-revolution-simon-nelson-futurelearn-22-jul-2015">progress with FutureLearn</a> during its first two years, who&rsquo;s using it, how they study, which courses do well, and whether anyone&rsquo;s making any money.</p>
<p>Alongside 45 universities and 19 other organizations, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/08/04/futurelearn-mooc-platform-adds-5-new-universities.aspx">FutureLearn</a> has added Durham, Manchester, the University of Madrid, the University of New South Wales and Japan&rsquo;s Keio University to its stable.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian; Peter Horrocks; The Telegraph; BBC]</em></p>
<p>The Independent Commission on Fees said raising the cost of undergraduate tuition to &pound;9,000 a year has led to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/30/tuition-fees-report-fall-mature-part-time-students-threatens-social-mobility?CMP=share_btn_tw">&ldquo;a significant and sustained fall in part-time students and mature students&rdquo;</a>.&nbsp; The commission called for the House of Commons Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee to urgently investigate the reasons for the severe decline, concluding: &ldquo;This is a failure which threatens both social mobility and economic performance.&rdquo;&nbsp; It also expressed concern about the effectiveness of university recruitment strategies, especially among disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>The Telegraph considers whether a combination of high fees and the demise of maintenance grants mean that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/11790571/Will-UK-students-look-to-free-online-higher-education.html?utm_content=buffer2843f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">more UK students will turn to free online higher education</a>?&nbsp; James Connington considers <a href="http://uopeople.edu/">University of the People</a> as one potential source.&nbsp; UoP has relationships with NYU, Yale, the UN, Microsoft and Hewlett Packard.&nbsp; Courses are tuition free and the only costs are a $50 application fee plus $100 per exam taken.</p>
<p>Over half the prisons inspected by Ofsted in 2013‑14 were judged as requiring improvement, or were <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/aug/04/michael-gove-prison-education-justice-secretary-jail">inadequate for learning and skills</a>. &nbsp;In those prisons, inspectors found &ldquo;education and training had little impact on supporting prisoners&rsquo; progression to employment or training after release&rdquo;.&nbsp; The majority of prisoner degrees were paid for by grants from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills until 2010, since when the number of prisoners doing OU degrees has dropped from 1,722, to 1,079.</p>
<p>A new report from the National Audit Office warns that there has been a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33595027">&ldquo;rapid decline&rdquo; in the finances of the FE sector</a> in England, with almost half of FE colleges in deficit in 2013-14 and 29 being reported as having &ldquo;poor financial health&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, a spokesman for DBIS claimed that there will be &ldquo;up to an additional &pound;25m this financial year to help support the creation of three million apprenticeships by 2020&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Coventry-based RDI (part of Capella Education) has become <a href="http://www.rdi.co.uk/online-distance-learning-provider-rdi-has-achieved-university-title/">Arden University</a>, having been accredited by DBIS, making it the only specialist distance learning university to launch in the UK since the OU was established.&nbsp; Around two-thirds of RDI&rsquo;s current students are based overseas and 90% studying whilst in employment.&nbsp; As well as developing its own programmes through Arden University, RDI will also continue to offer distance learning courses from its UK university partners, Anglia Ruskin, Bradford and Sunderland.</p>

<p>TechCrunch examines the success of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/19/is-for-profit-the-future-of-education-in-brazil/">Brazilian startup Descomplica</a> and wonders if for-profit represents the future of education in Brazil?&nbsp; Descomplica provides a test prep platform for Brazil&rsquo;s standardized college entrance exam tests, with its students logging in on average once every three days and spending around 80 minutes per visit.&nbsp; They pay about $3 a month (less than 1% of the cost of a typical test prep course offered in Brazil) and 78% of them out-perform the national average on the entrance exams.</p>

<p><strong>OU Analyse </strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>OU Students are going to have their progress monitored from 2015-16 by a new program, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33675471">OU Analyse</a>, which will track students' paths through courses and engagement with online learning modules.&nbsp; It uses a variety of data sets held by the OU and assesses the likelihood of a student submitting their next assignment by using information gathered from four different algorithms.&nbsp; The OU has taken steps to ensure that students' privacy is not compromised by the scheme &ndash; putting in place an ethics policy, agreed in consultation with a student committee, to protect their data.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, EdSurge reports on <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-07-13-3-ways-educational-technology-tools-predict-student-success">three North American approaches to predicting student success</a>.&nbsp; The simplest is by measuring how much students are using curricular materials (e.g. Iowa State) whilst the second also adds other forms of engagement such as posting messages (e.g. British Columbia).&nbsp; The third and most complex method is to predict student outcomes by actually evaluating their knowledge, as currently being trialled by Stanford on a computing programming course.</p>

<p><strong>Starting a University Press &ndash; The Perks, Pitfalls and Benefits</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jisc]</em></p>
<p>Vivien Ward considers the perks, pitfalls and benefits of <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/blog/publish-or-be-damned-starting-a-university-press-the-perks-pitfalls-and-benefits-24-jul-2015">starting a university press</a> as a way of easing the financial strain on students, and Libraries.&nbsp; Available technologies mean it has never been easier for a single university or a consortium to create and distribute electronic books &ndash; although those same technologies can create a host of potential problems relating to different platforms and file formats.&nbsp; She also describes a pilot involving five UK universities as part of a <a href="https://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/Institution-as-E-textbook-Publisher/News--progress/">Digital Publishing Project</a>, with the first two books due to be published very shortly.</p>

<p><strong>Higher Education : Access Denied</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>I read all of Stephen Downes&rsquo; OLWeekly emails and have to be quite selective about what I include here for fear of being swamped.&nbsp; But this item &ndash; <a href="http://www.downes.ca/post/64221">referring to a blog post by Graham Brown-Martin</a> &ndash; I include verbatim because (for me) it just seemed to say all the right things:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a small thing, but illustrative: the correct expression is "struck a chord", not "struck a cord".&nbsp; Why does that even matter?&nbsp; The former shows that you understand what the words mean, while the latter shows that you are parroting by rote.&nbsp; And this - not "a vested interest in maintaining an intellectual hegemony" - is what the three or four years of an undergraduate education is intended to produce.&nbsp; These minor differences in expression and presentation (citing people by their first name, use of generalizations like, "no interest in transformation", out-of-place employment of clich&eacute;s like "wax lyrical") are very obvious to a person with a formal education and invisible to a person without one.&nbsp; The result is the difference between learning on one's own, and learning through immersion in a knowing community, the difference between remembering what words mean and being able to speak a language.&nbsp; I have nothing but sympathy for Graham Brown-Martin, but it's hard, especially if it wasn't part of your early life, and you can't learn to speak a language by reading books.&nbsp; This - and not just a bunch of stuff to remember - is what needs to be produced by online learning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Accessibility Update</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jisc; The Chronicle; Engadget]</em></p>
<p>Jisc&rsquo;s Lisa Featherstone offers useful advice, tips and links &ndash; based on a persona approach &ndash; to help <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/blog/how-can-you-make-resources-accessible-for-those-with-disabilities-13-jul-2015">make learning resources more accessible</a> for learners with disabilities.</p>
<p>Jisc has also announced an <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/rd/projects/accessible-by-design">Accessible by Design</a> competition, aimed at improving accessibility and inclusion in post-16 education.&nbsp; Competition submissions will be accepted from next month and anyone working or studying in UK higher education, further education and skills is welcome to apply. &nbsp;Successful teams receive &pound;5000, and will also participate in a design sprint to get their idea off the ground.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, across the pond, it&rsquo;s the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) and The Chronicle&rsquo;s George Williams offers advice and links on <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/accessibility-for-web-writers/60529">Accessibility for Web Writers</a> and <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/how-to-evaluate-your-web-pages-for-accessibility/60485">how to evaluate your web pages for accessibility</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Tablets in Education</strong></p>
<p><em>[World Bank] </em></p>
<p>The World Bank&rsquo;s Michael Trucano writes about the proliferation tablets into education, citing numerous examples, initiatives and targets, not all of which came to fruition.&nbsp; Rather than a formal report, it&rsquo;s a slightly rambling journey but it does contain some useful links, such as to the Commonwealth of Learning&rsquo;s <a href="http://oasis.col.org/handle/11599/809">Large-Scale, Government-Supported Educational Tablet Initiatives</a> (May 2015) and a JCAL paper, <a href="http://www.sciencemedianetwork.org/preprint/Hassler_Major_Hennessy_2015._Tablet_use_in_schools_A_critical_review_of_the_evidence_for_learning_outcomes-FC4.pdf">Tablet use in schools: A critical review of the evidence for learning outcomes</a>, (of 23 studies, 16 reported positive outcomes, 5 no difference and 2 negative).</p>

<p><strong>Britons 'Love Smartphones and Selfies'</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>New figures from Ofcom shows smartphones (33%) have edged ahead of laptops (30%) for the first time as the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33777168">preferred devices for connecting online</a> in the UK.&nbsp; Smartphones were also found to be more popular than digital cameras for taking and storing photos in 2014, with 60% of adults and 89% of 16 to 24 year olds using their phone for photography, and Britons collectively taking 1.2bn selfies last year.&nbsp; However, less than 5% of UK adults own a smartwatch.&nbsp; Ofcom also reports that 90% of UK homes now have 4G access and only 2% still do not have access to even the most basic 2G mobile internet signal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a survey by the Australian Department of Communications has found that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-33618517">43% of Australia's digital users illegally download movies, TV shows and music</a> on a regular basis, although they claim they would do so less if content was cheaper and available at the same time as in other countries.&nbsp; Similar research carried out at the same time in the UK found that a fifth of British digital used illegal downloads</p>

<p><strong>Apple Dominance (gasp)</strong></p>
<p><em>[Bloomberg; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>US retailers sold $375 million of watches in June 2015, 11% less than a year ago, according to data from NPD.&nbsp; The market for watches that cost less than $1,000 is most at risk, with consumers in that price range indicating they&rsquo;re the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-07/apple-helps-push-u-s-watch-sales-to-biggest-drop-in-seven-years">most likely to buy an Apple Watch</a>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Apple Watch is going to gain a significant amount of penetration,&rdquo; said NPD&rsquo;s Fred Levin, &ldquo;The first couple of years will be difficult for watches in fashion categories.&rdquo;&nbsp; Apple has not revealed sales figures but analysts suggest the company may have sold at least 1.9 million watches, assuming an average selling price of $499.</p>
<p>However, Apple has released figures from its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/07/apples-app-store-saw-1-7b-in-billings-and-broke-customer-records-in-july/?ncid=tcdaily#.vlxkaj:SUXn">App Store</a> operation, showing that over 1.5 million apps are now available to users.&nbsp; In July alone, it had its largest number of transacting customers with over $1.7bn in billings.&nbsp; To date, the company has paid out $33bn to App Store developers, with $8bn being paid in 2015 alone.&nbsp; And since April, China has been the number one source of iOS downloads.</p>

<p><strong>Windows 10</strong></p>
<p>I upgraded fairly smoothly to Win 10 last week &ndash; apart from a total absence of audio, necessitating an online hunt for drivers &ndash; and I like what I see.&nbsp; But I always like to feel that I&rsquo;m controlling the software rather than the other way round, so I began searching for useful tricks and tips, such as:</p>

<p><strong>And Finally&hellip;</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>We would probably all agree that rich use of language leads to better society and learning, but Stephen Downes writes &ndash; &ldquo;We certainly need language of some sort in order to create models and representations. &nbsp;But to my mind, that's not how we learn. &nbsp;Consider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVaITA7eBZE">this case from the BBC demonstrating a crow undertaking a complex eight-stage task</a>. &nbsp;Crows caw, but they don't have a language. &nbsp;This is the sort of behaviour that any learning theory needs to explain. &nbsp;It's not enough to theorize how <em>humans</em> learn. &nbsp;We need to know how <em>learning happens</em>, no matter where it occurs.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/as-coursera-evolves-colleges-stay-on-and-investors-buy-in/57267">Coursera has announced a further $60m of venture capital investment</a> that it proposes to use to expand further outside the US and to experiment with new offerings such as its mini-degrees that have good &ldquo;product-market fit&rdquo; and thus generate revenue.&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s not all about professional development: &ldquo;About half our content is career oriented and half isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said CEO Richard Levin. &ldquo;One of the things we&rsquo;re thinking about would be premium content on top of [the free materials] in liberal-arts courses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Predating this announcement was news that <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/128115772357/30-new-business-computer-science-and-data">Coursera is launching 30+ new Specializations</a> this month in business, computer science, and data science. Each Specialization culminates in a hands-on Capstone Project which learners can add to their professional portfolios and CV.&nbsp; Industry partners include market leaders like Google, Qualcomm, Yahoo, IBM and Amazon.</p>
<p>The Texas State University System has announced a <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/09/11/texas-state-promotes-free-frosh-mooc-year">Freshman Year for Free</a> programme which allows students to earn a full year of credit via edX MOOCs. &nbsp;The only costs to students would be to take and pass either Advanced Placement or College Level Examination Program tests after completing the various MOOCs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New York Times reports on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/nyregion/online-summer-courses-attracting-college-bound-high-schoolers.html?_r=1">growing numbers of high school students taking MOOCs</a> (although the examples they cite are highly driven individuals), both to enhance subject knowledge and differentiate them from other college applicants.&nbsp; Admissions officers agree that more MOOCs are being included on applications, but that they tend to regard them as &lsquo;extracurricular&rsquo; because there remains low confidence of their content and quality.</p>
<p>Researchers from Harvard and MIT have analysed 115 MOOCs and discovered a <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/08/26/harvard-mit-researchers-find-mooc-learners-using-multiple-accounts-cheat">new form of cheating</a>, involving the creation of multiple accounts to allow correct-answer-harvesting, that they claim poses a &ldquo;serious threat to the trustworthiness of MOOC certification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Learning has launched a <a href="http://www.mooc4dev.org/">MOOC Development portal</a>, powered by the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur&rsquo;s mooKIT.&nbsp; Interested partner institutions can use the portal to create and offer their own MOOC which is mobile phone-, Twitter- and Facebook-friendly, with up to 10,000 registrations per course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a while since we&rsquo;ve had a new MOOC acronym so, courtesy of McGill University and edX, we bring you the world's first <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/group-mooc-set-to-ignite-global-social-change-523422031.html">GROOC</a> (MOOC for groups).&nbsp; <em>Social Learning for Social Impact</em> is co-created by management guru Henry Mintzberg and it aims to &ldquo;inspire social change through global collaboration of like-minded people&rdquo;.&nbsp; So, a c-MOOC then.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; BBC; Channel 4; The Guardian; Donald Clark]</em></p>
<p>A CIPD report, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20150820150823679">Over-Qualification and Skills Mismatch in the Graduate Labour Market</a>, finds that the increasing number of graduates in the UK labour market has significantly outstripped the creation of high-skilled jobs and is leading to negative consequences, with 58.8% of graduates currently in non-graduate jobs. &nbsp;However, Universities UK responded saying the skills provided by HE, such as the ability to think critically, are lifelong and increasingly in demand.&nbsp; The Association of Graduate Recruiters predicted an 11.9% rise in vacancies this year, following an increase of 4.3% last year.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34026051">Student Loans Company</a>, in the three years from 2010, loans and grants given to foreign students at alternative providers, which receive no direct state funding, increased from &pound;50m to &pound;675m. &nbsp;Payments were suspended by DBIS in 2013 as it was feared the system was being abused and, when 11,000 applications were reviewed, it was found that 992 people had been given money before stricter checks were put in place. &nbsp;A total of &pound;5.4m was wrongly paid and, of &pound;2.45m in the hands of individual students from 23 countries, including a large number from Romania, the SLC said it had been able to recover &pound;278,427 so far.</p>
<p>In a letter to the Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond writes: &ldquo;From a foreign policy point of view, Britain's role as a world class destination for international students is a highly significant element of our soft power offer. &nbsp;It's an issue that's consistently raised with me by our foreign counterparts.&rdquo;&nbsp; He joins the Chancellor and the Business Secretary in <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/philip-hammond-student-migration-target-risks-uk-reputation">calling for student figures to be stripped out of the target to reduce net migration</a> from its current 330,000 to less than 100,000 by the next general election. &nbsp;The latest data shows that in the year to the end of March the number of overseas students coming to the UK for more than a year rose from 176,000 to 188,000, with around three quarters from outside the EU.</p>
<p>Jo Johnson believes teaching has been neglected in the pursuit of brand reputation via international rankings in parts of the UK&rsquo;s HE system, and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34197403">the patchiness of teaching quality</a> is damaging the reputation of UK universities.</p>
<p>The Guardian&rsquo;s Nick Hillman does not agree with George Osborne&rsquo;s claim that &pound;9,000 fees are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-george-osbornes-summer-budget-2015-speech">&ldquo;a triumph of progressive reform&rdquo;</a> and is calling for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/08/part-time-student-numbers-undergraduates">greater lobbying against the collapse in part-time student numbers</a>.&nbsp; He refers to an unpublished DBIS survey carried out earlier this year in which university staff admitted part-time students were seen as a lower priority than &ldquo;full-time and international students who brought in more revenue&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Donald Clark looks at <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/7-things-corbyn-wants-in-education.html">ten Corbyn education policies</a> which he believes make good sense.</p>

<p><em>[Tony Hirst; Audrey Watters; Inside Higher Ed; EdSurge]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://keypathedu.com/en-uk/">Keypath Education</a> appointed Rajay Naik as CEO (Europe) in June following his five years at The Open University and the company has now launched its European operation. &nbsp;Keypath researches, designs, launches, markets and delivers online degree programmes for its university partners in the UK, United States and Australia. &nbsp;Naik believes, &ldquo;The global ambition of our universities continues to expand, and they appreciate the constraints of conventional campuses.&nbsp; Higher quality online degree programmes allow universities to innovate, students to have more choice and our sector and economy to prosper.&rdquo;&nbsp; Keypath has stated that its sole focus until 2017 will be the launching of online degrees and the company expects their investment in British education will rise to many millions of pounds by 2016/2017.</p>
<p>Having sold the FT and its stake in The Economist, <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/21/432719104/how-will-pearson-spend-2-billion-more-on-education">Pearson</a> is sitting on around $2bn of loose change.&nbsp; Anya Kamenetz considers how it might spend this nest egg, and also what it needs to do to turnaround some of the negative perceptions of its brand, particularly in the US where its presence (monopoly?) in the standardised testing marketplace has led to almost monthly <a href="http://www.postbulletin.com/news/local/vendor-takes-pay-cut-over-minnesota-student-testing-glitches/article_823283b4-b8a0-5563-88cc-6def60fcd1d9.html">bad news stories</a>.&nbsp; She wonders whether a lack of significant competition lies at the heart of the problem.</p>
<p>&hellip;Not to worry, strong competition may soon be coming from McGraw-Hill Education if plans for a <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-09-04-mcgraw-hill-education-eyes-6-billion-ipo?utm_content=bufferf08d7&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">$6bn initial public offering</a> come to fruition.</p>
<p>Graham Holdings has sold its <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/09/08/purchase-kaplan-campuses-finalized">Kaplan Higher Education campuses</a> to Education Corporation of America.&nbsp; For-profit chain ECA has purchased all 38 Kaplan campuses and related assets, although Kaplan will continue to operate Kaplan University and eight professional schools.</p>
<p>Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Cengage have filed a lawsuit in the US against textbook importer Information Recyclers which accuses its three owners of <a href="http://the-digital-reader.com/2015/08/13/cengage-mcgraw-hill-and-pearson-file-suit-against-textbook-importer/">importing and selling pirated counterfeit copies of textbooks</a> whose copyrights belong to the three publishers.</p>
<p>TES, one of Britain's largest education resource companies, boasts more than 800,000 resources and 7.3m registered teacher-users in Britain, Australia and other countries in Europe and Asia.&nbsp; Now the company aims to offer up materials from educators around the globe on their new marketplace for resources, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-08-20-tes-online-marketplace-for-teacher-materials-opens">TES.com</a>, the US version of which opened last month. &nbsp;Whereas materials used to be free, teachers can now offer their resources for sale and, in the UK, these now account for about 50% of downloads, with TES taking a 20% fee from sellers.</p>
<p>After seven years and $105 million in venture funding, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-08-28-finally-knewton-opens-adaptive-learning-platform-to-teachers-and-learners?utm_campaign=18eff420d7-Innovate+238&utm_medium=email&utm_source=EdsurgeLive&utm_term=0_0f1ec25b60-18eff420d7-292151429">Knewton</a> has finally opened up its adaptive learning platform to teachers, students and parents. It claims the free platform has over 100,000 pieces of content and multiple-choice questions for K-12 maths, English, science and history.&nbsp; Adaptive learning algorithms can deliver different sequences of learning materials and assessments based on how students progress.</p>

<p><strong>Who Are Your Online Students?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2015/08/07/who-are-your-online-students/#sthash.GOKzAWIP.JksXOpMq.dpuf">Online college students 2015: Comprehensive data on demands and preferences</a> reports on a survey of 1,500 US students who were recently enrolled, currently enrolled or planning to enrol in the next 12 months in either a fully online undergraduate or graduate degree program or a fully online certificate or licensure program.&nbsp; Key findings from its 53 pages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Competition for online students is increasing and they expect policies and processes tailored to their needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online students have a wide range of needs and backgrounds.&nbsp; About half would attend a hybrid or low-residency option if their program was not available fully online, but 30% would look elsewhere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main motivation for online students is to improve their work prospects and so courses must prepare them for and connect them to the world of work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Half of online students live within 50 miles of their campus, so a strong local brand is critical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost matters, with 45% of respondents selecting the most inexpensive institution.&nbsp; Among 23 potential marketing messages, the most appealing were found to be &ldquo;Affordable tuition&rdquo; and &ldquo;Free textbooks&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Use of Different Media in e-Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Donald Clark]</em></p>
<p>A bit like Tony Bates, Donald Clark seems to have become a more prolific writer, blogger, tweeter, etc, since he stopped having a regular day job.&nbsp; In separate posts, here are his design thoughts on the use of the following media in e-learning: <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.gr/2015/08/10-bloody-good-reasons-for-using-much.html">text</a> (and <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/10-top-online-learning-writing-rules.html">how best to write it</a>); <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.gr/2015/09/10-rules-most-often-broken-to-avoid-bad.html">graphics</a>; <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.gr/2015/09/10-essential-rules-on-use-of-animation.html">animation</a>; <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.gr/2015/09/10-sound-pieces-of-advice-on-use-of.html">audio</a>; and talking-head <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.gr/2015/09/10-rules-on-using-much-maligned-talking.html">video</a>.</p>

<p><strong>QA and Internationalisation Top Priorities for European Universities</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>A new report from the European University Association (EUA), <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/European-Universities-Make/232625/?cid=gn&utm_source=gn&utm_medium=en">Trends 2015: Learning and teaching in European universities</a>, is the result of responses from 451 universities from 46 countries.&nbsp; Compared to the previous report five years ago, it shows how institutions in different countries have faced up to the economic crisis, changing demographic trends and other major political and social challenges &ndash; with quality assurance and internationalisation emerging as the top priorities across Europe.&nbsp; The EU is the geographical target for 73% of European universities, with Asia (48%) gaining in importance whilst non-EU Eastern Europe and North America are losing ground.&nbsp; Interest in the EU is the lowest in Ireland (29%) and Great Britain (33%).</p>

<p><strong>Expect Learning to Become More Digital</strong></p>
<p><em>[Fox; SchoolGuide; THE]</em></p>
<p>Two classic examples of publishers asking the right questions to the right people and getting the right answers&hellip;</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2015/08/20/mcgraw-hill-education-ceo-expect-learning-to-become-more-digital/">McGraw-Hill Education</a>, not only is the learning environment of today very different compared to two or three decades ago (gasp), but it&rsquo;s going to get more digital.&nbsp; The company sold more software-based text in HE last year than physical textbooks, and both educators (75% of 171 surveyed) and students (55% of 1000 surveyed) want and expect more of it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.ischoolguide.com/articles/23131/20150821/vitalsource-technologies-survey-students-digital-interactive-homework.htm">VitalSource</a> found that 61% (of 500) students want more digitally-interactive homework.&nbsp; Between 2011 and 2015, the number of students who use digital technology to read course materials rose from 63% to 87% and 74% feel they could get even better grades if their professors used even more tech in the classroom.</p>
<p>But what they don&rsquo;t report is that <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2015/08/31/survey-87-percent-of-parents-are-concerned-about-student-data-security.aspx">87% of US parents are concerned about student data security</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Martin Dougiamas and Changes to the Moodle Community</strong></p>
<p><em>[e-Literate]</em></p>
<p>Phil Hill recently interviewed <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/interview-with-martin-dougiamas-on-changes-to-moodle-community-this-year/">Moodle founder, Martin Dougiamas</a>.&nbsp; There was quite a focus on Moodle&rsquo;s relationship with the commercial sector so it may be reassuring to many that MD does not regard Blackboard&rsquo;s recent acquisitions as having a huge impact.&nbsp; &ldquo;Moodle&rsquo;s mission is not changing at all, we are just expanding and improving how we do things in response to a shifting ed-tech world.&rdquo;&nbsp; He notes that around 40% of the thousands of clients using Moodle Partners are using Moodle for company training but adds, &ldquo;we see our mission as being servants to the community of teachers and learners who need Moodle and quality open source free software. &nbsp;Our core duty is to give away the software we develop.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Exploring Engaged Student Learning on an OU Module </strong></p>
<p><em>[HEA]</em></p>
<p>Richard Jones (an OU lecturer in English Literature) writes on the HEA site about his involvement in a project looking at <a href="https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/blog/understanding-click-exploring-engaged-student-learning-open-university-module">Engaged Student Learning</a>. &nbsp;It involved the coordination of several practitioner inquiries into the experience of students studying a first-year undergraduate module. &nbsp;The project ended with a conference in which participants were able to share their findings alongside statistical data gathered from students&rsquo; use of the module website.</p>

<p><em>[ConnectSafely]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.connectsafely.org/wp-content/uploads/eduguide.pdf">The Educator&rsquo;s Guide to Social Media</a> covers the sort of ground you might expect: digital literacy, available tools, pedagogy, working and sharing online, privacy, inappropriate content/comments, etc.&nbsp; It seems to be aimed more at the high school age group but there&rsquo;s some useful content and links, particularly if you&rsquo;re relatively new to this field.</p>
<p>And Hootsuite provides a very useful list of <a href="http://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-tools-for-social-media-managers/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=engage&utm_campaign=pro_act_2_7&mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvarKde/hmjTEU5z17+UuX6Wxh5Z41El3fuXBP2XqjvpVQcBqMLHORw8FHZNpywVWM8TIKNAXt9pkMQzmAGk=">10 essential tools for social media managers</a> to plan and track their social media presence and effects.</p>

<p><strong>Deceptive Publishing</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>

<p><strong>Top Tools for Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jane Hart]</em></p>
<p>Jane Hart is busy compiling her annual Top 100 Tools for Learning survey but, as a taster, she presents the thoughts of 15 Bloggers and their individual <a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/blog/2015/08/27/15-bloggers/">top 10 tools for learning</a>.&nbsp; There are some old favourites such as Twitter, Yammer and Wordpress but plenty of more niche choices such as PowToon, Mentimeter, Ominigraffe and Overcast.&nbsp; Notable is the fact that there is no overall leader &ndash; each person&rsquo;s preferences differ, reflecting both the diversity of tools available and the differing interests and needs of the users.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Education Dive; TechCrunch; Campus Technology; Stephen Downes; Peter Horrocks; EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>Kadenze is a new MOOC provider that has created <a href="http://www.educationdive.com/news/arts-education-goes-mooc/400913/">a digital platform designed for arts courses</a>.&nbsp; They have already teamed up with programs at 18 institutions, including Stanford and Princeton, and the aim is to embrace high production values and provide a &ldquo;multimedia rich&rdquo; service that allows students to create online portfolios, upload music files and scanned art, watch videos, and participate in discussion forums.&nbsp; There are 4 initial courses, with another 18 planned, on subjects including music, art history, and technology. &nbsp;Whilst enrolment and viewing will be free, students will be charged $7 to submit assignments and receive grades and feedback.&nbsp; Credit-bearing courses come more expensive at $300, $600, or $900.</p>
<p>OpenClassrooms has partnered with IESA Multim&eacute;dia to launch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/07/openclassrooms-launches-first-mooc-based-bachelor-degree-recognized-by-french-state/#.fcbm4v:dXgY">the first State-recognized bachelor degree in France that relies exclusively on MOOCs</a>.&nbsp; There are three learning paths &ndash;in engineering, design and digital marketing &ndash; and students will have to complete all the courses and required projects in order to get their degree, which will normally take a year.&nbsp; The degree is the same the conventional one offered by IESA, apart from the absence of a physical teacher and students, but the MOOCs include a weekly video-chat with a mentor to discuss problems and maintain motivation.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/penn-joins-edx-partnership-expands-free-online-classes">University of Pennsylvania</a> was a founding member and investor in Coursera but has now announced it is joining edX, mainly because of its open-source platform.&nbsp; Coursera MOOCs will continue but new titles launching on edX in a few months&rsquo; time will be branded as PennX.</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/06/25/open-edx-now-available-from-amazon-web-services-marketplace.aspx">Open edX</a> is now available from the Amazon Web Services Marketplace for &lsquo;free&rsquo; (AWS usage fees apply).&nbsp; The download will provide a basic version of the platform that allows educators to connect with existing Open edX MOOCs and create courses for their own online learning communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stephen Downes flags a EURODL paper, <a href="http://www.eurodl.org/?p=current&article=689">MOOCs as a Method of Distance Education in the Arab World</a>, which gives a good overview of MOOC technology being developed in the Arab world.&nbsp; He also provides helpful links to <a href="https://www.edraak.org/">Edraak</a> (Jordan), <a href="https://www.rwaq.org/">Rwaq</a> (Saudi Arabia) and <a href="http://www.menaversity.com/">MenaVersity</a> (Lebanon) and to a related EURODL paper on <a href="http://www.eurodl.org/?p=current&article=683">the experiences of Saudi Arabian women studying online in international master programmes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC Research</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; Campus Technology; Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>A survey of more than 4,500 MOOC students found that <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/students-in-free-courses-study-but-not-as-much-as-most-students-do/56935">more than 55% said they studied two to five hours per week</a>, with 22% spending 6-10 hours.&nbsp; This compares healthily with a recent survey of US first-year residential college students which found that about 43% spent more than six hours per week studying.&nbsp; The data show that students do not dedicate one particular time of the week to complete their MOOCs: &ldquo;People who are spending a fair amount of time on them are fitting it into their schedules in a very flexible way, not in a rigid way&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Kalyan Veeramachaneni, a researcher at MIT has developed <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/07/01/mit-researchers-develop-model-to-predict-mooc-dropouts.aspx?m=2">a model to predict when students may be about to drop out of a MOOC</a>, based on analysis of key variables such as amount of time spent per correct homework item and amount of time spent on learning resources such as video lectures.&nbsp; He cites the proportion of time that students spend on the course that falls on the weekend as being important because it is &ldquo;a proxy for how busy they are. &nbsp;And that put together with the other variables should tell you that the student has a strong motivation to do the work but is getting busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new survey by <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/07/06/survey-moocs-supplement-traditional-higher-ed.aspx?m=2">Duke University</a> of 9,000 students on 13 of their Coursera MOOCs focused particularly on those aged &lt;18 or &gt;65, or with no easy access to higher education.&nbsp; Researchers found that students in the younger group often took MOOCs in topics not taught in their schools or to explore different disciplines to help weigh academic and career choices; those in the over-65 group took MOOCs for lifelong learning, to keep their minds active and to mentor younger students in their own professional field.&nbsp; Those with limited access to HE chose MOOCs because they were available despite their financial or mobility limitations.</p>
<p>Researchers from Humboldt and MIT examined <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2015/07/08/mit-and-german-research-on-the-appalling-use-of-video-in-xmoocs/">the use of video in xMOOCs</a>, finding that in many MOOCs it is the primary medium for content, &ldquo;often separated by assessment questions&rdquo;.&nbsp; Two genres tended to be most used &ndash; the talking head or lecture, and screen capture with commentary &ndash; but the authors caution that it can be expensive and &ldquo;there is often not enough consideration given to whether or not video is the right medium to accomplish a MOOC&rsquo;s pedagogical goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjet.2015.46.issue-3/issuetoc">special issue of BJET</a> (Vol 46, 3) looks at MOOCs: &lsquo;disrupting&rsquo; teaching and learning practices in higher education.&nbsp; Fifteen papers consider aspects such as retention, media coverage, use of social media, assessment and learner characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian; THE; BBC; Mail Online; University World News]</em></p>
<p>George Osborne announced <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jul/08/maintenance-grants-scrapped-and-tuition-fees-to-increase-your-reaction-budget-2015">two major changes to UK HE in the budget</a>.&nbsp; Student maintenance grants will be replaced with loans from 2016-17, but with an increased maximum of &pound;8,200pa.&nbsp; Those HEIs that can demonstrate excellent teaching via the proposed Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) will be able to increase tuition fees in line with inflation from 2017-18.&nbsp; Both of these measures should make the OU a more attractive proposition.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.universitiesuk.ac.uk/2015/07/09/ou-head-are-more-students-from-poorer-backgrounds-going-to-university/">Peter Horrocks refutes George Osborne&rsquo;s budget claims</a> that a &ldquo;record number&rdquo; of students from low income backgrounds are going to university, and that the rise in tuition fees has not deterred people from applying &ndash; but Peter&rsquo;s evidence suggests that the Chancellor (or his civil servants) was being creative with the data.&nbsp; So 1-0 to the OU.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s just hope George&rsquo;s gang don&rsquo;t get us at playtime&hellip;</p>
<p>In a survey carried out last month by ComRes, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/mps-concerned-decline-part-time-study-survey-finds">73% of MPs say they are concerned by the decline in the number of students in part-time Higher Education</a>. &nbsp;Almost 200,000 fewer students were studying part-time in England last year compared to 2009/10 &ndash; a drop of 41%.&nbsp; Addressing a reception at the Houses of Parliament, Peter Horrocks called on policy-makers to address the decline: &ldquo;This Government has talked much about supporting those who work hard.&nbsp; Right now there is a golden opportunity for ministers to deliver on this by realising the kind of social and economic benefits part-time study creates.&nbsp; While it is encouraging to see MPs sharing our concern over the challenges facing our sector, now is the time to turn this into action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are similar funding concerns in the FE sector, with King&rsquo;s College&rsquo;s Prof Alison Wolf warning that Britain&rsquo;s supply of skilled workers may &ldquo;vanish into history&rdquo; if forthcoming FE budget cuts and relaxation of university student numbers caps are allowed to continue.&nbsp; Her new report, <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/publications/Issuesandideas-alison-wolf-digital.pdf">Heading for the precipice: Can further and higher education funding policies be sustained?</a> Concludes, &ldquo;In post-19 education, we are producing vanishingly small numbers of higher technician-level qualifications, while massively increasing the output of generalist bachelors degrees and low-level vocational qualifications&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33166429">(OIA) ruled on 2,175 complaints</a>, ruling in favour of 500 students and with 200 of these awarded payouts amounting to &pound;400,000.&nbsp; Disputes over academic issues such as degree classification or marks for work formed 61% of complaints.&nbsp; The OIA found that 59% of complaints were unjustified, 14% ineligible for OIA intervention, while 5% were withdrawn.</p>
<p>The UK is one of the top destinations for international students, attracting around 12.6% of the global market, but numbers from some sources such as India have been dropping and almost 24% of complaints received by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator last year were from international students.&nbsp; The Guardian warns that (shock) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jul/03/universities-dont-understand-how-international-students-learn">not all international students are the same</a>, not all stereotypical views (e.g. Asian students aren&rsquo;t critical thinkers) are accurate, and simply mixing them with English students to help them adjust doesn&rsquo;t work very well.</p>
<p>The Mail reveals that around half of UK universities (including 12 Russell Group) <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3137842/British-universities-allow-foreign-students-use-dictionaries-exams.html#ixzz3ej1iq7Xr">let foreign students use dictionaries in exams</a> in order to allow &ldquo;a level playing field&rdquo; for students from outside Britain.</p>
<p>A PA Consulting Group survey of 160 HE leaders has concluded that <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20150619112717179">UK universities are falling behind in educational innovation</a> and &ldquo;risk losing their world-leading reputation&rdquo;, whereas global competitors were &ldquo;innovating in response to student demands for more flexible and cheaper study options, new technologies that challenge traditional teaching methods and competition from new providers&rdquo;.&nbsp; Some 70% of VCs expect provision in the 2030s &ldquo;to remain focused around three-year campus-based study&rdquo; and nearly half thought it unlikely there would be a &ldquo;substantial shift towards alternative models of work-based study or towards online learning through alternative providers&rdquo;.</p>

<p><em>[BBC; The Chronicle; THE Journal; TNW; Audrey Watters; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Eton College has created an online learning company called <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33190029">EtonX</a> whose initial offering will be leadership classes for Chinese students, based on a mix of (English) interactive content produced at Eton, with one-to-one online teaching from tutors in the UK.&nbsp; The lessons are aimed at China's aspirational middle-class families and will cost about &pound;700 per pupil.</p>
<p>Apollo Education has had yet another poor quarter (to 31 May), with net revenue dropping by $113m and <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/U-of-Phoenix-Looks-to-Shrink/231247/">University of Phoenix student enrolments down</a> from nearly 241,900 a year ago to 206,900.&nbsp; Apollo laid off an additional 600 people last month, mostly enrolment counsellors but, in the finest spirit of you&rsquo;ve-got-to-speculate-to-accumulate, the company has bought a controlling interest in the Iron Yard, a &lsquo;coding boot camp&rsquo; that offers non-degree training.</p>
<p>Amplify, Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s education company, will stop selling the ruggedized tablet computers that were once a central part of the company&rsquo;s plan to shake up education.&nbsp; Despite an almost <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/news-corps-education-company-will-stop-making-tablets#.ihb3yV08K">$1bn investment by News Corp</a>, Amplify has struggled to gain a foothold in the education marketplace.</p>

<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/07/06/moodle-launches-free-cloud-hosting-for-educators.aspx?m=2">MoodleCloud</a> allows anyone to deploy Moodle with no installation or hosting charges.

<p><strong>Crossing the Pond</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>Interesting <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/06/19/essay-possibility-american-undergraduates-enrolling-britain">US perspective on studying for a degree in the UK</a>.&nbsp; Whilst we agonise over here about high fees, contact hours, teaching quality, etc, the view from across the pond is much more positive: &ldquo;Annual tuition for British undergraduate degrees averages well below the expense of well-considered private colleges in the US and about the same as that of an out-of-state public flagship university. &nbsp;By only taking three years to complete, however, British degrees stand in striking contrast to American four-year degrees that confront students and their families in the United States with severe, lingering financial challenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>What Is Teaching without Learning?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Faculty Focus]</em></p>
<p>Maryellen Weimer cites Prof Keith Parsons who tells his first-year students, &ldquo;At university, learning is your job &ndash; and yours alone.&nbsp; My job is to lead you to the fountain of knowledge.&nbsp; Whether you drink deeply or only gargle is entirely up to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; She acknowledges that <a href="http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/teaching-professor-blog/what-is-teaching-without-learning/">learners don&rsquo;t need teachers in the same way teachers need learners</a>, but believes good teachers can and should offer more than Parsons claims, notably in areas such as guidance, feedback and motivation.</p>

<p><strong>Professor Says Facebook Can Help Informal Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>Research shows that informal conversations with friends can facilitate learning, but very little has been studied about their online equivalents such as Facebook. &nbsp;Now researchers from Michigan State University have <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/professor-says-facebook-can-help-informal-learning/57059">studied students using a Facebook application about climate change</a> called Hot Dish which allows them to post articles and add comments.&nbsp; Of the 346 people in the group, only about 30 started their own comment threads or participated regularly, suggesting that those who benefited from the discussion were already very interested in the topic.&nbsp; Prof Christine Greenhow commented, &ldquo;We did see argumentation, we did see that debate was on-topic and on-task &hellip; It wasn&rsquo;t purely social, it wasn&rsquo;t off-topic.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Clear Objectives and Usability Key to Successful Online Courses</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Eduventures surveyed 28,000 students, mostly over age 25, who were pursuing an online degree or certificate.&nbsp; The majority (22,437) regarded themselves as &ldquo;high performing&rdquo; and said <a href="http://www.eduventures.com/2015/06/why-online-students-succeed/">the basis for their success</a> was down to nine factors, the top three being clearly stated objectives/expectations (70%), easy-to-use technology (64%) and well-paced courses (54%). &nbsp;These factors far outweighed others like faculty/peer interaction and tutoring services.&nbsp; Amongst poorly performing students, by far the most significant factor was family/personal obligations (65%), followed by pacing (20%) and lack of interest (18%).</p>

<p><strong>How Microsoft Will Release Windows 10</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Current users of Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 will be entitled to a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/02/heres-how-microsoft-will-release-windows-10/?ncid=tcdaily#.fcbm4v:rgFK">free upgrade to Windows 10</a> for its first year of release.&nbsp; Microsoft has now announced how this will be rolled out to the public. &nbsp;First in line on 29 Jul will be the 5 million or so &lsquo;Microsoft insiders&rsquo; who are currently signed up and testing the pre-release code.&nbsp; Next &ndash; in batches over the first few days of August &ndash; will be those who have clicked the icon that appeared on their task bar last month to &lsquo;reserve&rsquo; an upgrade.&nbsp; Thereafter, it will become available on demand to people like me who want to wait awhile just to see if any headlines of doom appear.</p>

<p><strong>Teacher Guides for Technology And Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Global Digital Citizen Foundation]</em></p>
<p>The Global Digital Citizen Foundation has pulled together a number of <a href="http://globaldigitalcitizen.org/the-teacher-guides-to-technology-and-learning?redirect_mongo_id=559571d869702d65cd549b07&redirect_log_mongo_id=5595b087336430000f110100">Edudemic teachers&rsquo; guides to technology</a>.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re a seasoned pro I wouldn&rsquo;t waste your time looking but, if you&rsquo;ve never really paid too much attention to Twitter, Pinterest, Badges and a few other technologies, they might offer just the introduction you need.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Experience Design</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Agonising over labels can be fraught with inconsequentiality, but the HE sector has never been completely happy with the (elsewhere) ubiquitous title of &lsquo;instructional designer&rsquo;, I presume because of its training connotations.&nbsp; So here&rsquo;s a suggestion from Connie Malamed that we move to a new name: <a href="https://christytucker.wordpress.com/2015/06/30/learning-experience-design-a-better-title-than-instructional-design/">Learning Experience (LX) Designer</a> because, &ldquo;Calling ourselves Learning Experience Designers acknowledges that we design, enable or facilitate experiences rather than courses.&nbsp; This gives us a broad license to empower people with the tools and information they need to do their jobs, regardless of the chosen format.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>BBC micro:bit</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>The BBC has revealed the final design of its <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/microbit">micro:bit</a> pocket-sized computer that it plans to give to around one million UK-based Year 7 (11/12-year-old) children in October.&nbsp; The 5cm x 4cm card has an ARM chip, an accelerometer, magnetometer, Bluetooth and USB.&nbsp; A web-based programming environment supports JavaScript, Python, C++ and Blocks (a visual programming language).&nbsp; BBC DG Tony Hall believes the devices will channel, &ldquo;the spirit of the Micro for the digital age&rdquo;.&nbsp; I hope so, but of course the old BBC Micros of the 80s weren&rsquo;t competing with smartphones, tablets, the internet, social media, Netflix and 300 TV channels &ndash; so it&rsquo;s a tough ask.</p>

<p><strong>Tablet Sales Have Plateaued But There&rsquo;s A Future In Business</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Tablet sales boomed from 2010 to 2013 but replacement rates are not the same as for smartphones.&nbsp; Most of the software and apps are &lsquo;evergreen&rsquo; and latest models are thin on innovative &ldquo;must-have&rdquo; new features, so <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/12/forrester-tablet-sales-have-plateaued-but-theres-a-future-in-business/#.fcbm4v:a4H3">tablet sales have plateaued</a>.&nbsp; The rise in phablets also has affected tablet sales figures, with around 41% of global information workers saying their primary smartphone is 5 inches or larger; for example, Samsung sold 4.5 million Galaxy Note 4s in the first month after release.&nbsp; However, there may be a brighter future in the business marketplace, with more than half of employees use a tablet for work purposes at least once a week, and 29% of employers providing tablets to use for work.</p>

<p><strong>US Web Use and Technology Skills</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Pew Research finds that <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/06/26/americans-internet-access-2000-2015/">84% of American adults now use the internet</a> (the same figure as for 2014 and 2013).&nbsp; Those aged 18-29 top the board (96%) but the 65+ sector (58%) is catching up.&nbsp; Other stats are fairly predictable &ndash; you&rsquo;re more likely to use the web if you are white, speak English, earn more or are better educated.</p>
<p>However, according to their employers, those 96% aren&rsquo;t as tech-savvy as they may think they are.&nbsp; Separate research by the American Institutes for Research (AIR) found that US &lsquo;<a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/06/11/report-6-of-10-millennials-have-low-technology-skills.aspx">digital natives</a>&rsquo; may spend an average of 35 hrs every week on digital media, but nearly six out of 10 can't do basic tasks such as sorting, searching for and emailing data from a spreadsheet.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; Stephen Downes; EdSurge; eCampus News; World Bank; Forbes]</em></p>
<p>Google announced at last month&rsquo;s I/O conference that it will be designing curriculum for Nanodegree courses offered by Udacity, the first being a program in Android development.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-05-31-google-teams-with-udacity-to-offer-nanodegrees?utm_campaign=4d006060ef-Innovate+225-HIREEDU&utm_medium=email&utm_source=EdsurgeLive&utm_term=0_0f1ec25b60-4d006060ef-292151429">Android Nanodegree</a> will comprise six courses and is expected to take nine to 12 months to complete.&nbsp; It costs $200 per month, and top 50 students will be invited for a three-day career summit at Google's headquarters.</p>
<p>Matt Crosslin considers whether <a href="http://www.edugeekjournal.com/2015/05/25/what-if-the-problem-isnt-with-moocs-but-something-else/">MOOC retention problems relate to student motivation</a>.&nbsp; He notes that much of education relies on motivation that is predominantly extrinsic in nature (grades, credits, fees, gold stars, etc) whereas MOOCs tend to rely much more on intrinsic motivation.&nbsp; In other words, &ldquo;What if MOOCs are just a mirror that shows us the sociocultural problems we don&rsquo;t want to deal with in our system?&nbsp; What if the problem is not with the learners, but the way they have been programmed through the years?&nbsp; You can say MOOCs are failing because they lack sufficient &lsquo;student motivation&rsquo;, but what if it was actually the case that society has been failing for decades and MOOCs are just exposing this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Canadian researchers are digging beyond the headlines and analytics to discover much more about <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher-ed-beta/invisible-learners-taking-moocs">MOOC learners and learning experiences</a>.&nbsp; Through a series of interviews (70 so far), three initial findings have emerged that contradict the initial hope that MOOCs can help anyone, anywhere, anytime learners.&nbsp; Firstly, MOOC learners possess sophisticated study skills (e.g. note taking, investigating new or unfamiliar subject matter).&nbsp; A significant proportion also either live flexible lives that enable them to participate, or appear to be exceptional in their abilities to create time to study.&nbsp; Finally, many say that learning experiences are deeply emotional, with the potential to offer not just pleasure and appreciation but occasional anxiety and embarrassment as well.&nbsp; They believe these findings call into question, &ldquo;whether open courses, in their current form, are the democratizing forces they are sometimes depicted to be &ndash; and even whether &lsquo;educating a billion&rsquo; with MOOCs is a laudable goal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>EdCast has announced a new social media platform that allows people to post mini-MOOCs, or video snippets of educational content plus short text comments. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.ecampusnews.com/technologies/edcasting-edcast-mooc-989/">EdCasting</a> is a less formal version of online courses, and is akin to tweeting, &ldquo;with the difference being that each post is based on a video or link that can be described without being limited to 140 characters&rdquo;; however, there is no &lsquo;re-tweeting&rsquo;, meaning that content will not get diluted.&nbsp; The launch platform includes 10 channels ranging from entrepreneurship, architecture, robotics, technology, and health, filled with insights from over 100 &ldquo;globally renowned experts and influencers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With a population of 1.4bn, it&rsquo;s not surprising that the <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/education/moocs-china-are-growing">Chinese online education market</a> increased by 700% between 2013 and 2014 (compared to 9% in the US).&nbsp; Part of this growth includes MOOCs, and one of the Chinese government&rsquo;s goals is to train 13 million K-12 teachers on education technology skills in the next five years through MOOCs.</p>
<p>A new survey, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2015/06/10/moocs-emerge-as-disruptors-to-corporate-learning/">Leveraging MOOCs and Open Learning Assets in The Workplace</a>, sought the opinions of 222 heads of HR, Corporate Learning and Talent Management on the benefits and barriers, and the long term impact of MOOCs on corporate learning.&nbsp; Key findings are that MOOCs are seen as innovative and attractive (to staff and externals) but many companies want to go further and curate a wider range of open learning assets.&nbsp; Barriers to developing MOOCs include budget, technical and security issues, a lack of MOOC design skills among corporate learning professionals, and resistance amongst in-house L&amp;D professionals.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of Udemy&rsquo;s seven million students come from outside the US but the company has just raised $65 million in new funding to further expand its global presence.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-06-02-udemy-raises-65m-in-quest-to-grow-online-learning-marketplace-across-the-world">Udemy</a> currently offers 30,000 courses and those taught by its top 10 instructors generated $17 million in revenues, with between 25-97% of course fees distributed back to instructors.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coursetalk.com/">CourseTalk</a> site lets users find, rate and comment on MOOCs, and more than 74,000 user ratings for over 7,500 courses from 46 providers have now been analysed in <a href="https://d3q6qq2zt8nhwv.cloudfront.net/s/coursetalk/pdf/newco/What Reviews Divulge About Online Education.891195873352.pdf">What Reviews Divulge About Online Education</a>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not big on detail but the findings on pp3-9 give a succinct overview of what users are saying.&nbsp; To summarise: low rated courses (1-3 stars) are confusing, boring, outdated (or wrong) and predominantly free; whereas those scoring 4-5 stars are easy to navigate and digest, fun and interactive, flexible and charge a moderate cost.&nbsp; On average, paid courses were rated 1.4 stars higher than free courses.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33047927">Mobile Phones in the Classroom: Examining the Effects of Texting, Twitter, and Message Content on Student Learning</a> reports on a series of tests conducted with 145 undergraduates to investigate how well they coped with multiple tasks such as watching a lecture on a video and then taking notes and answering questions, while facing a series of interruptions on their internet-connected mobile phones.&nbsp; Perhaps not surprisingly, the researchers found that those sending and receiving messages while studying scored lower test results and were less effective at tasks such as note taking.&nbsp; They described an effect where students are, &ldquo;physically present, yet mentally preoccupied by non-course-related material on their mobile devices.&rdquo;&nbsp; Last month, an LSE study found that schools in four English cities which <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/may/16/schools-mobile-phones-academic-results">banned phones saw test scores increased</a> by more than 6%.</p>
<p>But research from Miami University suggests <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11660908/Tweeting-could-help-children-focus-in-class-study-says.html">using phones in class could actually be beneficial</a>, provided students stay on topic.&nbsp; Students used mobile devices to respond to messages that were relevant to classroom material, revealing a direct relationship between note taking and engaging in social media discussions: &ldquo;Even if students are responding to messages from others, if that activity is related to class content, those students will take better-quality notes than students responding to unrelated content.&rdquo;&nbsp; Researchers believe this is because, &ldquo;the related content allows students to engage in behaviours similar to note-taking: focusing on the material at hand, processing that material to determine key parts, and recording the important information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Current <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jun/09/call-to-unlock-a-treasure-chest-of-hidden-research-data">copyright legislation limits the amount of data that researchers can &ldquo;mine&rdquo;</a> &ndash; using a computer to scan for facts and data within thousands of relevant articles to discover connections &shy;&shy;&ndash; because the process requires the mining program to download and copy content first before scanning it.&nbsp; Not surprisingly publishers are resisting any changes to laws in case content is used under the pretence of text mining but then re-published and charged for elsewhere.&nbsp; However, the EU is consulting this summer with a view to updating its 2001 copyright laws to better suit the digital age, thus giving researchers greater access to published work.</p>
<p>But every day, millions of Europeans may be unwittingly breaking copyright law. &nbsp;Due to an obscure rule known as <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org.uk/2015/06/uk-at-risk-of-losing-freedom-of-panorama/">Freedom of Panorama</a>, those innocent snapshots of modern buildings you&rsquo;ve taken in countries such as France and Belgium are breaches of copyright. &nbsp;While the UK does have this freedom, we may be at risk of losing it in the ongoing copyright reform negotiations taking place in the European Parliament.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; BBC; EdSurge; Audrey Watters;</em> <em>Stephen Downes; The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>THE asked 27 FutureLearn universities about <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/moocs-fluctuating-rates-in-online-investment/2019816.article">the cost per course of their FL MOOCs</a>.&nbsp; Based on information on 20 courses from nine institutions the average cost, including staffing, was &pound;29,356 &ndash; broadly in keeping with the &ldquo;around &pound;30,000&rdquo; predicted by Martin Bean two years ago.&nbsp; However, while Loughborough says that it has produced two courses for about &pound;10,000 each, Dundee has allocated &pound;130,000 to a programme that has so far produced one course.&nbsp; Edinburgh said that its three FL MOOCs cost &pound;150,000 &ndash; similar to its costs for the Coursera platform.&nbsp; The OU was one of seven institutions that declined to provide details.</p>
<p>FutureLearn says it has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-32721056">370,000 students enrolled for a British Council MOOC</a> preparing for an English language test.&nbsp; The six-week course, Understanding IELTS: Techniques for English Language Tests, has students from 153 countries, with the biggest number from the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.&nbsp; It prepares students for the IELTS exam, taken 2.2 million times last year, which is used by employers and professional bodies to measure English language skills.&nbsp; The course is free, but students can pay &pound;29 for a &ldquo;statement of participation&rdquo;, showing that they have followed the course.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t beat thinking big.&nbsp; edX made its MOOC code open source in 2013 and so far over 70 organisations have taken up <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-04-16-how-open-edx-plans-to-reach-1-billion-learners">Open edX</a> across the K-12, HE, professional development and corporate training sectors.&nbsp; This EdSurge piece gives some brief examples, along with news that edX hopes the initiative will reach one billion learners within 10 years.&nbsp; The Open edX feature roadmap includes delivering content in smaller chunks, more effective use of mobile apps, and promoting greater student contribution and engagement.</p>
<p>edX has partnered with Arizona State University to offer the <a href="https://www.edx.org/gfa">Global Freshman Academy</a> which allows first year students to take a series of MOOCs, pay only when they pass each one, and earn credits equivalent to one year of general education.&nbsp; Sounds good?&nbsp; Not according to Stephen Downes (and many, many others): &ldquo;Remember, courses are typically 3- or 6-credits. So you could end up paying $600 or $1200 for a course. That's not 'open' the way I define 'open'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard Patterson investigated <a href="http://www.human.cornell.edu/pam/academics/phd/upload/PattersonJMP11_18.pdf">the effects of study distractions on 657 Stanford MOOC students</a>.&nbsp; He tested three software tools including (1) a commitment device that allowed students to set time limits on distracting Internet activities, (2) a reminder tool triggered by time spent on distracting websites, and (3) a focusing tool that allowed students to block distracting sites when they go to the course website. &nbsp;Relative to a control group, he found students using the commitment device (1) spent 24% more time working on the course, receive course grades that were 0.29 SD higher, and were 40% more likely to complete the course. &nbsp;However, tools (2) and (3) yielded no significant difference to online student performance.</p>
<p>The University of Illinois has launched a low-cost online &ldquo;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/U-of-Illinois-to-Offer-a/229921">iMBA</a>&rdquo; in partnership with Coursera.&nbsp; Anyone would be able to view the course materials at no charge, but those who wanted the degree would have to go through the university&rsquo;s admissions process and pay about $1,000 per course.&nbsp; Enrolees would get greater support from faculty members, access to online discussions with other enrolled students, and could complete the entire degree for about $20,000 &ndash; far less than the $50k for the on-campus version or the $100k for the university&rsquo;s executive MBA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lecture videos are a central feature in the student learning experience in nearly all MOOCs,&rdquo; advises the MITx Office of Digital Learning, but Lorena Barba <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-05-11-why-my-mooc-is-not-built-on-video">included only one video in her Numerical Methods MOOC</a>.&nbsp; Admittedly this was partly due to financial constraints, but also because she is not convinced there is strong enough evidence to support its effectiveness as a teaching medium, despite its popularity (well, for at least <a href="https://www.edx.org/blog/optimal-video-length-student-engagement">the first 6 mins</a>) with students.&nbsp; She cites Derek Muller&rsquo;s investigation into the <a href="http://youtu.be/eVtCO84MDj8">effectiveness (or not) of physics videos</a>, which suggests many students do not pay full attention because they believe they already understand the topic, hence they don&rsquo;t absorb the very explanation that would have reversed any misconceptions that have.</p>
<p>And, in the finest spirit of openness, the University of Nottingham has trademarked &ldquo;<a href="http://uk.trademarkdirect.co.uk/nooc-nottingham-open-online-course-3020920">NOOC</a>&rdquo; (Nottingham Open Online Course).</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; The Independent; THE; BBC]</em></p>
<p>UWN considers the <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20150509141811197">implications of the election result</a>, with the prospect of withdrawal from the EU potentially impacting on research funding (est at &pound;1.2bn per year) and international student numbers.&nbsp; For example, the Erasmus programme &ndash; involving more than 4,000 HEIs in 33 countries &ndash; has funded the mobility of nearly 3m students and 300,000 academics in the past 25 years.&nbsp; The EU&rsquo;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme will also provide nearly &euro;80bn of funding for research during the period 2014-20.&nbsp; THE&rsquo;s John Morgan also gives his version of likely events, as <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=2020205">the sector stands by for battles over cuts, fees and Europe</a>.</p>
<p>In the new Cameron government, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/teachers-speak-out-over-nicky-morgans-reappointment-as-education-secretary-10239170.html">Nicky Morgan</a> remains as Education Secretary (to the regret of many teachers due to her lack of teaching experience) while <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-32690643">Sajid Javid</a> has been appointed business secretary, which includes responsibility for universities and their funding, with <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/jo-johnson-is-new-minister-covering-higher-education/2020168.article">Jo Johnson</a> (brother of Boris) as the new universities and science minister.&nbsp; Tristram Hunt remains as Shadow Education Secretary.</p>
<p>One of the first jobs for the new government is to decide whether to support the OECD&rsquo;s Ahelo (<a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/oecds-ahelo-project-could-transform-university-hierarchy/2020087.article">Assessment of Higher Education Learning Outcomes</a>) project, which aims to measure learning outcomes at a global level in a move to measure and report university teaching quality worldwide.&nbsp; Former universities minister David Willetts believes it is, &ldquo;absolutely the correct agenda and it&rsquo;s really important for students that they know how universities are doing on the teaching side.&nbsp; And indeed it&rsquo;s also reflected in the Conservative manifesto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two thirds of UCU members at <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-32693798">London Metropolitan University</a> have voted to strike in protest over 165 job cuts.</p>

<p>US-based <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Abrupt-Closing-of-Corinthian/229717">Corinthian Colleges Inc</a> has closed 28 campuses belonging to four of its subsidiary colleges.&nbsp; The company had been under intense scrutiny by the US Dept of Education, which imposed a $29.6m fine last month for alleged misrepresentation of job-placement rates.&nbsp; The closure affects 16,000 current students.</p>

<p><strong>Preparing For The Digital University</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://linkresearchlab.org/PreparingDigitalUniversity.pdf">Preparing for the digital university: a review of the history and current state of distance, blended, and online learning</a> is a grand study (234pp) of the distance/digital HE landscape.&nbsp; Led by George Siemens and backed by the Gates Foundation, its six chapters look at the history of distance learning, blended learning, online learning, and assessment, followed by a look forward at future research in MOOCs and technology infrastructure.&nbsp; It represents a detailed literature review but Stephen Downes considers it &ldquo;a really bad study&rdquo; because he considers its scope to be too narrow, too theoretical and it ignores contributions from many significant experts and contributors in the field.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2015/05/03/linearity_downes/">George disagrees</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Media Usage by Traditional vs Non-Traditional Students</strong></p>
<p><em>[IRRODL]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/issue/view/68">latest issue of IRRODL (Vol 16, No 2)</a> contains a number of articles relevant to OU teaching and learning, but a paper comparing <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/download/1979/3316">media usage by traditional vs non-traditional students</a> was particularly apposite, given that the (German) authors define NTS as (i) enrolling into HE through unconventional means, (ii) not fulfilling typical HE entrance requirements, and (iii) studying part-time and distance learning.&nbsp; The authors found:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High penetration of digital/online devices, especially mobile for both student types</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much greater acceptance of a wider range of media, tools and services by NTS (Tables 2 &amp; 4)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NTS have a greater need for flexible study due to their work and family responsibilities and so have higher expectations of the range of digital/virtual teaching-learning methods used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The university&rsquo;s internal media offerings (e.g. VLE) are used more intensively than external media, tools, and services</p>

<p><strong>Certifying Skills and Knowledge</strong></p>
<p><em>[Belinda Tynan]</em></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.knowledgeworks.org/sites/default/files/certifying-skills-knowledge-future-credentials.pdf">Certifying Skills and Knowledge: Four Scenarios on the Future of Credentials</a>, Jason Swanson speculates on what credentials/assessment might look like in ten years by considering four scenarios: &ldquo;All Roads Lead to Rome&rdquo; (a baseline future), &ldquo;The Dam Breaks&rdquo; (an alternative future), &ldquo;Every Experience a Credential&rdquo; (a second alternative future) and &ldquo;My Mind Mapped&rdquo; (a wild card scenario) &ndash; each of which he considers from a K-12, post-secondary and employment perspective.</p>

<p>The Economist Intelligence Unit asked employers about the <a href="http://googleforeducation.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/the-skills-agenda-preparing-students.html">most critical skills for employees</a> in their organisation to possess today.&nbsp; The top six came out as problem solving (a clear leader by 18 percentage points), team working, and communication (a trifecta commonly known as &ldquo;21st century skills&rdquo;), followed by critical thinking, creativity and literacy.</p>

<p>The University of California&rsquo;s all-digital &ldquo;campus&rdquo; was going to revolutionise HE by providing courses online for students shut out of the system&rsquo;s brick-and-mortar classrooms at a time of high demand but falling budgets.&nbsp; But three years later, the Online Instruction Pilot Project has become <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/californias-multi-million-dollar-online-education-flop-is-another-blow-for-moocs/">a $7 million example of the ineffectiveness of using MOOCs</a> and other forms of online learning to widen access to college degrees.&nbsp; Costs would be partially offset by allowing non-UC students to enrol (for $1k&ndash;$2k per course) but, in the two years from Spring 2012-14, only 250 non-UC students finished a class.&nbsp; &ldquo;We spent a lot of money and got extremely little in return,&rdquo; said Prof Jose Wudka, who previously chaired UC&rsquo;s Committee on Educational Policy of the Academic Senate.</p>
<p>But over at Stanford, everything&rsquo;s looking rosy.&nbsp; In a presentation entitled <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/05/04/stanford-prez-sees-distinct-role-for-online-ed-in-future.aspx">Technology in Teaching and Learning</a>, President John Hennessy said he expects technology to facilitate virtual team meetings to enable delivery of smaller group and project-based classes online; he foresees a day when online grading will be good enough to assess short-answer questions and, eventually, complex problems; and he predicts that online analytics will deliver real-time learning measurement with the reuse of materials leading to more engaging and compelling online learning.&nbsp; He believes MOOCs may be useful in certain circumstances but will not replace structured education: &ldquo;We've learned that MOOCs are not the answer, at least not the only answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arizona State University sees other benefits of <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/04/14/online-degrees-show-net-positive-campus-impact.aspx">high-quality online college degree programs</a>, particularly for older students who don&rsquo;t want the full on-campus experience (or costs).&nbsp; ASU&rsquo;s online program currently has more than 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled, according to a university spokeswoman, and the most recent retention rates are 87% for undergraduate students and 92% for graduate students &ndash; although the University believes that up to three-quarters of current undergraduate courses could be delivered online, saving costs and reducing their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>So if all this technology&rsquo;s so good, why do <a href="https://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2015/04/26/lessons-learned-from-a-chalkboard-slow-and-steady-technology-integration-bradley-emerling/">75% of Japanese classrooms still use chalkboards</a>?</p>
<p>Pearson&rsquo;s Bradley Emerling, visited seventeen K-12 classrooms, all of which were equipped with a large chalkboard, with few computers, projectors, smartboards or tablets in evidence.&nbsp; He writes, &ldquo;It turns out Japanese educators possess a unique technical vocabulary for describing chalkboard teaching practices, called <em>bansho</em> (board-writing) and <em>bansho-keikaku</em> (board-writing planning). &nbsp;Like many instructional practices in Japan, bansho has been studied and refined over a period of years through use of Japanese lesson study (<em>jugyō kenkyū</em>).&rdquo;&nbsp; He wonders, given the plethora of expensive devices and applications we use in the west, why educators don&rsquo;t treat these, &ldquo;as critical topics for collaborative inquiry, develop plans for using them in the classroom, articulate hypotheses for how they will create specific learning opportunities, implement, observe and collect data on the results&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>The Next Generation Digital Learning Environment</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>EDUCAUSE&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2015/05/11/educause-looks-beyond-the-current-lms-environment/">The Next Generation Digital Learning Environment: A Report on Research</a> explores the gaps between current learning management tools (LMS, VLE, etc) and a digital learning environment that could meet the changing needs of higher education, and is the result of &ldquo;consultations with more than 70 community thought leaders&rdquo;. &nbsp;The suggestions is that the NGDLE might be some sort of Lego-style ecosystem that addresses five functional domains: interoperability and integration; personalization; analytics, advising, and learning assessment; collaboration; and accessibility and universal design.</p>

<p><strong>Education for All Global Monitoring Report</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>In 2000, at the World Education Forum in Senegal, 164 governments agreed on the Dakar Framework for Action which aimed to reach six wide-ranging education goals by 2015.&nbsp; UNESCO&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.unesco.org/gem-report/">Education for All Global Monitoring Report</a> is an extensive (460pp) review of how they&rsquo;ve done.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the positive side, the number of children and adolescents who were out of school has fallen by almost half since 2000.&nbsp; An estimated 34 million more children will have attended school as a result of faster progress since Dakar [but] There are still 58 million children out of school globally and around 100 million children who do not complete primary education.&rdquo;&nbsp; The key reason?&nbsp; &ldquo;Many governments have increased spending, but few have prioritized education in national budgets, and most fall short of allocating the recommended 20% needed to bridge funding gaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Virtues of Online Moderation</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>When Stephen Downes describes <a href="http://james.grimmelmann.net/files/articles/virtues-of-moderation.pdf">Prof James Grimmelmann&rsquo;s article on online moderation</a> as &ldquo;careful, deep, sophisticated&rdquo; and &ldquo;a must-read&rdquo;, you just have to take a look.&nbsp; On a Friday in 2005, the LA Times launched an experimental &ldquo;wikitorial&rdquo; on the Iraq War that anyone could edit.&nbsp; By the Sunday, the experiment had failed, as vandals overran it with profanities and graphic pornography.&nbsp; So why did this fail while Wikipedia is into its thirteenth year?&nbsp; The answer is &lsquo;moderation&rsquo; and Grimmelmann provides four techniques (exclusion, pricing, organizing, and norm-setting), four case studies (including the LA Times and wikipedia) and four overall conclusions: moderation is complex, diverse, necessary and messy.</p>

<p><em>[Campus Technology; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/05/06/report-tablet-sales-fall-for-second-straight-quarter.aspx">Global tablet shipments</a> have seen a year over year drop for the second straight quarter, down by 5.9% according to analysis from IDC.&nbsp; Apple remains dominant with a 26.8% market share and 12.6m shipments for the quarter.&nbsp; This is the fifth consecutive quarter the company has seen a decline in tablet sales, possibly due to the success of iPhone 6.&nbsp; IDC, &ldquo;expects Apple to record negative growth until the iPad portfolio is significantly refreshed, either with the expected increase in screen sizes or by introducing a dedicated version of iOS for its tablet lineup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gartner reports that <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/04/15/pc-market-continues-decline-despite-growth-in-mobile-pc-segment.aspx">global PC shipments continued to decline</a> in the first quarter of 2015, totalling 71 million units (a 5.2% year-on-year drop).&nbsp; Lenovo led the market with about 13.6 million shipments (18.9%), followed by HP (17.3%) and Dell (12.6%).</p>
<p>The China smartphone bubble may be bursting.&nbsp; IDC reports that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/10/apple-top-but-chinese-smartphone-market-shrinks">smartphone shipments in China</a> in the last quarter decreased for the first time in nine years (to <em>just</em> 99 million), down 4% year-on-year and 8% on the previous quarter.&nbsp; However, Apple led the field, with 14.7% of the total shipments, ahead of Xiaomi (13.7%), Huawei (11.4%) and Samsung (9.7%).</p>
<p>But if your budget can&rsquo;t quite run to a shiny big-brand device, how about the CHIP?&nbsp; This is a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598272670/chip-the-worlds-first-9-computer">$9 single-board Linux computer</a> with a 1GHz processor, 512 RAM, 4GB of storage, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.&nbsp; It also comes with a VGA adapter for an extra $10 or HDMI for $15.</p>

<p>Turnitin&rsquo;s new <a href="http://turnitin.com/en_us/about-us/press/turnitin-announces-availability-of-turnitin-scoring-engine-for-automated-writing-assessment">Scoring Engine</a> claims to provide automated scoring of short answer texts and written essays by analysing, &ldquo;the lexical, syntactic, and stylistic features of writing, such as word choice and genre conventions&rdquo;.&nbsp; How effective it is remains to be seen, but this sort of technology, once perfected, will have a big impact on how higher education and distance learning is run and resourced.</p>

<p><strong>Student Take More Intellectual Risks on Blog Assignments</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>PhD student Drew Foster analysed over 2,000 private <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/blogs-arent-better-than-journal-assignments-theyre-just-different/56359">reflective journal entries and reflective blog posts</a>, finding that both practices produce distinct forms of reflection and lead students to take different risks in their writing. &nbsp;Journals, which do not incorporate peer readership, appear to compel students to take more personal risks and engage in emotional labour to process assigned materials. &nbsp;Whereas on blogs, which do incorporate peer readership, students engage in more intellectual risks, crafting complex arguments on what are often &ndash; especially in sociology courses &ndash; controversial issues,</p>

<p><strong>Making more Effective Lecture Notes</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS]</em></p>
<p>It is widely acknowledged that <a href="http://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/05/most-students-struggle-to-take.html">taking notes can help understanding and recall</a>, but can we make that process even more efficient?&nbsp; Bui and McDaniel (2015) asked 144 undergrads to take notes while they listened to a 12-minute technical lecture.&nbsp; One group used note paper containing a lecture outline, with headings and subheadings of the material. The second group were provided with illustrative diagrams showing the key components of a system, with labels explaining how the different parts interact.&nbsp; A control group were simply given a blank piece of note paper.&nbsp; Students who received a lecture outline performed better at free recall than the control participants and took more comprehensive notes but, when asked specific questions, the lecture outlines only appeared to help high-ability students.&nbsp; In contrast, both high and low-ability students who received annotated diagrams performed better at free recall and at answering specific questions than the controls.&nbsp; Further analysis showed that the students given an annotated diagram not only took fewer notes than the others, but those notes contained a higher proportion of references to cause-and-effect dynamics, suggesting the diagram helped students to focus on extracting the most important information for understanding the lecture topic.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Gill Smith; Grainne Conole; Campus Technology; edX; Stephen Downes; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>The US Dept of Justice has announced a <a href="http://www.educationdive.com/news/edx-reaches-deal-with-justice-dept/383257/">settlement with edX over the accessibility of its services</a>.&nbsp; The MOOC provider will modify its website, platform, and mobile applications to allow students who are blind, deaf, or otherwise disabled to participate, bringing it in line with the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>Research by Toven-Lindsey et al explores <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz8cVS8LoO7ON3dBOEM5bzM0eEU/view">the range of pedagogical tools used in 24 MOOCs</a>, finding that the range of pedagogical practices currently used tends toward an objectivist-individual approach, with some efforts to incorporate more constructivist and group-oriented approaches. &nbsp;The paper challenges educators to strive for more creative and empowering forms of open online learning.</p>
<p>MIT and Harvard University have just published a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2587984_code2293023.pdf?abstractid=2586847&mirid=1">37-page draft report</a> that summarises findings from two years of hosting 68 MOOCs for 1.7 million participants who logged 10 million "participant hours" of activity.&nbsp; Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Participation in a second presentation was around 43% lower than the first but there was no significant decrease in a third presentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>57% of registrants intended to earn a certificate (and a further 8% of the remainder ultimately did)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computer Science courses had average participation numbers almost four times higher than other subjects (68,000 vs 19,000) but lower certification rates</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A recent <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/enrollment-mitx-moocs-are-we-educating-educators">Educase paper</a> identified that a large proportion of edX learners were themselves teachers.&nbsp; Now a blog post by the same authors discusses whether <a href="https://www.edx.org/blog/are-we-missing-opportunities-engage#.VSPpe9J0xEY">opportunities are being missed to engage teachers with MOOCs</a>.&nbsp; Some 28% of edX survey respondents identified themselves as past or present teachers, 54% were interested in accreditation opportunities and more than 70% desired greater access to MITx materials for use in their own courses.&nbsp; Now the authors suggest this presents some opportunities for MOOC providers, such as offering professional development for teachers, providing tools that allow teachers to tailor MOOC content into &ldquo;personal online courses&rdquo;, and providing profiling facilities so experienced teachers could identify themselves and be paired with novices to promote greater dialogue and learning.</p>
<p>A recent paper by Joksimovic et al, <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/273755322_What_do_cMOOC_participants_talk_about_in_Social_Media_A_Topic_Analysis_of_Discourse_in_a_cMOOC">What do cMOOC participants talk about in Social Media? A Topic Analysis of Discourse in a cMOOC</a>, examines how social media platforms (blogs, Twitter, and Facebook) affect the learning processes shape learners' interests and the topics to which they devote a significant attention. &nbsp;The findings indicate that learners tend to focus on several prominent topics that emerge very quickly in the course and they tend to maintain that focus, regardless of readings suggested by the instructor, and the affordances of different social media mean that different tools are used to discuss different topics.</p>
<p>And a paper in this month&rsquo;s BJET, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjet.12277/abstract">What public media reveals about MOOCs: A systematic analysis of news reports</a>, finds that coverage of MOOCs in public media is rapidly decreasing.&nbsp; By mid- 2014, it had decreased by almost 50% from the highest activity during 2013 and, while the majority of discussions during 2012-13 were focused on MOOC providers, partnerships and investments, the more recent focus has shifted towards the position of MOOCs in the global educational landscape and the use of data and analytics.</p>

<p>A new HEFCE report, <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/HEFCE,2014/Content/Pubs/2015/201507/HEFCE2015_07.pdf">Financial health of the higher education sector</a>, shows there to be &ldquo;significant variations in the financial performance of individual institutions across the sector&rdquo;, with two institutions seeing their income fall by more than 10% in in 2013-14, while four saw growth of more than 15% (Fig 1).&nbsp; Staff costs rose by an average of 3.4%, but with variations from -11% to +14% (Fig 4).&nbsp; In a bid to attract students, institutions are borrowing to invest, with a sector total of &pound;6.7bn (26% of total income), but with one institution peaking at 93% (Fig 11).&nbsp; The report warns that, &ldquo;Without increased surpluses and continued government support, there is a risk that the sector will be unable to deliver the scale of investment required to meet student demands, build capacity and &hellip; remain internationally competitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Jeremy Clayton, director of knowledge and innovation strategy at the Dept for Business, Innovation and Skills, warns that universities are viewed by &ldquo;politicians from across the political spectrum&rdquo; as <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/universities-worse-than-bankers/2019426.article">overstaffed and largely untouched by public spending reductions</a>, despite having achieved efficiency savings worth &pound;1 billion over the past three years.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/uclan-sets-aside-28m-to-cover-losses-at-overseas-campuses/2019181.article">University of Central Lancashire</a> has put aside &pound;2.8 million to guard against further losses on its overseas campuses as its Cyprus branch lost more money and drew criticism from the UN Secretary-General.&nbsp; The campus recorded a loss of &pound;1.4 million in 2013-14, blamed on &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; recruitment which UCLan says has now improved.&nbsp; Plans for a Sri Lanka campus have been shelved and a deal for another planned campus in Thailand had previously collapsed before building started.</p>
<p>The Association of Colleges says that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-32017137">190,000 adult education places will go next year</a> and adult education in England &ldquo;will not exist by 2020&rdquo; if government cuts continue.&nbsp; Funding is being cut by 24% and courses for health, public services and care, and ICT could be hardest hit as the government prioritises apprenticeships and subjects such as English and maths.</p>
<p>Concerns about plagiarism in a 2013 <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-32034849">University of Buckingham law module</a> should have triggered a formal process says the QAA.&nbsp; Instead, academics reduced students' marks for &ldquo;poor academic performance&rdquo; because they interpreted the problem as poor referencing rather than plagiarism.&nbsp; The university subsequently referred to some sections in essays as having been &ldquo;lifted&rdquo; but decided the first year students had not yet been subject to rigorous training on avoiding plagiarism and so had not committed any deliberate action to deceive.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s first <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=201503271940068">Research Centre for Global Higher Education</a> is being established by the UCL Institute of Education in partnership with Lancaster University and the University of Sheffield. Co-funded by HEFCE, the centre will open in October 2015.</p>

<p>Apollo Education Group (<a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/university-of-phoenix-enrollment-numbers-are-down-2015-3?r=US">University of Phoenix</a>) announced its Q2 earnings last month and news that total enrolments were down 15% and revenues were down 14% caused the company's share price to fall by 16%.&nbsp; Student numbers have fallen by more than 50% compared to five years ago, from 460,000 down to 213,000.</p>
<p>LinkedIn is buying online training provider <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/linkedin-to-acquire-online-training-site-lynda-com/">Lynda.com</a> for around $1.5bn in what will be the professional network's largest acquisition to date. &nbsp;Lynda.com offers a large library of online courses in such areas as Web design and development, computer programming, animation, video production and editing, education and business. &nbsp;A basic subscription currently costs $25 a month ($250/year) with a premium subscription at $37.50 a month ($375/year).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2015/04/02/jones-international-university-to-close.html">Jones International University</a>, an online, for-profit institution based in Colorado, has announced plans to shut down following a 55% drop in enrolment between 2011 and the end of 2014, leaving JIU with about 2,000 students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be warned, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sv_ls2_4?ie=UTF8&node=10943282011">Amazon is moving into online tutoring</a>.&nbsp; As part of Amazon's new Home Services, US customers can purchase tuition in subjects ranging from maths and languages to music and fitness &ndash; 121 at home or in small groups in local centres.&nbsp; The service is offered in partnership with San Diego-based TakeLessons, a marketplace for local and online lessons.</p>

<p><strong>Technology For Employability</strong></p>
<p><em>[Rebecca Galley]</em></p>
<p>The Jisc cross-sector <a href="http://employabilityproject.jiscinvolve.org/wp/">Technology for employability</a> study is currently about half-way to completion and three key themes are emerging:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Institutions are on various points of the continuum towards student employability &ldquo;maturity&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology is under exploited</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is insufficient engagement and partnership working with employers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors welcome feedback on these themes, either as blog comments or replying directly to <a href="mailto:peter.chatterton@daedalus-e-world.com">peter.chatterton@daedalus-e-world.com</a> or <a href="mailto:grebbeck@me.com">grebbeck@me.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>30 Trends in Education Technology For 2015 </strong></p>
<p><em>[Belinda Tynan]</em></p>
<p>Terry Heick posts <a href="http://www.teachthought.com/trends/30-trends-education-technology-2015/">30 ed tech trends for the coming year</a>, organised into three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Trending Up</strong> (e.g. Teacherpreneurs, Decentralising academic standards, Digital citizenship)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Awkward Middle Ground</strong> (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Apple, &ldquo;Accountability&rdquo;, Traditional reading lists of truly great literature)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trending Down</strong> (e.g. Mass education publishers, Common core standards, &ldquo;21<sup>st</sup> Century learning&rdquo;, MOOCs)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Teaching in a Digital Age</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Tony Bates seems to have done more work and made more online postings since he retired than ever before.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been releasing chunks of his new online book,<a href="http://opentextbc.ca/teachinginadigitalage/">Teaching in a Digital Age</a>, for comment as they&rsquo;ve been drafted over the past year or so.&nbsp; Now the whole thing (502pp) is complete and available for free.&nbsp; Tony&rsquo;s foreword says that &ldquo;The book examines the underlying principles that guide effective teaching in an age when everyone, and in particular the students we are teaching, are using technology.&rdquo; &nbsp;The twelve chapters cover issues such as the nature of knowledge, F2F and online methods of teaching, technology and different media, and quality.&nbsp; Stephen Downes&rsquo; assessment: &ldquo;This is a monumental accomplishment and I have no doubt that Bates will receive wide praise for his efforts over the last year.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>College Lets Students Switch Between Online and In-Person</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>An increasing number of institutions allow students to <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/online-or-in-person-one-college-lets-students-switch-back-and-forth/56265">study courses on campus or online</a>, but Philadelphia&rsquo;s Peirce College will shortly allow access to both formats in the same course.&nbsp; The college, which caters specifically to adult learners, plans to allow its students to switch back and forth between attending class in person or online, based on which is more convenient for them on a given week.&nbsp; As part of the college&rsquo;s 2015-2018 strategic plan, some programmes will allow switching from autumn of this year, with the entire curriculum following by September 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>State of the Commons</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>CC reports on <a href="https://stateof.creativecommons.org/report/">the state of Creative Commons</a>, noting that there are currently around 880 million CC-licensed works (although Stephen Downes points out that 111 million of these are separate Wikipedia articles) and that total is expected to pass 1 billion in 2015.&nbsp; Other highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The majority of CC work is published in the US (37%) and Europe (34%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>14 countries (including the UK and Scotland) (?) have made national commitments to open education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Hewlett Foundation leads the way in open policy for philanthropy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The US Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training initiative (TAACCCT) is the largest CC project, with a $2bn budget to help community colleges equip their students with the skills they need to find employment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But according to <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/free-not-future-digital-content-education/">Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</a>&rsquo;s Chief Content Officer, writing in Wired, &ldquo;If we do not get educational content right, students are less likely to gain the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in college and careers.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, a clear message &ndash; it&rsquo;s very important that we pay money to educational publishers in order to learn well from &lsquo;quality&rsquo; content.&nbsp; But, as Stephen Downes observes, &ldquo;&hellip;in fact, almost any content will do if learners are motivated, and no content will do if learners are not motivated.&nbsp; And the reason why free can work and is working is that it's created by and for people who are motivated.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Learning for Life</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>According to a new report, <a href="http://tytonpartners.com/tyton-wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Learning-for-Life_The-Oppty-for-Tech-to-Transform-Adult-Education_March-20151.pdf">Learning for Life: The Opportunity for Technology to Transform Adult Education</a>, there are 36 million US adults who lack basic skills (1 in 6 maintains low literacy skills and nearly 1 in 3 has low numeracy skills) and yet the adult education system serves only about 11% of them. &nbsp;There is enthusiasm for using technology and participants have good access to modern devices and the internet, so the report (Part 1 of 2) calls for greater exploitation of ICT.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Thug Notes</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-03-20-lessons-from-thug-notes-does-swearing-belong-in-the-classroom?utm_campaign=22e47780a7-Innovate+215-HIREEDU&utm_medium=email&utm_source=EdsurgeLive&utm_term=0_0f1ec25b60-22e47780a7-292151429">Thug Notes</a> is web site aimed at US students which includes video explanations of Shakespeare and other notable works of literature.&nbsp; However, the approach taken by Sparky Sweets PhD is a little unconventional&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After making a b**** outta their enemies, the king&rsquo;s fresh generals Macbeth and Banquo hit up three witches who start laying down some cold prophecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, it&rsquo;s a hit with many students and also some teachers, and the YouTube channel currently has over 400,000 subscribers.&nbsp; According to the site&rsquo;s cofounder, Jacob Salamon, &ldquo;Thug Notes originally started off as an idea and a joke&hellip; &nbsp;We never really expected to enter this whole world of education; that wasn&rsquo;t the initial intention. &nbsp;But we began to see that this is working in classrooms. &nbsp;Teachers are using it; students are using it. &nbsp;Millennials are falling in love with reading again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if you tend towards the more academic end of the literary spectrum, a feature on The Week site provides descriptions and video exemplars of what <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/545166/what-english-shakespeare-beowulf-king-arthur-actually-sounded-like">the English of Shakespeare, Beowulf, and King Arthur</a> actually sounded like.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Watch Interface Design</strong></p>
<p><em>[User Focus]</em></p>
<p>Good user interface design is a challenge in itself, but trying to squeeze lots onto a 38mm (1.5&rdquo;) screen makes it even more so.&nbsp; Therefore, the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/WatchHumanInterfaceGuidelines/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014992-CH3-SW1">Human Interface Guidelines for the Apple Watch</a> make interesting reading because they explain not just <em>what</em> developers should aim for, but also <em>why</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Happy Birthday iPad</strong></p>
<p><em>[Techno Buffalo]</em></p>
<p>OK, so <a href="http://www.technobuffalo.com/2015/04/03/the-first-ipad-launched-5-years-ago-today-see-how-much-it-has-changed/">when was the first iPad launched?</a>&nbsp; My two late-teen daughters guessed at 1999 and 2002, making them about a decade out &ndash; because iPad 1 appeared on 3 April 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why predicting the future and impact of technology on society is so fraught with uncertainties.</p>

<p>Coursera announced last month that it had teamed up with more than half a dozen companies (including Google, Instagram and Shazam) that will help create capstone projects for its course series.&nbsp; Nineteen colleges now work with <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/meet-the-new-self-appointed-mooc-accreditors-google-and-instagram/55807">Coursera to offer what amount to microdegrees</a> (&lsquo;Specialisations&rsquo;) that require students to take a series of MOOCs and then finish a hands-on capstone project.&nbsp; This approach has proved an effective way to bring in revenue, as students end up paying around $500 in fees to get a certificate proving they passed the &lsquo;free&rsquo; courses.&nbsp; This strategy has already worked well for Udacity, which has bypassed universities and works only with industry to develop its courses and nanodegrees.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re discovering that there are a huge number of willing and eager lifelong learners that are underserved by higher education,&rdquo; says founder, Sebastian Thrun. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting to the point where we&rsquo;ll be profitable as a company.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/03/10/edx-and-microsoft-launch-it-development-moocs.aspx">Microsoft and edX</a> have partnered to launch IT development courses that will be taught by Microsoft experts.&nbsp; The courses focus on core development skills for cloud and mobile technologies, and feature interactive coding, assessments and exercises. &nbsp;Courses start at the end of March and students can enrol for free or obtain a verified certificate for a fee.</p>
<p>The OU has launched a range of free <a href="http://oeru.org/news/the-open-university-launches-badged-open-courses/">Badged Open Courses</a> (BOCs) which will differ from MOOCs because they are perpetual, enabling students to return to them at any time to refresh their knowledge, unlike MOOCs which tend to have set start and finish dates.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/futurelearn-breaks-1-million-learner-milestone/">FutureLearn</a> announced last month that it has reached 1 million learners from over 190 countries, becoming a top-five MOOC provider in a little over a year.&nbsp; FL now offers 220+ courses from 44 partner universities and institutions, mostly in the UK but also including Scandinavia, Australia, New Zealand, China, and Korea.&nbsp; Last week, FL announced nine new university partners including their first in Colombia, France, Spain and Switzerland.&nbsp; Other interesting snippets: the most popular course is &lsquo;Exploring English language and culture&rsquo; (120k learners); one video in that course has over 17,000 comments on its page; and around 25% of FL access is now from tablets and smartphones.</p>
<p>It remains the case that a great many MOOC students are educationally advantaged.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/11/8014563/bill-gates-education-future-of-online-courses-third-world">Bill Gates</a>, in his capacity as guest editor at The Verge, explores why MOOCs need to change to help students who don't have developed literacy skills, easy access to internet, or face gender prejudice.&nbsp; To be honest, the video is slick but relatively lightweight, whereas the accompanying article from Adi Robertson is much more comprehensive and wide ranging.</p>
<p>In a brief but interesting post, Austin Tate provides demographic and activity data for participants in the <a href="http://blog.inf.ed.ac.uk/atate/2015/03/03/coursera-ai-planning-mooc-statistics-2015/">2015 Edinburgh/Coursera AI Planning MOOC</a> that completed this month.</p>

<p><strong>&lsquo;World's Largest University&rsquo; is Scamming Students</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>A <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Worlds-Largest-University/190337">global network of fraudulent online universities</a>, leading back to a &ldquo;Middle East Office of Academic Regulation &amp; Examination&rdquo;, has been uncovered by journalists.&nbsp; The universities in the network, which typically say they are based in the United States, actively encourage students from the Arab world to enrol by offering what appear to be generous scholarships after just a few minutes of exchanging instant messages online. &nbsp;But that financial aid is conditional on students paying the rest of their fees immediately.</p>

<p><strong>The End of College</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Washington Post]</em></p>
<p>Kevin Carey, director of the Education Policy Programme at the New America Foundation, suggests that HE is becoming increasingly unaffordable and unattainable and so is on the verge of a transformation that could change the role universities play in our society.&nbsp; In his new book, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/one-vision-of-tomorrows-college-cheap-and-you-get-an-education-not-a-degree/2015/02/11/7b2ed78c-8617-11e4-9534-f79a23c40e6c_story.html">The End of College: Creating the Future of Learning and the University of Everywhere</a>, he sets out his vision for a digital, online future, with little bricks-and-mortar overhead, where students are taught in ways tailored to their individual needs, resulting in &ldquo;an education, not a degree&rdquo;.&nbsp; Nice idea but I remain sceptical.&nbsp; Carey states that &ldquo;MIT is already moving in this direction&rdquo;, but there is no sign that MIT has any plans to close its campus.&nbsp; It is true that MOOCs (etc) have been a great success, but mainly as supplements to HE or to provide short bursts of education for specific groups.&nbsp; Employers are not educators, most want a credential they understand &ndash; and that credential is the degree.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A Typology of Web 2.0 Learning Technologies</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Matt Bower has conducted a <a href="http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/csd6280.pdf">typological analysis of Web 2.0 learning technologies</a>, identifying 212 tools that were suitable for learning and teaching purposes which he&rsquo;s arranged into 14 clusters.&nbsp; Links and brief descriptions are provided for all 212 tools and, whilst documents of this type tend to go out of date fairly quickly, it currently represents a comprehensive and valuable collection of goodies.</p>

<p><strong>Crowdsourced Outlines Improve Learning from Videos</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Even though video is generally accepted to be one of the more engaging forms of learning content, we cannot assume that time-poor students will devour every clip from beginning to end.&nbsp; Researchers from MIT and Harvard are using <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/02/12/research-outlines-improve-learning-from-videos.aspx">crowd-sourced conceptual outlines</a> that work as navigation tools, so that those who are already familiar with some of a video's content can skip ahead, while others can backtrack to revisit content as required.&nbsp; According to co-author Juho Kim, &ldquo;It's really hard to find the exact spots that you want to watch.&nbsp; You end up scrubbing on the timeline carefully and looking at thumbnails.&nbsp; And with educational videos, especially, it's really hard, because it's not that visually dynamic.&nbsp; So we thought that having this semantic information about the video really helps.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Student Recall of Electronic Versus Handwritten Feedback</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>Sadler (1998) defined formative assessment as that which is intended to accelerate learning and improve performance through the providing of feedback.&nbsp; But how important is the medium by which feedback is provided?&nbsp; Researchers at the University of Louisiana compared the effects of <a href="http://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/ij-sotl/vol9/iss1/7/">handwritten versus electronic textual feedback</a> and found that, whereas students who preferred or received handwritten feedback recall more of that feedback (quantity), those who actually received electronic feedback recall the comments more accurately (quality).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Australia&rsquo;s Monash University, education lecturers Michael Henderson and Michael Phillips have been providing <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/could-video-feedback-replace-the-red-pen">video feedback</a> &ndash; typically 5 mins, unscripted, unedited &ndash; for about five years.&nbsp; Not only does this take them less time to create than handwritten notes but 126 of their students reported that, &ldquo;&hellip;they felt the feedback to be &lsquo;real,&rsquo; &lsquo;honest,&rsquo; and &lsquo;authentic&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; They also found it to be clearer than written notes, notwithstanding the lack of editorial polish.</p>

<p><strong>Targeting Deeper Learning with Micro-Credentials</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>I used to think that <a href="http://exchange.ac.uk/learning-and-teaching-theory-guide/deep-and-surface-approaches-learning.html">deep learning</a> was at the opposite(and preferable) end of the spectrum to surface learning (Biggs, 1999; Marton &amp; S&auml;lj&ouml;, 1996) but I blinked and now it&rsquo;s been redefined.&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.digitalpromise.org/page/-/dpdocuments/microcredentials/mc_deeperlearning.pdf">Developing a System of Micro-credentials: Supporting Deeper Learning in the Classroom</a>, &ldquo;Deeper Learning is an umbrella term for the skills, understandings, and mind sets students must possess to succeed in today&rsquo;s jobs and civic life.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s organised into 6 categories of activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Master core academic content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think critically and solve complex problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work collaboratively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate effectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn how to learn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop academic mindsets</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;and these are then divided into 40 micro-credentials (e.g. Resolving conflicts).&nbsp; Looks useful, and quite an overlap with the <a href="https://usergeneratededucation.wordpress.com/2013/05/22/the-other-21st-century-skills/">21st Century Skills</a> retweeted a couple of weeks ago by Belinda.</p>
<p>So how can education systems help teachers engage in practices and behaviours that promote deeper learning? &nbsp;The <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/learning_deeply/2015/02/how_to_teach_for_deeper_learning_an_international_survey_provides_insights.html">Teaching and Learning International Survey</a> (TALIS) from OECD surveyed over 100,000 teachers and principals from 34 countries regarding their teaching and the conditions in which they work. &nbsp;The site contains a nice (but unattributed) graph showing how worker tasks are now much more non-routine, analytical and interpersonal than was the case 50 years ago.&nbsp; Findings from the survey showed that opportunities to share and learn from colleagues can help create the conditions for the innovative and effective teaching that provides the deeper learning today's students need. &nbsp;Among the key findings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More than 94% of teachers agreed that their role was to facilitate students' own inquiry and yet teaching practices that foster deeper learning are relatively rare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborative teacher professional learning supports instructional practices that promote&nbsp; deeper learning for students and fosters a positive climate and ongoing teacher learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time, resources and funding all matter &ndash; and OECD data show that the high-performing education systems have invested carefully in teaching quality</p>

<p>Data from Strategy Analytics shows Android now accounting for over 80% of all smartphones shipped globally.&nbsp; However, when it comes to actually making money the position is almost reversed &ndash; with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/26/apple-eating-all-the-profits">Apple taking 89% of all smartphone profits</a> ($18.8bn) in Q4 last year.&nbsp; This left Android suppliers sharing the remaining 11% ($2.4bn), although it is estimated that Samsung took around half of this.</p>

<p><strong>HTTP/2 Comes a Step Closer</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>HTTP/2 will be with us very soon according to the chair of the HTTP working group.&nbsp; HTTP powers the Web by defining how hypertext is to be formatted and transmitted and how web servers and browsers should respond to those commands.&nbsp; Currently, HTTP/1.1 is most commonly used, but <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-webs-about-to-get-faster.aspx?m=2">HTTP/2</a> will speed up loading of web pages by transporting data between browser and server.&nbsp; The new protocol is backward-compatible with older versions and, importantly, it will speed up activities by carrying more data in a single pass with each request to load the requested Web site. &nbsp;This is especially important for smart phone access, which now accounts for about a third of all Web access.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on&hellip;&nbsp; The Psychology of Social Networkers </strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS; Science Direct; APA; The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to make presumptions about social media users, but to what extend are these borne out by evidence?&nbsp; Research suggests that Facebook users tend to be &ldquo;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211000379">more extraverted and narcissistic, but less conscientious and socially lonely, than nonusers</a>&rdquo;, but there is also evidence that <a href="http://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/02/student-narcissists-prefer-twitter-more.html">narcissism is age-related</a>, with student narcissists preferring Twitter, while more mature narcissists prefer FB.&nbsp; Separate research reported that &ldquo;higher degrees of narcissism led to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214000600">deeper self-disclosures and more self-promotional content</a> within these messages. [And] users with higher need to belong disclosed more intimate information&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Further research suggests that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211002020">personality was a more important factor than gender and FB experience</a>, with high scorers in neuroticism spending more time on FB, although extraverts were found to have more friends on the network than introverts.&nbsp; However, people who said they used FB as an informational tool (rather than socialising) tended to score higher on neuroticism, sociability, extraversion and openness, but lower on conscientiousness and &ldquo;need for cognition&rdquo;.&nbsp; The same study also found that higher scorers in sociability, neuroticism and extraversion preferred FB, while people who scored higher in "need for cognition" preferred Twitter.&nbsp; There is also evidence that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563212003317">anxiousness</a> (as well as alcohol and drug use) predicts more emotional attachment to Facebook.</p>
<p>And what of academic performance?&nbsp; An analysis of nearly 4,000 US students found that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211001932">the more they used Facebook to socialise, the poorer their grades tended to be</a>, although using the site to collect and share information was actually associated with <em>better</em> grades.&nbsp; However, an earlier longitudinal study found <a href="http://www.firstmonday.dk/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2498">no evidence for a link between FB use and poorer grades</a>; if anything there were signs of the opposite pattern.</p>
<p>Research published last month suggests that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0193397314001257">students may learn to regulate their use of Facebook</a>, both as a distraction from coursework and in their free time, as they progress through university.&nbsp; The study of 1,649 US students showed that seniors spent significantly less time on Facebook and spent significantly less time multitasking with Facebook than newer students.&nbsp; Time spent on Facebook was significantly negatively predictive of grades for freshmen but not for other students.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seniors were less likely to post status updates than freshmen and sophomores, comment on content less than the other class ranks, use Facebook chat less than freshmen and sophomores, post photos less than juniors, tag photos less than freshmen and juniors, and view videos less than all the other class ranks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a 2011 study of about 300 college students, researchers from Cornell found that students who were asked to look at their own Facebook page for just three minutes showed <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~telecom/people/faculty/gonzaamy/Gonzales-11-Mirror-FB- wall.pdf">a boost in self-esteem</a> compared with control groups who either looked in a mirror or simply sat in a room for three minutes.&nbsp; They speculate that we might get that ego lift because we self-select the information we include in our Facebook profiles and posts &ndash; and so looking at our favourite flattering photos and witty or erudite comments reinforces the version of ourselves we want to be.</p>
<p>Building on the ubiquity of Twitter, The Chronicle&rsquo;s Adeline Koh posts on her experiences of getting students to <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/live-tweeting-assignments-to-use-or-not-to-use/58949?cid=gn&utm_source=gn&utm_medium=en">live tweet whilst watching films</a> (feature films, documentaries or recorded lectures).&nbsp; The assignment does not require that students follow one another to read their tweets, they simply need to use public accounts and make sure each tweet contains the event hashtag.&nbsp; She has tried this both in a classroom and remotely, and she reports that, &ldquo;Every single time this activity has massively increased student engagement and learning&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; Audrey Watters; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>The latest Babson Research Group annual survey of more than 2,800 academic leaders suggests that <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-mooc-fades-in-3-charts/55701">MOOC hype is fading</a>, with the percentage of institutions offering MOOCs levelling off, at around 14%.&nbsp; There is a growing feeling that MOOCs will not generate money or reduce costs for universities, with only 16% of those questioned believing that MOOCs are sustainable, while 51% think they are not &ndash; in stark contrast to figures of 28% and 26% respectively in 2012 &ndash; and only 2.4% of academic leaders offering MOOCs said their main goal was to &ldquo;explore cost reductions.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a similar shift in responses to whether MOOCs were &ldquo;important for institutions to learn about online pedagogy&rdquo;, with 28% agreeing and 37% disagreeing, compared to 50% and 19% in 2012.</p>
<p>Daphne Koller has announced that <a href="http://www.afr.com/p/national/education/coursera_sets_sights_on_universities_YoYzesiG11p0QtnEsDV8pI">Coursera was rebuilding its &shy;platform &lsquo;from the ground up&rsquo;</a> to allow students to commence courses &lsquo;on demand&rsquo; and to give university &shy;instructors access to student data on progress and performance.&nbsp; She said Coursera had already shifted about 50 courses to an &ldquo;on-demand&rdquo; basis and by the end of this year most of its courses would be offered that way.&nbsp; Indications were that on demand courses were also&shy; beneficial for students. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a higher degree of learner engagement than with session-based courses,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The University of Central Florida has partnered with Educause and ed tech company Instructure to launch <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/01/27/u-central-florida-launches-blended-learning-mooc-for-educators.aspx">BlendKit2015: Becoming a Blended Learning Designer</a>.&nbsp; Building on the success of last year&rsquo;s BlendKit2014, the 5 week MOOC starts on <strong>23 Feb</strong> and will include: scholarly reading selections on blended learning; guest presenters each week; assessment and critique of course design work from experts and peers; and frequent interaction with other students and course facilitators via blogs or social networks.</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/01/14/new-mooc-platform-provides-free-it-certification-courses.aspx">Cybrary.IT</a> is a new provider offering 20-plus certification MOOCs in IT systems administration, network administration and cybersecurity.&nbsp; Courses range from 5&ndash;30 hours and combine individual study with instructional lectures, interactive demos, online discussions and collaborative activities. &nbsp;Students also have access to study guides, white papers, case studies and other materials through the Cybrary Web site. &nbsp;More than 3,500 students worldwide have joined so far.</p>
<p>Australian MOOC provider <a href="http://www.startupsmart.com.au/2015020514083/venture-capital/tech-entrepreneur-clive-mayhew-pumps-1-million-into-openlearning-as-the-mooc-provider-raises-17-million.html">OpenLearning</a> has raised A$1.7m to help meet its goal of increasing the number of students using its platform from 125,000 to a million by the end of thia year.&nbsp; Roughly 50% of OpenLearning&rsquo;s users come from Malaysia, while the majority of its other users are in Australia, the US and China.&nbsp; The company has recently struck a deal with the Malaysian government to deliver 15% of the country&rsquo;s public university courses using its platform, with the aim increasing this to 30% by 2020.</p>
<p>MOOC organisers can now include URLs that allow their registered learners to purchase print, eBooks and journal articles from <a href="http://www.springer.com/gb/about-springer/media/press-releases/corporate/springer-cooperates-with-mooc-organizers-around-the-globe/42598">Springer</a> at discounted rates.</p>
<p>The folks at the Daily Genius have come up with <a href="http://loocs.org/">LOOCs</a> (Little&hellip;) which are &ldquo;one-page courses that give you what you need in a simple step-by-step recipe format.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nice idea, but definitely over-egging the MOOC bandwagon: these aren&rsquo;t LOOCs, they&rsquo;re good old just-in-time learning factsheets.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian; THE, The Independent; University World News]</em></p>
<p>Latest figures from HESA show the number of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/15/part-time-university-students-numbers-fall?CMP=share_btn_tw">UK part-time students fell by 7%</a> in 2013-14 compared with the previous year, with the worst-case market &ndash; foundation degrees &ndash; falling by 18% to just 24,000.&nbsp; The figures underscored earlier research suggesting that part-time student numbers have fallen sharply since 2010-11, when fees rose to a maximum of &pound;9,000 a year for full-time study.&nbsp; &ldquo;These figures confirm another reduction in the number of part-time students, and should be a significant concern for policymakers and the higher education sector as a whole,&rdquo; said Les Ebdon, director of the Office of Fair Access to Higher Education.&nbsp; Over the same period, full-time student numbers rose by 2%.</p>
<p>According to new data from UCAS, the latest <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/student-admissions-bounce-back-after-2012-slump/2018225.article">rise in student admissions</a> in this academic year takes the total up by almost 14,000 (3.2%) to 447,450, meaning that nearly all universities in England have bounced back from the &pound;9k fees admissions slump, which saw core intakes shrink in some cases by 20%.</p>
<p>But not everyone wants to go to university for their degree.&nbsp; There was an 11.8% in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/thousands-of-students-shun-universities-in-favour-of-studying-for-their-degrees-at-local-further-education-colleges-10016084.html">undergraduates joining FE colleges</a> in the two years to 2012-13, helped in part by the relaxation in recruitment curbs.&nbsp; The Association of Colleges estimates that there are around 115,000 students currently studying for degrees at FE colleges.</p>
<p>Analysis by UCAS shows that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/record-numbers-of-women-going-to-university-according-to-ucas-9993201.html">a record number of women started university courses</a> last Sep, but they are still avoiding science, IT and engineering courses.&nbsp; The biggest gap between the sexes were in education, with 85% per cent of acceptances being women, and &ldquo;subjects allied to medicine&rdquo;, i.e. nursing (81%).&nbsp; In contrast, 87% of computer science undergrads were men, as were 85% of engineering students.&nbsp; In a dubious pre-election comment, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said &ldquo;&hellip;if you didn&rsquo;t know what you wanted to do, then the arts and humanities were what you chose to do because they were useful for all kinds of jobs.&nbsp; Of course, we now know nothing could be further from the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Colquhoun suggests that honours degrees aren't well suited to all students and that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/feb/03/honours-degrees-arent-for-all-some-unis-should-only-teach-two-year-courses">some universities should focus on two-year ordinary degrees</a>, similar to those offered by US liberal arts colleges, and these should be less specialist than what is now offered.&nbsp; Some institutions should specialise in teaching such degrees, others should become predominantly postgraduate institutions and have the time, money and expertise to do proper advanced teaching.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Sunday Times last month, shadow HE spokesman Liam Byrne said the present university funding system was unsustainable: &ldquo;We want to bring the cost down, but this has to be funded. &nbsp;The right long-term shift is to a <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2015012010053921">graduate tax</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, more recent speculation suggests that Labour may commit to a Robbins- or Dearing-style major review of HE and a <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/uuk-warning-over-6000-fees/2018347.article">cut in maximum tuition fees from &pound;9k to &pound;6k</a>, described by UUK as ignoring the &ldquo;legitimate concerns of vice-chancellors&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Overseas fee-paying students at the University of the West of Scotland could benefit from a proposed initiative to <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/university-students-who-fail-should-get-refund.117233988">have their costs waived if they fail to graduate</a>.&nbsp; UWS says it has broken ranks with other institutions to ensure it remains attractive in an increasingly competitive global market.&nbsp; If the scheme is approved, UWS would become the first institution in the UK to offer students a refund for failing to complete their courses.</p>

The time-to-adoption for makerspaces and wearable technology are estimated within two to three years, while adaptive learning technologies and the Internet of Things is expected to be mainstream in universities and colleges within four to five years.</p>

<p><a href="http://onlinelearningconsortium.org/read/survey-reports-2014/">Grade Level: Tracking Online Education in the United States</a> is the 12<sup>th</sup> annual report by the Babson Research Group on the state of online learning in US HE.&nbsp; The headline finding is that the number of HE students taking at least one distance education course in 2014 is up 3.7% from 2013.&nbsp; This represents the slowest rate of increase in over a decade, and there has actually been a decrease among for-profit institutions.&nbsp; Curiously, while 71% of chief academic leaders report that online learning is critical to their long-term strategy, only 28% say that their faculty accept the &ldquo;value and legitimacy of online education.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Short Courses Offer Hope to US Education Companies</strong></p>
<p><em>[Reuters]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/01/13/education-competition-idUKL3N0US3Z620150113">Short courses, Bootcamps and nanodegrees</a> could be the way forward for traditional for-profit US education providers.&nbsp; Companies such as Apollo and ITT have seen enrolments dwindle in the face of increased regulatory scrutiny for issues including student loans, poor placements and low graduation rates &ndash; and this has given a boost to smaller schools offering niche courses, which teach skills that give students an edge in the job market at a fraction of the cost of a degree course.&nbsp; Apollo's shares have fallen 14% in the past year and ITT by more than two thirds.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/choose/ou/brainwave">OU Brainwave</a> is a new, free, research focused, psychology app from The Open University and Reed.&nbsp; Users are encouraged to play five simple but fun games which build up a profile of how their cognitive performance varies across the day &ndash; and whether they are a &lsquo;morning&rsquo; or &lsquo;evening&rsquo; person.&nbsp; The app also anonymises your scores and uploads them to the OU research team, where the data is combined with that of all the other users of the app in order to provide new insights into how circadian rhythms and time-of-day affects cognitive performance.</p>

<p><em>[Audrey Watters; Mashable; The Chronicle; Ian Blackham; EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>Half of American adults now own an e-reading device and the Obama administration has set a goal of getting e-textbooks into every classroom by 2017.&nbsp; However, it remains the case that many people just don&rsquo;t like them and, in <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/readingreport/key-findings.htm">a 2014 survey by Scholastic</a>, 65% of 6 to 17-year-old children said they would always want to read books in print (up from 60% in 2012).&nbsp; In her new book, <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120765/naomi-barons-words-onscreen-fate-reading-digital-world">Words Onscreen: The Fate of Reading in a Digital World</a>, Prof Naomi Baron brings more data to the case for print, having surveyed over 300 university students in the US, Japan, Germany, and Slovakia.&nbsp; Whilst the delivery format is less important for &ldquo;light reading&rdquo;, she found a near-universal preference for print for serious reading and study.&nbsp; When students were given a choice of various media &ndash; including hard copy, phone, tablet, e-reader and laptop &ndash; 92% said they could concentrate best in hard copy.</p>
<p>Amazon has launched the <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/01/22/kindle-textbook-creator/">Kindle Textbook Creator</a>, which allows users to easily and freely transform PDFs into an e-book format and to organise images, graphs, equations, charts, etc.&nbsp; The resulting e-books include Kindle tools such as highlighting, note-taking and dictionary/Wikipedia lookup but will run on multiple devices including Kindles, iOS and Android.&nbsp; The company has also launched <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/03/amazon-kindle-convert">Kindle Convert</a> which allows users (in the US only for now) to turn their paper library into e-books&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US National Endowment for the Humanities and the Mellon Foundation will jointly provide $1 million to convert out-of-print humanities books into e-Pubs with a Creative Commons licence, ensuring that the books are freely downloadable with searchable texts and in formats that are compatible with any e-reading device.&nbsp; Books proposed under the new <a href="http://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2015-01-15/humanities-open-book">Humanities Open Book</a> programme must be of demonstrable intellectual significance and broad interest to current readers&nbsp;</p>
<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s <a href="http://publishingperspectives.com/2015/02/trust-readers-defy-drm-says-no-starch-press/">No Starch Press</a> produces &ldquo;sharable books for geeks,&rdquo; eschewing DRM and defying conventional publishing wisdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have never used DRM and we never will. It&rsquo;s just foolish,&rdquo; says Bill Pollock, founder of No Starch Press.&nbsp; &ldquo;People should have the same rights in an ebook that they do in a print book, I don&rsquo;t believe in charging people three times for the same information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reporting that one in five US students have a language-based learning disability, EdSurge considers how e-books and TTS audiobooks may <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-01-27-will-digital-accessible-books-improve-reading-for-students-with-dyslexia">improve learning opportunities for those with dyslexia</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Critical Pedagogy</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Sean Michael Morris posts about <a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/announcements/mmcp-critical-critical-pedagogy/">critical pedagogy</a> &ndash; the theme of a 6-week &ldquo;MOOC MOOC&rdquo; that started on 19 Jan.&nbsp; He describes CP as a philosophy of teaching that <em>shows</em> more than <em>tells,</em> and he equates telling to what Freire calls the banking model of education in which &ldquo;the scope of action allowed to the students extends only as far as receiving, filing, and storing the deposits&rdquo; (p53).&nbsp; Compare that with an inquiry model which leaves learners free to ask, explore and experiment.&nbsp; With this approach, Freire notes that, &ldquo;Knowledge emerges only through invention and re-invention [&hellip;] through the restless, impatient, continuing, hopeful inquiry human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other.&rdquo; (p53).&nbsp; So how&rsquo;s the balance looking on your latest module?</p>

<p>A report from Pew Internet Research looked at <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/12/30/technologys-impact-on-workers/">US workers and technology</a>.&nbsp; When asked about technological tools that are &lsquo;very important&rsquo; for their job, 61% cited email, followed by the internet (54%), landline (35%) and mobile phone (24%); social networking came in at a tiny 4%.&nbsp; Only 7% of working online adults felt their productivity had dropped because of the internet, email and cell phones, while 46% felt more productive and 35% work longer hours using these new online technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Plagiarism: A Disconnect between Students&rsquo; Thoughts and Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>[Faculty Focus]</em></p>
<p>Almost 800 US students completed a <a href="http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/teaching-and-learning/plagiarism-interesting-disconnect-students-thoughts-actions/">plagiarism survey</a>, in which 75% agreed or strongly agreed that copying text without referencing it was plagiarism, 81% said such behaviour should result in strong punishment, and 84% said that they never or rarely engaged in this practice.&nbsp; The same students were then given a scenario which opened with some original text from an academic paper and was followed by a piece of writing by a student which included two identical sentences from the original text that were not referenced.&nbsp; Now, when questioned, only 30% agreed that inserting the text was a breach of academic guidelines, although 64% did agree that a reference was required.&nbsp; So they <em>did</em> recognise plagiarism but the researchers speculate that they may consider that just two sentences (as opposed to lifting a whole section) didn&rsquo;t count as serious plagiarism.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Audrey Watters; TechCrunch; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>EdSurge reports on <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-12-26-moocs-in-2014-breaking-down-the-numbers">MOOC stats for 2014</a>, highlights of which are that, by mid-2015, over 400 universities are expected to have delivered 2400+ courses to around 17 million students.&nbsp; Coursera still offers the lion&rsquo;s share of courses (36%) but this has fallen from around 50% in 2013 as new providers emerge &ndash; including FutureLearn, in 5<sup>th</sup> place with 4.7% of courses and around 800,000 students.&nbsp; And what courses do people want?&nbsp; The top 20 search terms suggests: python, healthcare, java, finance, android, English, statistics, marketing, music, writing, psychology, accounting, design, Spanish, programming, law, photography, big data and history.&nbsp; The article also reports on four notable trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each of the Big 3 MOOC providers have introduced their own credentials (Udacity&rsquo;s Nanodegrees, Coursera&rsquo;s Specializations and edX&rsquo;s Xseries)</li>
<li>Open edX has quickly become the de facto platform for organisations and groups who are looking to host their own MOOCs</li>
<li>There is a move towards self-paced &lsquo;always on&rsquo; availability rather than fixed start/finish dates (but with the challenge of providing the social interaction and/or assistance that many MOOC-takers expect)</li>
<li>Production quality is improving, with many universities setting up centralised production studios to support academics creating MOOCs</li>
</ul>
<p>Coursera has revamped its <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/104696446187/have-a-business-idea-get-funded-with-coursera">Developing Innovative Ideas: The First Step in Entrepreneurship</a> &lsquo;Specializations&rsquo; MOOC.&nbsp; Learners completing three 4-week courses will then be able to take part in a final project, creating a business plan and pitch deck to woo investors.&nbsp; Those deemed to have a compelling product idea will be invited to interview for a 500 Startups (a Silicon Valley investment fund and business accelerator) cohort.</p>
<p>A new partnership between Amazon Web Services and edX sees the former <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/23/amazon-web-services-will-give-you-1000-in-credit-for-completing-these-edx-courses/?ncid=tcdaily">offering students $1,000 in credit</a> for completing one of two MITx courses on entrepreneurship.&nbsp; The credit can be spent on processor time and/or storage in Amazon&rsquo;s cloud.&nbsp; Recipients can also get credit for instructor-led training and web classes on using AWS, free premium support and &ldquo;office hours&rdquo; with Amazon specialists to help newbies set up their app or service for Amazon&rsquo;s instances.</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/01/12/coursera-expands-presence-in-china.aspx">Coursera is moving into China</a>, thanks to a new partnership with Hujiang which will see English language Coursera MOOCs hosted on the Hujiang education platform, giving Chinese users access to course materials, class activities and discussions in a familiar learning environment.&nbsp; Additional services will be available to help users' pronunciation, grammar and translation.&nbsp; Future plans include launching courses in Hujiang from popular Coursera instructors, as well as incorporating educational resources from Hujiang into the Coursera platform.</p>
<p>Berkeley is teaming with private partner Databricks to launch a <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/12/02/berkeley-launches-big-data-moocs.aspx">new edX MOOC focused on big data analysis</a> using the open source Apache Spark data processing engine.&nbsp; The first five-week course, Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark, will cover the application of data science techniques using parallel programming for big and small data, and will start on 23 Feb.</p>

<p><em>[BBC; Independent]</em></p>
<p>The UK's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30711724">first private medical school</a> has just opened at the University of Buckingham, with an initial intake of 67 students paying annual tuition fees of &pound;36,000.&nbsp; Contrary to expectations, 60% of applicants are from the UK, reflecting the fact that conventional medical courses are consistently over-subscribed.&nbsp; The course will last four and a half years (with a total cost of more than &pound;162,000) and will include a mix of clinical and biomedical science teaching, working with the Milton Keynes Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. &nbsp;COO, Prof John Clapham says he has been &ldquo;absolutely staggered&rdquo; by the initial interest and that demand was even higher for next year's entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new report by High Fliers Research claims the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30745839">UK graduate employment market</a> is at its most buoyant for 10 years.&nbsp; Key to success is undertaking work placements at the firm in question, with a third of jobs expected to be offered to graduates who have managed to do this.&nbsp; Conversely, those with no work experience are unlikely to be successful applicants and have &ldquo;little or no chance&rdquo; of receiving a job offer through graduate programmes, half of the recruiters said.</p>
<p>A request from HEPI for universities to provide details of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/top-universities-refuse-to-reveal-how-they-are-spending-tuition-fees-9958264.html">how they spend tuition fees</a> was met with a deafening silence from the majority, including almost all the of the country&rsquo;s most select universities.&nbsp; However, HEPI Director Nick Hillman &ndash; an adviser to the former Universities Minister David Willetts &ndash; said he believed they would be unable to convince MPs in future to lift the &pound;9,000-a-year cap on fees unless they were more open about their financing.</p>

<p><strong>Should YouTube Clips Replace Hour-Long Lessons?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Emma Piquemal]</em></p>
<p>According to Prof Sanjay Sarma, MIT&rsquo;s director of digital learning, educators should stop relying on one-hour lessons and opt instead for <a href="https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6455175">10-minute video lessons</a> to capture the &ldquo;wandering minds&rdquo; of their students.&nbsp; &ldquo;The way we teach today is based on lectures, which is still a factory-style system,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;[Young people] spend hours each week consuming 10- or 20-minute titbits about physics and history or whatever on YouTube or Khan Academy&hellip; It&rsquo;s not &lsquo;maybe this will be the future&rsquo; &ndash; it is the future. &nbsp;We just need to recognise it.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, not everyone agrees.&nbsp; Miles Berry, principal lecturer in computing education at the University of Roehampton, said that in-depth learning still had a place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Academic and professional success requires the ability to concentrate for extended periods of time and the mastery of complex ideas and arguments.&nbsp; Good schools do all they can to help their pupils develop a love of learning, whether it&rsquo;s online, from books or face-to-face.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Emerging Technologies and the Workplace </strong></p>
<p><em>[Cisco; Bentley University]</em></p>
<p>Cisco&rsquo;s 2014 <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise/connected-world-technology-report/cisco-2014-connected-world-technology-report.pdf">Connected World Technology Report</a> is based on recent surveys of 1,388 Gen Y (millennial) professionals (aged 18-30) and 1,524 Gen X professionals (aged 31-50) from 15 countries.&nbsp; Its 147 pages provide a detailed insight into attitudes to work, expectations of the workplace and preferences/use of technologies,.&nbsp; Even the <a href="http://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1528226">summary</a> is extensive, so here&rsquo;s a summary of that summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 40% of Gen X and Gen Y professionals consider themselves to be &ldquo;Supertaskers&rdquo; (able to do more than two things effectively at once)</li>
<li>60% of Gen X professionals think that Gen Y employees are able to perform tasks faster than older employees using mobile devices and apps</li>
<li>Gen X professionals are considered easier to manage than their younger counterparts; the greatest challenge when managing Gen Y employees is their &ldquo;I want it now&rdquo; ambition</li>
<li>More than half of Gen X and Gen Y professionals consider themselves accessible for work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week</li>
<li>Around half of professionals wish to work anywhere at any time.&nbsp; Most are not prepared to sacrifice salary for this but they believe organisations that offer it have a competitive advantage</li>
<li>If forced to choose, the majority of Gen Xs and Gen Ys would pick their smartphone over their television and 1 in 5 would rather be robbed of their wallet than their smartphone</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar research by Bentley University into <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/BentleyU/preparedu-the-millennial-mind-goes-to-work-41415813">millennial workplace preferences</a> tells us that, as you read this in Jan 15, one in three US employees will be a millennial.&nbsp; They are part of the always-on generation, with 77% preferring flexible working and 89% regularly checking work emails outside work; but they are not exclusively digital, with 51% preferring to communicate with others face-to-face at work.&nbsp; Nor are they job hoppers we might imagine: 80% expect to work for four or fewer organisations during their career and 16% hope to stay in their current job for life.&nbsp; But 35% admit to having a poor work ethic and 66% believe limiting social media usage at work would make workers more productive.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Aids Learning?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Faculty Focus]</em></p>
<p>As learning designers, we often assume we should be making learning as clear and painless as possible for our busy students.&nbsp; But Daniel Lemire suggests the opposite can be much more effective, and we should encourage learners to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek the most difficult problems</li>
<li>Reflect on what you have supposedly learned</li>
<li>Avoid learning from a single source</li>
</ul>
<p>He believes that, &ldquo;When studying, many people do not want to mix topics &lsquo;so as not to get confused&rsquo;. &nbsp;So if they need to learn to apply one particular idea, they study to the exclusion of everything else.&rdquo;&nbsp; The structure of most books and course materials (and lectures) supports this but students are often quite passive and are learning at a fairly surface level.&nbsp; He suggests <a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/12/30/how-to-learn-efficiently/">interleaved practice</a> (intentionally mixing up topics) is more effective, even though it may feel harder and confusing (&ldquo;If some learning activity feels easy, it means that it is too easy&rdquo;).&nbsp; This approach also better mirrors real life and the workplace because &ldquo;Interleaved practice is exactly what a real project forces you to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s another counterintuitive one: John Orlando suggests that <a href="http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/educational-assessment/praise-undermining-student-motivation/">too much praise</a> could be undermining student motivation and self-esteem.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing Can Aid Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS]</em></p>
<p>Two experiments reported in Contemporary Educational Psychology showed benefits gained by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X14000496">students who were asked to make drawings</a> (using a template) whilst assimilating new textual information about the biology of influenza.&nbsp; In experiment 1 (<em>N=</em>48), those who drew scored 61% on a multi-choice comprehension test, vs 44% for a control group.&nbsp; In experiment 2 (<em>N=</em>164), the scores were 63% vs 52%.&nbsp; Experiment 2 also included two other groups: one received pre-drawn images along with the text, yielding a mean post-test score of 53%; the other also received pre-drawn images and were asked to create their own (51%).&nbsp; These latter two conditions thus showed no notable gains over plain text, but the benefits of drawing over just reading were significant in both experiments.&nbsp; The researchers believe this &ldquo;&hellip;encourages learners to engage in generative cognitive processing during learning such as organising the relevant information into a coherent structure, and integrating it with relevant prior knowledge from long-term memory.&rdquo; &nbsp;However, they acknowledge that the study material involved a causal chain of events and so it is not clear if drawing could also help people learn other kinds of content.</p>

<p><strong>US Online HE Shows Little Growth but College Debts Show Big Growth</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Higher education researchers Eduventures predict that US online learning will grow in 2015 (but only modestly); more colleges and universities will test out competency-based assessment; and education technology will continue to expand as an industry, driven by investment capital. &nbsp;Eduventures expects just <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/01/07/2015-predictions-competency-based-ed-to-grow-debt-could-topple-some-schools.aspx">2% growth in online degree programmes</a>, dampened in part by the &ldquo;uncertainty and indecision&rdquo; of adult learners, and the number of new colleges entering the online market is expected to grow &ldquo;very little, if at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The company also noted that low interest rates are causing institutions to borrow more against the expectation that revenue from tuition, endowments, etc, will cover these debts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rating agencies, however, are not being fooled. &nbsp;Between 2009 and 2013, the number of credit rating downgrades at colleges rated by Moody's Investment Services outpaced upgrades by nearly five to one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Gender Gap in STEM Online Class Discussions</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>A study of 420,000 undergraduates and graduate students enrolled in STEM classes in the US and Canada found <a href="http://blog.piazza.com/stem-confidence-gap/">notable differences in male and female behaviour in online forums</a>.&nbsp; Whilst most students enrolled in classes that use online discussion tools <em>do</em> participate, women ask 23% more questions than do their male peers, but they answer 18% fewer.&nbsp; When women do answer, they are more likely than men to answer anonymously (39% vs 28%).&nbsp; At the &lsquo;top&rsquo; STEM universities (Berkeley, Stanford, Harvard and MIT) the male:female gap was greater than the institutional average.&nbsp; However, gender differences varied greatly by subject.&nbsp; While male computer science students answer 37% more questions than women, the difference is only 7% in humanities subjects and, in business and social sciences, women actually answer more questions than men (11% and 5%).</p>

<p>Further data from Gartner suggests that <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/01/05/tablet-sales-growth-to-continue-to-slow-in-2015.aspx">tablet sales will continue to slow</a> in 2015, with an estimated growth of around 8% to reach 233 million shipments for the year.&nbsp; Research director Ranjit Atwal suggests the drop is partly due to the lifetime of tablets being extended as they are shared out amongst family members and remain &lsquo;evergreen&rsquo; due to automatic software upgrades. &nbsp;Gartner forecasts the total device market (tablets, desktops, laptops, notebooks and mobile phones) growing by 3.9% this year to reach approximately 2.5 billion shipments.</p>

<p>Vital Source&rsquo;s Kent Freeman believes publishers are &ldquo;&hellip;fundamentally changing themselves from publishing organizations to software development houses&rdquo;, but Dian Schaffhauser considers whether the current breed of <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/12/03/whats-next-for-e-textbooks.aspx">e-textbooks</a> have really moved much beyond annotations, highlighting, glossaries and bookmarking.&nbsp; She discovers that:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/revel/">Pearson&rsquo;s REVEL</a> offers interactive exercises, infographics, social features, video segments and progress tracking</li>

This ensures that the focus is on the content he or she needs to learn, while simultaneously promoting long-term retention of material&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cengage.com/mindtap/">Cengage&rsquo;s MindTap</a> is an online system that assembles learning resources such as readings, multimedia, interactive activities and assessments into a &ldquo;learning path&rdquo; that guides each student through the curriculum as well as providing analytics to indicate &ldquo;engagement levels&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www1.flatworldknowledge.com/cbe">Flat World Knowledge</a> is developing a competency based adaptive learning platform that can provide content from multiple sources, social interaction, gamification/simulation, analytics and a proctored exam service that streams real-time video of students to a company that monitors for cheating</li>

<p>A team from Harvard Medical School compared <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-30574260">reading paper books and backlit e-readers before sleep</a>.&nbsp; They found that the latest e-readers which emit blue light (similar to smartphones, tablets and LED lighting) can slow or prevent the production of the sleep hormone melatonin, meaning users take longer to nod off and experience poorer quality sleep.&nbsp; However, original Kindles do not emit blue light and do not cause such problems.</p>

When orchestra director Luis Szaran and music teacher Favio Moran tried to set up a music program for the disadvantaged kids of Cateura, they soon ran out of instruments. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s when some enterprising parents started to make cellos from oil cans and pieces of wood, and saxophones from water pipes, spoons and buttons &ndash; and there&rsquo;s now an entire Recycled Orchestra.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our main goal isn't to form good musicians, but to form good citizens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A survey by <em>Which?</em> of 1000 UK undergrads found that a third thought <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30144416">their course was not good value for money</a> and around half felt it was not demanding enough or that seminars were generally worth attending.&nbsp; A fifth found an advertised module was no longer available or the content had significantly changed.&nbsp; Only half of those dissatisfied actually complained and 58% were dissatisfied with the response.&nbsp; <em>Which?</em> believes it should be easier to remove the degree-awarding powers of universities that fail to meet academic and consumer standards.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been slightly lukewarm about desktop virtual reality in the past (dating back to Superscape in 1996), but Donald Clark has experienced <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.ca/2014/11/oculus-rift-freezers-smilers-grippers.html">Oculus Rift</a> and is smitten or, as he puts it, &ldquo;Once you flood their field of view with a screen that has a high refresh rate with rock solid tracking so that your head movements mimic what would happen in that world, along with great audio &ndash; you&rsquo;re there. &nbsp;That new world is your reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TechCrunch is onboard too, and Kyle Russell considers some of the technology advances that mean <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/24/why-virtual-reality-is-happening-now/?ncid=tcdaily">we can deliver VR now</a> in ways that simply weren&rsquo;t possible/affordable just a few years ago.</p>
<p>But perhaps we don&rsquo;t need the expense of Oculus Rift.&nbsp; Could the future lie in your smartphone velcroed into <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/10/google-cardboard/">Google Cardboard VR</a>?</p>

<p><strong>2014 Learning Insights Report</strong></p>
<p><em>[Kineo]</em></p>
<p>City &amp; Guilds Kineo have published their latest <a href="http://resources.kineo.com/learning-insights-report-2014-download">Learning Insights Report: Adding Business Value Through Learning</a>, based on interviews with 35 directors and managers responsible for</p>
<p>learning in 29 different organisations.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, money was an issue, as was supporting (in many cases) a global 24/7 workforce, but the L&amp;D focus has also shifted: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about upskilling; it&rsquo;s transforming the business through learning&rdquo;.&nbsp; Organisations are deploying more blended and technology-enhanced solutions, and social/peer learning and support are becoming more significant.</p>

<p><strong>JISC Learning Analytics Report</strong></p>
<p><em>[Niall Sclater]</em></p>
<p>Niall Sclater has researched and written a &lsquo;state of the nation&rsquo; report, <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5657/1/Learning_analytics_report.pdf">Learning analytics: The current state of play in UK higher and further education</a>, based on interviews with 13 FEIs and HEIs, including the OU.&nbsp; He notes that analytics is in its relative infancy in the UK, meaning there is an almost pioneering spirit based on some generally perceived benefits, a great deal of enthusiasm, but little yet in the way of robust, tangible outcomes and surprisingly little commonality in terms of institutional goals, approaches, tools and systems.</p>
<p>Also available from JISC is a new <a href="http://sclater.com/blog/jisc-releases-report-on-ethical-and-legal-challenges-of-learning-analytics/">Code of practice for learning analytics: A literature review of the ethical and legal issues</a>, which aims to provide, &ldquo;the groundwork for a code of practice which is intended to help institutions solve the complex issues raised by learning analytics.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Mapping Student-Led Peer Learning in the UK</strong></p>
<p><em>[HEA]</em></p>
<p>A new HEA research report, <a href="https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/about/news/10209">Mapping student-led peer learning in the UK</a>, highlights the benefits of peer-led learning.&nbsp; Students who take part in peer-led learning sessions experience reduced anxiety associated with transition into higher education. They also have a greater sense of belonging and improved academic confidence.&nbsp; For students who undertake the role of 'peer leader', benefits include the acquisition of higher level personal and professional skills. Their own subject learning is deepened too, inter-cultural awareness is enhanced and employability prospects are greater.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; The Chronicle; Audrey Watters; EdSurge; University World News; Michel Wermelinger; IRRODL; Grainne Conole; Huff Post]</em></p>
<p>Yousef et al presented an excellent paper, <a href="https://oerknowledgecloud.org/sites/oerknowledgecloud.org/files/MOOCs - A Review of the State-of-the-Art.pdf">MOOCs: a Review of the State of the Art</a>, at CSEDU 2014.&nbsp; This was not the usual facts-and-figures look at MOOC students and their activities (welcome as those are) but a comprehensive analysis 84 peer reviewed papers generated over the past 5 years and a template analysis that categorised the research into 7 dimensions: MOOC concept, design, learning theories, case studies, business models, target groups, and assessment.&nbsp; They conclude that, far from being as radical as we have been led to believe, most MOOC implementations, &ldquo;still follow a top-down, controlled, teacher-centered, and centralized learning model.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prof Yoonil Auh, from South Korea&rsquo;s Kyung Hee University, also thinks that current MOOCs are a top-down way of achieving &ldquo;a one-way transfer of knowledge from the West to the rest&rdquo;.&nbsp; Now here comes <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20141105144147849">Collaborative MOOC 2.0</a>, wherein, &ldquo;Content will not have to be taken in a specific order but would be more like cafeteria-style modules that can be customised; only those modules taken that are needed for their community [sic].&rdquo;&nbsp; Auh also believes that, &ldquo;MOOC 2.0 technology is such that students can actually learn from each other and the MOOC is the facilitator.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that what c-MOOCs have been doing since 2008?</p>
<p>Maria Konnikova&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/moocs-failure-solutions">Will MOOCs be Flukes?</a> begins with a look back at the original aspirations of the OU to bring education to &ldquo;the tired, the poor, the huddled masses&rdquo;.&nbsp; MOOCs appeared to set off along a similar road but have somehow ended up driving through mainly white, middle class, well-educated neighbourhoods &ndash; and with most of the travellers alighting before reaching the final destination.&nbsp; She suggests we might learn some useful lessons from control theory &ndash; adjusting the content, sequence and break points according to past performance and other metrics.&nbsp; We should also not allow our concerns over dropouts to limit when and how much we test students which, if done well, invariably leads to more effective learning &ndash; a view shared in a separate Huff Post article by Jonathan Lash, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-lash/testblind-and-rigorous_b_6134924.html">Test-blind and rigorous</a>.</p>
<p>November&rsquo;s IRRODL contains a paper examining the <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1842/3065">employer potential of MOOCs</a>, based on a survey of 103 employers about their awareness of MOOCs (31% had heard of them) and their receptivity to using MOOCs in recruiting, hiring, and professional development. &nbsp;Once they understood what MOOCs were, 59% were receptive to using MOOCs for recruiting purposes, partly because of their subject matter (especially for software/technical skills) but also because they demonstrated attributes such as drive, motivation, time-management and willingness to self-develop (see also Donald Clark&rsquo;s similar comments about distance learning degrees from the <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/7-traits-of-online-graduates-that-trump.html">University of Herts</a>). &nbsp;Still more (83%) were using or would consider using MOOCs for professional development because they provide a convenient way to take a &ldquo;refresher course&rdquo; or &ldquo;stay up to date&rdquo; in their field, and also &ldquo;to take what they want&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In Jan of this year, Coursera launched its <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/coursera-expands-its-mooc-certificate-program/54915">Specializations certification programme</a> for students who pass multiple MOOCs.&nbsp; It has now announced an expansion of that programme &ndash; which requires learners to take Coursera&rsquo;s fee-based &ldquo;Signature Track&rdquo; courses &ndash; by adding 18 new Specializations.&nbsp; These are mostly practical, in-demand fields like project management, cloud computing, and data mining, and students who complete the sequences can expect to pay $100 to $300, depending on the number of courses.</p>
<p>In addition to Specializations, Dhawal Shah walks us through <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-10-15-how-does-coursera-make-money">how Coursera makes money</a>, starting with Career Services (Dec 12) which failed to take off with potential employers.&nbsp; Then came Signature Track (Jan 13) which generated $1m+ in its first nine months through students paying $30-100 for verified certification, and which he now estimates is raising around $1m per month.&nbsp; Finally, he looks at corporate collaborations, sponsorships, employee training and capstone projects &ndash; although the facts and figures relating to these are much less transparent.</p>
<p>Coursera is also exploring the possibility of offering online discussions with the university professors who teach its MOOCs. &nbsp;According to CEO Rick Levin, &ldquo;Down the road, we&rsquo;ll probably go to a premium layer that you could pay for that would give you <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/king-free-online-courses-may-soon-add-videochats-professors/">live interaction with a professor by video</a> or something like that &ndash; a seminar within a MOOC&rdquo;.</p>
<p>edX is hosting a free <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/free-online-ap-courses-debut-on-edx-web-site/2014/10/20/6b16c204-5883-11e4-b812-38518ae74c67_story.html">Advanced Placement course</a> in biology from Rice University &ndash; the first edX MOOC advertised as an AP course for high school students.&nbsp; Further AP courses are planned, with physics from Boston University, mechanics from MIT and electricity &amp; magnetism from Georgetown University all starting early in the new year.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://project.europeanmoocs.eu/moocs/">European Multiple MOOC Aggregator</a> (EMMA) is an EU-funded site that aims to provide a system for the delivery of MOOCs in multiple languages from different European universities &ldquo;to help preserve Europe&rsquo;s rich cultural, educational and linguistic heritage and to promote real cross-cultural and multi-lingual learning.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are 12 initial partners, including open universities from Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal.&nbsp; Although there are not many MOOCs available yet, of the ten I found, four related to eLearning and its design.</p>
<p>Katy Jordan has complied an impressive list of <a href="http://www.katyjordan.com/moocliterature/">MOOC research</a> dating back to 2009.&nbsp; There are still one or two technical limitations and it will rely on some community input, but it looks like a really useful resource.</p>
<p>Since its launch a year ago, Berlin-based MOOC provider <a href="https://iversity.org/pages/financing-round-in-the-millions">iversity</a> has attracted nearly 700,000 enrolments in 51 online courses, cooperated with more than 30 partners (mainly European universities) and attracted &euro;5m in venture capital investment.</p>
<p><a href="http://firstyear.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a> is also a year old and they&rsquo;ve published some key facts-and-figures in a nifty scrolling graphic.&nbsp; This tells us there are 133 course titles available from 44 partners, the most populous of which had 121,965 enrolees.&nbsp; There are over 650,000 registered FL users who&rsquo;ve signed up to 1.4m courses.&nbsp; And they&rsquo;ve cracked retention (22%).&nbsp; By counting it differently.</p>

<p><strong>Martin Bean Warns Universities Over Digital &lsquo;Irrelevance&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>In his final public speech as OU VC, Martin Bean warned those in the sector that, &ldquo;in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/bean-warns-universities-over-digital-irrelevance/2016842.article">students are demanding new, more engaging ways of teaching and learning</a>&rdquo;, and he cited some examples of retailers who ultimately suffered from failing to keep pace with evolving expectations.&nbsp; He also commented on the phenomenal pace of societal and technological change, noting that, &ldquo;If education doesn&rsquo;t keep up with this changing environment &hellip; we risk the sector becoming irrelevant and even irresponsible.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>[BBC; THE]</em></p>
<p>More than <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29649172">200 FE colleges now provide HE courses</a>, often with fees of &pound;7,500 or less.&nbsp; However, during recent inspections of 45 of these by the Quality Assurance Agency, 14 were classed as "requires improvement to meet expectations" or "does not meet expectations".</p>
<p>And writing in THE, Chris Rust questions <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/feature-are-uk-degree-standards-comparable/2016838.article">whether degree standards are compatible across all UK institutions</a>, claiming that, without a system for sharing assessment practice, it&rsquo;s nonsense to assume that a 2:1 is the same everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>Uncontrolled Expansion: How Private Colleges Grew</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>THE reports that new universities minister, Greg Clark, is being encouraged to welcome more private colleges into the sector, taking on the legacy left by David Willetts.&nbsp; Bypassing BPP and the University of Buckingham, the article takes a detailed look at the operation and funding of <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/uncontrolled-expansion-how-private-colleges-grew/2016579.article">Regent College</a>.&nbsp; For example, in 2013, Regent gained 70% of its students through one Romanian recruitment agent, whose Facebook page emphasised the availability of UK government grants and loans, urging students to &ldquo;share the good news with all your friends&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-million Pound Giving to Universities Increases </strong></p>
<p><em>[The Telegraph; BBC]</em></p>
<p>Figures from Coutts and the University of Kent show that, out of the ten largest donations made in the UK last year, 7 were received by HEIs, all worth at least &pound;30m.&nbsp; A total of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/11205282/Multi-million-pound-giving-to-universities-increases.html">33 universities received seven-figure donations</a> last year, and 11 institutions saw more than one donation of this size (e.g. 12 for Oxford and 7 for Cambridge).&nbsp; The largest single donation was a &pound;75m gift made to the University of Oxford from grant-making organisation, the McCall MacBain Foundation in Geneva.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29786836">a study of more than 2,300 billionaires</a> found that they were more likely to be graduates, a quarter have postgraduate degrees and more than 10% has a doctorate.&nbsp; In a listing of universities producing billionaires, elite US institutions take the top 9 places (headed by the U Penn, Harvard and Yale), followed by Mumbai in ninth and LSE in tenth &ndash; the only UK institution in the top 20. &nbsp;The most populous city for billionaires is New York, and more than 40% of billionaires in Europe live in just 10 cities, headed by Moscow and London.</p>

<p><strong>Mature Students: Lifelong Learning on Life Support?</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>In this THE article, Matthew Reisz talks to academics about their experiences of teaching older learners (they have life experience, broader knowledge, different perspectives and often have firmer political opinions), while Holly Else analyses the decline in the number of <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/mature-students-lifelong-learning-on-life-support/1/2016718.article">mature students</a>.&nbsp; At the OU, 90% of its 60,000 first-year undergraduates are aged 21 or over, but the UK as a whole has seen the number of mature students decline by about 150,000 since 2008/9 to about 290,000 in 2012/13, with the decrease being particularly acute in England.&nbsp; Birkbeck&rsquo;s Prof Claire Callender believes ELQ rules and part timers&rsquo; ineligibility for loans and maintenance grants to help with living costs have all contributed to this.</p>

<p><strong>Global Postgraduate Student Mobility Trends to 2024</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>A British Council report released last month, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20141009145454791">Postgraduate Student Mobility Trends to 2024</a>, estimates that India will have by far the most tertiary students in 2024 &ndash; 48 million against 37 million in China &ndash; but Chinese students are likely to be more mobile, with around 338,000 studying abroad compared to India&rsquo;s 209,000. &nbsp;America will continue to be the world&rsquo;s most popular student destination, with an increase of 154,000 students expected (to 407,000), followed by the UK with growth of 83,000 (to 241,000).&nbsp; According to the British Council&rsquo;s Zainab Malik, &ldquo;Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Pakistan will become key postgraduate markets by 2024, next to India and China&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Those predictions gained credibility this week with the release of figures from the US Council of Graduate Schools which showed that overall <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/files/2014/11/Intl_III_2014_report_final.pdf">international enrolment increased</a> by 8% this year.&nbsp; Enrolment by Indian students grew by 40% last year and 27% this year, but enrolment by Chinese students grew by just 5% last year (down from double digit growth in the past 7 years) and actually declined by 1% this year.&nbsp; Also notable was a 91% growth in enrolments in the US by Brazilian students.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Crowds: Learning and Social Media</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>A new e-book from Athabasca professors Jon Dron and Terry Anderson, <a href="http://news.athabascau.ca/au-press/teaching-crowds-book-online-learning/">Teaching Crowds: Learning and Social Media</a>, makes the case for an online learning model that places a high value on social media and the connections that technology can help to create.&nbsp; Teaching Crowds is about technologies that celebrate the creative partnering of human beings and harness the enormous amount of information on the web, and the authors argue that these technologies will soon challenge the traditional, institution-based approaches to education that we know so well.</p>

<p><strong>How Community Feedback Shapes User Behaviour</strong></p>
<p><em>[Andrew Cupples]</em></p>
<p>Interesting research from Stanford on <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/disqus-icwsm14.pdf">the effects of community feedback (comments, likes, etc) on web authors&rsquo; future behaviour</a>.&nbsp; By studying four large comment-based news communities, the researchers found that negative feedback leads to significant behavioural changes that are detrimental to the community in a number of respects.&nbsp; Firstly, authors of negatively-evaluated content actually go on to contribute more, but their future posts are perceived by the community to be of lower quality; these authors are also more likely to subsequently evaluate their fellow users negatively, percolating these effects through the community. &nbsp;In contrast, positive feedback neither encourages rewarded authors to write more, nor improves the quality of their posts.&nbsp; Finally, those authors that receive no community feedback are most likely to leave that community. &nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Technologies</em></p>
<ul>
<li>93% are using e-learning courses</li>
<li>86% are using live online learning such as virtual classrooms</li>
<li>80% are using an LMS/VLE</li>
<li>74% are using mobile devices for learning</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Content</em></p>
<ul>
<li>70% learn what they need to do their job from web searches</li>
<li>30% are creating micro-content (less than 10 minutes)</li>
<li>26% are investigating the use of MOOCs in corporate learning</li>
<li>14% encourage learners to share experiences and solve problems using online social media</li>
<li>12% have content curation strategies in place to help staff make sense of the resources available to them</li>

<p><strong>Skype Real Time Translation</strong></p>
<p><em>[Elliott Masie]</em></p>
<p>Microsoft Research demonstrated a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJIILew6l28">Skype speech to speech translator</a> at the recent WPC 2014 conference.&nbsp; The service combines speech-recognition, automatic-translation and machine-learning technologies to provide near real time translation, output in the form of synthetic audio and subtitles.&nbsp; The company hopes it will &ldquo;pave the way for a more personal and more human era of computing&rdquo; once it becomes widely available, and it is now offering a <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/skype-starts-offering-early-preview-translator-feature/">preview version</a>.&nbsp; The potential for some global learning scenarios surely makes this worthy of further investigation.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware Update</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; Campus Technology; Andrew McDermott]</em></p>
<p>Latest Q3 figures from Gartner show that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/15/tablet-sales-growth-plummets-in-2014-as-android-smartphones-continue-to-soar-gartner/">tablet sales in 2014 will only see 11% growth</a> over last year, compared to growth of 55% the year before.&nbsp; This means around 229 million tablets are expected to ship in 2014, equivalent to 9.5% of overall worldwide device sales (phones, tablets, desktops) of 2.4 billion devices for the year.&nbsp; Around 51% of all devices sold this year have or will be running Android.</p>
<p>IDC reports that Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/07/mac-achieves-highest-u-s-pc-market-share-ever-in-q3-2014-according-to-idc/">Mac marketshare hit record highs</a> during Q3 2014, with shipments up by 12.9% from Q3 2013 to 2.34 million (13.4% market share).</p>
<p>Gartner predicts that worldwide shipments of <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/10/27/3d-printer-shipments-to-double-each-year-through-2018.aspx">3D printers</a> will more than double each year between now and 2018, when it projects sales of the devices to top 2.3 million.&nbsp; The rise will be fuelled by the increasing availability of good quality sub-$1000 models.</p>
<p>And a new study from ABI Research, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/10/27/report-wearable-interfaces-to-become-increasingly-sensor-based-over-next-5-years.aspx">Mobile Device User Interface Innovation</a>, suggests that mobile and wearable devices will start to rely less on screen-based user interfaces and increasingly on proximity sensors, voice, gesture, eye-tracking, GPS, GNSS and other input methods.&nbsp; Take a look at Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/#project">Project Tango</a> if you want to see where this might be taking us.</p>

<p><strong>OER Use Growing</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>A Babson/Pearson survey of 2,144 faculty members found that around <a href="http://onlinelearningsurvey.com/oer.html">two-thirds say they are unaware of OERs</a>. However, more than 34% say they are regularly or occasionally using OERs as teaching resources, with images and video topping the list.&nbsp; Searching for OERs is easy or very easy (60%) although the absence of a single comprehensive catalogue of resources is seen as a barrier by more than half.</p>

<p><strong>If Learners Live Online, Teachers and Textbooks Must Follow Them</strong></p>
<p><em>[Pete Mitton]</em></p>
<p>The title seems to say it all, but David White&rsquo;s article in <a href="http://theconversation.com/if-learners-live-online-teachers-and-textbooks-must-follow-them-32478">The Conversation</a> also cautions that &lsquo;online&rsquo; is not the same as &lsquo;social&rsquo; and that, &ldquo;Irrespective of how digitally savvy they think they are, most people will spend the majority of their time browsing online content before walking away without leaving a social trace.&rdquo;&nbsp; He refers to the difference between <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/projects/visitorsandresidents.aspx">&lsquo;visitors&rsquo; and &lsquo;residents&rsquo;</a> &ndash; the subject of a JISC research project that can help universities explore the relationship between institutional and online cultures.</p>

<p><strong>Putin&rsquo;s Friend Profits in Purge of Schoolbooks</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>NYT reports that, when the Russian school year began a couple of months ago, the number of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/world/europe/putins-friend-profits-in-purge-of-schoolbooks.html">approved textbooks</a> for Russia&rsquo;s 43,000 schools and 14 million schoolchildren had been slashed by more than half due to a series of bureaucratic purges.&nbsp; However, it was notable that one company, Enlightenment (previously the sole provider of school textbooks under Soviet rule), seemed to have emerged unscathed.&nbsp; The fact that the company is chaired by Arkady Rotenberg, a judo sparring partner from Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s St Petersburg youth, must surely just be a coincidence?</p>

<p><strong>Focus on &hellip; Students and Technology</strong></p>
<p><em>[JISC; University World News; Business Insider; Campus Technology; Stephen Downes; BBC; Pete Mitton]</em></p>
<p>Exact definitions of Generation X (born around 1960-80) and Generation Y/Millennials (1980-2000), seem to vary &ndash; but we know they will have had differing exposure to and experiences of online technologies.&nbsp; However, there is increasing evidence that their attitudes, expectations and levels of competence do not necessarily accord with our assumptions that younger people will be happy for their higher education to be social, hi-tech and online.</p>
<p>JISC&rsquo;s Digital Student project has released <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5600/1/STUDENT_EXPECTATIONS_SCHOOLS.pdf">Incoming expectations of the digital environment formed at school</a>, which examines what students entering HE expect from digital technologies.&nbsp; There is no formal summary but a useful list can be found in the Appendix (p17) which tells us new starters&rsquo; expectation include: fast web access, BYOD, good quality digital information (VLE and elsewhere), knowledgeable staff and training in &lsquo;how to use the Web for learning&rsquo;.&nbsp; They would also appreciate video lecture capture but do not expect the institution to engage with them in Social Media.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC Analysis</strong></p>

<p>Are many MOOCs <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-mooc-where-everybody-learned/54571">only fit for those who are already well educated</a>?&nbsp; MIT researchers analysed data from an edX course on Newtonian Mechanics and found that students who had spent significant time on the course showed evidence of learning no matter what their educational background.&nbsp; The MOOC students also learned at a similar rate to those MIT students who had taken the on-campus version of the course &ndash; which included study in small groups for four hours a week and regular access to their professors.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2014/09/15/what-ubc-has-learned-about-doing-moocs/">University of British Columbia</a> has analysed the first 5 courses in its MOOC Pilot. A total of 330,150 learners signed up, 164,935 (50%) of whom logged in at least once, 12,031 (3.6%) took a final exam and 8,174 (2.5%) earned course certificate.&nbsp; Based on the figures provided by UBC, Tony Bates estimates production costs at around $54,000 per MOOC, excluding faculty time and co-ordination support, but including academic assistance. &nbsp;A total of 305 videos were produced, with a combined duration of 65 hours, and over 1,000 quiz questions.</p>
<p>U Penn has been offering MOOCs through Coursera for around 2 years, with over 2m learners registering.&nbsp; A recent study analysed the movement of 1m online pupils through <a href="http://thepenngazette.com/course-evaluation-mooc-edition/">16 Penn courses</a>, finding that persistence is a rare commodity. &nbsp;Completion rates averaged 4% across all the courses, although those with lighter workloads fared better at around 6%.&nbsp; However, variables such as course length and the availability of &ldquo;live chat&rdquo; made no statistically significant difference to retention.</p>

<p>However, smartwatch growth may be at the expense of <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/09/30/ipad-declines-as-samsung-lenovo-tablets-push-forward.aspx">tablet sales</a>, which ABI Research reports will slow to a &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; 2.5% for 2014 and fail to hit the 200 million unit milestone.&nbsp; iPad sales have fallen by13% so far this year, although Samsung's tablet shipments have increased by 26% in the first half of 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on &hellip; e-Reading</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; The Chronicle; Campus Technology; Publishers Weekly]</em></p>
<p>Defining an accurate student position on learning from print vs screen is fraught with danger.&nbsp; For start, &lsquo;on-screen&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean now what it used to (i.e. probably a vertical 17&rdquo; monitor placed a couple of feet away on a desk), and many of the headline facts and figures for e-books refer more to sequential reading of fiction than studying from textbooks.&nbsp; OU surveys tell us that around 95% of our students, &ldquo;enjoy learning through reading printed text&rdquo; but only around 50% &ldquo;enjoy learning through reading text online&rdquo;.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t ask the question but presumably those figures relate to &lsquo;dense&rsquo; text rather than reading shorter activities, quiz questions, forum posts, etc.&nbsp; We might also presume that those who love print also benefit occasionally being able to search or copy/paste from electronic text (but may not necessarily regard this as &ldquo;enjoyable&rdquo;).&nbsp; So, what other relevant evidence is there to help us assess the situation?</p>
<p>Stavanger University&rsquo;s Anne Mangen conducted a study comparing reading an &lsquo;upsetting&rsquo; short story on paper and on iPad, in which she found that paper readers reported higher measures of empathy and immersion than iPad readers. &nbsp;In a more recent study, 25 participants read a 28-page story on a Kindle, and 25 read the same story in print.&nbsp; They were then tested on aspects of the story including objects, characters and settings, revealing that performance was largely similar, except when it came to the timing of events in the story.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Kindle readers performed significantly worse on the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/19/readers-absorb-less-kindles-paper-study-plot-ereader-digitisation">plot reconstruction</a> measure, ie, when they were asked to place 14 events in the correct order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prof Naomi Baron bemoans <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/How-E-Reading-Threatens/147661/">a growing reluctance on the part of students to read long-form text in any format</a>, suggesting that e-readers and tablets have made matters worse &ndash; they may be fine for novels, but not for text we intend to &ldquo;muse over or reread&rdquo;.&nbsp; She surveyed university students in the US, Germany and Japan, finding that, if cost was not a factor, &ldquo;If a text is long, 92 percent would choose hard copy. For shorter texts, it&rsquo;s a toss-up.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is also the attendant distraction factor, with 85% of US students indicating they were likely to multitask when reading on-screen, compared to just 26% while reading in print (and there is evidence that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254?np=y">multitasking</a> &ldquo;poses a significant distraction&rdquo; to academic performance).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xconomy reports that educational publishers are moving much more into <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2014/08/04/as-book-prices-drop-big-publishers-push-into-software-and-edtech/">interactive e-books</a> as potential sources of profit and Pew Internet research tells us that 37% of US adults aged 18-29 <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/09/10/younger-americans-and-public-libraries/">have read an e-book in the past year</a>.&nbsp; In a recent survey of 500 US students sponsored by e-book supplier <a href="http://www.vitalsource.com/pressreleases/Pages/Fourth-Annual-Wakefield-Survey-Cites-Cost-of-College-Technology-Innovation-as-Top-Trends-in-Higher-Education.aspx">Vital Source</a>, 62% stated that they have used interactive textbooks with features such as video, audio and quizzes, and 67% say their professors frequently recommend they purchase the e-text versions of textbooks and other course materials.&nbsp; The top benefit (31% of students) is that these make lessons easier to understand; 23% say they help them complete assignments more quickly and 21% believe they help them stay more organized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Textbook price comparison site CampusBooks found that nearly half of the 1,072 US undergraduates they surveyed had been assigned an e-textbook for a course. &nbsp;However, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/08/25/facebook-still-lures-students-and-etextbooks-dont-make-them-uniformly-happy.aspx">only 44% were very or somewhat happy</a> using an e-book, with 39% very or somewhat unhappy. The researchers noted that reported dissatisfaction with e-books appears to rise as students progress through school but, despite this, adoption also increases &ndash; probably for financial reasons.&nbsp; The survey also asked how students take notes in class. Around 90% use paper and 35% use a laptop, but only 9% append the textbook itself, possibly mindful of the potential textbook resale market in the US.&nbsp; But Mueller &amp; Oppenheimer caution against taking notes on laptops because it <a href="http://adifference.blogspot.ca/2014/09/are-laptops-really-bad-for-learning.html">results in shallower processing</a> due to a tendency to transcribe verbatim, whereas those students who took notes longhand tend to process information and reframe it in their own words &ndash; leading to better performance in conceptual question tests.</p>
<p>And, in a <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/63225-college-students-prefer-a-mix-of-print-and-digital-textbooks.html#path/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/63225-college-students-prefer-a-mix-of-print-and-digital-textbooks.html">Hewlett Packard</a> online survey of 527 college students, 57% said they preferred print materials to e-books when studying.&nbsp; When citing reasons for their preference, 54% cited &ldquo;ease of use&rdquo; and 35% &ldquo;note-taking ability&rdquo; as a reason for preferring print.&nbsp; Only 6% favoured e-books for their note-taking ability and 5% for their interactivity (which, we&rsquo;re often led to believe, is the holy grail of e-book design).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, regardless of preferences and opinions, what about actual learning effectiveness?&nbsp; In a recent study, <a href="http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/eds/detail/detail?vid=5&sid=480ac1d9-99bb-4cda-b195-b72645f87007@sessionmgr110&hid=106&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#db=psyh&AN=2013-27035-011">Margolin et al (2013)</a> invited ninety participants read five factual and five fiction 500-word passages of text.&nbsp; Thirty read from A4 paper, 30 used a Kindle and 30 read PDFs on a PC.&nbsp; All scored around 75% in MCQ comprehension tests, regardless of medium/device.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; The Chronicle; Audrey Watters; The Boston Globe; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Stanford&rsquo;s Prof John Mitchell welcomes the impact that MOOCs have had on the world of education over the past couple of years but he fears <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/moocs-are-free-but-for-how-much-longer/2015204.article">they may not remain free for too much longer</a>.&nbsp; This is for obvious economic reasons relating to the costs of development and support, but also for practical ones such as abating high drop-out rates.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the issues we have with MOOCs is that it can be very difficult to set up successful group projects when people keep leaving the course,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe if there&rsquo;s payment or an application process or courses targeted at a particular community we will have less attrition and more cohesion in the group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how confident can we be that students will pay even modest fees?&nbsp; Australia&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.afr.com/p/national/education/une_shuts_down_its_loss_making_moocs_ZQoeYL6tucYL6h5TJTAXBI">University of New England</a> (UNE) has shut down its pioneering pay-for MOOC because it could not make it pay.&nbsp; Whilst the basic online courses were free, students were required to pay A$495 to do an exam, A$35 an hour for a group tutorial and A$150 an hour for private tutoring.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a very good experiment for us but it was an experiment,&rdquo; said vice-chancellor, Prof Annabelle Duncan.&nbsp; &ldquo;While MOOCs will continue to be offered I am sure by some of the very big providers around the world it&rsquo;s not something that a university like UNE would go at alone,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Sebastian Thrun solved Udacity&rsquo;s economic conundrum by &lsquo;selling out&rsquo;, whereas Coursera remains largely free apart from the $50 Signature Track fee students can pay to take verified exams and earn a certificate of completion.&nbsp; However, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2014/08/20/courseras-new-goal-teaching-at-firms-such-as-mastercard/">Coursera is now also embarking on paid partnerships</a> with organisations such as MasterCard, AT&amp;T and Shell, as they seek content for employee training and development.&nbsp; At MasterCard, for example, a course on web applications has been offered to 2,500 employees, whilst a behavioural economics class taught by Duke professor Dan Ariely has been offered to 300 marketing staff.</p>
<p>An interesting new take on dropout rates comes from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/10/coursera-president-daphne-koller-2014-is-the-year-moocs-will-come-of-age/">Coursera&rsquo;s Daphne Koller</a>, who claims that, of the people who actually aim to finish the course, 70% do so.&nbsp; In an interview at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference earlier this month, she also flagged a move towards more self-directed learning, and classes that have less rigid (and distant) start dates &ndash; Coursera has found that if a course starts within a week of a student enrolling, engagement doubles. &nbsp;And how do employers regard MOOCs?&nbsp; Koller noted that around 70% of students with a Coursera credential list it on their LinkedIn profile, and she believes that around 60-70% of employers would look at the credential of an applicant favourably.</p>
<p>edX is expanding its reach beyond HE and has begun offering <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/09/09/online-education-company-edx-expanding-offer-free-courses-aimed-high-school-students/wWdR6XQakRKIxAhaH580ZP/story.html">26 courses geared toward high school students</a>.&nbsp; The courses were created by 14 institutions &ndash; including MIT, Georgetown and Rice universities, the University of California and Boston University &ndash; and will cover subjects including computer science, calculus, geometry, algebra, English, physics, biology, chemistry, Spanish, French, history, statistics, and psychology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/09/04/online-education-platform-edcast-puts-universities-charge-their-content">EdCast</a> is the latest new kid on the block, with aspirations to be simultaneously massive and intimate, private and public.&nbsp; It is essentially a service provider built on top of Open edX code, and a first example of what an EdCast product may look like comes from the UN-backed Sustainable Development Solutions Network &ndash; which has more than 200 university and organizational members and now has its own online education portal, SDSN.edu.&nbsp; EdCast EdCast claims to be finalising deals with &ldquo;dozens&rdquo; of groups of institutions, the number of which &ldquo;may total in the hundreds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A FutureLearn MOOC offering <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29157037">English language lessons</a> from the British Council has attracted over 100,000 registrations from students in 178 countries.&nbsp; Spain accounts for the biggest group of students but there are also large groups from the UK, Burma, Russia, Colombia, China, Vietnam and India &ndash; and around a third of these are studying via mobile phones.</p>
<p>The Indian Institute of Technology and the Commonwealth of Learning have teamed up to offer a novel MOOC that is focused on the design of the course itself. &nbsp;The four-week <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140903154113518">MOOC on MOOCs: What you need to know about massive open online courses</a> is aimed at addressing the nuts and bolts of designing and running a MOOC.</p>

<p><strong>Majority of Scottish Academics Set to Vote &lsquo;No&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; BBC]</em></p>
<p>A survey by THE suggests that a majority of Scottish academics are set to vote &lsquo;no&rsquo; in <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/majority-of-scottish-academics-set-to-vote-no-in-referendum/2015688.article">this week&rsquo;s independence referendum</a> (54.8% vs 41.2%).&nbsp; However, there are some notable splits in intentions when viewed by specialism (STEM = 69% &lsquo;No&rsquo;; humanities = 44% &lsquo;No&rsquo;) and region (e.g. Glasgow = 39% &lsquo;No&rsquo;; Dundee = 77% &lsquo;No&rsquo;).</p>
<p>However, according to 1,048 young people (16-17) who attended the BBC's Big Debate in Glasgow, 97% of them thought <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29158556">tuition fees was the most important issue</a> to them, followed by the economy (94%), currency (88%), welfare (88%) and pensions (84%).</p>

<p><strong>Labour Proposes Technical Universities</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; Stephen Downes; edsurge; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>Shadow universities minister Liam Byrne is calling for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-28952647">technical universities</a> to be created as part of a blueprint to reshape the HE system to support a hi-tech, high-income economy.&nbsp; These would offer more options for young people than traditional degree courses; they would operate in partnership with industry and would support local enterprise zones.&nbsp; &ldquo;We've got to build a bigger knowledge economy, home to better-paid jobs and open to anyone with talent, no matter whether they want an academic or a technical path in life,&rdquo; said Mr Byrne.&nbsp; He called for there to be a &ldquo;variety of ladders&rdquo; into HE, including &ldquo;learn-while-you-earn&rdquo; courses which would allow people to upgrade their skills while still working.</p>
<p>The need for such an approach is supported by evidence from the Manpower Group, whose <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/08/employers-arent-just-whining-the-skills-gap-is-real/">Talent Shortage Survey</a> surveyed 38,000 employers worldwide, finding that 35% reported difficulty in filling jobs due to lack of suitable and available talent.&nbsp; McKinsey estimates that the number of skillsets needed in the workforce increased from 178 in Sep 09 to 924 in Jun 12 and the US National Center for Education Statistics projects that by 2020, <a href="http://www.christenseninstitute.org/publications/hire/">42% of all college students will be 25 years of age or older</a> as more working adults seek to develop new skills for the rapidly emerging new technologies and jobs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2014/Q3/daniels-awards-prize-for-competency-based-degree-to-purdue-polytechnic-institute.html">Purdue University&rsquo;s Polytechnic Institute</a> has been awarded $500,000 to create a new cross-disciplinary bachelor's degree based on demonstrated mastery of concepts and skills rather than performance measured only at fixed calendar intervals of classroom time.&nbsp; According to Purdue President Mitch Daniels, the course, &ldquo;will allow students to move as fast as their ability and diligence will permit, reducing their time to degree and their costs as they do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>What Will a Liberal Arts Education Look Like in 50 Years?</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>The great and the good at this year&rsquo;s Aspen Ideas Festival were asked <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/376014/what-will-a-liberal-arts-education-look-like-in-50-years">what will a liberal arts education look like in 50 years?</a>&nbsp; Sebastian Thrun expects that education will move beyond the constraints of those bright college years towards lifelong learning, and Howard Gardner thinks, &ldquo;We won't have liberal arts and sciences at all 50 years from now unless we really understand how to save what's good, but reinvent what's new and needed&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Horizon Report &ndash; Library Edition</strong></p>

<p>The Library-flavoured <a href="http://cdn.nmc.org/media/2014-nmc-horizon-report-library-EN.pdf">2014 NMC Horizon Report</a> has just been published.&nbsp; It looks at developments, trends and challenges affecting adoption of technology for academic and research libraries &ndash; grouping challenges into what it describes as &lsquo;solvable&rsquo; (e.g. rethinking roles and skills), &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; (alternative avenues of discovery) and &lsquo;wicked&rsquo; (interoperability).</p>
<p>The Guardian brings news that Florida Polytechnic University's new 11,000 square-foot <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/29/bookless-library-new-us-university-florida-polytechnic-digital">library contains not a single physical book</a>.&nbsp; Instead, students will have access to around 135,000 e-books.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have access to print books through the state university system's interlibrary loan program.&nbsp; However, we strongly encourage our students to read and work with information digitally,&rdquo; said director of libraries, Kathryn Miller.</p>
<p>And latest research from Pew Internet shows that younger Americans do not necessarily regard <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/09/10/younger-americans-and-public-libraries/">libraries and books</a> with the disdain we might sometimes expect.&nbsp; Despite their embrace of technology (98% of those under 30 use the internet), 62% of agree there is &ldquo;a lot of useful, important information that is <em>not</em> available on the internet,&rdquo; compared with 53% of older Americans. &nbsp;And 88% of Americans under 30 read a book in the past year, compared with 79% of those age 30 and older.</p>

<p>A ComScore report shows that <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/publishers-concentrate-mobile-web-apps/">time spent on mobile devices</a> increased by 24% from Jun 13&ndash;Jun 14.&nbsp; However, the bulk of theis growth was fuelled more by app usage (+52%) than mobile Web (+17%).&nbsp; In the US, only three news-related apps &ndash; Yahoo Stocks, Yahoo Weather and The Weather Channel &ndash; made the top 25 mobile apps, with the remainder being social platforms (Facebook, Snapchat, Pinterest, etc), utilities (Google Maps, Google search), entertainment (YouTube, Pandora, Netflix) and commerce-related (Amazon). &nbsp;Seven percent of smartphone users generate nearly half of all app downloads and 65.5% of users don&rsquo;t download any new apps each month.</p>

<p><strong>e-Book Prices Continue to Rise</strong></p>
<p><em>[DBW; The Daily Finance; EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>Digital Book Wire reports that the <a href="http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2014/average-price-of-an-ebook-best-seller-on-the-rise/">average price of best selling e-books</a> continues on the steady upward trajectory that began last Christmas (from about $5.50 to around $8 last month).&nbsp; DBW believes this is largely due to the effects of Amazon&rsquo;s <em>Kindle First</em> and <em>Kindle Unlimited</em> services.</p>
<p>But not to worry, a free daily e-mail service from <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/on/bookbub-cheap-free-ebooks-best-deals">BookBub</a> highlights deeply discounted books and, unlike Amazon's Deals, offers bargains for users across all major reader platforms, including the iPad, Kindle, Sony and Nook. &nbsp;It also allows users to select books across 17 different genres (rather than Amazon&rsquo;s four).&nbsp; BookBub already has a million subscribers.</p>
<p>Jose Ferriera bemoans the <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-08-10-oer-and-the-future-of-publishing">low production values</a> and weak instructional design evident in some OER e-books.&nbsp; But David Wiley reminds us of a recent article in Educause Review describing Mercy College&rsquo;s change from a commercial maths textbook and online practice system &#40;~$180 per student&#41;, to an <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-08-19-oer-or-traditional-textbooks-look-at-learning-outcomes-per-dollar">OER e-book and open source online practice system</a>.&nbsp; Over 18 months, the maths pass rate increased from 48.4% to 68.9% and the savings to students amounted to $125,000 the first year.</p>

<p><strong>Tentative Transitions of US Graduates into Work</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>Government statistics from many countries show that those <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Lets-Ask-More-of-Our/148559">workers with degrees tend to reap the benefits</a> with higher salaries over the longer term.&nbsp; However, a recent study followed approximately 1,000 US students for two years after graduation to document their successes and failures &ndash; revealing a more sobering picture.&nbsp; Two years after graduation, 23% were either unemployed or underemployed (working fewer than 20 hours per week or in jobs where the majority of workers had not completed even a year of college), and less than half had full-time jobs that paid $30,000 or more per year.&nbsp; Three quarters reported receiving continued financial assistance from parents and 24% were still living at home.</p>

<p>A new forecast from IDC predicts that <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/09/04/phablet-sales-to-top-mobile-laptops-this-year-tablets-in-2015.aspx">global sales of phablets</a> (smartphones with screens between 5&frac12;&rdquo;&ndash;7&rdquo;) will hit 175 million in 2014, slightly ahead of sales of portable PCs.&nbsp; Further growth is expected in 2015, when predicted phablet sales of 318 million will comfortably exceed those of tablets (estimated at 233 million).</p>
<p>Toshiba has launched its new <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/toshibas-encore-mini-tablet-runs-windows-8-1-and-is-just-119">Encore Mini tablet</a>.&nbsp; For just $119, users will get Windows 8.1 running on an Intel Atom quad-core CPU with a 7&rdquo; (1024x600) display, 16GB of storage, a microSD card slot, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, accelerometers, front- and rear-facing cameras and a 7hr battery life.&nbsp; The spec is not to-die-for, but the price is.</p>
<p>All the evidence and predictions over the past 12 months or so suggested that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/23/why-are-pcs-up-and-tablets-down">PC sales were on the wane</a> as we all started to become more mobile.&nbsp; However, more recent figures suggest that may not be the case.&nbsp; Peter Yared believes the reason is that tablets have not evolved at a sufficient rate to make people desperate to replace their old models.&nbsp; He suggests that, with the consumer market becoming more saturated, the greatest potential growth is in the business sector &ndash; and those users are waiting for the emergence of &lsquo;super tablets&rsquo; (e.g. 13&rdquo; screen, keyboard, 256GB storage) before they&rsquo;ll get their corporate chequebooks out.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on &hellip; Video for learning</strong></p>
<p>In my 2010 EdD research, e-learning participants (<em>n</em>=80) expected video material to be more appealing and effective than audio or text, but these expectations were not borne out by their test scores or opinions afterwards.&nbsp; Video can be expensive, so why does it sometimes not deliver what we expect?&nbsp; Whilst there are many differences between MOOCs and full-fat higher education, it seems reasonable to assume that student attitudes to video content will be similar in both.&nbsp; The recent publication of an analysis of <a href="http://pgbovine.net/publications/edX-MOOC-video-production-and-engagement_LAS-2014.pdf">How Video Production Affects Student Engagement</a> is based on data from over 6.9 million video watching sessions across four edX courses.&nbsp; The researchers focused on just two genres: &lsquo;tutorials&rsquo; (e.g. some form of problem-solving walkthrough) and &lsquo;lectures&rsquo;, and they defined engagement in terms of (a) time spent watching and also (b) &ldquo;whether a student attempted the follow-up problem within 30 minutes after watching a video&rdquo;.&nbsp; Key findings and recommendations to emerge were as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>.&nbsp; Shorter clips are generally better.&nbsp; Student levels of engagement are greatest for videos up to 3 mins duration and drop sharply after 6 mins.</li>
<li><strong>Re-watching</strong>.&nbsp; Students are likely to watch less (2-3 mins) of a tutorial video but are much more likely to re-watch and jump to relevant parts of longer clips, so signposting (hyperlinks or visual cues such as captions) is important.&nbsp; Because lectures often tend to present more conceptual information, students are more likely to watch for longer but less likely to re-watch.</li>
<li><strong>Personal</strong>.&nbsp; Many F2F academics prefer to make classroom lecture videos but students prefer a more intimate head to camera format with eye contact, some personal stories and gentle humour.</li>
<li><strong>Tutorial style</strong>.&nbsp; Khan-style videos, with the instructor drawing on a tablet and narrating, were found to be more engaging than screencasts or narrated PowerPoints.&nbsp; If these latter genres must be used, they can be enhanced by occasionally editing-in head shots of the speaker.</li>
<li><strong>Speaking rate</strong>.&nbsp; A speaking rate of around 160wpm is traditionally recommended for lecturing but, for clips up to 6 mins, students were equally engaged by faster rates (conveying academic enthusiasm) and slower ones (often due to writing on the board).&nbsp; However, for longer clips, &gt;180wpm was preferred, and 160wpm was actually found to be the <em>least</em> engaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare this with a smaller EDUCAUSE study of <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/what-makes-online-instructional-video-compelling">What Makes an Online Instructional Video Compelling</a>, which found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average view duration was 4 mins</li>
<li>Videos were more likely to be watched if the topic related to an upcoming assessment</li>
<li>Conversational language was preferred, as was humour and drawing on past experiences</li>
<li>Content should exploit the medium of video, not just convey information students could read as text</li>
<li>Good quality production values (e.g. sound, lighting, framing and graphics) imply credible pedagogic content</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://jolt.merlot.org/vol10no2/draus_0614.pdf">Draus, Curran and Trempus</a> (2014) examined the impact of instructor-generated video on student satisfaction (by survey), engagement (by forum posts) and performance (by scores and persistence) &ndash; having previously received feedback that bi-weekly narrated PowerPoints were "brief," "dry," and "not very helpful".&nbsp; Their pattern of a video course introduction, weekly video lectures, video discussions, and video advice on assignments and specific topics collectively resulted in a high degree of perceived value from students, grades increased by 3.2% and increases in the number and length of student discussion postings.</p>

<p>Google is offering a free course on Udacity &ndash; <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.ca/2014/07/learn-to-think-like-android-developer.html">Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals</a>.&nbsp; It aims to provide those with some basic programming knowledge with everything they need to learn how to make an Android app step-by-step, through a mixture of course materials, videos, quizzes and forums.&nbsp; The basics are available for free, whereas those subscribing at $150/month get additional support, projects and certification.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is expected to launch an <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/07/16/edx-partners-with-saudi-arabia-on-mooc-portal-women-youth-disabled-and-rural-citizens.aspx">edX Arab portal</a> next month that should, &ldquo;bridge the gap between education and employment&rdquo; across the region by providing women, youth, disabled people and those in rural communities with access to, &ldquo;courses licensed from edX university members and translated into Arabic, as well as original courses developed exclusively for Arabic-speaking students&rdquo;.&nbsp; The multi-year collaboration will also provide support to Saudi instructors and include &ldquo;a research component focused on learning through innovative technologies and R&amp;D,&rdquo; according to edX.</p>
<p>Speaking at last month&rsquo;s CT Conference, edX CEO, Anant Agarwal, said <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/07/31/edx-ceo-it-is-pathetic-that-the-education-system-has-not-changed-in-hundreds-of-years.aspx">it was &ldquo;pathetic&rdquo; that classrooms today still look like they did decades ago</a>.&nbsp; Despite oft-discussed issues such as retention rates, he firmly believed in the success and future potential of MOOCs, stating that edX offers, &ldquo;a federated, decentralized approach to spread education around the world&rdquo;.&nbsp; He also noted that the 155,000 students who participated in the first edX course on circuits and electronics exceeded the total number of alumni of MIT in history, and that the 7,200 who passed the course are more than the total number of students he will ever teach in his career at MIT.</p>
<p>The Chronicle reports on how a Coursera MOOC, &ldquo;Foundations of Teaching and Learning&rdquo;, has achieved success in <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/can-you-really-teach-a-mooc-in-a-refugee-camp/54191">teaching refugees near the Kenya-Somalia border</a>.&nbsp; Some adaptations were required &ndash; such as downloading lecture videos and quizzes to a USB drive &ndash; and the 2 students were closely supported by the University of Geneva&rsquo;s Prof Barbara Moser-Mercer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Meeting Coursera&rsquo;s requirements for a certificate made things harder, with the students taking quizzes that were monitored via webcam &ndash; a &ldquo;hugely complicated&rdquo; undertaking under the circumstances. &nbsp;There were cultural and linguistic challenges too, especially when it came to peer grading. &nbsp;Ms. Moser-Mercer texted back and forth with the students, but she said she was careful not to provide more help than she was allowed to under Coursera&rsquo;s honour code.</p>

<p>Last month the US Dept of Education announced <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/07/16/331700270/students-react-to-the-closure-of-a-giant-for-profit-college">a review of how federal student aid is administered</a> for University of Phoenix&rsquo;s 200,000+ students.&nbsp; In June, the department halted funding to another big for-profit, Corinthian, leading it to announce plans to sell or close all of its campuses.&nbsp; Enrolment at US for-profit colleges quadrupled between 2000 and 2010, peaking at 1.7 million (about 1 in 10 college students) but the sector has been plagued by repeated allegations of financial mismanagement, fraud and abuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-25/pearson-first-half-sales-drop-6-5-percent-on-strength-of-pound.html">Pearson will be cutting about 4,000 jobs</a> over two years (around 10% of its workforce) after first-half revenue dropped to &pound;2.05bn from &pound;2.19bn a year earlier, in line with the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg, as the strength of the pound reduced revenue converted from US dollars and other currencies.&nbsp; The cuts will be partly offset by the creation of 1,800 jobs in the two-year period as the company expands digital and emerging-market operations.</p>
<p>Canadian e-learning giant <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-08-13-desire2learn-s-85-million-deal">Desire2Learn</a> has raised $85m in funding after what the company calls &ldquo;a year of record growth in the higher education, K-12 and corporate markets.&rdquo; &nbsp;CEO John Baker says the company currently serves 1,100 institutions and 15 million learners &ndash; up from 850 and 10 million, respectively, at this time last year. &nbsp;The company also recently opened offices in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Focusing on Specific Dropouts Can Help Raise Completion Rates</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>College <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/A-Focus-on-Specific-Dropouts/147955">dropouts</a> who came close to graduating but didn&rsquo;t quite finish could be a key target for HEIs, according to a report by the US National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.&nbsp; Instead of focusing only on helping new students succeed, colleges should also be targeting those who intended to earn degrees and finished at least two years of study before falling off track, it says.&nbsp; Chasing down former students can be expensive and time-consuming, but some may be relatively close to their final degree.</p>

<p><strong>Duke Offers e- and Audio-books</strong></p>

<p><strong>Visualising the Internet</strong></p>
<p><em>[Go-Gulf; Social Times; TechCrunch; Campus Technology; Penny Stocks]</em></p>
<p>So, who&rsquo;s doing what on the internet, and how much are they doing it?</p>
<p>Firstly, Go-Gulf shows us <a href="http://www.go-gulf.ae/blog/what-people-share-on-social-networks/">what people share on social networks</a>.&nbsp; Most popular is photo sharing (by 43% of us), with videos someway behind (17%).&nbsp; Americans mostly share news video clips, Indians share movie trailers and Brits share travel, news and education clips.&nbsp; On Facebook alone, 4.75bn items are shared per day, with Turkey being the most sharing nation (93%), 25-34 the most sharing age group and men sharing more than women.</p>
<p><a href="http://socialtimes.com/social-media-facts-figures-stats-infographic_b200159">Digital Insights</a> cut the data cake differently, informing us that:</p>
<ul>
<li>84% of women and 50% of men stay active on Pinterest</li>
<li>75% of the engagement on a Facebook post happens within the first 5 hrs</li>
<li>44% of Twitter users have never sent a tweet</li>
<li>40% of YouTube traffic comes from mobile</li>
<li>23% of internet time is spent on blogs and social networks</li>
<li>400m snaps per day are sent on SnapChat</li>
<li>There are 39m students and recent graduates on LinkedIn</li>
</ul>
<p>According to comScore, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/11/snapchat-is-now-the-3-social-app-among-millennials">Snapchat is now the third most popular social app</a> among millennials, with a 32.9% penetration on the mobile phones of those aged 18&ndash;34.&nbsp; This puts it behind Instagram (43.1%) and Facebook (75.6%), but ahead of Twitter, Pinterest, Vine, Google+ and Tumblr.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone gets the same internet service.&nbsp; A free <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/07/23/aalto-unversity-helps-study-internet-quality-around-the-world.aspx">Netradar app</a> allows all of us to report our connectivity measurements, which are then displayed in terms of quality of download/upload speed, latency, and signal strength via an overlaid Google map.&nbsp; The app has already been installed more than 130,000 times, and the database contains about 3 million anonymised measurements.</p>
<p>And two excellent web pages from Pennystocks show <a href="http://pennystocks.la/internet-in-real-time/">how quickly internet data is generated</a> and how quickly those tech companies are <a href="http://pennystocks.la/battle-of-internet-giants/">generating revenue and profit</a> (about 50% of which goes to Apple). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bibblio</strong></p>
<p><em>[Andrew Law]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://bibblio.org/u/open-university">Bibblio</a> offers, &ldquo;a whole new type of learning experience that starts with your curiosity instead of a pre-defined curriculum and uses all the best tools from the web to help guide you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The OU has 700+ videos on the channel which, according to Andrew Law, &ldquo;means our material is now more universally accessible, searchable and embeddable. &nbsp;It is in keeping with the OU&rsquo;s mission to be open and accessible to all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>OER and Copyright</strong></p>
<p><em>[Zite]</em></p>
<p>Copyright law is complicated and OERs may not be as &lsquo;open&rsquo; as we think.&nbsp; Worse still is the different interpretation/application of the rules across Europe; for example 63% of EU/EEA nations allow academics to translate literary works for use in a teaching compilation, but 46% do not.&nbsp; <a href="http://oerpolicy.eu/oer-and-copyright-mapping-exempted-uses-in-europe/">OER and Copyright: mapping exempted uses in Europe</a> is a working paper that investigates and tries to define the fragmented European landscape of copyright exceptions and limitations for educational purposes, across 49 European states.</p>

<p><strong>Kenyatta Launches Digital &lsquo;Anywhere School&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; Paul Hoffman]</em></p>
<p>Kenya&rsquo;s Kenyatta University has become the first in East Africa with a digital school, offering a range of vocational certificates and degree courses through virtual and open learning.&nbsp; Each student will be issued with a free tablet, uploaded with all the course units registered for.&nbsp; Live tutorials will also be offered from the institution&rsquo;s 10 campuses across the country when the programmes commence in Sep.&nbsp; The &ldquo;<a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140716160151904">Anywhere School</a>&rdquo; is targeting adult learners and people unable to commit themselves to attending classes either as full-time or part-time students.&nbsp; Programmes will run on a trimester cycle which will enable students to complete an undergraduate course in three calendar years.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140815124144866">African Virtual University</a>, in partnership with the African Development Bank, is launching 29 new open, distance and e-learning centres in 21 African countries at a cost of approx $200,000.&nbsp; The first centre opened in Sudan on 11 Aug and all should all be installed in the next six to eight months.&nbsp; Despite steadily increasing admissions, Sub-Saharan Africa still has only around 6% of its population aged 25-34 in tertiary education, compared to around 60-70% in the UK and US.</p>

<p><strong>Distance Between IT and Campus Users</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>IT is a disjointed effort on most US campuses, according to a recent survey of 150+ HE IT staff.&nbsp; For example, in more than four out of five colleges and universities, IT professionals report that they <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/08/04/survey-it-and-academics-dont-work-together-much.aspx">do not regularly develop joint plans with academic departments for IT initiatives</a>.&nbsp; Nearly 60% don't survey academic or research staff on IT needs; and over 60% lack a catalogue of IT services &ndash; which might explain why 57% of end users view IT as the &ldquo;fix it&rdquo; folks and just 22% consider IT a &ldquo;trusted ally.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>[BBC; Campus Technology; TechCrunch]</em></p>

<p>The <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/07/29/report-as-tablet-market-grows-smaller-vendors-make-inroads.aspx">global tablet market</a> grew by 11% in 2014 Q2 compared to the same period last year, according to new data from IDC.&nbsp; However, that represents a drop of 1.5% over Q1 which the analysts attribute to the &ldquo;the rise of large-screen smartphones and longer than anticipated ownership cycles&rdquo;.&nbsp; Apple continued to lead the market with 26.9% market share (13.3 million shipments), followed by Samsung with 17.2%.</p>
<p>A new report from Strategy Analytics shows <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/30/the-one-horse-race-android-represented-85-of-the-300m-smartphones-shipped-in-q2/">Android</a> accounting for 85% of the 295.2 million smartphones shipped in 2014 Q2, with Apple, Windows Phone and BlackBerry all losing market share.&nbsp; Meanwhile, IDC predicts that <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/08/05/report-smartphone-shipments-to-top-300-million-in-third-quarter.aspx">smartphone shipments in Q3</a> will top 300 million units.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on &hellip; Employability</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; The Economist; New York Times; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>I speculated last month that students&rsquo; expectations suggest they might be yearning for some form of Technology Enhanced Polytechnic.&nbsp; Now news comes that <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/To-Fight-Unemployment-China/147217/">China intends to turn 600 of the country&rsquo;s general universities into polytechnics</a> to focus on applied knowledge and skills rather than over-academic, highly theoretical studies.&nbsp; Education vice-minister Lu Xin believes, &ldquo;There is an urgent need to reform our current education system, which has been struggling to provide high quality talents with skills and knowledge that meet demand at the production frontline&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Economist reports that, &ldquo;Around the world <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21605899-staid-higher-education-business-about-experience-welcome-earthquake-digital">demand for retraining and continuing education is soaring</a> among workers of all ages [...] In America, higher-education enrolment by students aged 35 or older rose by 314,000 in the 1990s, but by 899,000 in the 2000s.&rdquo;&nbsp; It believes campus-based degree courses &ndash; particularly those from &ldquo;middle tier institutions&rdquo; &ndash;are not well-suited to serve this growing and changing marketplace but that online education (MOOC or otherwise) can offer a viable solution.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2014/06/announcing-nanodegrees-new-type-of.html">Udacity</a> reports that, &ldquo;McKinsey estimates there will be a shortfall of 85 million skilled jobs globally in 2020 driven by the rapid changes in technology. Students will need to acquire new skills and hone previously learned ones in time for their next job or strategic initiative to keep pace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence the announcement of a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/business/economy/udacity-att-nanodegree-offers-an-entry-level-approach-to-college.html?_r=1">NanoDegree</a> programme, developed by Udacity with $1.5m funding from AT&amp;T, designed to give learners, &ldquo;&hellip;compact, flexible, and job-focused credentials that are stackable throughout your career. &nbsp;And the NanoDegree program is designed for efficiency: select hands-on courses by industry, a capstone project, and career guidance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Learners pay $200 a month and, &ldquo;AT&amp;T will accept the NanoDegree as a credential for entry-level jobs (and is hoping to persuade other companies to accept it, too) and has reserved 100 internship slots for its graduates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the UK, the government persists with its target of 50% of school leavers entering university, with David Willetts asserting that, &ldquo;Graduates are the engines of our future growth&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, Ed Milliband last week called for the introduction of &lsquo;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-28197128">technical degrees</a>&rsquo; for those with more vocational aspirations, as part of a move to help drive a &ldquo;high-wage, high-skill, high-quality economy&rdquo;.&nbsp; He expects students to study whilst working and cited Germany as an example of how vocational qualifications can be given a high status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canada currently has an unemployment rate of 7% &ndash; similar to the UK (6.8%) &ndash; but a study from <a href="http://research.cibcwm.com/economic_public/download/feature1.pdf">CIBC</a> reports that, &ldquo;Large swaths of those unemployed are not what employers are seeking.&rdquo;&nbsp; Might competence based education (CBE) be the answer?&nbsp; A report from HEQCO, <a href="http://heqco.ca/SiteCollectionDocuments/CBE Report-ENG.pdf">Productivity Implications of a Shift to Competency-Based Education</a>, observes that, &ldquo;Compared to traditional models for the delivery of baccalaureate education, competency-based education is said to lead to better and faster acquisition of skills directly relevant to employment so that graduates are more job-ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, it urges caution because, based on its recent investigations, &ldquo;There is no systematic, comprehensive study indicating that the purported skills from a CBE program translate into performance, either in graduation results or in the labour market.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Steve Rycroft; Ian Blackham; Pearson; Phil Hill; Wired Campus; Martin Weller; George Siemens; ALT; FutureLearn]</em></p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;the year of the MOOC&rsquo; well out of the way, the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Deke Kassabian considers <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/value-moocs-early-adopter-universities">the value of MOOCs to elite early adopter universities</a>, and the differences and overlaps between their goals and public perceptions.&nbsp; He concludes that, &ldquo;The exuberance of 2012 has faded, replaced by the skepticism of 2014, but at the early adopter universities, MOOCs appear poised to play an important role [&hellip;] with a strong value proposition: supporting the goal of improving on-campus teaching and learning while also promoting the university and its faculty.&nbsp; At the same time, the elite universities connect with the public through educational outreach, demonstrating leadership in an emerging higher education learning technology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The case of <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/07/08/massiveteaching-mystery-captivates-confuses#sthash.IY7kbCXN.dpbs">the disappearing MOOC</a> continues.&nbsp; The University of Zurich&rsquo;s &ldquo;Teaching Goes Massive: New Skills Required&rdquo; course was one week into its planned three-week run when the course materials were apparently deleted from Coursera by maths professor Paul-Olivier Dehaye.&nbsp; The university stated that this was part of Dehaye&rsquo;s &ldquo;pedagogical concept in order to get more students actively engage in the course forum&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, Dehaye wrote that his intention was to &ldquo;confuse everyone, including the university, [C]oursera, the Twitter world, as many journalists as I can, and the course participants. &nbsp;The goal being to attract publicity.... I want to show how [C]oursera tracks you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pearson&rsquo;s Amar Kumar considers whether MOOCs really are the magic bullet in opening access to education.&nbsp; He believes MOOCs offer a poor learner experience compared to on-campus offerings and that completely open entry fuels the 90%+ dropout rates we often see.&nbsp; Instead, he proposes a three tier model based on MOOCs for casual &ldquo;tourists&rdquo;, <a href="http://labs.pearson.com/will-soocs-eat-moocs-for-breakfast/">Selectively Open Online Courses</a> (SOOCs) for &ldquo;explorers&rdquo; with some proven competency or credential, and a campus offering for &ldquo;adventurers&rdquo; who need greater depth, collaboration and mentorship.</p>
<p>Diana Laurillard also asks, if MOOCs are not providing mass education for millions in emerging economies, or reducing student loan debt, or encouraging large numbers of unqualified or unemployed adults into education, then <a href="https://newsletter.alt.ac.uk/2014/06/what-is-the-problem-for-which-moocs-are-the-solution/">what is the problem for which MOOCs are the solution?</a>&nbsp; She concludes (as have many others) that all the data suggests MOOCs are mainly providing free university teaching for highly qualified professionals.</p>
<p>Google is giving Carnegie Mellon $300,000 in each of the next two years through the Google Focused Research Award program to focus on <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/google-will-finance-carnegie-mellons-mooc-research/53521">&ldquo;data driven&rdquo; approaches to research on MOOCs</a>, including &ldquo;techniques for automatically analyzing and providing feedback on student work&rdquo;.&nbsp; Google&rsquo;s goal is to develop platforms that are intelligent enough to mimic a traditional classroom experience.</p>
<p>Martin Weller believes <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2014/07/mooc-completion-rates-do-matter.html">MOOC completion rates do matter</a> but that we need to better understand why they sometimes disappoint, and he uses Stephen Downes&rsquo; analogy: &ldquo;no-one drops out of a newspaper, they just take what they want&rdquo;.&nbsp; He suggests that MOOCs might be more effective if they were designed more like newspapers rather than on a week-by-week basis (which we know currently means that &ldquo;90% of your registered learners are never even looking at 50% of your content&rdquo;).&nbsp; Interestingly, George Siemens reports that <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2014/07/08/i-was-wrong/">corporate MOOCs</a>, with their different motivators, see completion rates in the 70-80% range.</p>

<p><strong>Characterising Online Learners</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dropout&rdquo; is an unfortunate term in the MOOC lexicon.&nbsp; A study of MOOC engagement from Cornell and Stanford tracked the behaviour patterns of more than 300,000 Coursera students.&nbsp; From this, the authors devised a <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/study-of-moocs-suggests-dropping-the-label-dropout/53421">taxonomy of engagement</a> to differentiate between different types of participation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collectors</strong> primarily download lectures</li>
<li><strong>Viewers</strong> watch lectures, handing in few if any assignments</li>
<li><strong>Solvers</strong> hand in assignments for a grade, viewing few if any lectures</li>
<li><strong>All-Rounders</strong> balance the watching of lectures with the handing in of assignments</li>
<li><strong>Bystanders</strong> are registered for the course, but their total activity is below a very low threshold</li>
</ul>
<p>A survey of 2,500 high school and college students by the Boston Consulting Group identified <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/06/18/research-online-students-take-five-forms-each-calling-for-unique-offerings.aspx">five distinct types of students who take online courses</a>, based on their expectations for learning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Minds</strong> (30% of students surveyed) value the classroom experience, are the &ldquo;most satisfied&rdquo; with blended courses and don't consider online programs less credible than F2F education. &nbsp;They are receptive to virtual classrooms/whiteboards, searching learning resources and participating in online discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Experience Seekers</strong> (23%) believe that blended courses are &ldquo;generally effective&rdquo; and enable &ldquo;personalized learning&rdquo;.&nbsp; They want to achieve their degree by the most effective means and are open to game-based learning and simulations, collaboration and mobile learning.</li>
<li><strong>Money Mavens</strong> (17%) are the least satisfied with all of education and are more likely to believe that &ldquo;college is a waste of money&rdquo;.&nbsp; Many have taken blended courses and they are likely to be attracted by non-profits offering foundation degree programmes, career services and self-pacing.</li>
<li><strong>True Believers</strong> (15%) tend to be the most satisfied with online learning, they take more than 75% of their courses online or as a blend and they don't believe online degrees are &ldquo;inherently lower in quality&rdquo;.&nbsp; This segment should be fostered by bolstering the line-up of self-paced courses and career-advising services, improving credit transfer and offering the promise of faster degree completion.</li>
<li><strong>Online Rejecters</strong> (15%) have tried online courses and are &ldquo;skeptical of the quality, effectiveness and career outcomes of online education&rdquo;.&nbsp; They tend to be attracted by F2F offerings from non-profits, the quality of the faculty, &ldquo;exclusiveness of admissions&rdquo; and the positive aspects of campus life.</li>

<p>According to the Aspen Task Force&rsquo;s new <a href="http://aspeninstitute.fsmdev.com/documents/AspenReportFinalPagesRev.pdf">report on learning and the internet</a>, &ldquo;American students are falling farther behind their counterparts in other countries, which suggest that our 18th and 19th century model of education is not working as it should in the 21st century.&rdquo;&nbsp; The report goes on to highlight five essential principles and twenty-six action steps to achieve a new vision of learning.&nbsp; In summary: all learners should have access to, and be at the heart of, learning networks; those networks should be interoperable; students should be sufficiently information-literate, and their learning environment should be safe and trusted.</p>

<p><em>[The Mirror; ALT]</em></p>
<p>A Mirror investigation suggests that up to 100,000 students a year pay <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/watch-dodgy-firms-offer-ready-written-3782199#ixzz36Nv32uzl">essay-writing companies</a> to produce bespoke assignments, with one leading firm claiming to have produced &ldquo;nearly five million words&rdquo; for students in the current academic year.&nbsp; A mirror reporter was offered a 10,000-word masters dissertation on international relations for &pound;2,000 and undergraduate politics essays for &pound;85 per 1,000 words.&nbsp; A study by Birmingham City University found there had been more than 19,000 attempts at cheating by UK students since 2005.</p>
<p>A paper in the latest issue of JOLT scores more highly than the Mirror for academic rigour, although it is notably thin on evidence gathered from shady meetings in BMWs.&nbsp; Prof David Ison compared <a href="http://jolt.merlot.org/vol10no2/ison_0614.pdf">184 doctoral dissertations</a> submitted to traditional HEIs between 2009-2013 against 184 submitted to online institutions.&nbsp; Analysis using Turnitin revealed no significant difference between the originality indices of either batch, although more than half of all dissertations contained some level of plagiarism.&nbsp; Whilst basic plagiarism was slightly more prevalent at online institutions, the more extreme examples were found amongst bricks and mortar.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>This digest has only ever aimed to present a brief synopsis of each item, on the assumption that those who are interested will follow the hyperlink and investigate further for themselves.&nbsp; However, I have been asked to try and pick out some information of direct relevance to the OU each month and present a little more detail.&nbsp; So here goes.</p>
<p>As an organisation, we strive to better understand what our students like, need and expect from us in the shorter and longer term, and we are investing much more effort in conducting surveys and analysing data from various sources to try and build that picture.&nbsp; But we can&rsquo;t ask every survey question, nor can we fully understand what it really means if a student spends 7&frac12; mins on a VLE page, so relevant external studies can often help to provide additional useful guidance and evidence for us.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.laureate.net/AboutLaureate/University-of-the-Future">2014 Global Survey of Students</a> is a report commissioned by Laureate Education which analysed opinions from 21,000 students at 37 Laureate institutions in 21 countries on what universities of the future would look like.&nbsp; The key outcomes were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessible</strong>.&nbsp; Some 43% of students expect all content to be free for most university courses and 59% expect courses, &ldquo;will utilize social media to learn and teach skills to other students&rdquo;.&nbsp; One in three thinks a majority of classes, &ldquo;will be taught online instead of in a traditional classroom&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible</strong>.&nbsp; 52% expect, &ldquo;a majority of classes will be provided all day and night&rdquo; and 42% expect to be able to study in certificate-sized chunks throughout their academic career, rather than a concentrated few years leading to a degree.&nbsp; 64% also think courses will be taught simultaneously in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Innovative</strong>.&nbsp; 54% expect a high degree of collaboration and group projects, with 43% hoping to receive, &ldquo;personalised tutoring and instruction by professors online, not in person&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Job-focused</strong>.&nbsp; Students expect courses to be job-focused, 61% expect most of these to have been designed by &lsquo;industrial experts&rsquo; (whereas only 26% foresee content being designed by other students) and 71% expect courses to, &ldquo;teach students career-oriented skills&rdquo; in additional to subject matter.&nbsp; They expect that employers will place a higher value on internships (55%), teamwork (53%) and workplace skills (48%) over pure academic performance (39%).</li>
</ul>
<p>There is considerable overlap between this report and the outcomes of Belinda&rsquo;s recent &lsquo;Learning Now - For the Future&rsquo; workshops, which included inputs from some of our own students.&nbsp; But perhaps that shouldn&rsquo;t surprise us because most of these things are quite reasonable expectations from busy students who want to acquire workplace-relevant knowledge and skills as efficiently as possible.&nbsp; It almost seems as if many are yearning for a Technology Enhanced Polytechnic?</p>
<p>Also noteworthy is a pragmatic attitude to technologies as there appears to be no great clamour for lots of interactive or multimedia bells and whistles.&nbsp; For those of Generation Y, technology is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; or &lsquo;special&rsquo; &ndash; it is simply part of what they do and what they use as part of their everyday lives.&nbsp; I recall a session at an Online Educa conference a few years ago in which delegates were able to quiz half a dozen high school students on their attitudes towards e-learning.&nbsp; The questions flowed and there was polite bemusement from the students. &nbsp;We eventually established that they routinely used e-learning and social media on a regular basis, but they never referred to them in those terms and simply couldn&rsquo;t understand what all the fuss was about on our part.</p>
<p>Further corroboration of a need for flexibility and an employment focus comes from two sources.&nbsp; Firstly, a Guardian report of a recent HEA roundtable discussion (which included our own Musa Mihsein) on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/jun/10/flexible-study-future-for-universities">Conditions of Flexibility</a> in HE, in which participants all seemed to accept the need for greater flexibility and workplace relevance.&nbsp; Several examples of current flexible practices are described and the impact of MOOCs, analytics, student attitudes to technology and QAA considerations were all discussed.&nbsp; Secondly, an article on the UA site of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada considers the merits of <a href="http://www.universityaffairs.ca/competency-based-degree-programs-are-growing-in-the-us.aspx">Competence Based Education</a> (CBE), citing examples of flexible, employment-focused programmes in North America.&nbsp; Athabasca&rsquo;s Dr Dianne Conrad believes &ldquo;CBE opens pathways to quicker and cheaper learning for students,&rdquo; but also suspects the reason why it hasn&rsquo;t been embraced by traditional Canadian universities (and some US ones as well) is because &ldquo;it smacks too much of training&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Pete Mitton; Stephen Downes; Tony Bates; THE; Wired Campus; Audrey Watters; George Siemens]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.qualt.com/">Qualt</a> is a new MOOC service with a difference.&nbsp; Firstly, it is a mobile-only service, with content and services made available through a free app.&nbsp; Secondly, all available courses cover a professional subject and are backed by a recognised industry body.&nbsp; An obvious downside is the size of some mobile device screens, which has always limited some types of learning activities and content &ndash; but the other benefits may outweigh this, particularly for tablet owners.</p>
<p>Andrew Kelly&rsquo;s Bellwether report: <a href="http://bellwethereducation.org/policymakers_guide_to_moocs">Disruptor, Distracter, or What?</a> provides a thorough, readable and well-referenced assessment of where we are with MOOCs and where things could be heading. He notes that, &ldquo;MOOCs are neither the cataclysmic disruptor that advocates predicted nor the flash in pan their critics were hoping for&rdquo;.&nbsp; He is also neither surprised nor concerned when MOOCs do not appear to completely solve a problem: &ldquo;MOOCs are a tool, not a solution.&nbsp; And like any tool, they are likely to be more useful for some jobs than for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to David Willetts, a mismatch between the content of university courses and the skills demanded by employers could lead to <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/employers-could-turn-to-bespoke-moocs-willetts-says/2013465.article">companies setting up their own MOOCs</a> and bypassing universities.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once a significant number of employers say &lsquo;we will take evidence that you have done this course as the basis for giving you an interview&rsquo;, some of the more formal accrediting processes within education can be bypassed,&rdquo; he said last month, predicting &rdquo;&hellip;the rise of the de facto accredited MOOC&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A new EC report based on a survey of about 3,000 people, including 731 students, said that only one student in four was not familiar with MOOCs and that about 64% of respondents had taken such courses.&nbsp; Most employers surveyed said <a href="http://www.openeducationeuropa.eu/node/142833">MOOCs could help close a skills gap in web design</a>, but only 56 MOOCs teach such skills throughout Europe, compared with 115 in the United States.&nbsp; For the most part, respondents rated MOOCs as more effective than colleges in teaching such skills.</p>

<p>The first Arab language MOOC platform &ndash; <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140529184801359">Edraak</a> &ndash; launched last month, powered by Open edX code.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MOOC Analysis</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Harvard Business Review; Wired Campus; Campus Technology] </em></p>
<p>A new report from Columbia University, <a href="http://cbcse.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MOOCs_Expectations_and_Reality.pdf">MOOCs: Expectations and Reality</a>, is based on interviews with administrators, faculty members, researchers, and others from 62 different US institutions. &nbsp;The report contains a number of case studies and &ldquo;&hellip;investigates the actual goals of institutions creating MOOCs or integrating them into their programs, and reviews the current evidence regarding whether and how these goals are being achieved, and at what cost.&rdquo;&nbsp; The researchers conclude that MOOCs could potentially affect HE by offering participants credentials of economic value, and by catalysing the development of adaptive learning experiences.</p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania has analysed data from over 875,000 students enrolled in nine MOOCs offered by its <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/moocs-wont-replace-business-schools-theyll-diversify-them/">Wharton business school</a>, concluding that MOOCs do not threaten its traditional MBA or executive education market but they do reach at least three new and valuable student populations.&nbsp; For example, 78% of MOOC students came from outside the US and nearly half of these were from developing countries.&nbsp; MOOCs also attracted greater proportions of unemployed adults and underrepresented minorities than traditional MBAs.&nbsp; There remain concerns over completion rates and the researchers note that those who persist tend to be disproportionately male, well educated, employed, and from OECD countries.</p>
<p>Harvard and MIT have released <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/mit-and-harvard-release-de-identified-learning-data-open-online-courses">de-identified learning data</a> from the 16 HarvardX and MITx courses offered in 2012-13 that formed the basis of the first HarvardX and MITx <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/mit-and-harvard-release-working-papers-on-open-online-courses-0121">working papers released in Jan</a> and the open-source interactive <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/mitx-and-harvardx-release-mooc-datasets-and-vizualization-tools">visualization tools released in Feb</a>.&nbsp; However, Phil Hill suggests that the data are not as useful as we might have hoped, and that lessons can be learned from the analytics approach being taken by <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/harvard-mit-learn-university-phoenix-analytics/">Apollo/Phoenix</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/vpol/vpol-files/2013_Report/Stanford_Online_2013_In_Review.pdf">Stanford Online: 2013 in Review</a>, 1.9 million people have registered for one or more of the 246 online/blended courses on either Coursera, NovoEd or Stanford OpenEdX since autumn 2012 and four million hours of instruction have been delivered.&nbsp; Greatest participation was from 21-25 year-olds, 73% of enrolees were male (although women very more prevalent in older age bands) and most were well-qualified with a bachelors degree (33%), masters (40%) or PhD (12%).&nbsp; Around 40% of students spend 1-20 mins studying each week, 29% spend 20-60 mins and 32% exceed an hour.</p>

<p><strong>Modernisation of Higher Education in Europe</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>A new report from the EU, <a href="http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice/documents/thematic_reports/165EN.pdf">Modernisation of Higher Education in Europe</a>, finds that most European countries are failing to set precise targets or monitor progress in the key areas of access, retention and employability.&nbsp; For example, of the 36 national education systems shown in Figure 1.2 (p18), staff and student ethnicity is only monitored in 8, labour market status of students prior to entering HE in 13, and disability in 17.&nbsp; The researchers also found that 13 did not systematically calculate completion and/or drop-out rates.</p>

<p><strong>Part-Time Student Numbers Tumble in England</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; The Telegraph; BBC]</em></p>
<p>Ten years ago, 47% of all entrants to HE in England were on part-time courses.&nbsp; Today, that figure is down to 31%, with the biggest fall in undergraduate courses according to a new HEFCE report, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140523125614333">Pressure From All Sides: Economic and policy influences on part-time higher education</a>.&nbsp; UWN reports that, &ldquo;Some of the best-known providers have international reputations, such as The Open University, with 168,215 students when last counted by the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency, or HESA, in 2012-13.&nbsp; That figure sounds enormous, but it was down from 208,710 the year before.&nbsp; Birkbeck College &hellip; saw overall student numbers drop from 19,580 in 2011-12 to 16,460 in 2012-13 despite introducing new intensive evening courses, which enable students to gain a first degree in three years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>UCAS figures show that conventional <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/10863107/University-applications-soar-by-20000-in-12-months.html">university applications are up by more than 20,000 (4%)</a> to 634,600 by the end of May, compared to this time last year.&nbsp; This has partly been fuelled by rising demand from foreign students, with overseas applications up by more than 6%.</p>
<p>There is also evidence that students are starting to realise that they are (highly) paying customers, with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-27640303">more than 20,000 student complaints</a> being made last year.&nbsp; Responses from 120 universities across the UK revealed that total academic appeals and complaints were 10% higher in 2012-13 than in 2010-11 and that more than &pound;2m has been paid out in compensation.</p>
<p>But a new HEPI/HEA survey of 15,000 students shows that <a href="http://universitybusiness.co.uk/News/major_student_survey_shows_key_insights">86% are 'satisfied' with their course</a>, although 31% would have chosen another course if they were to have their time again.&nbsp; At Scottish institutions, 70% of undergraduates believe their (free) courses represent good value for money, compared with only 41% in England.</p>
<p>And is it all worth it?&nbsp; The ONS reports that one British person in five who receives university degree <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/10834895/One-in-five-university-graduates-become-millionaires.html">becomes a millionaire</a>.&nbsp; And the average 2:1 graduate is estimated to pay <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-27763112">more than &pound;200,000 extra in taxes</a> to the government over their lifetime.</p>

<p><strong>Growth in Online Post-Secondary Education</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>According to the new report, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/06/04/1-in-10-students-enrolled-exclusively-in-online-courses.aspx">Enrollment in Distance Education Courses, by State</a>, 11% of all US undergraduate students enrolled on exclusively online courses in 2012, with another 14% taking at least some course components online.&nbsp; The figures for all post-secondary students were 12% and 13% respectively; however, the highest rates by far were seen at private, for-profit institutions, where 43% of students were enrolled exclusively online.&nbsp; There was also wide variation according to location, with Arizona having the highest proportion of online students (48%) compared to just 1.6% in more densely-populated Rhode Island.</p>

<p><strong>Reclaiming Innovation</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Jim Groom and Brian Lamb believe, &ldquo;If any concept should be seen as an uncomplicated good thing in higher education, it's innovation.&nbsp; Defined by a common-sense notion of &lsquo;doing things better&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; But they also note that, currently, &ldquo;innovation is increasingly conflated with hype, disruption for disruption's sake, and outsourcing laced with a dose of austerity-driven downsizing.&nbsp; Call it <a href="http://www.educause.edu/visuals/shared/er/extras/2014/ReclaimingInnovation/default.html">innovation fatigue</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp; They then go on to consider what&rsquo;s gone wrong, what part LMS/VLEs, MOOCs, Openness and disruption (&ldquo;it's difficult to see the value in disruption for its own sake&rdquo;) may have played in this, and what we can do to get things back on track.&nbsp; The discussion is good (including references to Martin Weller and Tony Hirst), as are the video clips and supporting case studies.</p>

<p><strong>The Condition of Education, 2014</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014083.pdf">Condition of Education</a> report from the US Dept of Education provides a mammoth (256pp) snapshot of US education based on 42 topics and trend indicators covering population characteristics, participation in education, elementary and secondary education, and postsecondary education.&nbsp; Difficult to summarise it all here but some HE highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% of US adults aged 25-29 had a high school diploma and 34% had a bachelor&rsquo;s or higher degree</li>
<li>Median earnings were higher for those with higher levels of education</li>
<li>Around 87% of students at non-profit colleges were under the age of 25 but this was much lower (29%) at for-profit colleges</li>
<li>Only around 60% of those who began their degree in autumn 2006 had completed it by 2012</li>
<li>In 2012, the US awarded over 1.8m bachelor&rsquo;s degrees, and 750k master&rsquo;s degrees</li>

<p>According to Diana Laurillard, &ldquo;Intelligent people leave their brains behind when it comes to technology&rdquo; and so Donald Clark suggests <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/may/15/ten-reasons-we-should-ditch-university-lectures">10 reasons why universities should ditch lectures</a>.&nbsp; Sounds good, but it transpires that he only wants to cull one-off F2F lectures by recording them.&nbsp; Okay, so that provides a convenient location and timing (reasons 8 &amp; 9), plus a means of pausing the lecture (4), but it does nothing to improve the length (1), amount of detail (7) and skills of the presenter (10), nor does it enhance student engagement through participation (2).&nbsp; Add some new factors such as dodgy sound, lighting and camerawork into the mix and I remain unconvinced.&nbsp; Technology offers tremendous potential to improve teaching and learning, but I&rsquo;m afraid recorded lectures don&rsquo;t get my vote.</p>
<p>Prof Alex Small takes a contrary position.&nbsp; He uses <a href="http://m.chronicle.com/article/In-Defense-of-the-Lecture/146797/">lectures as part of a broader mix of activities and techniques</a>, and believes that a well-constructed and well-delivered lecture, &ldquo;is engaging, it naturally invites discussion and dialogue, it operates at a level much higher than raw information delivery, it is a natural setting for the expert to act as a role model, and it can be integrated with more formal activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Higher-Education Reforms in Australia</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>There has been uproar over PM Tony Abbott&rsquo;s plans to <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/worldwise/down-under-or-upside-down-higher-education-reforms-in-australia/33923">slash Australian government support for higher education</a> and move closer to funding models operated by the US, UK and others.&nbsp; Abbott&rsquo;s plans will see government funding cut by at least 20% and students having to repay debts sooner, and at higher rates of interest.&nbsp; Public universities (37 of Australia&rsquo;s 39) will become competitors in a free-market system and allowed to charge whatever they choose for their courses.&nbsp; However, Jamie Miller&rsquo;s article looks at some of the problems this causes in other parts of the world, and suggests Australia should stay as it is and that some other countries should consider moving to its system instead.</p>

<p><strong>Active Learning Improves STEM Student Performance</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>A meta-analysis of STEM teaching led by the University of Washington, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/Articles/2014/05/14/55-More-STEM-Students-Fail-Lectures-Than-Courses-with-Active-Learning.aspx?Page=1">Active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics</a>, found that 55% more students flunk purely lecture-based STEM courses than flunk courses taught with some sort of active learning component.&nbsp; The report examined 250 previously published studies on STEM education and found that 34% of students taking STEM lectures that contain no active learning component fail, but this fell to 22% for classes incorporating active learning activities such as discussion, reflection and collaboration.</p>

<p><strong>Internet Trends 2014</strong></p>
<p><em>[ReadWrite; EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>Mary Meeker&rsquo;s annual <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/05/28/mary-meeker-internet-trends-report">internet trends presentation</a> is always one to watch.&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s 164 slides scamper from tablets and mobile internet growth, through social media and data to e-commerce and finance.&nbsp; China is so significant, it gets its own section (slides 127-136) and buried in there on just 5 slides (24-28) is a dash of education.&nbsp; Key messages are: it&rsquo;s important; it&rsquo;s expensive; it&rsquo;s becoming much cheaper for newcomers to get a presence, and; we like the fact that online learning can be much more personalised.&nbsp; And key stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Khan Academy received 430m views last year (up by 69%)</li>
<li>65m OU iTunes U downloads (up 59%)</li>
<li>25m use the Duolingo app to learn a new language (up 14x)</li>
<li>7m enrolled on Coursera courses (up 2x)</li>
</ul>
<p>Describing the present is always a safer bet than predicting the future and, whilst the upcoming trends in the latest <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-05-24-forecasting-k-12-edtech-adoption-trends/">NMC K-12 Horizon Report</a> seem to make sense, it&rsquo;s interesting to look at their track record of accuracy.&nbsp; As the table at the bottom of the EdSurge web page shows, nothing NMC predicted more than a year out seems to have rolled forward in subsequent years.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tabletsforschools.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/T4S-Sometimes-Addicted-Report-9-5-14.pdf">Tablets for Schools</a> surveyed over 3,500 UK children aged 11-17 during Jan 14 with the key question: &lsquo;Do you sometimes think you are addicted to the internet&rsquo;, finding that 39% believed they were.&nbsp; A series of supplementary questions showed that 64% took an internet enabled device to bed with them, on which they were mostly talking to friends (66% - with Facetime being the most popular method) and viewing video/photo sites (63%).&nbsp; The report also gives further breakdowns by device, age, gender and activity.</p>

<p><strong>Device News</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; Gigaom; Campus Technology; BBC]</em></p>
<p>Microsoft has launched <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/20/microsoft-announces-the-surface-pro-3/?ncid=tcdaily">Surface Pro 3</a>, with a 12&rdquo; screen (with an aspect ratio of 3:2), Intel i3, i5 or i7 processor and improved battery life.&nbsp; The keyboard/cover is more flexible and comes with a larger and better trackpad, plus the device also accepts pen input.&nbsp; Prices start at $799.&nbsp; But for how long will Apple leave MS unopposed in this upper end of the mobile marketplace?</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/05/27/encore-2-windows-tablet-surface-mini/">Toshiba Encore 2</a> is an 8&rdquo; slate with a quad-core Intel processor, full Windows 8.1 and 10 hours of expected battery life &ndash; and all for $199.</p>
<p>According to ABI Research, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/05/21/tablet-competition-heats-up-samsung-apple-vie-for-top-spot.aspx">41.3 million tablets shipped worldwide</a> in the first quarter of 2014.&nbsp; Apple took the No 1 spot with 16.4 million units, followed by Samsung (13m) and Asus (2.1m).&nbsp; That gave Android 56.3% of the overall market, followed by iOS (39.6%) and Windows (4.1%).&nbsp; ABI also notes that 22% of those tablets included an integrated 3G/4G capability.</p>
<p>In a move to break its sole dependence on Android, Samsung has announced its first commercial smartphone powered by the open source <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/samsung-z">Tizen</a> platform, with initial sales likely to be in Russia in the autumn.&nbsp; Tizen will have its own app store, but an OpenMobile application compatibility layer will enable the handset to run Android apps as well.</p>
<p>And Mozilla is likely to start <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27793464">selling $25 smartphones in India</a> within the &ldquo;next few months&rdquo; running Mozilla's HTML5 web-based Firefox OS.</p>

<p><strong>Growth of e-Book Sales</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>A report from Pricewaterhouse Coopers predicts that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-27694650">e-book sales will outstrip print by 2018</a> and that the consumer e-book market - which excludes text books and professional manuals - will increase in value from &pound;380m to &pound;1bn.&nbsp; PwC expects 50% of the UK population to own a tablet or e-reader device by 2018.</p>
<p>A good example of bringing a subject to life is <a href="http://digitaldubliners.com/">Digital Dubliners</a>, an interactive iBook from Boston College, published 100 years after the original collection of James Joyce&rsquo;s short stories.&nbsp; This interactive book is enhanced by the inclusion of maps, photos, video, audio, additional facts and a useful glossary of terms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Education Post-2015</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; Towards Maturity; EdSurge; </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;A UNESCO Position Paper on <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140508162141672">Education Post-2015</a> suggests that unequal access to HE is likely to persist in most countries globally despite concerted attempts to expand opportunities by 2030.&nbsp; It also warns that the problem will not be limited to scarcity of places but that there is also likely to be a knowledge divide caused by lack of chances to acquire skills in technology.&nbsp; The authors note that the quality of schooling in many countries continues to suffer from limited learning resources, teacher shortages, teacher absenteeism, and distance and safety travelling to and from school &ndash; leading to high drop-out rates, especially among girls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Towards Maturity does a good job investigating and supporting those using learning technologies in the workplace.&nbsp; Their latest benchmark report, <a href="http://www.towardsmaturity.org/article/2014/04/09/towards-maturity-learner-voice-part-1/">The Learner Voice</a>, provides evidence from over 2,000 UK private sector e-learners.&nbsp; Although directed at workplace learning, it&rsquo;s a fairly compact and readable report that does also have some relevance for the potential design of OU material for adult learners.&nbsp; Some highlights: 88% of learners like to proceed at their own pace; 86% believe collaborative learning is essential or very useful; and 64% would recommend online learning as a result of their own experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In a similar vein, the Gates Foundation has just released the results of a survey into <a href="http://collegeready.gatesfoundation.org/Innovation/InnovationContent/TeachersKnowBest">what those in the K-12 sector want and need from digital instructional tools</a>.&nbsp; A total of 3100 teachers and 1250 students were questioned, revealing that only 54% of teachers believe that the digital tools their students use are effective.&nbsp; For example, according to Chicago teacher Arelys Villeda, &ldquo;I realize that I haven&rsquo;t found a single edtech tool that helps my students communicate with each other and develop communications skills&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Time to Retire From Online Learning?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2014/04/15/time-to-retire-from-online-learning/">Tony Bates</a>, long-time academic, e-learning consultant and founding member of IET, has announced (aged 75) his retirement from &ldquo;(nearly) all professional activities&rdquo;.&nbsp; His blog post explains the reasons, which include:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t express adequately just how p***** off I am about MOOCs &ndash; not the concept, but all the hubris and nonsense that&rsquo;s been talked and written about them. At a personal level, it was as if 45 years of work was for nothing. All the research and study I and many others had done on what makes for successful learning online were totally ignored, with truly disastrous consequences in terms of effective learning for the vast majority of participants who took MOOCs from the Ivy League universities. Having ignored online learning for nearly 20 years, Stanford, MIT and Harvard had to re-invent online learning in their own image to maintain their perceived superiority in all things higher educational. And the media fell for it, hook, line and sinker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am concerned that the computer scientists seem to be taking over online education. Ivy League MOOCs are being driven mainly by computer scientists, not educators. Politicians are looking to computer science to automate learning in order to save money [&hellip;] This is a battle that has always existed in educational technology, but it&rsquo;s one I fear the educators are losing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Open Access Requirement For UK Research Funding</strong></p>
<p><em>[JISC; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>HEFCE, together with the Scottish and Welsh funding councils and the Department for Employment and Learning have announced that, from 2016, they will expect <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/open-access-to-be-a-requirement-for-uk-research-funding-31-mar-2014">all articles submitted to the REF to be available by open access</a>.&nbsp; JISC believes the move is, &ldquo;potentially great news for universities and researchers keen to raise their profile and their impact.&nbsp; However, as with any benefit, it will require some investment on the part of the sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And OER Research Hub&rsquo;s Rob Farrow has been considering <a href="http://oerresearchhub.org/2014/03/26/ethics-in-the-open/">what &lsquo;open&rsquo; really means and the role of ethics</a> in all this.</p>

<p><strong>Durable Technology Enhanced Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Inge de Waard summarises the <a href="http://ignatiawebs.blogspot.ca/2014/04/free-report-durable-technology-enhanced.html">Beyond Prototypes</a> report, which looks at, &ldquo;the processes of innovation in technology-enhanced learning (TEL) with a special emphasis on building online learning solutions that are durable&rdquo;.&nbsp; Key findings include, &ldquo;Sustainable change is not a simple matter of product development, testing and roll-out [&hellip;] it is necessary to look beyond product development and pay close attention to the entire process of implementation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if you do need to prototype, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/09/marvel-at-this">Marvel</a> has just released a powerful free app which allows iOS7 users to take photos of sketches, pictures, diagrams, whiteboards, etc, then designate hotspots and create links between the various images &ndash; thus allowing an interactive prototype to be quickly mocked-up.&nbsp; The app can sync with Dropbox and prototypes can be shared using email, SMS or Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>Former British Colonies Achieve Higher Research Output</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>According to a recent study of data from 47 African countries &ndash; 18 former British colonies, 20 former French and nine others &ndash; between 1994 and 2009, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140326133745371">different research and education policies that were strongly influenced by former colonial powers</a> have impacted on scientific research output.&nbsp; &ldquo;On average, former British colonies achieve higher numbers of scientific article publications than former French or other colonies in Africa including Portuguese, Belgian, Italian and Spanish,&rdquo; said the report&rsquo;s author.&nbsp; &ldquo;Former British colonies may enjoy comparative language advantages, a relatively efficient, open and dynamic scientific research model, increased demand for collaboration with advanced universities and research centres, as well as better political and economic institutions that support higher education&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Video for Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Education Technology; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>A study by Kaltura finds that 90% of respondents believe <a href="http://edtechnology.co.uk/News/video_now_a_must_have_in_he">video improves the learning experience</a>, with even basic video tools having a significant impact; 81% also agree that online learning will grow in prominence and will underpin the award of a large number of degrees going forward.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, Kaltura hosts an online platform for learning videos.</p>
<p>Derek Muller&rsquo;s PhD thesis examined the effectiveness of videos (such as from Khan) for teaching physics.&nbsp; His premise was that (1) learners often start with some subject knowledge, (2) their understanding can often be wrong or contain misconceptions, but (3) because they think they know the content, they don&rsquo;t pay full attention and so never remedy the situation.&nbsp; His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8">8-min video illustrates his findings</a> in a clear and thought-provoking manner (tip: start around 1:18 if you want to skip the general intro about Khan Academy).</p>

<p><strong>Scotland Fears Influx of &lsquo;Free&rsquo; English students</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Scotsman]</em></p>
<p>Universities Scotland is calling on the Scottish government to provide &ldquo;legally-defensible certainty&rdquo; that institutions will be able to deal with <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/scottish-independence-university-influx-fears-1-3349339">an influx of English students following independence</a>, at which time they will become standard EU citizens and thus entitled to the same free tuition as Scots.</p>

<p><strong>Taking Notes by Hand Benefits Recall</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>US research compared <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/taking-notes-by-hand-benefits-recall-researchers-find/51411">students who took lecture notes longhand</a> with those using (offline) laptops, with the former group performing better in a subsequent post test.&nbsp; Within the computerised group, those who made briefer notes performed better than those who made verbatim transcription.&nbsp; &ldquo;While more notes are beneficial, at least to a point, if the notes are taken indiscriminately or by mindlessly transcribing content, as is more likely the case on a laptop, the benefit disappears,&rdquo; claim the researchers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verbatim note-taking, as opposed to more selective strategies, signals less encoding of content&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Change the Homework, Improve Student Achievement</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>A new US study, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/03/20/change-the-homework-improve-student-achievement.aspx">Integrating Cognitive Science and Technology Improves Learning in a STEM Classroom</a>, has shown the beneficial effects of taking a cognitive science approach to undergraduate homework tasks, by providing students with:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Immediate feedback on homework, which they were required to read</li>
<li>Problems spaced over three weeks rather than all in a single week</li>
<li>Follow-up problems assigned in subsequent homework (&ldquo;repeated retrieval practice&rdquo;)</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparing groups who received this approach with those who did &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; homework showed a 7% improvement on short answer questions on the final exam and 5% on multiple choice questions.</p>

<p><strong>Ethnicity Has Greatest Impact on UK Degree Grades</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>A study of 130,000 recent graduates by HEFCE suggests that <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140329102323216">ethnicity is the most significant factor in students' performance</a> at university, although other factors such as gender, disadvantage and school type also affected students&rsquo; chances of success.&nbsp; Some 72% of white students who entered HE with three B grade A-levels graduated with a first or upper-second class degree, but only 56% of Asian students and 53% of black students did so.</p>
<p>Separate data published by HESA shows that the proportion of students at English universities from <a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2060&Itemid=141">disadvantaged backgrounds</a> rose during the first year of higher tuition fees &ndash; up from 10.2% in 2011-12 to 10.9% in 2012-13.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; TechCrunch; TES; IRRODL; Stephen Downes; The Economist; JISC]</em></p>
<p>European MOOC platform <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/02/19/european-mooc-platform-nearing-500000-enrollments.aspx">iversity</a> launched last Oct and now claims to have reached 500,000 enrolments in its 28 courses, with 5,000 students completing the first five courses.&nbsp; Students were also able to obtain ECTS credit points in two courses &ndash; <em>An Introduction to Business Studies</em> and <em>Marketing</em> &ndash; by completing an onsite exam (in Germany) even if they were not enrolled at one of the institutions offering the course.</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/03/06/edx-expands-membership-structure-adds-12-organizations.aspx">edX is expanding its membership</a> by adding 12 new institutions including The Smithsonian, the International Monetary Fund and OpenCourseWare Consortium, plus universities in the US, Spain, Mexico and Japan.</p>
<p>Google is about to launch its own MOOC, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/26/google-announces-an-online-data-interpretation-class-for-the-general-public">Making Sense of Data</a>, which will run from 18 Mar - 4 Apr and will be taught mainly by means of video lectures and interactive projects, supported by community teaching assistants.&nbsp; According to Google, &ldquo;Making Sense of Data is intended for anybody who works with data on a daily basis, such as students, teachers, journalists, and small business owners, and who wants to learn more about how to apply that information to practical problems&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Donald Clark believes MOOCs are reaching beyond higher education into vocational learning, with the arrival of <a href="http://news.tes.co.uk/further-education/b/opinion/2014/02/21/39-moocs-have-burst-out-of-higher-education-into-vocational-learning-voocs-have-arrived-39.aspx">VOOCs</a> that are no longer the domain of just undergraduates and interested academics.&nbsp; He cites an example of a maths VOOC funded by the University for Industry charitable trust that he claims is the world&rsquo;s first &lsquo;adaptive&rsquo; MOOC that personalises the path taken by the learner through a network of maths topics.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is not about GCSE maths, but functional maths, the maths that most people find useful in the real world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katy Jordan was among the first independent commentators to start compiling and analysing MOOC user data.&nbsp; Now, her IRRODL paper, <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1651/2813">Initial Trends in Enrolment and Completion of Massive Open Online Courses</a>, draws together public domain data relating to enrolment and completion, from which she concludes that: &ldquo;The average MOOC is found to enrol around 43,000 students, 6.5% of whom complete the course.&nbsp; Enrolment numbers are decreasing over time and are positively correlated with course length.&nbsp; Completion rates are consistent across time, university rank, and total enrolment, but negatively correlated with course length.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jimmy Daly has also collated a number of visualisations of <a href="http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2014/02/harvardxs-and-mitxs-mooc-data-visualized-and-mapped">demographic data for HarvardX and MITx</a>.</p>
<p>Terry Anderson reports on a study of a Coursera MOOC which concluded that <a href="http://terrya.edublogs.org/2014/03/13/does-teaching-presence-matter-in-a-mooc/">teacher presence</a> had no significant relation to course completion, most badges awarded, intent to register in subsequent MOOCs or course satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Economist believes the rise of online tuition &ndash; particularly MOOCs - will <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21595901-rise-online-instruction-will-upend-economics-higher-education-massive">upend the economics of higher education</a>. &nbsp;However, the situation may be different for elite and less selective institutions, with MOOCs seen as a closer fit for the latter but quite different to the educational package offered by the former.&nbsp; Stanford&rsquo;s Caroline Hoxby believes, &ldquo;these universities may have threatened their own business model by embracing MOOCs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leah Belsky and Michal Tsur&rsquo;s edSurge opinion piece argues that, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-03-01-opinion-are-moocs-a-disappointment-or-a-gift">MOOCs have failed to meet some of our greatest hopes</a>&rdquo; but that they have succeeded in highlighting the importance of, &ldquo;high quality teaching and top teachers (not always the top researchers), which are critical for high quality learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvard Students in English professor Elisa New&rsquo;s &ldquo;Poetry in America&rdquo; lectures have been asked to <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2014/03/harvard_student.html">keep quiet and not ask questions</a> so that the sessions can be recorded without interruption for rebroadcast via HarvardX.</p>

<p><strong>Student Narcissists Favour Twitter over Facebook</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>US researchers have found that students (<em>n=</em>515; average age 21) who scored higher on measures of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2013.12.011">narcissism</a> were no more likely to post Facebook status updates or have more Facebook friends, whereas there <em>was</em> a correlation for the general public (<em>n=</em>669, aged 18 to 75; average age 33).&nbsp; However, students with higher narcissism were more active users of Twitter and were likely to say they posted updates to attract followers and to gain admiration on the site.&nbsp; The researchers suggest that Twitter may have a number of features that particularly appeal to narcissists, including the fact that relationships need not be reciprocal &ndash; people can follow you on Twitter, without you having to follow them.</p>

<p>But just how media savvy are &lsquo;digital natives&rsquo;?&nbsp; A new study from Northwestern University discovered that <a href="http://readwrite.com/2010/07/29/so-called_digital_natives_not_media_savvy_new_study_shows?awesm=readwr.it_j1MH">many students are quite na&iuml;ve, especially when it comes to search engines</a> and the ability to determine the credibility of search results.&nbsp; During the study, one of the researchers asked a study participant, &ldquo;What is this website?&rdquo; to which the response was, &ldquo;Oh, I don't know.&nbsp; The first thing that came up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Only 10% of the students made mention of the site's author or that author's credentials while completing tasks.&nbsp; Another interesting finding was that only a third of the students used Wikipedia to search for answers when given particular tasks, possibly because of teachers' insistence over the years that it is not a credible source of information.</p>

<p><strong>Global Online Education Report</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; University World News; Time]</em></p>
<p>The Sloan Consortium is partnering with a group of HE and inter-governmental organizations to generate a <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/02/24/new-global-online-education-report-to-study-impact-of-online-learning-worldwide.aspx">Global Online Education Report</a> (GlobalOHER) which will be based on empirical data on the state of online learning worldwide.&nbsp; It will include information on enrolments and programs offered online, the role of MOOCs, adoption of OERs, and strategies, challenges and policy issues relating to the delivery of high quality online education.</p>
<p>An internal report from <a href="http://philosophy.cornell.edu/epl/upload/CornellDistancelearning.pdf">Cornell</a> states that distance learning, and particularly MOOCs, &ldquo;holds much promise&rdquo;, advising that, &ldquo;Cornell should pursue a diverse portfolio of distance learning avenues, continually rebalancing it as evidence emerges&rdquo; but that faculties should not be, &ldquo;making commitments that adversely impact on-campus teaching and research.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I usually cringe at &ldquo;no programming skills required&rdquo; authoring tools, mainly because users end up working within the original developers&rsquo; vision of what components are available and how they should function.&nbsp; But then along comes <a href="https://www.oppia.org/">Oppia</a>, which has been largely written by a group of Google engineers in their &ldquo;20% time&rdquo; and so should hopefully contain some best-of-breed features.&nbsp; Oppia is an open source project that aims to let anyone create interactive online activities &ndash; alone or as part of a community &ndash; that enable students to learn by doing.&nbsp; It aims to &ldquo;simulate the one-on-one interaction that a student has with a teacher by capturing and generalizing &lsquo;interaction dialogues&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

Depending on the set of assumptions used, machine scoring of long form essays can be as low as 20 percent to 50 percent of the cost of human scoring given favorable conditions and major volumes of student responses&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <a href="http://elearningmanifesto.org/">Serious eLearning Manifesto</a> launched on 13 Mar:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that learning technology offers the possibility for creating uniquely valuable learning experiences.&nbsp; We also believe, with a sense of sadness and profound frustration, that most elearning fails to live up to its promise.&nbsp; We further believe that current trends evoke a future of only negligible improvement in elearning design&mdash;unless something radical is done to bend the curve.&nbsp; Finally, we have concluded that in order to elevate elearning to the height of its promise, we need to begin with a personal commitment to a new set of standards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has the backing of some big hitters, mainly in the US commercial sector, so it will be interesting to see what transpires.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Belinda Tynan; Audrey Watters; THE; Getting Smart; Paul Hoffman; edSurge; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Harvard is making some MOOCs available only to its alumni from next month in an effort to help Harvard graduates reconnect with the university and one another.&nbsp; <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/harvard-u-will-offer-exclusive-moocs-to-alumni/50265">HarvardX for Alumni</a> will offer versions of seven Harvard MOOCs exclusively to graduates of the university. The courses will not be full-length MOOCs but &ldquo;segments&rdquo; that include some new material developed specially for graduates.</p>
<p>One notable absentee from MITx/edX has been MIT&rsquo;s own <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-12/mit-sloan-follows-wharton-hbs-in-offering-mba-courses-online">Sloan School of Management</a>, but that&rsquo;s about to change as Sloan offers its data analytics course for free in the spring semester.&nbsp; Analytics Edge will offer the same curriculum for MOOC and campus students, including studies of the dating site eHarmony and the 2012 US presidential election, with MOOC students watching prerecorded lectures and submitting assignments online.</p>
<p>Belinda Tynan spots a &ldquo;slightly confused article&rdquo; in Business Week, reporting a Babson poll of more than 2,800 colleges and universities that finds 39% disagree that <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/academics-are-down-on-moocs-dot-business-schools-arent">MOOCs are &lsquo;a sustainable method for offering courses&rsquo;</a> (up from 26% last year).&nbsp; She comments that, <em>&ldquo;It wouldn't be entirely cynical to see this as a piece of simple product differentiation on the part of the 'elite' schools designed to bolster their position as custodians of the self-styled quality end of the market. &nbsp;MOOCs may indeed be the democratisation of knowledge but the thrust of the article is that such new-fangled devices cannot be compared with the personal treatment available at the premium end of the market&rdquo;.</em>&nbsp; She also wonders, if MOOCs are so poor, why Harvard/Wharton/MIT are still pursuing them, and is some form of hybrid solution possible that exploits MOOC precepts within a suitably supported student experience?</p>
<p>Diana Laurillard explains in THE why <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/comment/opinion/opinion-five-myths-about-moocs/2010480.article">MOOCs are not necessarily the answer to all our problems</a>.&nbsp; In particular she notes that content which may be &lsquo;free&rsquo; to the consumer is almost certainly not free for the provider, and she discusses in detail the myths that students might simply support each other through their courses and that MOOCs will bring education to the underprivileged.</p>
<p><a href="http://gettingsmart.com/2014/01/udemy-launching-android-app/">Udemy has launched an Android mobile app</a> which allows students to engage with course materials, watch videos on demand and download rich content for offline consumption.&nbsp; Udemy&rsquo;s existing iOS apps have already been downloaded nearly 1 million times and mobile course consumption now accounts for approximately 20% of content from Udemy&rsquo;s catalogue of around 10,000 courses.</p>
<p>Coursera is partnering with Discovery Communications (The Discovery Channel, Animal Planet) to offer MOOCs on their new <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/73302211026/now-explore-coursera-courses-on-discovery">Curiosity.com</a> online learning portal.</p>
<p>A new paper from <a href="http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/2014/898">CETIS</a> discusses three themes that have emerged from recent MOOC activity: the provision of scalable, open, online learning; different revenue models such as applying the concepts of freemium and premium offers; and disaggregated services such as offering paid-for assessment or support on top of free online course content.</p>
<p>edSurge offers an infographic that portrays <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-01-10-a-handy-cheatsheet-on-moocs">the size and shape of the current MOOC marketplace</a> and, although some data have been previously reported directly by Coursera, it still provides a useful numeric overview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if it&rsquo;s detail you&rsquo;re after, turn to <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2381263">Harvard and MIT&rsquo;s detailed research into participants in their first 17 MOOCs</a>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the standard demographic information we&rsquo;ve come to expect, along with some more interesting but rarely reported details such as ages of certificate-earners (Fig 6), when students enrolled relative to the start date (Fig 8), forum posts (Table 6) and course grades vs content accessed (Fig 13).</p>
<p>Even more detailed and varied are the just-published <a href="http://www.emoocs2014.eu/sites/default/files/Proceedings-Moocs-Summit-2014.pdf">proceedings of the 2014 European MOOCs Stakeholders Summit</a>.&nbsp; Even a rapid scroll through its 293 pages suggests that this must surely be required reading for MOOC theorists everywhere.</p>
<p>...but the most esoteric MOOC research of the month award goes to Cheng &amp; Shatin in EURODL for <a href="http://www.eurodl.org/?article=607">the emotional affordances of the massive open online course</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Athabasca Moving Away From Tutors?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Athabasca&rsquo;s Faculty of Science is moving to <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2014/01/28/is-athabasca-university-moving-away-from-tutoring/">a call-centre model of learner support</a> for some of its undergraduate courses.&nbsp; Students call with their query, are given a tracking number and then someone calls them back later, depending on who is available.&nbsp; This replaces a previous system more akin to the OU&rsquo;s AL/tutor model. &nbsp;The move is expected to save around $1m a year.</p>

<p><strong>BBC is 'Stifling' Educational Innovation</strong></p>
<p><em>[Belinda Tynan]</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;most biased and uninformed opinion of the month&rsquo; award goes to investment banker Hugh Campbell. He complains that the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/16/bbc-stifling-educational-innovation-claims-tech-investment-bank">BBC is stifling educational innovation</a> by giving away too much content for free, singling out BBC Bitesize as the main offender (an obvious next choice, given that the commercial sector managed to kill off the highly innovative (and also free) BBC Jam in 2007).&nbsp; Oh Hugh.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s probably more educational innovation going on right now than there ever has been.&nbsp; You just need to get over the fact that a lot of it isn&rsquo;t making you any money and start seeing some of those perceived threats as opportunities &ndash; for example, just think what a next generation of Coursera&rsquo;s <em>signature track</em> technology might do for reliable remote assessment across our industry.&nbsp; And, yes, we know MOOC completion rates are around 10% but that&rsquo;s not failure, it&rsquo;s a different &lsquo;normal&rsquo;.&nbsp; Have you read every textbook you own from cover to cover, Hugh?</p>

<p><strong>Puttnam: Fear of Technology May Hold Back Change in Education</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Americanization of British Higher Education</strong></p>

<p>NYT believes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/world/europe/the-americanization-of-british-higher-education.html?_r=1">Britain&rsquo;s 200-year-old degree grading system is broken</a>, reporting that 21 universities started to experiment in November with a US-style grade-point average (GPA) approach.&nbsp; The hope is that this could offer a better evaluation of students&rsquo; efforts and help solve grade inflation and other problems, although many British academics think the GPA method itself is flawed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think this GPA reform is a bit like giving academics American titles such as assistant, associate, or full professor.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the Americanization of higher education,&rdquo; said Christopher Hill, head of the politics and international-studies department at the University of Cambridge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will do what people are assuming it will do.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s likely to make much of a difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was all set to add a sceptical comment about the dullness and limited value of recorded lectures, but was stopped in my tracks by a blog post from Gr&aacute;inne last year in which she reported that <a href="http://e4innovation.com/?p=789">85% of Leicester students said they would welcome lecture capture</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Free and Low-Cost Learning Resources Not Popular</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>A Gates-subsidised OER trial in the state of Washington has failed to take off.&nbsp; Thirty-four institutions in the Washington Community and Technical College system were selected to offer <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/02/12/free-and-low-cost-learning-resources-fail-to-gain-traction-in-statewide-program.aspx">Open Course Library</a> materials in 42 courses per campus.&nbsp; But a survey of 25 of those 34 campuses found that only 2.8% of the 2,722 course units used OCL materials and that just 2.4% of students enrolled in the selected courses.&nbsp; However, a rose-tinted, glass-half-full spokesman said &ldquo;I don't think this data suggests the program is a failure. Quite the contrary: Students in the sections where OCL materials are being used have seen lower costs for those classes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Short-Fat vs Long-Thin Online Study </strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>US researchers compared 58 students studying <a href="http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/winter164/shaw_chametzky_burrus_walters164.html">an online undergraduate course on abnormal psychology, designed to have a 16-week duration</a>, with a group of 57 who took a condensed 8-week version.&nbsp; The former group achieved a mean final score of 756/1000, submitting 15.5 of 18 possible assignments, whilst the latter group scored 763 and submitted 15.6 assignments.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the paper is quite thin on background details so it is not clear to what extent this might be generalizable to OU students.</p>

<p>While Android is by far the most prevalent mobile OS worldwide, iOS remains particularly dominant in the US.&nbsp; Q4 figures show that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/27/apple-q1-2014-iphone-ipad-mac/?ncid=tcdaily">Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 26 million iPads</a>.&nbsp; The demise of the iPod comes ever closer as sales halved from 12.7 million (2012: Q4) to around 6 million.</p>

<p><a href="http://interact.stltoday.com/pr/business/PR123013062015461">LaunchCode</a> is a St Louis-based volunteer initiative that provides a way for people of any background to get a job in software development and help fill the current US skills gap. &nbsp;LaunchCode is taking advantage of an edX MOOC (CS50x, &ldquo;Introduction to Computer Science&rdquo;) plus free mentorship and partnerships with over 100 local companies who have agreed to take on inexperienced programmers traditionally screened out by HR recruitment processes. These novice programmers then are given &ldquo;pair programming&rdquo; apprenticeships at companies.</p>

<p>Duke was one of the earliest MOOC providers to publish stats a year ago, based on its first two courses.&nbsp; Kim Manturuk now reflects on life a year down the track and she suggests that the growth has been &ldquo;nothing short of amazing&rdquo;.&nbsp; <a href="http://cit.duke.edu/blog/2013/12/duke-moocs-year-in-review/">Duke offered 16 MOOCs during 2013</a> which attracted over 876,000 enrolments, 595k of whom visited the course website at least once, 443k watched at least one video and 108k attempted the first assessment.&nbsp; Of these, nearly 30k attempted the final assessment and were therefore deemed to have &lsquo;completed&rsquo;.&nbsp; Motivation for enrolment is perhaps surprising, with &lsquo;enjoyment&rsquo; being considerably more important than &lsquo;credentials&rsquo;.</p>
<p>New Republic also considers who&rsquo;s doing what with MOOCs, based on a <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116013/mooc-student-survey-who-enrolls-online-education">U Penn survey of 35,000 MOOCers</a>.&nbsp; The results are presented as an infographic, highlights of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most MOOC students come from the US (34%) followed by India (5.8%) and Brazil (4%), with the UK in fifth place (3.6%).</li>
<li>Around 80% worldwide already have a degree</li>
<li>Business, economics and social sciences courses have the highest enrolments (42%) and highest completion rates (7.2%)</li>
<li>54% would not have been willing to pay for their MOOC and a similar number enrolled for &lsquo;fun&rsquo; or &lsquo;curiosity&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Aimee Hosler suggests that MOOCs, and they types of people who are often attracted to MOOCs, may open up possibilities for <a href="http://www.emergingedtech.com/2014/01/massive-open-online-research-the-mooc-evolves-into-the-moor/">Massive Open Online Research</a> (MOORs) which she describes as, &ldquo;essentially a MOOC, but with a major emphasis on research&rdquo;.&nbsp; She explains some of the thinking behind UCSD&rsquo;s recent Bioinformatics MOOR which ran during last Oct/Nov which, in addition to standard coursework, also allowed students to work on research projects under the guidance of UCSD&rsquo;s &ldquo;prominent bioinformatics scientists&rdquo; from all across the globe.</p>
<p>MCT&rsquo;s Michel Wermelinger blogged last year on his early MOOC experiences and he now reflects on a further <a href="http://michel.wermelinger.ws/chezmichel/2014/01/moocs-some-further-experiences/">four MOOCs</a>, ranging from Data Analysis to Write Like Mozart.&nbsp; He believes there are, &ldquo;four common core mechanisms (video lectures, discussion forums, mix of short and longer assessment pieces and of automatic and peer marking)&rdquo; but that, &ldquo;clear, well-paced lectures are of course key, as they&rsquo;re the main teaching vehicle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Assignments that help turn theory into practice are good motivators, automatically graded quizzes can be too simplistic and peer-assessed larger projects are engaging but can introduce workload peaks.&nbsp; Differentiated activities good for keener students who want to be challenged and dive deeper, and model solutions are very helpful where tutor support is unavailable.</p>

<p><strong>Online Completion Rates Close to On-Campus Courses</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Completion rates for F2F HE courses are only slightly higher than those for online courses, according to a new report from WCET.&nbsp; <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2013/12/17/report-online-completion-rates-only-trail-on-campus-rates-slightly.aspx">Managing Online Education 2013: Practices in Ensuring Quality</a> found that, when comparing completion rates from respondents representing institutions offering both on-campus and online courses, rates for on-campus courses were just 5% higher.&nbsp; Among four completely online HEIs surveyed, completion rates averaged 89%, compared to 81% for on-campus courses.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Online Education 2013</strong></p>

<p>WCET&rsquo;s latest survey, <a href="http://wcet.wiche.edu/advance/managing-online-education-survey">Managing Online Education 2013: Practices in Ensuring Quality</a>, was most notable in my opinion for the have-nots rather than the haves.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>8% of institutions have no review process for new online courses (p21)</li>
<li>15% of responding institutions did not have any organisational quality standards for curriculum design and teaching of online courses (p9)</li>
<li>16% of institutions had &lsquo;no policy&rsquo; on whether their online courses met the needs of students with disabilities (p30).</li>
<li>55% of institutions were not able to provide completion rates for online courses (p17)</li>

<p><strong>2013 e-Learning Winners and Blaggers</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; The Ed Techie]</em></p>
<p>Martin Weller gives a &lsquo;bah humbug&rsquo; but entirely accurate perspective on many of <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2013/12/the-year-of-no-st-sherlock.html">2013&rsquo;s ed-tech innovations and discoveries</a>.</p>
<p>One of Audrey Watters&rsquo; end of year blog postings looked at the whole notion of &lsquo;open&rsquo;.&nbsp; Apart from references to Morozov, Aaron Swartz and Martin Weller, she presents a long list of <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/12/16/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-open/">open wins</a> as well as some announcements that she thinks are more akin to &lsquo;openwashing&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Educated Prisoners 'Less Likely to Reoffend'</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>A Ministry of Justice study of 3,000 English and Welsh <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-25668081">prisoners with access to education</a> showed 19% had reoffended within a year of release, compared with 26% of 3,000 similar inmates without.&nbsp; Participation in distance learning was found to be the best reduction method.&nbsp; The sample group included people studying a range of courses from Open University degrees to vocational qualifications.&nbsp; According to Prisoners' Education Trust chief executive, Rod Clark, &ldquo;Courses we fund typically cost &pound;250 a piece, which is a minor cost when set against the &pound;37,648 annual cost of a prison place.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Market Surveys</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; TNW]</em></p>
<p>Mixpanel analysed <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/27/what-the-data-says-about-how-we-spent-christmas-morning/?ncid=tcdaily">US online traffic on Christmas day</a>, reporting that overall activity was up 66% on last year.&nbsp; Of the 1.2 billion &lsquo;actions&rsquo;, 90% came from mobile devices and 25% of these were from tablets; 58% of all traffic came from gaming apps.&nbsp; One interesting pattern to leap out from the data traffic graph was that the US appears to collectively pause for breakfast around 10:00 on Christmas morning.</p>
<p>The latest Pew research report shows that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/30/pew-social-networking">73% of US adults use some form of social networking</a>.&nbsp; Facebook is the clear leader, used by 71%, followed by LinkedIn (22%) and Pinterest (21%).&nbsp; Twitter drops from 3<sup>rd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> spot this year (18%) followed closely by Instagram (17%).&nbsp; Frequency of use shows Facebook topping the &lsquo;used daily&rsquo; category (63%), whereas the &lsquo;used weekly&rsquo; figures show LinkedIn ahead (34%), presumably reflecting the less immediate nature of that site&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>The release of Windows 8.1 also brought with it IE11 and this boosted <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/01/02/ie11-triples-market-share-10-42-firefox-slips-bit-chrome-gains-back-share/#!ruFQ8">Microsoft&rsquo;s browser share</a>, with all versions capturing 58% of the worldwide market.&nbsp; IE11 rose from 3.3% in Nov to 10.4% in Dec, largely at the expense of IE10.&nbsp; Interestingly, good old IE6 is still hanging in there with a 4.4% user base.&nbsp; Firefox (all versions) has 18.4% with Chrome slightly behind on 16.2%.</p>
<p>And Gartner predicts that shipments of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/08/androids-rise-to-platform-dominance-in-one-graph">Android devices</a> will grow by about 26% this year to surpass one billion units in 2014, making it the clear market leader, way ahead of Windows and iOS.</p>

<p>Coursera has announced an additional <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/11/22/coursera-lands-20-million-in-new.html">$20 million in funding from three unnamed universities</a>.&nbsp; This means the organisation has raised $85 million since April 2012 &ndash; eclipsing MOOC competitors Udacity ($20m) and Udemy ($16m).</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/69518555384/this-holiday-season-learn-on-the-go-with-the-new">Coursera has launched an iOS app</a> that allows students to browse, search and enrol on courses, download video lectures for offline viewing, take quizzes and view their personal dashboard.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania surveyed 34,000 learners on Penn/Coursera MOOCs and found that 44% had some graduate education and <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/moocs-are-reaching-only-privileged-learners-survey-finds/48567">more than 80% had a degree</a>.&nbsp; They believe this pattern is true not just for the US but also for the BRICS nations, where, &ldquo;80 percent of MOOC students come from the wealthiest and most well educated 6 percent of the population&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, the researchers do caution that these findings may not be generalizable due to the low response rate.</p>
<p>Penn researchers also studied the behaviour of around a million (potential) learners on 16 Coursera MOOCs, finding that, on average, <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/from-a-million-mooc-users-a-few-early-research-results/48841">only half of those who register even watch the first lecture</a>.&nbsp; One interesting outcome to emerge is that courses with lighter weekly workloads and fewer assignments had somewhat higher completion rates than those that expected more of participants.</p>

<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Martin Weller; George Siemens; Wired Campus; Audrey Watters; Richard Easterbrook; Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>Sebastian Thrun&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gerald Ratner moment&rsquo; set the blogosphere alight.&nbsp; In an article in Fast Company Magazine, Thrun is quoted as saying (amongst other things), &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t educate people as others wished, or as I wished.&nbsp; <a href="http://higheredstrategy.com/udacity-has-left-the-building/">We have a lousy product</a>&rdquo;.&nbsp; Now, as part of an &lsquo;Open Education Alliance&rsquo;, Udacity will receive payment from Google, Intuit and others to help produce courses for employee training.&nbsp; Or, to quote <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2013/11/stop-me-if-you-think-youve-heard-this-one-before.html">Martin Weller</a>, &ldquo;Thrun has realised that not many people complete MOOCs, and that making them pay is a good incentiviser, so he's making Udacity an elearning corporate training company.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2013/11/15/the-failure-of-udacity/">George Siemens</a> is one of many with strong views on this: &ldquo;This is a failure of Udacity and Sebastian Thrun.&nbsp; This is not a failure of open education, learning at scale, online learning, or MOOCs.&nbsp; Thrun tied his fate too early to VC funding.&nbsp; As a result, Udacity is now driven by revenue pursuits, not innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Artist Rooms is a collaboration between Tate, the National Galleries of Scotland and the University of Edinburgh.&nbsp; In addition to a 2014 touring exhibition programme, they will also launch a MOOC looking at the life and work of <a href="http://uk.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/990349/education-for-the-nation-first-warhol-mooc-to-launch-next-year">Andy Warhol</a>.</p>

<p>edX is abandoning offering <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/edx-drops-plans-to-connect-mooc-students-with-employers/48987">job-placement services</a>.&nbsp; In a pilot scheme, edX identified 868 high-performing students from two Berkeley computer-science MOOCs and tried matching them to a handful of technology companies, including Google, Amazon, and SAP.&nbsp; But, of those 868 students, only three landed job interviews and none were hired.</p>
<p>Novelist <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n22/john-lanchester/short-cuts">John Lanchester</a> writes the London Review of Books about his experience of taking an EdX MOOC &ndash; Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science &ndash; which he found to be &ldquo;more rigorous, and more educational&rdquo; than he expected.&nbsp; However, I&rsquo;m not is the great and the good from Harvard will be completely aligned with his conclusion: &ldquo;I suspect a lot of the good they bring to the world won&rsquo;t be in the form of anything useful.&nbsp; Instead they offer anyone who can be bothered the chance to learn things just for the sake of learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gates-funded <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/12/06/mooc-research-conference-confirms-commonly-held-beliefs-about-medium">MOOC Research Initiative</a> has announced its preliminary results at a conference at the University of Texas but, so far, nothing ground-breaking has emerged: few active users, high drop-outs, high production costs, low returns, etc, etc.&nbsp; Sounds to me like the gravy train may be suffering from a few leaves on the line&hellip;</p>
<p>Martin Weller has also been funded by some of the money I spent buying MS Office 4.0 on 13 floppy disks in 1994.&nbsp; He blogs <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2013/12/completion-data-for-moocs.html">Katy Jordan&rsquo;s analysis of completion data</a> from 221 different MOOCs.&nbsp; You really need to see the graphs, but highlights include: negative correlations between numbers who enrol and % who complete, and between numbers of active users and % of those who complete; and a duration of 3-7 weeks looks to be more successful than anything longer.</p>

<p>Coursera celebrated its second birthday last month with an <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/students/Coursera Infographic (2).jpg">infographic</a> that encapsulates the enormity of what they&rsquo;ve achieved: 532 courses from 107 partners; 5.2m students in 190 countries who&rsquo;ve spent a collective 5,565 years watching videos and submitted 9.9m assignments.&nbsp; The one telling stat that&rsquo;s missing is the educational qualifications of those students, maybe because MOOCs in general still seem to benefitting more of the haves than the have-nots?</p>
<p>Coursera&rsquo;s partner list was swollen by the addition of 13 new institutions from 11 countries spanning the Far East, Russia and Europe, including the <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/64905875290/with-13-new-organizations-coursera-reaches-100">University of Manchester</a> which will be offering four courses in health, climate and sanitation.</p>

<p>Michel Wermelinger (MCT) has <a href="http://michel.wermelinger.ws/chezmichel/2013/10/a-tale-of-two-moocs/">blogged about his recent MOOC experiences</a>, having signed up for 5 Coursera courses, started two and dropped out of one by the second week due to its poor presentational style &ndash; based on webcam video lectures of up to 30 mins comprising quite complex narrated slides of text or graphical plots.&nbsp; His good example &ldquo;&hellip;was quite the opposite.&nbsp; Not only were explanations clear and the pace gentle, the lectures were professionally lit, filmed, and edited.&rdquo;&nbsp; He concludes, &ldquo;while [X] seems to be mostly reading out the slides he prepared for his graduate course to biostatisticians, [Y] seems to have prepared his course from ground up, as a MOOC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cindy Londeore has also had <a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/Journal/files/Tales_of_a_MOOC_Dropout.html">good and bad experiences of two MOOCs</a>.&nbsp; Her interpretation of having a &ldquo;basic knowledge&rdquo; of XML did not match that of the provider and she found herself struggling by week 3.&nbsp; In contrast, the prerequisites for her second course were more accurate and the modular structure with formative questions was more supportive.&nbsp; Cindy&rsquo;s experiences also form a chapter in a new online book, <a href="http://hybrid-pedagogy.github.io/LearnerExperiencesInMOOCs/TOC.html">Learner Experiences with MOOCs and Open Online Learning</a>.</p>
<p>Philip Guo has been <a href="https://mktg.edx.org/blog/optimal-video-length-student/1239">analysing edX student behaviour</a>.&nbsp; His first bog post is about video usage (in maths and science courses), with median engagement times suggesting most students will watch clips of up to 6 mins&rsquo; duration in their entirety but, thereafter, engagement drops off.&nbsp; However, this may not mean that longer clips are being abandoned: Seb Schmoller points out that, &ldquo;viewers of long videos may be watching them to completion in short segments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24804803">University of London</a> has revealed that 210,000 students signed up for its four initial Coursera MOOCs.&nbsp; Around 90,000 of these were regarded as &ldquo;active students&rdquo; but only 8,843 received a "Statement of Accomplishment" for successful completion.</p>

<p>David Willetts, writing 50 years after the Robbins Report was published, suggests that our HE system has become &ldquo;lopsided&rdquo;, with <a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/uk/universities-should-teach-more-29675786.html">institutions focusing more on research than on teaching</a> students.&nbsp; He argues that over the years, universities have focused primarily on research &ldquo;because that is where the funding and prestige came from&rdquo; but that the &ldquo;pendulum has swung too far away&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Educause Survey of Technology Usage</strong></p>

<p>Educause&rsquo;s latest <a href="https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERS1302/ERS1302.pdf">ECAR study of students and IT</a> is based on responses from 113,000 HE students in 13 countries.&nbsp; Key findings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students recognise the value of using technologies; basic things such as the institution&rsquo;s web site and VLE/LMS are most valued; most students still regard OERs, e-books, e-portfolios and educational games as &lsquo;experimental&rsquo;</li>
<li>More students are taking online courses, most prefer a blended experience, few have taken a MOOC and few say they would use a digital badge as part of a job application</li>
<li>Students own 2-3 internet-capable devices; smartphone and tablet ownership has grown fastest but laptops are still regarded as the most important devices for academic work</li>
<li>Students value their digital privacy and prefer to keep their social and academic lives separate; when communicating with staff, they prefer F2F, email and the VLE</li>
</ul>
<p>A separate survey of over 700 US students found that <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/10/21/study-documents-how-much-students-text-during-class">92% use their mobile devices for non-class activities during class times</a>.&nbsp; Main offences are texting (by 86% of students), checking the time (79%), e-mail (68%), social networking (66%), web surfing (38%) and gaming (8%).</p>
<p>And a study by Noel-Levitz shows that <a href="http://blog.noellevitz.com/2013/11/07/older-students-satisfied-online-learning-traditional-aged-students/">older students are more satisfied with online learning</a> than younger ones, despite the latter having grown up in an online world.</p>

<p><strong>Gamers solve decade old HIV puzzle in ten days</strong></p>
<p><em>[Elliott Masie]</em></p>
<p>Scientists from Washington University have been struggling for the past decade to decipher the complex structure of an enzyme which might hold a critical role in building a cure for AIDS.&nbsp; Gamers playing spatial game <a href="http://www.zmescience.com/research/studies/gamers-solve-decade-old-hiv-puzzle-in-ten-days/#GREtTPSVATe6ILWB.99">Foldit</a> have managed to collectively determine the enzyme&rsquo;s structure in ten days.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple Intelligences &ne; Learning Styles </strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Howard Gardner published his seminal book on seven &lsquo;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/10/16/howard-gardner-multiple-intelligences-are-not-learning-styles/">Multiple Intelligences</a>&rsquo; in 1983.&nbsp; Now, writing in the Washington Post 30 years later, he sets the record straight on one unanticipated development that has &ldquo;driven me to distraction&rdquo; &ndash; the confusing of MI with &lsquo;learning styles&rsquo;.&nbsp; Gardner explains: &ldquo;there is strong evidence that human beings have a range of intelligences [linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, interpersonal, etc] and that strength (or weakness) in one intelligence does not predict strength (or weakness) in any other intelligences.&rdquo;&nbsp; Trying to relate MI to learning styles or to our five senses is incoherent, so what should educators do?&nbsp; Individualise teaching as much as possible, teach important materials in several ways and with different activities/media, and drop the confusing term 'styles'.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media in Higher Education</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran] </em></p>
<p>Pearson has just published its annual <a href="http://www.pearsonlearningsolutions.com/higher-education/social-media-survey.php">Social Media in Higher Education survey</a> which shows that academic professional use of social media has lagged behind personal use but has increased each year.&nbsp; A majority of faculty now use social media in a professional context (any aspect of their profession outside of teaching) but use of social media for teaching purposes has lagged even more.&nbsp; This appears to be mainly due to concerns about privacy and about maintaining the class as a private space for free and open discussion, plus some concerns about the integrity of student submissions by this method.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial News</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Telegraph; University World News; THE; TechCrunch; Audrey Watters; Kineo]</em></p>
<p>The number of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10334140/US-universities-seeking-to-recruit-more-British-students.html">US institutions marketing themselves to British students</a> has almost doubled in four years.&nbsp; More than 9,000 British students took HE courses in the US in 2011-12, but this is expected to grow in 2013 and 2014.&nbsp; The number of British students taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT&ndash; the US HE entrance exam) has risen by a quarter in the past three years.&nbsp; UWN also reports that more UK independent school <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20130916153122157">sixth formers are seeking out university courses abroad</a>, according to headteachers of the UK&rsquo;s leading independent schools.</p>
<p>CBI chief, John Cridland, thinks <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/cbi-head-john-cridland-country-has-too-many-universities/2007619.article">England has too many universities</a>.&nbsp; He warned a fringe meeting at last month&rsquo;s Labour conference that some institutions are &ldquo;a little bit too small&rdquo; and are vulnerable to falls in recruitment from overseas.&nbsp; But Pam Tatlow, chief executive of Million+, challenged this view, suggesting that rather than &ldquo;too many students&rdquo; or &ldquo;too many universities&rdquo;, the problem was &ldquo;a funding system that is not doing the right things&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Government has introduced some <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/comment/opinion/elq-relaxation-is-good-but-part-timers-need-more-aid-and-support/2007964.article">reforms to ELQ funding</a> for some upskilling students, but Birkbeck&rsquo;s David Latchman argues that they should go further in supporting part-timers.</p>
<p>US for-profit <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/09/23/universitynow-makes-college-degrees-accessible-to-anyone-with-a-computer/">UniversityNow</a> has raised $20.4 million in funding to help build a network of accredited, online universities where students earn undergraduate and graduate degrees at a low cost and in a flexible environment.&nbsp; Students take an initial assessment which generates an appropriately adapted curriculum.&nbsp; Then, through a combination of online videos, textbooks, assignments, assessment tools and peer discussions with instructors and classmates, students move through the course until they are ready for final exams, which can be taken at home.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/26/academia-edu-2/">Academia.edu</a> has been quietly building a social networking platform for academics and researchers for the past 5 years and now boasts 4.3 million users.&nbsp; About 1m new users join every three months and around 150,000 articles are uploaded every month.&nbsp; The company has just attracted $11.1m in new funding.</p>
<p>Amazon is acquiring education technology company <a href="http://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/item/34487-amazon-com-to-acquire-educa">TenMarks</a> for an undisclosed sum.&nbsp; TenMarks provides personalised online maths practice and instruction to school students, with hints, videos and real-time results that aim to motivate and engage them.</p>
<p>Social publishing service, Scribd, has announced that the &ldquo;majority&rdquo; of HarperCollins US and HarperCollins Christian&rsquo;s back catalogue will now be available to its 80 million active users via <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/01/scribd-harpercollins-book-subscriptions/">Scribd&rsquo;s subscription service</a>.&nbsp; Readers pay $8.99 per month and can read unlimited books through desktop and mobile browsers or iPhone, iPad, and Android apps.</p>

<p><strong>MOOCs</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Stephen Downes; Paul&nbsp;Hoffman; THE; Audrey Watters; Adrian Bickers]</em></p>
<p>Harvard is introducing SPOCs (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247">small private online courses</a>) which are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers rather than tens of thousands.&nbsp; For example, Harvard has just launched a course in US national security strategy and, alongside the campus students, there will be a parallel SPOC version with a limit of about 500 online students, each of whom was required to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials in order to gain entry.</p>
<p>The government has published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/240193/13-1173-maturing-of-the-mooc.pdf">The Maturing of the MOOC</a>, a detailed 123-page &ldquo;literature review of massive open online courses and other forms of online distance learning&rdquo;.&nbsp; The headlines: MOOCs are disrupting HE; there are different perspectives on their value from faculty, employers and students (the latter &ndash; those that stick around &ndash; generally like them); and there is considerable lack of clarity over business models and ROI.</p>
<p>Stephen Haggard refers to both the previous items in <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/comment/opinion/moocs-from-mania-to-mundanity/2007773.article">Moocs: from mania to mundanity</a>.&nbsp; His assessment of FutureLearn is lukewarm: &ldquo;The pedagogy seemed to be that old favourite, linear instructivism: watch an expert presentation, do some reading and an assessment, then go on to the next class&rdquo; and &ldquo;Many courses reheat existing material&rdquo;.&nbsp; And of course, he&rsquo;s right: we really should invest much more public funding in giving this stuff away for free.</p>
<p>MITx will soon offer special certificates to students who complete a prescribed sequence of MOOCs (called an <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/mit-will-offer-mooc-curricula-not-just-single-courses-on-edx/46715">XSeries</a>) from MIT.&nbsp; The first XSeries &ndash; Foundations of Computer Science &ndash; will comprise seven courses that together &ldquo;will cover content equivalent to two to four traditional residential courses and take between six months and two years to complete&rdquo;.&nbsp; Students will pay roughly $100 per course, or $700 for a whole XSeries, with online proctoring software ensuring they are who they say they are.</p>
<p>Getting a <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-13/wharton-puts-first-year-mba-courses-online-for-free">Wharton MBA</a> involves taking off from work for two years, moving to Philadelphia, and spending about $200k on tuition and expenses.&nbsp; Now, with the provision of three new MOOCs &ndash; financial accounting, marketing, and corporate finance &ndash; via Coursera, students can get much of the course content for free.&nbsp; A fourth MOOC in operations management that&rsquo;s already live rounds out the &ldquo;foundation series&rdquo; and there are also five existing elective MOOCs, including sports business and health care.</p>
<p>Brazilian EdTech company, Veduca, is introducing the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/veduca-launches-the-worlds-first-open-online-mba-226142121.html">world's first open online MBA in Engineering and Innovation</a>, intended for professionals and entrepreneurs working in process management with a focus on innovation.&nbsp; The online video classes are free, but those wanting a certificate will have to pay a fee and prepare and present a final project to a panel of examiners as well as taking exams for each subject in-person.</p>
<p>The EU has unveiled <a href="http://www.openeducationeuropa.eu/en/find/moocs?retain-filters=1&rows=50&solrsort=ds_start_date desc">Open Education Europa</a>, a <a href="http://www.openeducationeuropa.eu/en/find/moocs">website</a> that aggregates MOOCs and other free online resources from European universities.&nbsp; There are currently around 140 MOOCs on offer, including those old favourites &lsquo;Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ohjelmoinnin perusteet&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Given the high drop-out rates, Phil Hill considers whether centralised discussion <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/mooc-discussion-forums-barriers-engagement/">forums are a barrier to MOOC engagement</a>, citing data from edX and Coursera that suggests forums tend to be dominated by a relatively small proportion of learners.</p>
<p>The French Ministry of HE has announced <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/node/2820676">France's MOOC and blended learning portal</a> which will use the edX platform. &nbsp;Over 100 HEIs throughout France will participate in the new venture, with the first CLOMs (cours en ligne ouverts et massifs) launching this month for starts in Jan 14.</p>
<p>The increasing rate of <a href="http://www.downes.ca/MOOC_Lit.htm">new information and opinions relating to MOOCs</a> makes it quite difficult to keep up.&nbsp; However, Stephen Downes has been doing his best to collate the notable items, which he&rsquo;s organised into articles, presentations and posts.</p>
<p>Volume 1, Number 1 of <a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/toc/mooc/1/P">MOOCs Forum</a> is now available and includes an interview with Peter Lange, Provost at Duke University, a SWOT analysis of MOOCs and a case study of the first adaptive MOOC (aMOOC).</p>

<p><strong>Khan Adds Personal Tutoring To Help Identify Skills Gap</strong></p>

<p><strong>e-Readers Help Dyslexics Improve Reading Speed and Comprehension</strong></p>

<p>US researchers have found that use of <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0075634">e-reader devices significantly improved reading speed and comprehension</a> when compared with traditional presentations on paper &ldquo;for specific subsets of these [dyslexic] individuals&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, it was not the device per se that improved matters, but its capacity to format text to give just a few words per line &ndash; which is known to improve matters for those dyslexics with visual attention deficits.</p>

<p><strong>Is Bunkr The New PowerPoint Killer?</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>It seems that gone are the days when hating Microsoft was an occupational pastime, but many of us still seem to harbour a grudge against PowerPoint &ndash; probably not because of the package itself, but the awful things some people do with it.&nbsp; Prezi promised a different approach but it seemed quite complicated and never really took off.&nbsp; Now comes <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/22/bunkr-is-the-powerpoint-killer-weve-all-been-waiting-for/">Bunkr</a>: a</p>
<p>web app that helps you collect visual content and organize it into slides.&nbsp; The resulting HTML5 presentation works on your computer, phone or tablet &ndash; and can be exported as a PDF or PPT as well.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Which iPhone?</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; Digital Trends]</em></p>
<p>The new iPhones arrived with a bang, with Apple reporting that the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/23/apples-iphone-5s-and-iphone-5c-sell-9m-units-over-opening-weekend-topping-5m-for-iphone-5-last-year">iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c</a> combined sold 9 million units during their opening weekend &ndash; compared with total iPhone 5 sales last year of just 5 million.&nbsp; Apple has also announced that 200 million devices are now running iOS 7, making this the &ldquo;fastest software upgrade in history&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But which one should you buy?&nbsp; Digital trends offers a helpful <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/iphone-5s-vs-iphone-5c-vs-iphone-4s/">comparison table</a> to distinguish between the iPhones 4S, 5C and 5S.</p>
<p>And then of course you&rsquo;ll need some apps.&nbsp; Research from Gartner is predicting <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/19/gartner-102b-app-store-downloads-globally-in-2013-26b-in-sales-17-from-in-app-purchases">102bn worldwide app store downloads</a> this year, 91% of which will be (initially) free.&nbsp; Those of us who chose to pay will spend a total of $20bn on apps and another 4.6bn on in-app purchases.</p>

<p>Paul Fain writes gives a <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/08/15/profit-kaplan-branches-out-learning-science-projects#ixzz2c72WVJwl">detailed assessment of Kaplan&rsquo;s fortunes</a> now that The Washington Post has gone its own way.&nbsp; The company introduced the Kaplan Commitment in 2010 a three-week try-before-you-buy scheme which saw student numbers fall by 47% and revenues drop by more than $600m, leading to plans to close nine campuses and consolidate four others.&nbsp; However, Kaplan is now back in profit, new student enrolments are up by 21% and Kaplan accounts for 62% of the WP parent company&rsquo;s total revenue.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/14/instaedu-series-a-battery-ventures/">InstaEDU</a> has just received $4m funding to expand its online service that allows students to instantly connect with a top tutor. &nbsp;Students can browse tutor profiles, message with tutors, connect instantly or set up a video/audio/text lesson with a specific tutor at a specific time.&nbsp; Tutoring sessions typically $25-45 per hour, compared with $50-100 for more traditional tutoring.</p>
<p>Australia is now the most expensive destination for <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20130816154944386">overseas students</a>, with annual tuition and living costs hitting US$38,000, followed by the US ($35k) and UK ($30k).&nbsp; Despite that, Australia remains popular with students, with a 2011 study showing that 21% of Australia&rsquo;s entire student population was from overseas.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/noredink">NoRedInk.com</a> is a web-based service that helps students improve writing and grammar skills by generating grammar questions based on their personal interests, Facebook friends and favourite celebrities, adapting quizzes and exercises according to student performance.&nbsp; The company has just received $2m in seed funding.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20130830182712660">University of East London</a> has ordered an investigation into its international activities after the closure of its Cyprus campus, which recruited just 17 students in its first six months.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/20/collegefeed-raises-1-8m-from-accel-partners-for-data-driven-platform-that-connects-students-and-employers/">Collegefeed</a> has raised $1.8m in funding to boost its social networking/crowdsourcing service that connects students with each other and potential employers.&nbsp; Its Facebook-like news feed lets students access tuition help, mentors, job opportunities and interview guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malaysia&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20130830115148971">Allianze University College of Medical Sciences</a> (AUCMS) has bought a 32-hectare site from Middlesex University for &pound;30m as part of its plans to expand into Europe.&nbsp; Around 300 existing students from Malaysia are expected to be on campus by October but AUCMS aims to secure accreditation as a British university in order to be able to enrol British medical students.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/failed-partnership-costs-london-met-2m/2007248.article">London Metropolitan University</a> has written off &pound;2m after its partnership with the privately-owned London School of Business and Finance collapsed.&nbsp; LMU was to have validated business courses and sponsored international students at LSBF &ndash; until the Home Office stepped in last Dec and stripped LMU of its licence.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mindsy.com/library/">Mindsy</a> is a UK startup that aims to offer a Netflix-style service for video-based e-learning content. &nbsp;A $29 per month &lsquo;all you can eat&rsquo; subscription will currently provide access to over 5,000 video lessons.&nbsp; Mindsy believes it can offer a wider spectrum of courses &ndash; ranging from computer programming to learning the piano &ndash; than competitors such as Lynda.com.</p>
<p>Two Texas Colleges are working with Pearson Education to launch the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/2-texas-colleges-will-offer-competency-based-hybrid-degree/46309">Texas Affordable Baccalaureate Program</a> &ndash; a 90-credit-hour online program leading to a degree in organizational leadership. &nbsp;The program will use a hybrid model that combines an academic coach and a competency-based curriculum created by Pearson and the two state institutions.&nbsp; The curriculum will be offered in seven-week sessions, each costing less than $1000, and can be completed as slowly or quickly as a student likes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who says there&rsquo;s no such thing as bad publicity?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/details-of-trump-university-suit-2013-8">The State of New York is suing Trump University</a> for alleged fraud on behalf of the 5,000 people who&rsquo;ve paid Trump around $40m, only to discover they weren&rsquo;t getting what they&rsquo;d been led to expect (e.g. pyramid selling techniques; have your photo taken next to a cardboard cut-out of Donald).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MOOCs</strong></p>
<p><em>[Pete Mitton; George Siemens; TechCrunch; Stephen Downes; New York Times; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://mooc.org/press.html">edX has announced a partnership with Google</a> to jointly develop the edX open source learning platform and tools.&nbsp; In collaboration with Google, edX will build out and operate MOOC.org, a new site for non-xConsortium universities, institutions, businesses, governments and teachers to build and host their courses for a global audience.&nbsp; This sees Google expand further into education, coming on top of Play for Education, Apps for Education and Course Builder.</p>
<p>Udacity has announced the launch of the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/opened">Open Education Alliance</a>, which aims to provide students worldwide with skills and knowledge to pursue successful careers in technology.&nbsp; Other partners include AT&amp;T, Autodesk, Google, Khan Academy and NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Coursera claims that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/12/free-massive-online-education-provider-coursera-begins-to-find-a-path-to-profits/">25,000 learners have signed up for Signature Track</a> since its January launch, generating around $1m in revenue.&nbsp; In addition, some 25,000 less fortunate learners have been given access to Signature Track at no cost by Coursera.</p>
<p>The City of Boston has teamed with edX to create <a href="http://opensource.com/education/13/8/bostonx">BostonX</a>. &nbsp;The programme will offer free online MOOCs available at community colleges and libraries throughout the city.</p>
<p>Udacity is different from many other MOOC providers in that it mostly makes its own courses (typically with a core team of around 8 people) and hires instructors to present them.&nbsp; Founder <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/education/online-learning/udacity-ceo-says-mooc-magic-formula-emer/240160169?pgno=1">Sebastian Thrunn</a> has also kept their course list small because, &ldquo;I want to solve the question of how to make education work and only scale up once I figure that out&rdquo; and he now believes he has the answers.&nbsp; Part of his formula is to provide plenty of support in the form of mentors, a help line and proactive phone calls to students but he believes the next big thing will be adaptive learning which can respond to learner performance and progression.</p>
<p>Princeton <a href="http://www.ecampusnews.com/around-the-web/coursera-prof-stops-teaching-online-course-in-objection-to-moocs/">Professor Mitchell Duneier</a> has announced that he will no longer teach his non-credit &ldquo;Introduction to Sociology&rdquo; MOOC despite having already reached more than 40,000 &ndash; because he is concerned that it could undermine public higher education.&nbsp; His decision was apparently triggered when Coursera asked him about licensing the MOOC so that other schools could use the content for a blend of online and offline instruction.</p>
<p>A MOOC on <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2013/09/09/creativity-mooc-draws-120000-students.aspx?=CTNU">creativity</a> is interesting enough (well, 120,000 people seem to think so) but so too is Penn State&rsquo;s attempt to cope with different types of participant.&nbsp; The course design allows learners to select one of three profiles that best suits their circumstances.&nbsp; &lsquo;Adventurers&rsquo; are those who are willing and able to make the biggest commitment to the course and get most involved. &nbsp;&lsquo;Tourists&rsquo; can pick and choose their course activities, whilst &lsquo;Explorers&rsquo; fall in the middle of the spectrum of course commitment and involvement.</p>
<p>The University of California, Irvine, is collaborating with US TV company AMC to launch a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23931078">MOOC based on a zombie TV show, the Walking Dead</a>.&nbsp; Academics from UCI say the course will be, &ldquo;academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show&rdquo;.&nbsp; For example, a physicist will look at the &ldquo;science behind decay&rdquo;; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as &ldquo;What can we learn from past epidemics?&rdquo; and maths lecturers will show how &ldquo;post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics&rdquo;.&nbsp; This may push drop-out rates to whole new depths&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.futurelearn.com/news/futurelearn-to-go-live-in-september-with-its-first-set-of-free-courses/">FutureLearn</a>&rsquo;s initial course list &ndash; containing MOOCs from over 20 UK and international universities &ndash; will be launched on Wed 18 Sep.</p>

<p><strong>MOOMs, LOOCs, DOCCs and SMOCs</strong></p>
<p><em>[NYT; Campus Technology; UBC; Pete Mitton]</em></p>
<p>Georgia Institute of Technology, in partnership with Udacity, will offer a MOOM (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/education/masters-degree-is-new-frontier-of-study-online.html?nl=todaysheadlines&emc=edit_th_20130818&_r=3&">MOOC-based Master of Science in computer science</a>) for $6,600 compared with on-campus fees of $45,000. &nbsp;Georgia Tech will provide the content and professors and take 60% of the revenue, with Udacity providing the platform and course assistants for its 40% take. &nbsp;The projected budget for the Jan 14 test run is $3.1m (including $2m from AT&amp;T) with $240k profits, rising to $14.3m costs and $4.7m profits in year 3.</p>
<p>An eleven-week DOCC (<a href="http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/docc2013/">Distributed Open Collaborative Course</a>) starts on 23 Sep, looking at technology through a feminist lens.&nbsp; Planned activities include a &ldquo;storming&rdquo; of Wikipedia to &ldquo;write women and feminist scholarship of science and technology back into our web-based cultural archives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The University of British Columbia is introducing its first LOOC (<a href="http://about.library.ubc.ca/2013/08/30/loocing-into-the-future-of-digital-learning/">Local Open Online Course</a>) as part of its Master of Educational Technology programme.&nbsp; The LOOC is essentially a localised form of a MOOC, open to all members of the UBC community.&nbsp; It will help users &ldquo;acquire, maintain, refine and promote&rdquo; digital literacy skills but they will be able to build their skills in any area, in any order and at any speed that they wish</p>
<p>Two professors from the University of Texas have just launched a SMOC (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324324404579045381967754304.html">Synchronous Massive Online Class</a>) on introductory psychology, with the aim of eventually enrolling 10,000 students at $550 and earning $$$s for their school.&nbsp; The pedagogic model is very simple the professors lecture into a camera and students watch on their computers or mobile devices in real time.&nbsp; I hope they&rsquo;re good.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC Analysis</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/2013/08/lessons-learned-from-vanderbilts-first-moocs/">Vanderbilt University</a> has published some facts and figures from its first three MOOCs that ran earlier this year.&nbsp; There was the usual downward trend from initial interest, watched a video, took a quiz, etc - but completion rates of 7%, 15% and 16% are at the healthier end of the current MOOC spectrum.</p>
<p>Detailed analysis of three recent algebra and stats MOOCs also comes from <a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/chemistry/People/Faculty/Collins_Research_Page/AOLE Report -September 10 2013 final.pdf">San Jos&eacute; State University</a>.&nbsp; These were remedial and introductory courses offered to &lsquo;at-risk&rsquo; students during the Spring.&nbsp; Emerging from 48pp of tables and graphs is the news that what mattered most was how hard students worked: &ldquo;Measures of student effort trump all other variables tested for their relationships to student success&rdquo;.</p>

<p>IET&rsquo;s second annual <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/personalpages/mike.sharples/Reports/Innovating_Pedagogy_report_2013.pdf">Innovating Technology</a> report has just been published.&nbsp; This is where that well known firm of solicitors, Sharples, McAndrew, Weller &amp; Partners, attempt to predict the future in terms of, &ldquo;new forms of teaching, learning and assessment for an interactive world, in order to guide teachers and policy makers in productive innovation&rdquo;.&nbsp; Their top ten includes some old favourites (MOOCs, badges, analytics), plus some interesting new arrivals such as seamless learning, crowd learning and citizen inquiry.</p>

<p><strong>Where Student Fees Go</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/highereducation/Documents/2013/WhereStudentFeesGo.pdf">Where Student Fees Go</a> is a new report from Universities UK which explains the effects of the shift from HEFCE grants to tuition fees.&nbsp; The report contains a number of national statistics and trends, plus numerous case studies from individual institutions.&nbsp; Some HEIs appear to have benefitted from tuition fee income whereas others have seen a reduction in income; high levels of investment in staff and facilities are evident and this seems to have had a positive impact on National Student Survey results.</p>

<p><strong>40% of University Language Departments Face Closure</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian]</em></p>
<p>A-level candidates for French and German fell by 50% between 1996 and 2012, and the number of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/17/language-teaching-crisis-universities-closure">universities offering degrees in modern languages has plunged</a> from 105 in 2000 to 62 at the start of this academic year.&nbsp; Now former government adviser, Prof Mike Kelly, warns that as many as 40% of language departments are likely to close within a decade.&nbsp; It has emerged that just 3% of EU staff are British despite the UK contributing 11% of Europe's population.&nbsp; The Foreign Office is so concerned that it has built its own languages school and is spending &pound;1m a year to bring the civil service up to scratch.</p>

<p><strong>LinkedIn University Pages</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>LinkedIn began life as a useful service to allow professionals to network with each other.&nbsp; That seems to have degenerated recently with the proliferation of seemingly endless (and often dubious) endorsements.&nbsp; However, LinkedIn is now trying to capitalise on some younger users&rsquo; reported lukewarmness toward Facebook by targeting <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/19/linkedin-growing-up-opens-up-to-high-school-students-over-13-adds-university-pages/?ncid=tcdaily">secondary school students</a> (13+ will be able to sign up from 12 Sep) and with the introduction of <a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2013/08/19/introducing-linkedin-university-pages/?sf16244573=1">university pages</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Students and Recruiters Suspicious of Online Education</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>According to a new report, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/f6f45fc4-0678-11e3-ba04-00144feab7de.html#axzz2el7833tM">See the Future 2013</a>, 50% of employers would not consider recruiting someone who had studied for their degree wholly online and more than 70% said they did not believe that an online degree offered the same opportunity for students as a campus-based one. &nbsp;However, 80% of those same managers and directors believed that their own companies would use technology to deliver more workplace learning in the future.&nbsp; Business students were also wary of online degrees: although more than 40% would consider studying for part of their business degree online, only 30% would consider studying on a MOOC. &nbsp;The report is based on responses from around 5,400 people from 137 countries.</p>
<p>A survey of 2,251 professors, conducted for Inside Higher Ed by Gallup, finds significant <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/survey/survey-faculty-attitudes-technology">scepticism about the quality of online learning</a>, with only one in five of them agreeing that online courses can achieve learning outcomes equivalent to those of in-person courses.&nbsp; However, many negative views are expressed by professors with little or no exposure to online learning.&nbsp; Only 30% of respondents had taught at least one course online, but 50% of these agreed or strongly agreed that online courses were as effective as F2F, compared to just 13% of professors who had not taught online.&nbsp; There is more universal scepticism about MOOCs with most respondents wanting faculties to be able to decide how these are used and that accreditors review their quality.</p>

<p><strong>Elsevier Launches Open Video Journal</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; Nature]</em></p>
<p>Elsevier has launched a new open journal on gastrointestinal endoscopy that <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2013/08/13/elsevier-launches-open-video-journal.aspx?=CTNU">includes videos with each article</a> because, &ldquo;many pathologies, current endoscopic techniques, and materials are too complex to be explained by conventional written articles.&rdquo;&nbsp; All content (including videos) are peer-reviewed; each video includes auditory comments and transcripts are included as plain text and PDF files.</p>
<p>A new report by the EU finds that the number of <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/half-of-2011-papers-now-free-to-read-1.13577">freely available research papers</a> is growing at a faster rate than expected.&nbsp; Researchers found that around 50% of research articles published in 2011 can be obtained via open-access journals or from other free online sources.&nbsp; Brazil appears to be the most &lsquo;free&rsquo; country, followed by the US, with Biology and Biomedical research topping the subject rankings.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook and Six Phone Companies Aim to Improve Internet Access</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Facebook has announced a partnership with Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Nokia, Opera and Qualcomm to launch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/20/facebook-internet-org/?ncid=tcdaily">Internet.org</a>, a project aimed at bringing affordable internet access to the 5bn people without it. &nbsp;Around a third of the world&rsquo;s population currently has internet access and this is growing at just 9% a year.&nbsp; Internet.org will see companies working together on data-compression technologies and cheap, high-quality smartphones to make the web more accessible.</p>

<p><strong>Every Little (Tablet) Helps</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Independent]</em></p>
<p>Reports are emerging that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/tesco-to-launch-tablet-computer-to-compete-with-amazon-and-apple-8774488.html">Tesco will soon launch its own brand of tablet</a>, rumoured to have a 7&rdquo; screen, run Android and sell for around &pound;100.&nbsp; The device will come loaded with apps for Tesco online shopping and banking, plus Blinkbox - the video-on-demand service Tesco bought two years ago. &nbsp;This will see the retailer compete directly with Netflix and iTunes, but with a possible deal-clincher of Clubcard points.</p>

<p><strong>Current Use of Blended Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Clive Shepherd] </em></p>
<p>A recent report from Kineo and The Oxford Group, <a href="http://www.kineo.com/documents/Free_Guides/Blended_Learning_Report_ 2013.pdf">Blended Learning: Current Use, Challenges and Best Practices</a>, is based on a survey of over 100 organisations.&nbsp; This found that 86% of organisations report using a blend of development methods; F2F is the most prevalent method (reported by 75% of respondents) but its use is decreasing, with self-paced e-learning at number two (51%) but on the increase.&nbsp; Expectations for the coming two years predict an increase in m-learning (56%), virtual classrooms (54%) and webinars, learning resources and social learning (all at 49%).&nbsp; Interestingly, 51% never or rarely calculate the return on investment or construct business cases as part of the blended design process.</p>

<p><strong>Planet Apple</strong></p>
<p>[TechCrunch]</p>
<p>Where to begin?&nbsp; Data from StatCounter shows how <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/09/apple-falls-behind-samsung-in-global-internet-usage-on-smartphones-pointing-to-a-low-cost-iphone-opportunity-or-challenge">Apple devices dominate certain markets</a>, especially in the &lsquo;developed world&rsquo;, but that Samsung is ahead in worldwide sales. &nbsp;Kantar WorldPanel presents a similar view based on latest <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/02/kantar-android-accounted-for-70-of-sales-windows-phone-grows-by-tapping-dumbphone-users">quarterly sales figures</a>, 65% of which were Android.&nbsp; Might all that change with the new &lsquo;cheaper&rsquo; <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/iphone-5c-1179311/review?src=rss&attr=all">iPhone 5C</a>?&nbsp; Probably not: the UK price will be &pound;469 for the 16GB model (&pound;80 cheaper than the new iPhone 5S, but still more expensive than the HTC One and Galaxy S4) &ndash; so nobody&rsquo;s yet predicting a flood of new recruits in China, India and other Android strongholds. &nbsp;Perhaps competition for Apple and Samsung might start to come from Microsoft, who are <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23940171">buying Nokia&rsquo;s mobile phone business</a> for &pound;4.6bn?</p>
<p>Analytics firm Flurry tells us <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/16/the-whos-and-wheres-of-ios-device-usage-explained">who does what with their iOS devices</a> and new analysts on the block, Appurify, lift the lid on how a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/06/new-report-on-apples-app-store-algorithm-change-shows-how-even-a-minor-ratings-shift-affects-top-apps">mobile app&rsquo;s ranking in the iTunes App Store</a> can be significantly affected by user ratings and other metrics in order to help determine its place on the charts.&nbsp; They also explain what causes some of the lower user ratings.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook in Education</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Audrey Watters; ASTD; Elliott Masie]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ednfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/Facebookguideforeducators.pdf">Facebook Guide for Educators</a> (20pp PDF) compiles the views and experiences of various UK educators and offers advice ranging from &lsquo;what is Facebook?&rsquo; and &lsquo;how to get setup&rsquo; through to examples and case studies on formal and less formal uses in education.</p>
<p>The newly published Almanac of Higher Education reports that <a href="https://chronicle.com/article/Almanac-2013-Technology/140801/?f-nav">94.8% of all US institutions have an institutional presence on Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>According to a survey of 1000+ senior managers, 68% of them report feeling uncomfortable at <a href="http://officeteam.rhi.mediaroom.com/file.php/1493/OT+Facebook+chart+FINAL.jpg">being &ldquo;friended&rdquo; by their bosses</a> or by the employees they supervise (62%) &ndash; up from 47% and 48% in a similar 2009 survey. &nbsp;In addition, 49% prefer not to connect with co-workers on Facebook.</p>
<p>Adam Grant reports on <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-grant/why-some-people-have-no-b_b_3909799.html">Why Some People Have No Boundaries Online</a>, suggesting that &lsquo;Integrators&rsquo; strive to blend their jobs with their private lives, tweeting or posting about their kids at work and sharing the same information with colleagues as family and friends.&nbsp; However, &lsquo;Segmentors&rsquo; like to keep their professional and personal lives separate; for example, they might use LinkedIn for professional contacts and Facebook for personal contacts.</p>

<p><strong>eBooks</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; BBC; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/07/its-almost-time-to-throw-out-your-books/">Oyster</a> has launched a Netflix-style service for books, offering subscribers unlimited access to its library of 100,000 titles for $9.95/month. &nbsp;At launch, Oyster&rsquo;s library offers titles from a wide range of genres, from sci-fi to biographies, including both classics and bestsellers.&nbsp; Of note is that the deal includes titles from Harper-Collins - one of the &lsquo;Big Five&rsquo; publishers who have been fighting subscription model tooth and nail.</p>
<p>Amazon has introduced <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/03/for-authors-amazons-kindle-matchbook-offers-plenty-of-upside/">Kindle MatchBook</a> which allows purchasers of print books to also buy a Kindle version at a discount.</p>
<p>The BBC reports on the rapid increase in self-published books around the world, and the fact that major publishing houses are having to find <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23810339">new ways to maintain their market share</a>, through innovative pricing or offering interactive features for their e-books to help stand out in a crowded market.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flooved.com/">Flooved</a> aims to offer open access textbooks for undergraduates, starting with Maths and Physics subjects.</p>
<p>And of course, the ongoing &lsquo;<a href="http://clintlalonde.net/2013/08/09/the-business-of-textbooks/">why do students prefer print?</a>&rsquo; discussion continues.</p>

<p><strong>Smartwatch Roundup </strong></p>
<p>Smartwatch stories having been simmering for several months, but we now seemed to have reached the point where the mockups and prototypes are tipping into actual products.</p>
<p>The $149 <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/smartwatches/pebble-watch.aspx">Pebble Smartwatch</a> launched a couple of months ago and, whilst not as pretty as some of the more recent launches, it uses an e-ink display which should help preserve precious battery life.&nbsp; The Italian <a href="http://www.imsmart.com/en/i-m-watch/overview">I&rsquo;m Watch</a> has been around for a few weeks and is more expensive (&pound;219) but more stylish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samsung&rsquo;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/04/hands-on-the-galaxy-gear-is-here-and-better-than-expected-but-is-that-enough/">Galaxy Gear Smartwatch</a> launched on 4 Sep, although no prices or shipping dates have yet been confirmed.&nbsp; Initial reviews are favourable but the Gear is tied very closely to other Samsung products (it currently <em>only</em> works with the Samsung Note III), so that will greatly limit initial uptake.</p>
<p>The &pound;160 <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-SmartWatch-SW2-Black-Metal/dp/B00DM2APM6">Sony Smartwatch 2</a> should be available any day now and claims to be &ldquo;the world's first Android compatible SmartWatch with one-touch NFC.&rdquo;&nbsp; Omate&rsquo;s <a href="http://inventorspot.com/articles/use_your_watch_your_phone_omates_androidpowered_truesmart_smartw">TrueSmart</a> is actually Android powered and will be available at $299 in time for Christmas.&nbsp; Unlike the competition, the TrueSmart is also a phone, whereas most smartwatches just link to your phone via Bluetooth.&nbsp; But of course, most interest surrounds <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/08/28/apple-projected-to-ship-nearly-65m-iwatch-units-priced-at-199-in-first-year">Apple&rsquo;s iWatch</a> - although this seems to be the furthest away from actual launch (predicted for mid-2014).</p>
<p>And once we&rsquo;ve all finished gasping at the coolness, it should only be a matter of time before developers start coming up with useful e-learning apps.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a great believer in the power of immediacy and, whilst it&rsquo;s no great problem to get your phone out and swipe/log-in, simply being able to lift your wrist is much more spontaneous and seems to open up all sorts of opportunities for just-in-time nuggets of learning.</p>

<p><strong>Blocksworld</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Having failed to takeover the (virtual) world with SecondLife, <a href="http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2013/08/blocksworld-linden-lab-second-life.html">Linden Lab</a> is now trying its hand at consumer apps and is doing very nicely with Blocksworld - which has consistently been in the top-ten grossing apps list since its launch last month.&nbsp; No firm figures on income, but New World Notes estimates that the current front runner, Candy Crush Saga, is generating income of around $880,000 per day.</p>

<p><strong>Researchers Demo First Brain-To-Brain Control</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not e-learning but it&rsquo;s fascinating.&nbsp; Two researchers at the University of Washington have created a remote, non-invasive, brain-to-brain interface (using a transcranial magnetic coil) that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/28/researchers-build-the-first-brain-to-brain-control-interface/?ncid=tcdaily">allows one person to trigger another&rsquo;s finger remotely</a> on a keyboard using his thoughts.&nbsp; They stress that this is not mind control or mind reading, but a way of sending a small shock to create a predictable but involuntary motion.</p>

<p><strong>One Laptop per Child Announces XO-4 Notebook</strong></p>
<p><em>[Engadget]</em></p>
<p>One Laptop Per Child has released further details of its forthcoming <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/15/one-laptop-per-childs-xo-4-touch-expected-to-be-released-in/">XO-4 Touch</a>, planned for release in Q1 2013.&nbsp; The device will be a notebook with a keyboard and a touch-sensitive 7&rdquo; 1200x900 display.&nbsp; Inside will be a Marvell ARMADA 2128 processor, 8GB of storage, 2GB of memory, an accelerometer, wi-fi and HDMI, SD and USB slots.&nbsp; No word yet on pricing.</p>
<p>However, Michael Horn, writing in Forbes, reports on the Peruvian government&rsquo;s five year initiative costing more than $200m to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhorn/2012/08/22/no-shock-as-perus-one-to-one-laptops-miss-mark/">equip 800,000 of its public school students with low-cost laptops</a> through the One Laptop per Child initiative.&nbsp; The purpose was to use digital technology to fight poverty by boosting student learning and yet the experiment is now widely assessed as having been a failure.&nbsp; Horn notes that simply throwing technology at education does little to improve it (e.g. the recent interactive whiteboard craze in our schools); transformations occur when technology, &ldquo;&hellip;has been implemented in a new learning model&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Education at a Glance 2012: OECD Indicators</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>OECD&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.oecd.org/edu/eag2012.htm">2012 Education at a Glance</a> report has just been released.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s comprehensive stuff (the highlights alone run to 91 pages) that compares and contrasts individual countries and political/economic groupings (OECD, G20, EU) in terms of education levels, student numbers, costs, benefits, the school environment and equity of access to education.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s such a lot of detail, it&rsquo;s difficult to find the key take-aways, although I did eventually find a useful <a href="http://www.oecd.org/edu/eag-2012-sum-en.pdf">four-page summary</a>.</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Media Use and Literacy </strong></p>
<p><em>[Seb Schmoller; Steve Rayson]</em></p>
<p>Although the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18873041">Ofcom annual UK communications market report</a> (reported last month) provides a detailed view of UK ICT, it did not contain any specific references to online learning.&nbsp; In contrast, the BBC&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/69vxaN8h5">Media Literacy: Understanding Digital Capabilities</a> (based on recent Ipsos-MORI survey data) contains a whole section on learning, starting on p27 (and with apologies for the clipart).</p>
<p>Google has published an interesting survey into <a href="http://steverayson.kineo.com/2012/09/google-survey-on-cross-platform.html">consumer cross-platform behaviour</a>.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, this shows that we use different screen devices, and that the device we choose to use is driven by context such as where we are, what we want to achieve and the time we have.&nbsp; Steve Rayson believes that most serious learning which requires time and focus will continue to take place on a computer, but that smartphones allow people to quickly look things up on the move (hence a need for &lsquo;performance support&rsquo; materials).</p>
<p>Following heavy criticism last month from a House of Lords committee, Jeremy Hunt has insisted that the UK will have <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19316824">the fastest broadband of any major European country</a> by 2015.&nbsp; He plans to bring high-speed broadband - which he defined as greater than 24 Megabits per second - to more than 90% of the country.</p>
<p>A study from the Oxford Internet Institute looks at <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6A71PvC3U">Low and Discontinued Internet Use Amongst Young People in Britain</a>.&nbsp; The report finds that assumptions and practices can make some individuals even more excluded from society because of a lack of support being offered; and a &lsquo;digital by default&rsquo; strategy works well for those who need to be persuaded to do online but not so well for those who are willing to go online, but find it difficult to do so for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p><strong>OER Inventory</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>Audrey has made a few recent posts describing her efforts to track down a <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/08/23/oer-types-by-the-number/">definitive list of available OERs</a>.&nbsp; She quickly recognised the impossibility of this, but settled on OER Commons as the best inventory and her analysis of topics, licensing, formats and popularity makes interesting reading.</p>

<p><strong>How &lsquo;Open&rsquo; is Elsevier?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Seb Schmoller]</em></p>
<p>Peter Murray-Rust is &ldquo;appalled&rdquo; by the way Elsevier breach licences and <a href="http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/08/05/elsevier-replies-about-hybrid-openacess-i-am-appalled-about-their-practices-breaking-licences-and-having-to-pay-to-read-open-access/">charge readers for &lsquo;Open Access&rsquo;</a>.&nbsp; He blogs on the matter at length, cites evidence from Elsevier and implores others to contribute to the debate and spread the word.</p>

<p><strong>Developing a MOOC</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>A post from the University of Edinburgh&rsquo;s MOOC team describes the challenges of <a href="http://newsletter.alt.ac.uk/2012/08/mooc-pedagogy-the-challenges-of-developing-for-coursera/">building a MOOC in the Coursera model</a>.&nbsp; Stephen Downes notes that Coursera courses seem to be designed to rigorously emulate existing academic practice, focusing on coursework, content and elevating the status of the professor.&nbsp; Rather than promote engagement, Coursera seems to move away from it, but he believes Edinburgh&rsquo;s partnership with Coursera presents an opportunity &ldquo;&hellip;to research the new and sometimes uncomfortable territory that the MOOC foregrounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Who Hangs Out Where?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Lara Mynors]</em></p>
<p>In the virtual world, just as in the physical world, different communities attract different types of people.&nbsp; <a href="http://libezproxy.open.ac.uk/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=77224146&site=ehost-live&scope=site">Harvard Business Review</a> presents a brief snapshot of one month's activity (March 2012) by US users in several online venues including Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube, along with their breakdown by age, sex, educational attainment, and household income.&nbsp; Example: if an organisation wants to target young, lower income males, Reddit is the place to go, whereas LinkedIn is the place for older, better educated and better paid surfers.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond Bars &ndash; Boosting HE for Prisoners</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>UWN presents a global view of problems associated with <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120823110036332#.UDuZBjLYSh4.mailto">educating and upskilling the growing number of prisoners</a> in order to increase employment opportunities and reduce reoffending rates.&nbsp; Several recent studies are cited from a variety of sources, with the general conclusion that we can and should do more.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps OU History Offers Some MOOC Answers?</strong></p>
<p><em>[JE]</em></p>
<p>Many educators are watching MOOC-mania with interest, wondering how things will pan out and which club, if any, they should join &ndash; but perhaps the OU could look to its own history for some of the answers.&nbsp; Although we haven&rsquo;t done much open/free content until fairly recently, we have been running hundreds of successful <em>MOC</em>s for more than a decade, so some of the things that are happening out there should come as no great surprise.&nbsp; For example, Wired Campus reports that many MOOC students are now, &ldquo;&hellip;increasingly <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/students-in-free-online-courses-form-groups-to-study-and-socialize/38887">forming groups</a>, both online and in the real world, to study and socialize.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hmm &ndash; sounds like OUSA groups, tutor groups, Moodle forums, FirstClass and CoSy to me.&nbsp; Can it only be a matter of time before edX and Coursera start sending out Home Experiment Kits?</p>

<p><strong>Pearson Bid for World Domination Continues</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC;</em><em> Tony Hirst; The Telegraph; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>Pearson is opening the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19245788">Pearson College</a> and will initially offer a business and enterprise degree course, costing &pound;6500 per year and validated by the University of London.&nbsp; The course will be taught in London and Manchester and will have about 40 places this year and a further 100 in 2013.&nbsp; Entry requirements are ABB, plus successful completion of an assessment day.&nbsp; Pearson wants to provide a degree which teaches practical, hands-on business skills.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have a network of blue-chip industry relationships, many of whom are working with us on the design and delivery of our degree programmes,&rdquo; said the college's managing director Roxanne Stockwell.&nbsp; An accelerated two-year option will also be available.</p>
<p>The Guardian asks how great an influence over education policymaking can and should a private organisation have?&nbsp; In addition to running Penguin and the FT, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jul/16/pearson-multinational-influence-education-poliy">Pearson</a> is the world's largest education firm, with core education publishing through brands of such as Heinemann, Longman and BBC Active, as well as ownership of the Edexcel exam board (purchased in 2003), the largest in the UK by volume of sales.&nbsp; Apart from secondary school exams, Edexcel has, since 2009, administered the marking of SATS tests for England's 11-year-olds (3.8m tests in 2011).&nbsp; Pearson also has a major presence in the US, particularly through testing.&nbsp; Hundreds of parents recently protested outside the firm's NY offices, unhappy at the company's $35m contract to provide controversial high-stakes tests for the city's schools.&nbsp; The company also reportedly has a five-year contract worth nearly $500m to provide tests for schools in Texas, and sets tests across other states including Florida, Kentucky, Arizona, Virginia and Maryland.&nbsp; Pearson has also announced plans to invest &pound;10m on running private schools in the developing world.</p>
<p>Some 211,000 books were <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9412013/Penguin-books-owner-Pearson-buys-self-publishing-company-Author-Solutions-for-116m.html">self-published</a> in 2011, either in print or digital form, and Pearson wants a piece of this action, having just bought Author Solutions from Bertram Capital for $116m.&nbsp; Formed in 2007, ASI has enabled 150,000 authors to publish, market and distribute more than 190,000 books in print and electronic formats, Pearson said.</p>
<p>Audrey Watters notes that <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/07/19/edmodo-25-million/">Edmodo</a> has raised $47.5m in three recent rounds of funding.&nbsp; She thinks that&rsquo;s a lot for a company offering a free social learning platform but, with 8m registered users, she speculates that they might be ripe for a takeover bid from Pearson.</p>

<p><strong>Coursera and edX Both Expand Memberships </strong></p>
<p><em>[Adrian Bickers; BBC;</em> <em>Audrey Watters; Tony Hirst,</em> <em>Seb Schmoller</em><em>]</em></p>
<p>Twelve more universities, including Johns Hopkins and the University of California, plus Edinburgh in the UK, have joined <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jul/17/top-universities-free-online-classes">Coursera</a> to offer free higher education courses online.&nbsp; Mike Boxall, of PA Consulting, compared the development to the changes that have swept the media and music industry.&nbsp; &ldquo;The interesting thing is that it effectively marks the provision of knowledge as a free good, which accords with young people's expectations.&nbsp; Now you've got the industry saying, we have to protect our offer &ndash; that offer is not the key to the library door &ndash; they have to provide something around that, the ability to use and interact with that knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MIT and Harvard&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-18972376">edX</a> has seen the University of California, Berkeley join its ranks.&nbsp; Berkeley will present two courses this autumn in software and artificial intelligence.&nbsp; MIT will offer courses in chemistry and computer science and Harvard will run courses in health statistics and computer science.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/07/17/considering-courseras-expansion/">Audrey Watters</a> considers where this is all going, and the implications for universities that are trying to justify campus <em>and</em> MOOC existences.&nbsp; Coursera&rsquo;s Daphne Koller noted that there is a, &ldquo;growing amount of content out there on the Web ...&nbsp; the value proposition for the university isn&rsquo;t getting the content out there but rather the personal interaction between faculty and students and students and students.&rdquo;&nbsp; University of Michigan (and Coursera) professor Scott Page says, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s talk about how online education&rsquo;s going to wipe out universities, but a lot of what we do on campus is help people transition from 18 to 22, and that is a complicated thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; He suggests MOOCs would be most helpful to &ldquo;people 22 to 102, international students and smart retired people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Atlantic&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/the-single-most-important-experiment-in-higher-education/259953/">Jordan Weissmann</a> also looks under the bonnet, citing a recent US poll that showed that 58% of professors were more afraid of online learning than excited by it, with two thirds claiming that learning outcomes on the web were inferior to in-person instruction.&nbsp; He notes that Coursera does not consider itself an alternative to a traditional university. Rather, it's more of a market for learning. Schools that design classes for Coursera retain the rights to their work, meaning it's a risk-free way for them to dip into online education without building the technology infrastructure from scratch.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been no end of coverage and discussion on MOOCs in the past month.&nbsp; Rather than try and capture it all here, I&rsquo;ll direct you to OUNL&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.scoop.it/t/networked-learning-learning-networks">Peter B. Sloep&rsquo;s Scoop.it page</a> which is oozing with MOOC-flavoured news and information.</p>

<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/16/bbc-worldwide-25m-app-downloads-including-1m-for-global-iplayer-digital-now-nearly-13-of-revenues/">BBC Worldwide&rsquo;s annual review</a> shows headline sales of &pound;1,085 million, with digital now making up 12.8% of revenue (up from 8.1% last year).&nbsp; The boost in digital appears to be due to two main growth areas: the growth of apps and video-on-demand.&nbsp; BBC Worldwide says that it saw 12.5 million app downloads in the last year, including 1m for global iPlayer, whilst cumulative VOD downloads now stand at 31 million.</p>

<p><strong>The Rise of the Multinational University</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; THE]</em></p>
<p>More than 200 degree-granting international branch <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120802130423710">campuses of universities are now located in foreign countries</a>.&nbsp; However, a new report from the University of Sydney Business School says universities are considering transforming the branch campus model into fully fledged multinational universities, with a focus on China because of its scale and rapid development, and Singapore because of its aggressive government policy and high level of development.&nbsp; Although Australia has only 12 such offshore campuses, it educates more students on them than any other country &ndash; almost 28,000 &ndash; nearly as many as the UK (about 18,000) and the US (slightly more than 13,000) combined.&nbsp; The report predicts that, by 2020, the world&rsquo;s four largest countries in terms of population &ndash; China, India, Indonesia and the US &ndash; will account for more than half the global population of university-aged young people.</p>
<p>In the UK, there are concerns over <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=420807&c=1">the willingness of EU students to repay student loans</a>.&nbsp; Undergraduates from EU countries outside the UK have access to fee loans but, while UK graduates have repayments automatically deducted from their payslips, the system relies on their EU counterparts providing earnings data upon their return home.&nbsp; David Willetts has stated that &ldquo;2,800 or 9 per cent of EU borrowers liable to repay were considered to be in arrears&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, Student Loans Company data show another 33% as &ldquo;not currently repaying - further information being sought&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Is the US HE Bubble About to Burst?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran; University World News]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21559936?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/the_college_cost_calamity">Long-term debt</a> at not-for-profit universities in the US has been growing at 12% a year, according to a new report which examined the finances of 1,692 universities and colleges between 2006 and 2010, finding that one-third were significantly weaker.&nbsp; The report found that the average cost of college per student has risen by three times the rate of inflation since 1983 &ndash; an increase that cannot continue.</p>
<p>In a separate report, senator Tom Harkin questions the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/30/for-profit-colleges-senate-report_n_1721058.html?utm_hp_ref=business">value for money offered by the US for-profit sector</a>.&nbsp; The US feeds $32 bn of taxpayer dollars into an industry that often provides misleading sales pitches, poor quality programs and high dropout rates.&nbsp; Harkin notes that 30 large companies that own for-profit colleges employed more than 35,000 recruiters, yet had only about 3,500 employees working in career services and 12,400 working in student support.&nbsp; In 2009, they spent $4.2 bn on marketing but only $3.2 bn on instruction.</p>

<p>Pew Internet has just released its 2012 <a href="https://www.elon.edu/docs/e-web/predictions/expertsurveys/2012survey/PIP_Future_Internet_Higher_Education_7-27-12.pdf">Future of the Internet</a> survey, with report number eight (of eight) looking at the future impact of the Internet on higher education and finding that the &ldquo;experts&rdquo; questioned expect more efficient collaborative environments and new grading schemes; they worry about massive online courses and the shift away from on-campus life.&nbsp; I found the absence of any index/contents made it frustrating read, but Tony Bates obviously persevered and has generated a good <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2012/07/28/the-impact-of-online-learning-on-the-future-of-higher-education-a-response-to-the-study-from-the-pewresearchcentre/">analysis of the content</a>.</p>
<p>Ambient Insight&rsquo;s latest examination of the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/north-american-elearning-market-to-reach-272-billion-by-2016-163944576.html">North American eLearning market</a> predicts a &ldquo;modest growth rate of 4.4%&rdquo; from $21.9 bn last year to $27.2 bn by 2016.&nbsp; The fastest growing products (9% pa) will be cloud-based authoring tools and learning platforms.&nbsp; North America accounts for 62% of the world market and, according to Chief Research Officer, Sam Adkins, &ldquo;While the growth rate may seem low compared to the other regions in the world, the revenues are very high.&nbsp; Additionally, growth rates are much higher in specific buying segments.&nbsp; For example, the growth rates in the Canadian and US healthcare segments are 16.8% and 12.8%, respectively.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A survey of more than 600 US organisations by eLearning! magazine found that enterprise learning and workplace technologies are growing across public and private sectors.&nbsp; <a href="http://elmezine.epubxp.com/i/74275/14">Spending for e-learning</a> is predicted to &ldquo;soar&rdquo; in 2012, boosted by an increase in mobile learning, e-learning development and social learning networks.</p>

<p><strong>Is the Academic Publishing Industry on the Verge of Disruption?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; University World News]</em></p>
<p>There have been items in previous digests about universities in the UK and US fighting against <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/07/23/is-the-academic-publishing-industry-on-the-verge-of-disruption">increasing subscription fees charged by academic journal publishers</a>.&nbsp; A detailed article in US News follows up on the letter published by Harvard in April which revealed it was paying $3.75m annually in subscriptions, with a few journals costing upward of $40,000 a year each, noting, &ldquo;Prices for online content from two providers have increased by about 145% over the past six years.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is now more of a move to self-publishing and open-access (fuelled by the rise of Kindle/iPad) by academics, but about 80% of a journal publisher's subscription revenue still comes from university libraries.&nbsp; With some commercial publishers generating profit margins of &gt;30%, many have questioned whether taxpayers are simply shelling out money to prop up an extremely profitable industry.</p>
<p>The UK government&rsquo;s announcement last month that it would require much of the country&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/europe-joins-uk-open-access-bid-1.11022">taxpayer-funded research to be open-access</a> from next April has been followed by a similar move from the EU.&nbsp; This new proposal will open up all the work funded by its Horizon 2020 research programme that will run, at a cost of &euro;80bn, from 2014 to 2020.&nbsp; The EU is aiming for 60% of all European publicly funded research articles to be open access by 2016.</p>

<p><strong>Ofcom: Texting Overtakes Talking in UK</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18873041">Ofcom&rsquo;s annual UK communications market report</a>, 58% of people (and 96% of 16 to 24-year-olds) communicated via texts on a daily basis in 2011, whereas only 47% made a daily mobile call.&nbsp; For the first time, over half (52%) of all call volumes were made from mobile phones.&nbsp; The report finds that 39% of adults now own a smartphone, 11% own a tablet (which Ofcom describes as a &ldquo;snacking version&rdquo; of the home PC) and over half of all UK households now have three or more internet-enabled devices.&nbsp; Household internet access rose to 80% in Q1 2012 and broadband access stood at 76%.&nbsp; This may now be approaching a natural ceiling, as one in seven UK adults do not intend to get the internet in the next year; this rises to 33% of people aged 65-74 and two thirds of those aged 75 or over.</p>

<p>Android and iOS combined account for 85% of the smart phone marketplace, making it a clear two-horse race, with Blackberry, Symbian and Windows trailing badly at 4.8%, 4.4% and 3.5% market share respectively.</p>

<p>On the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/07/olympics_design.html">BBC internet blog site</a>, Nick Haley gives a fascinating insight into how the Beeb&rsquo;s desktop, tablet, mobile and connected TV sites were designed in terms of their features, layout, usability and testing.&nbsp; The Corporation reports 2m downloads of its Olympic app and 55m worldwide online visits to its sports coverage during the games (and video is apparently remaining live on its <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/2012/">Olympic site</a> until January); however, according to <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/olympics-online-who-won-the-gold-medal-for-best-website.php">ReadWriteWeb&rsquo;s assessment of Olympic sites</a>, it only gets a bronze, having been pipped at the post by the New York Times and the Guardian.&nbsp; There are also several good interactive examples on the <a href="http://elearningexamples.com/?s=olympic">ElearningExamples site</a>, including an excellent unpicking of a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/19/sports/olympics/the-toughest-vault.html">gymnastic vault</a> (NY Times), an analysis of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/olympic_infographics_and_data/9397299/Olympics-2012-Team-GB-athletes-diets-interactive.html">an Olympian&rsquo;s diet</a> (Telegraph) and an HTML5 <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/interactive/2012/jul/23/could-you-be-a-medallist">&lsquo;could you be a medallist?&rsquo;</a> game (Guardian).</p>
<p>Mashable reports that the games generated around <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/08/13/olympics-generated-150-million-tweets/">150 million tweets</a>, including one which reunited a man with his <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/08/15/twitter-olympic-ticket/">lost Olympic ticket</a>, and an infographic from EDF Energy tracked <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/08/13/uk-twitter-olympics/">the UK&rsquo;s twitter mood</a> during each day of the games.</p>

<p><strong>BPP to Offer Healthcare Degrees</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>Private provider BPP, best known for offering business, accountancy and law programmes, is set to offer <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-18712289">degrees to the health sector</a>.&nbsp; The company is launching a School of Health and will offer courses in psychology and nursing, starting this autumn, with a three-year degree priced at &pound;15,000 or a fast-track two-year programme at &pound;12,000.&nbsp; BPP&rsquo;s Carl Lygo said, &ldquo;We have some exciting growth plans for the next five years, which include expanding into other sectors, increasing our range of programmes and providing highly flexible methods of study.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, UEL&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/VC_UEL">Prof Patrick McGhee</a> is one of many following this on Twitter and he notes that many of the BPP health-sector courses do not seem to be aiming for recognition by professional bodies.</p>

<p><strong>Private Providers to Compete Directly With Universities on Places</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; BBC]</em></p>
<p>In its response to the public consultation on the HE White Paper, the government says it will create a &ldquo;level playing field&rdquo; without primary legislation.&nbsp; This will allow <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=420263&c=1">private providers to compete directly with universities</a> for undergraduate places, operating under the same controls on the number of students accessing public loans, and the same quality assurance regime, as the rest of the sector.&nbsp; The number of students receiving publicly funded loans to attend private providers will no longer be uncapped, although David Willetts noted that providers currently accounted for &ldquo;less than 1 per cent&rdquo; of the student loans pot.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don't think existing providers will lose out,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>However, concerns have been expressed by UCU and UUK that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-18812103">ministers are &ldquo;falling over themselves&rdquo;</a> to approve degree and diploma-level courses at private colleges in England.&nbsp; The Student Loans Company checks course descriptions against information on courses in the public domain, but David Willetts said in a parliamentary written answer that such checks did not cover the quality of education provided.&nbsp; A total of 403 courses were approved in 2011-12, up by 77% from the previous year, with one college having 98 courses approved by officials in just a single day.</p>

<p><strong>Gates Support for MOOCs</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; eLearn Magazine; Pete Mitton; Nick Watson; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>The Gates Foundation has announced $9m in grants to support new approaches to HE, including its first contribution to MOOCs.&nbsp; Specifically, <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/gates-foundation-gives-9-million-in-grants-to-support-breakthrough-business-models/37037">the Gates Foundation is giving $1m to MIT for its MITx project</a> to support the teaching of low-income students who will use MITx materials plus traditional classroom time at their own institution for additional exercises and to get help when they&rsquo;re stuck.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a test to see how much can students get from what&rsquo;s in the MITx course, and what do they need to get supplemented ... and what&rsquo;s the best way to support faculty in the blended environment,&rdquo; said Gates&rsquo; Josh Jarrett.&nbsp; The foundation is also giving $500k to the University of the People, which uses volunteer professors to teach online courses that are free to students.</p>
<p>(Of course, not everyone is a fan of MITx.&nbsp; Dan Butin explains in eLearn Magazine how <a href="http://elearnmag.acm.org/archive.cfm?aid=2263018">MIT got it wrong</a> and they should really have done.)</p>
<p>San Francisco-based <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120621/universitynow-another-vc-backed-online-college-but-this-ones-not-elite/">UniversityNow</a> raised $17.3m in funding to help create a network of affordable online colleges for adults; this includes a $300k research grant from the Gates and Hewlett Foundations.&nbsp; The company&rsquo;s New Charter University charges $199 per month for as many courses as students can take at one time, including books.&nbsp; Students have access to individual student advisers and subject-matter experts and are assessed on competencies - courses can only be completed once the system determines they are ready to pass the final exam.</p>
<p>Also making the news, although they got their Hewlett funding a while back, is the <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/In-This-Online-University/132307/?cid=wc&utm_source=wc&utm_medium=en">Peer-to-peer university</a> (P2PU) - an online institution where students learn together and support each other, at no charge, using materials found on the Web. &nbsp;P2PU began offering courses in 2009 and now has about 33,000 registered users, with about 1,700 joining each month.&nbsp; Courses, are offered in five languages and typically last six weeks.</p>
<p>Audrey Watters notes that the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/07/12/education-technology-as-content-delivery/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+HackEducation+(Hack+Education)&utm_content=Google+Reader">Khan Academy claims to have delivered over 168,000,000 lessons</a>, although she queries what that means in terms of learning quality, noting that McDonalds famously claims to have served &ldquo;over 200 billion&rdquo;.&nbsp; She also questions our current obsession with <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/07/03/who-will-benefit-from-badges">badges</a> and wonders just who benefits from them.</p>
<p>Finally, if you&rsquo;re done with MOOCs, Seb Schmoller now invites you to consider whether <a href="http://fm.schmoller.net/2012/07/the-emergence-of-mass-on-line-tutoring-systems-mots.html">Mass Online Tutoring Systems (MOTS)</a> might be the next big thing.</p>

<p><strong>Free Access to British Scientific Research Within Two Years</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian]</em></p>
<p>The Government will today announce plans to make <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jul/15/free-access-british-scientific-research">publicly funded scientific research available for anyone to read for free by 2014</a>.&nbsp; Under the scheme, research papers that describe work paid for by the British taxpayer will be free online for universities, companies and individuals to use for any purpose, wherever they are in the world.&nbsp; The move reflects a groundswell of support for open access publishing among academics who have long protested that journal publishers make large profits by locking research behind online paywalls.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the taxpayer has paid for this research to happen, that work shouldn't be put behind a paywall before a British citizen can read it,&rdquo; said David Willetts.</p>

<p><strong>Tablet Heaven</strong></p>
<p><em>[ZDnet; TechRadar; Web Citation; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Although there seem to be mixed messages about a UK release date for <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/google-nexus-7-release-date-news-and-features-1051918">Google&rsquo;s new 7&rdquo; Nexus tablet</a>, sometime in July looks certain.&nbsp; With prices of &pound;159 (8GB) and &pound;199 (16GB) &ndash; both including &pound;15 Google Play credit &ndash; it looks like a clear (if slightly smaller) threat to the iPad in the consumer marketplace.</p>
<p>Microsoft has announced <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-surface-will-be-a-real-ipad-rival-in-the-enterprise-say-cios-7000000714/">Surface, its new Windows 8-based tablet</a>, although launch dates and pricing are not yet clear.&nbsp; There were initial suggestions that they may have irritated other manufacturers by introducing their own competing device, and that they may confuse consumers who try to decide what the difference is between Intel and ARM-based models.&nbsp; However, ZDnet cites three international &lsquo;juries&rsquo; of CIOs, all of whom see Surface as a realistic iPad rival.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/68DlEA0XW">Tablet Landscape Evolution</a> paper offers a detailed analysis of the hardware, software and supply chain landscape, arriving at three key takeaways: (1) tablet shipments in the last two years were over 20% higher than MS previously estimated and purchase intentions indicate shipments of 133 million and 216 million in 2012 and 2013; (2) survey responses suggest 25% of users expect to buy Windows 8 tablet, with MS Office being a key feature in that decision; and (3) pricing is the key variable that will determine the success of Microsoft and its partners and there is potential for MS to heavily discount Win 8 + Office, charging $82-114 before OEMs would lose money on tablets.</p>
<p>The Pearson Foundation also notes astonishing growth, and that <a href="http://doteduguru.com/id8265-how-tablets-will-change-higher-ed.html">ownership by US college students has tripled in the past 12 months</a> so that a quarter of them now own such a device.&nbsp; Research by Nielsen uncovers notable differences on how tablets are used: 59% of smartphone owners use their devices while shopping and running errands and 47% use them while commuting.&nbsp; These figures fall significantly for tablet owners, to 21% and 20% respectively &ndash; it seems that tablet owners spend a majority of their time on the devices when they&rsquo;re either watching TV or lying in bed.</p>

<p><strong>Insights into Corporate Moodle</strong></p>
<p><em>[eLearnity; Zite]</em></p>
<p>eLearnity&rsquo;s David Wilson has published a detailed report offering <a href="http://www.elearnity.com/EKCLoad.html?load=ByKey/AJOS8VQCM4">Insights into Corporate Moodle</a>.&nbsp; It looks at Moodle&rsquo;s origins, aims, evolution, use by the corporate sector and issues arising.&nbsp; It also includes (on p28) a comprehensive case study of the OU, its use of Moodle and its role in shaping and developing the core system.</p>
<p>Moodle HQ has announced that further development of its iOS/Android MyMoodle apps will cease, to be replaced by a new modular <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=206758">Mobile Moodle</a> app developed in HTML5+Phonegap.</p>
<p>The Moodle community has developed a plugin for Moodle 2.3 which <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ukschools/archive/2012/07/13/linking-skydrive-and-moodle-together.aspx">allows users to save their files into Microsoft&rsquo;s SkyDrive directly from Moodle</a>.</p>

<p><strong>HE Cheating Disputes Quadruple</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=420269">Complaints by students</a> against universities in England and Wales have increased by 20%, and expectations are that this will increase further next year when higher fee-payers are taken into account.&nbsp; Most complaints concerned academic grades, assessments and appeals, with 10% relating to alleged breaches of contract between universities and students and 6% relating to disputes over plagiarism.</p>

<p><strong>EU Urges Better Deal for Disabled Students</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>An EC policy paper has encouraged EU member states to work harder at helping disabled students to gain university places and good degrees, with data showing that their life chances improve considerably with higher education.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2012071310164734#.UAJ-8DFAYf4.mailto">'Education and Disability/Special Needs &ndash; Policies and practices in education, training and employment for students with disabilities and special educational needs in the EU'</a> was compiled by a French network of experts but refers to UK data that 75% of disabled adult men with degrees are in work, whereas 38% of those without are not.&nbsp; For able-bodied adult males, those figures are 93% and 85% respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Generation Y Researchers Fail to Use New Technologies</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jonathan Fine]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/reports/2012/researchers-of-tomorrow">Researchers of Tomorrow</a>, published by the British Library and JISC, is based on a survey of more than 17,000 PhD students over three years.&nbsp; Sixty Generation Y (born between 1982-94) were followed in greater depth and, despite being technologically savvy, they were found to know little about information available in new formats such as online databases, e-journals and repositories, or how to access it; many also believed their supervisors would not approve of citing open-access papers. &nbsp;Although Generation Y students use some online tools such as bookmarking and RSS web feed alerts, very few employ collaborative technologies such as wikis, blogging and Twitter in their research, despite using such tools in their personal lives.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Learning in a Digital Age</strong></p>
<p><em>[ALT]</em></p>
<p>JISC has released <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/elearning/Digilifelong/Lifelong Learning accessible PDF.pdf">Learning in a Digital Age</a>, the latest in its Effective Practice series.&nbsp; The publication signposts some of the effective higher education practice taking place in the UK and addresses the benefits and challenges that arise in a digital age.&nbsp; It includes 11 case studies and is aimed at individuals in FE and HE who have an interest in lifelong learning.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Condition 1 Immersive Video</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.conditionone.com/">Condition1</a> is an immersive video technology and, although I didn&rsquo;t fully understand the description on the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/14/professional-photographer-creates-conditionone-a-180-degree-video-player-for-ipad-iphone/">TechCrunch</a> website, it seemed intriguing enough to investigate further &ndash; and it was.&nbsp; Imagine watching a video on an iPad, but also being able to look left, right, up and down by tilting the device (or swiping).&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t do it justice here in words but I recommend you download the free iOS app: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/popular-science-atlas-immersive/id529337326?mt=8">Popular Science @ ATLAS Immersive Video Tour</a> of the Large Hadron Collider.&nbsp; There are also several other demos on the C1 site.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Automated Short Answer Question Scoring</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>The Hewlett Foundation is sponsoring a competition to develop <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-sas">a scoring algorithm for student-written short-answer responses</a>, in a bid to try and shift computerised assessment away from multiple-choice tests.&nbsp; Entrants are given access to graded short answer responses and their corresponding prompts, so they can build, train and test their scoring engines against a wide field of competitors. &nbsp;Success is based upon how closely they can align their scores to those of human expert graders.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Free eBooks</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>Bookboon.com is offering its <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2012/06/19/free-digital-textbooks-funded-through-advertising.aspx?=CTNU">digital textbooks free of charge</a> to college students, funded by including advertising within the pages of the books.&nbsp; For example, Strategic Management, a 52-page book, includes advertising for master's level programs and job recruitment ads.&nbsp; Utah State&rsquo;s Larry Walther notes that most books required for accounting courses cost around $200, adding, &ldquo;This is one of the ways technology will lower the cost of educational materials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Similar, but different, is start-up <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/start-up-hopes-to-create-free-digital-versions-of-published-books/36991">Unglue.it</a>, which asks users to pledge money toward &ldquo;ungluing&rdquo; previously published works, thus allowing them to become free and legal downloads.&nbsp; Ungluing &ldquo;is not really buying the rights, and it&rsquo;s not really buying the license,&rdquo; said founder Eric Hellman, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s compensating the rights-holder in exchange for them releasing something with Creative Commons.&rdquo;&nbsp; The company is starting with just five potential titles, including &ldquo;Oral Literature in Africa&rdquo;, by anthropologist and former OU professor, Ruth Finnegan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new report from Pew Research finds that 62% of (US) respondents didn&rsquo;t know if their library offered <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/06/22/libraries-are-lending-e-books/">eBook lending</a> (around three quarters of US libraries do) and only 11% had actually borrowed an eBook from their library.&nbsp; Some 75% reported that an online bookstore was their first port of call if they wanted to read a particular book.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Research Inefficient at Shaping the World</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jonathan Gudgion]<br /><br /></em></p>
<p>Matt Welsh was a professor of Computer Science at Harvard but has more recently moved to Google, where he now finds himself <a href="http://matt-welsh.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/startup-university.html">questioning the practical value of academia</a> because he, &ldquo;&hellip;never built anything real until I moved to Google, after nearly ten years of college and grad school, and seven years as a faculty member.&nbsp; And by &lsquo;real&rsquo;, I don't just mean a prototype that we developed for a couple of years and then threw away as soon as the papers got published.&nbsp; In effect, I &lsquo;wasted&rsquo; millions of dollars in funding, and countless man-years of development effort by my students and lab staff &ndash; apart from a bunch of papers, nothing of practical value came out of my entire academic research career.&nbsp; What would the world be like if all of this hard work had actually translated into real, shipping products that people could use?&nbsp; How could we change the structure of academic research to close the gap between playing in the sandbox and making things real?&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Conceptboard</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://conceptboard.com/">Conceptboard</a> offers a blank work space (like an online whiteboard) on which you can create, review and discuss your ideas and concepts.&nbsp; You can upload any document (e.g. PDF, PPT, Word, images) to work on, or just start to scribble.&nbsp; There are different pricing plans but the free option allows you to work with up to five guest collaborators.</p>

<p><strong>And Finally&hellip;</strong></p>
<p><em>[Chris Hough]</em></p>
<p>Australian online retailer Kogan is introducing a 6.8% surcharge on its products for users who it detects are still using <a href="http://www.kogan.com/au/blog/new-internet-explorer-7-tax/">&ldquo;antique browser&rdquo; IE7</a>.&nbsp; The company says it now takes a lot of effort to get pages to display correctly in IE7 and, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only costing us a huge amount, it&rsquo;s affecting any business with an online presence, and costing the Internet economy millions.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Pearson Offers Exams for Udacity Students </strong></p>
<p><em>[Seb Schmoller; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>Udacity has added five new &lsquo;premiere&rsquo; courses to its line up and is now partnering with <a href="http://fm.schmoller.net/2012/06/udacity-new-courses-and-secure-exams.html">Pearson VUE</a> to offer assessment.&nbsp; Students will be able to sit secure exams for &ldquo;a nominal fee&rdquo; at one of 4000 VUE centres in 165+ countries, the aim being to make success on a Udacity course count towards a qualification that is recognised by employers.&nbsp; Last month, Pearson acquired testing company Certiport, adding a further 12,000 authorised certification and testing centres to its portfolio.</p>
<p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5910717/plan-your-free-online-education-at-lifehacker-u-summer-semester-2012">Lifehacker &lsquo;University&rsquo;</a> list 30+ free online university courses (including 3 from the OU) that, &ldquo;anyone with a little time and a passion for self-growth can audit, read, and &lsquo;enrol&rsquo; in these courses for their own personal benefit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And is it then possible to turn all your open and lifelong learning into a &lsquo;degree&rsquo;?&nbsp; New venture <a href="http://degreed.com/about/what-is-degreed">Degreed</a> intends to offer this as a free service.</p>
<p>Finally, the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/new-york-times-to-suspend-online-education-program/36631">New York Times</a> is calling time on its foray into online education which began in 2007.&nbsp; Spokeswoman Linda Zebian said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking at what we&rsquo;re doing in education, and online education specifically, to decide what we want to do in the future.&rdquo;&nbsp; In other words, whoever would have predicted that organisations would start giving this away for free?</p>

<p><strong>Former Kaplan Exec Launches Civitas Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>&lsquo;Big data&rsquo;, predictive analytics and recommendation engines are transforming the way we buy products, play games and watch movies.&nbsp; <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/31/big-data-for-higher-ed-with-4-1m-from-first-round-floodgate-former-kaplan-exec-launches-civitas-learning/">Civitas Learning</a> plans to offer the same service for education and it has raised $4.1M in funding to help it do so.&nbsp; Civitas will offer a service that combines student demographic, behavioural and academic info with complex analysis and data modelling to let institutions build and make sense of their data.&nbsp; They are working with universities, community colleges and proprietary schools to build what it claims is already the largest cross-institutional data set in the industry, with over one million student records and more than seven million course records already on file.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Threshold for a &lsquo;University&rsquo; Lowered to 1,000 Students</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>The government is set to push ahead with plans to create a new generation of universities by <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=420048&c=1">lowering the qualifying threshold for university title to 1,000 students</a> as a way of making it &ldquo;easier for new providers to enter the sector&rdquo;.&nbsp; At present, an institution must have at least 4,000 FTE higher education students, of whom at least 3,000 are studying for a degree, before it can apply for university title, a status awarded by the Privy Council.&nbsp; Such a reduction does not require any changes to legislation; however, the proposed expansion of private provision via the opening of degree-awarding powers to non-teaching bodies will require legislation.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>McGraw-Hill Want to Buy Your Ed Tech</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>McGraw-Hill is getting scarily benevolent.&nbsp; During a presentation for reporters last month about adaptive learning and e-books, President Brian Kibby, frequently referred the growing number of start-ups, noting, &ldquo;<a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/05/22/mcgraw-hill-build-education-tech-and-well-buy-you/">I encourage start-ups in this space</a> because I&rsquo;d like to acquire you and partner with you&rdquo; and, &ldquo;the more ideas that come into this space, the better off the student is going to be.&rdquo;&nbsp; As for players that are resistant to new and different models?&nbsp; &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re a little foolish,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think they need to try anything and be a little bold.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Moglue Lets Anyone Create and Publish Interactive eBooks</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Moglue aims to let users create and publish content-rich, interactive ebooks without programming skills or distribution power.&nbsp; The company offers a desktop app for ebook creation and an ebook store on iOS for users who just want to browse and consume content.&nbsp; The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/17/moglue-mogluebuilder-mogluebooks">MoglueBuilder</a> beta has so far been downloaded by more than 20,000 creators and this provides a drag-and-drop interface to create and directly publish eBooks to MoglueBooks without the need for programming.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Open Content Licensing for Educators</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates; THE; University World News; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>UNESCO&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/events/calendar-of-events/events-websites/World-Open-Educational-Resources-Congress">World Open Educational Resources Congress</a> will be held from 20-22 Jun in Paris and, to coincide with this, the OER Foundation will be hosting a free online course &ndash; <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Open_content_licensing_for_educators/About">open content licensing for educators</a> &ndash; that runs from 20 Jun-3 Jul and is designed for educators and students who want to learn more about open education resources, copyright, and creative commons licenses.</p>
<p>The EU is set to throw the weight of its &euro;80bn research funding programme behind <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=419949">open-access publishing</a>, according to Times Higher Education.&nbsp; A pilot under way in seven areas of its current funding programme will be extended to become a mandate across all peer-reviewed research in the new scheme, which will cover fields ranging from particle physics to social science.&nbsp; An EU official indicated that for researchers receiving funding from its programme between 2014 and 2020, open-access publishing &ldquo;will be the norm&rdquo;.</p>
<p>London-based academic publisher <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120524160640563">Versita</a> plans to publish 100 &lsquo;emerging science&rsquo; journals this year as part of its open access programme.&nbsp; CEO Jacek Ciesielski said, &ldquo;The journal editors hail from the world&rsquo;s most prestigious universities and research institutes, such as Harvard, University of California, Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, Cambridge and the Max Planck Institute &hellip; One of the main reasons for this outstanding support is the open access publishing model&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/new-publishing-venture-gives-researchers-control-over-access/36651">PeerJ</a> is a new open access journal - focussing on biological and medical sciences - for which authors can pay a &ldquo;modest fee&rdquo; ($99-$259) to buy lifetime rights to publish their work.&nbsp; However, membership alone doesn&rsquo;t guarantee publication; all articles must go through peer review and meet a basic standard of scientific quality.&nbsp; PeerJ leaves the rights in authors&rsquo; hands and gives them control over when and how to share preprints of their articles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/petition-urges-white-house-to-require-public-access-to-federally-financed-research/36409">Access2Research</a> online petition is urging the Obama administration to require that work supported by taxpayer money be accessible online.&nbsp; In its first three days, around 13,000 people had signed and, according to the White House site&rsquo;s rules, if a petition gets 25,000 signatures within 30 days, it goes to the president&rsquo;s chief of staff and will get a response from the White House.</p>

<p><strong>Italian University Switches to English</strong></p>
<p><em>[Ian Blackham]</em></p>
<p>One of Italy's leading universities - the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17958520">Politecnico di Milano</a> - has announced that from 2014 most of its degree courses will be taught and assessed entirely in English rather than Italian.&nbsp; &ldquo;We strongly believe our classes should be international classes - and the only way to have international classes is to use the English language,&rdquo; says the university's rector, Giovanni Azzone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several French universities are expected to follow suit.&nbsp; No, only joking&hellip;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Movies, TV Shows, Songs and Textbooks</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>David Wiley has been number-crunching and highlights some massive inconsistencies in the <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2348">costs of access to different online media</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Netflix &ndash; $7.99/month for access to 20,000 movies and TV shows</li>
<li>Spotify &ndash; $9.99/month for access to 15 million songs</li>
<li>CourseSmart &ndash; $20.25/month for access to a single biology textbook</li>
</ul>
<p>He notes the obvious but sad fact that, &ldquo;One textbook costs more than the entire output of the film, television, and music industries combined.&rdquo;&nbsp; But for how much longer?</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Sainsbury&rsquo;s Buys HMV&rsquo;s 64% Stake in Anobii for &pound;1</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Troubled retailer HMV is selling its 64% stake in e-book retailer <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/12/new-ebook-player-uk-supermarket-giant-sainsburys-buys-hmvs-64b-stake-in-anobii-for-1">Anobii</a> to Sainsbury&rsquo;s for the princely sum of &pound;1.&nbsp; This will give Sainsbury&rsquo;s a jump start into the e-book market, allowing it to compete more directly with Tesco, which has its own e-books portal and resells devices like the Kindle.&nbsp; It also gives Sainsbury&rsquo;s a window for international expansion: Anobii currently has 600,000 customers &mdash; not just in the UK but internationally.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Connectivism and Connective Knowledge</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Connectivism is the thesis that knowledge is distributed across a network of connections, and therefore that learning consists of the ability to construct and traverse those networks. Stephen&rsquo;s latest eBook, <a href="http://www.downes.ca/files/books/Connective_Knowledge-19May2012.pdf">Connectivism and Connective Knowledge</a>, is a collection of eight years&rsquo; worth of blog posts, essays and transcripts from presentations in the field of connectivism and its implications for learning.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Data Journalism Handbook</strong></p>
<p><em>[Seb Schmoller] </em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/">data journalism handbook</a> is a free online resource, written by practitioners, that aims to be, &ldquo;a useful resource for anyone who thinks that they might be interested in becoming a data journalist, or dabbling in data journalism.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very readable (no, it&rsquo;s not a stats textbook) and it includes many valuable case studies and lessons learned.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Google Knowledge Graph</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tim Seal; TechCrunch; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Google hopes to improve search accuracy and relevance by rolling out <a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html">Knowledge Graph</a>, which uses a database of over 500m commonly searched-for items.&nbsp; However, as CNET&rsquo;s <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57436828-93/google-knowledge-graph-hands-on-the-webs-tail-is-long-indeed/">Rafe Needleman</a> notes, users are only likely to benefit if they search for &ldquo;things&rdquo; (he cites TV shows and famous people as good examples, but suggests that Wikipedia might offer more information), whereas searching for concepts, non-proper nouns and companies invokes a standard Google search.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, Yahoo has launched <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/23/yahoo-axis-search-browser/">Yahoo Axis</a> which offers web search outside the main browser in an expandable black lozenge.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s also a companion iOS app which can sync bookmarks between your computer and mobile.</p>
<p>If you prefer your searches to be social affairs, check out Microsoft&rsquo;s &lsquo;experimental&rsquo; social networking site called <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/05/20/microsoft-socl-launches/">So.cl</a>, which it describes as, &ldquo;&hellip;an experiment in open search.&nbsp; That means your searches on So.cl are viewable by other So.cl users and will also be available to third parties.&rdquo;&nbsp; The service seems to have borrowed features and approaches from Google+, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Grockit Launches Learnist, a Pinterest for Education</strong><br /><em>[Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>Grockit is a social learning company that provides an online test prep service for students taking SATs and other similar forms of tests.&nbsp; The company is now trialling <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/05/24/grockit-learnist-pinterest-for-education/">Learnist</a> which it describes as &ldquo;a way for anyone to share what they know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Users will be able to pull together blog posts, music, videos, images, podcasts, etc, which can be annotated, sequenced and assembled into lessons.&nbsp; Learnings can be pushed to a user&rsquo;s Facebook timeline and they can choose to follow people as well as topics.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Delivering Web to Mobile</strong></p>
<p><em>[CETIS]</em></p>
<p>Mark Power has just released a JISC Observatory paper, <a href="http://observatory.jisc.ac.uk/docs/delivering-web-to-mobile.pdf">Delivering Web to Mobile</a>, which &nbsp;looks at the growth of mobile, the state of the Web and gives an overview of approaches to delivering content and services optimised for the mobile context. This includes approaches to Web design for responsive sites, leveraging access to device functions and capabilities and the use of Web technologies to build mobile applications.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Sixty Seconds in Social Media</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tim Seal; TechCrunch; BPS]</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to wonder if infographics are getting a bit overdone and contrived, but this one from Alltop is fairly straightforward and shows visually the sorts of <a href="http://holykaw.alltop.com/60-seconds-in-social-media-infographic">social media traffic that occurs during a sixty-second period</a>.</p>
<p>More specific data on Twitter use comes from Pew Internet&rsquo;s latest survey which shows that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/31/pew-8-of-u-s-online-adults-now-use-twitter-daily/">15% of online US adults say that they use Twitter</a> and 8% do so daily.&nbsp; For African-Americans those figures rise notably to 28% and 13%.</p>
<p>And two separate studies of <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207594.2011.649285">Facebook profiles</a> compared photos used by US and Asian students, whether studying at home or abroad.&nbsp; They found there was a significant association between cultural background and style of picture, with users originally hailing from Taiwan being more likely to have a zoomed-out picture with some background context, whilst US users were more likely to have a close-up (and their &lsquo;smile intensity&rsquo; tended to be greater).</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Reflection on the Launch of the Ufi Charitable Trust</strong></p>
<p>[Seb Schmoller]</p>
<p>Seb Schmoller posts about last month&rsquo;s launch of the &pound;50m <a href="http://fm.schmoller.net/2012/05/scaling-up.html">UfI charitable trust</a> and then reminisces about how UfI/LearnDirect came about and whether the taxpayer got a good return on their &pound;1.5bn investment.&nbsp; My own UfI experience was as an e-learning developer, commissioned to design and produce a CAL programme on ICT for small business managers.&nbsp; However, our first design was rejected outright until we removed all technical terms and jargon on the grounds that they might cause confusion and impede learning.&nbsp; Hmm.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Report Shows Hybrid Learning Has Same Outcomes as Classroom</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Tony Bates flags another research study that finds <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2012/05/22/report-shows-hybrid-learning-has-same-outcomes-as-classroom/">no significant difference between different modes of learning</a>.&nbsp; He applauds the rigour with which it was conducted but thinks the question to ask is not &lsquo;Is one mode of teaching better than the other?&rsquo; but &lsquo;Under what conditions?&rsquo;&nbsp; He concludes, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to have some real research being done in this area.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pity though that it didn&rsquo;t take account of years of past experience of media research.&nbsp; Different questions and a different research design might have resulted in something more useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Build Your Responsive Open Learning Environment</strong></p>
<p><em>[Alex Mikroyannidis]</em></p>
<p>The ROLE project featured in an eLC workshop earlier this year.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about designing your own widgets and how you can build your personalised learning environment, all you have to do is register for the PLE conference on 11 Jul in Aveiro, Portugal, and join Alex &amp; Co their <a href="http://projects.kmi.open.ac.uk/role/pleconf-workshop/">interactive workshop</a>.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Learning Technology Benchmark Survey </strong></p>
<p><em>[Towards Maturity]</em></p>
<p>The sixth Towards Maturity <a href="http://www.towardsmaturity.org/article/2012/05/14/2012-13-towards-maturity-benchmark/">Benchmark Study</a> has just been launched, so why not join the 1800 organisations that have already taken part in the largest learning technology benchmark in Europe?&nbsp; On completion you will receive a complimentary paper entitled 101 Tips for Success, plus a free personalised company benchmark report.</p>

<p><strong>Livingstone&rsquo;s 1871 Field Diary Project</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>David Livingstone kept a field diary during his 1871 expedition to Africa but, low on paper and ink, the explorer had resorted to writing on newspaper sheets using ink made from berries.&nbsp; This has faded over time, but the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/archive-watch-the-words-of-david-livingstone-in-living-color/36457">Livingstone&rsquo;s 1871 Field Diary Project</a> team has illuminated the text with different wavelengths of light to create 6 or 8 different images for each page.&nbsp; That allowed team members to promote or fade out different features, making about 99% of Livingstone&rsquo;s handwriting legible.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Livingstone Spectral Images Archive&rdquo; provides Creative Commons access to the images, transcriptions, and metadata the project has created, no strings attached.</p>

<p><strong>Colin Powell&rsquo;s 13 Rules For Leadership</strong></p>
<p><em>[Elliott Masie]</em></p>
<p>Elliott Masie is busy planning his Learning 2012 conference (21-24 Oct in Orlando, since you ask) and one of this year&rsquo;s keynoters is Gen Colin Powell.&nbsp; As a taster, Powell offers his <a href="http://www.learning2012.com/item/colin-powell-leadership-tips.html">13 rules for leadership and life</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>It ain't as bad as you think.&nbsp; It will look better in the morning</li>
<li>Get mad, then get over it</li>
<li>Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it</li>
<li>Don't let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision</li>
<li>Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>edX, Coursera &hellip; and others</strong></p>
<p><em>[Pete Mitton; Lara Mynors; Wired Campus; Paul Hollins; Stephen Downes; BBC; Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47269703/ns/us_news-the_new_york_times/">MIT and Harvard have announced edX</a>, a joint venture that will build on MITx and Harvard distance learning to develop an open-source technology platform to deliver online courses.&nbsp; The partners claim this will benefit campus-based and remote learners as well as providing research data for teaching and learning online.</p>
<p>Purdue is launching <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/purdue-kicks-off-global-online-education-project/36339">HUB-U</a>, which will serve up modular online courses with video lectures, interactive visualizations, and tools for students to interact with their peers and the professor.&nbsp; The initiative builds on earlier work on Purdue&rsquo;s nanoHUB, a collaborative platform for nanotechnology research.&nbsp; A course on the fundamentals of nanoelectronics attracted 900 students from 27 countries, most of whom paid $30 for the class and a certificate of completion.&nbsp; Students also had the option to turn their certificates into continuing-education credits for an additional $195.</p>
<p>Previous digests have reported on Sebastian Thrun&rsquo;s Udacity.&nbsp; Now comes <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> from fellow Stanford tutors, Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller.&nbsp; The company has raised $16m in venture capital and secured partnerships with four major universities.&nbsp; Their site will offer free access to HE content from Princeton, Stanford, Berkeley, Penn and others, together with assessment and peer/expert support and discussion. &nbsp;Students can also opt-in to pay for premium content and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joining the ever-expanding marketplace, a group of UK academics concerned that higher education has become &ldquo;highly commercialised and profit-oriented&rdquo; are setting up a university where students can learn for free.&nbsp; Calling themselves the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-17789049">Social Science Centre</a>, the 40 academics will teach students at evenings and weekends to the equivalent of BA, MA and PhD levels, but the centre will not be awarding official degrees.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2012/04/30/the-worlds-largest-supplier-of-free-online-learning/">ALISON</a>.&nbsp; Having just celebrated its 5<sup>th</sup> birthday, this Irish site claims to be, &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s leading free online learning resource for basic and essential workplace skills.&nbsp; ALISON provides &hellip;. interactive multimedia courseware for certification and standards-based learning.&rdquo;&nbsp; The site has one million registered learners spread across nearly 200 countries worldwide, using a mix of advertising and sponsored programs from partners and publishers to enable students to take the courses free of charge.&nbsp; It graduated over 50,000 people in Certificate and Diploma courses in 2011.</p>

<p><strong>Dual-Mode Universities in Higher Education </strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>John Daniel writes about an OERu model (<a href="http://www.col.org/resources/speeches/2012presentations/Pages/2012-04-12.aspx">dual-mode universities</a>), based on the fact that, &ldquo;&hellip;higher education generally will no longer be able to use the function of presenting content, whether through lectures or learning materials, as justification for the major element of its costs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Stephen Downes concludes that, since institutions will need to generate income somehow, &ldquo;&hellip;it follows that the model must include pay-as-you-go assessment as the value proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Warwick-Monash Alliance</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120508132416621">University of Warwick has signed up to a new alliance</a> with Australia&rsquo;s Monash University that will establish them as &lsquo;globally connected universities&rsquo;, offering a seamless international experience to students and allowing employers to take their pick of globally educated graduates.&nbsp; The two institutions will also collaborate on global research, aiming to be one of the world&rsquo;s 50 &lsquo;globally networked research-heavy university systems&rsquo;.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Could Universities be Sold Off?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>Following the sale of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/apr/23/college-of-law-private-sale">The College of Law</a> to Montagu Private Equity, The Guardian speculates over what future deals might be afoot, noting that the college was able to retain its charitable status and Royal Charter.&nbsp; Robin Middlehurst, co-author of two recent reports on private involvement in higher education, says: &ldquo;I'm sure that, as public funding goes down, publicly funded institutions will &hellip; look to issue bonds and have some kind of different private financing.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Glynne Stanfield, a partner at the law firm Eversheds, says it could be used by all UK universities, not just as the basis of an outright sale, which he thinks will be rare, but to allow investors to buy some kind of stake in an institution, with the valuation depending on the profitability of that institution and its brand.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Six-fold Return for Investment in Innovation in UK Universities</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>According to a HEFCE report, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120503160642472">Strengthening the Contribution of English Higher Education Institutions to the Innovation System: Knowledge exchange and HEIF funding</a>, every pound invested in higher education innovation funding adds at least &pound;6 (US$9.70) in knowledge exchange income to the economy.&nbsp; HEIs have submitted institutional strategies to HEFCE that set out how they are using &pound;600 million in HEI funding.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Invests in Barnes and Noble</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Microsoft has announced an investment of $300 million for a 17.6% share in a new <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/what-the-microsoft-investment-in-barnes-noble-means-for-e-textbooks/">Barnes and Noble</a> subsidiary that will include the Nook and B&amp;N College divisions. Microsoft&rsquo;s investment ensures that Windows 8 will launch with the Nook digital bookstore in tow.&nbsp; e-Literate&rsquo;s Rob Reynolds suggest it will also provide competition for Amazon, resulting in greater numbers of digital titles and a gradual decline in prices.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>TED Launches Revamped Education Platform</strong></p>
<p><em>[Zite]</em></p>
<p>The TED-Ed YouTube channel launched in March with twelve 3-10 minute videos that extend beyond the lecture format for which TED is known, and these have now exceeded 2.5 million views.&nbsp; TED has now announced a dynamic <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/04/25/backed-by-1-25-million-ted-launches-revamped-education-platform-with-customized-learning-tools/?awesm=tnw.to_1EAMg">TED-Ed site</a> with new teacher tools for customising learning experiences through the use of follow-up questions and assignments. &nbsp;TED-Ed&rsquo;s Logan Smalley explains, &ldquo;The goal of TED-Ed is for each great lesson to reach and motivate as many learners as possible. The new website goes a step further, allowing any teacher to tailor video content, create unique lesson plans, and monitor students&rsquo; progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Are Online Learners Frustrated with Collaborative Learning?</strong></p>
<p><em>[IRRDOL]</em></p>
<p>A paper in the latest issue of IRRDOL considers, &ldquo;feelings of frustration as a negative emotion among online learners engaged in <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1127/2179">online computer-supported collaborative learning</a>&nbsp; experiences and, moreover, to identify the sources to which the learners attribute their frustration.&rdquo;&nbsp; The findings are not surprising, although it is interesting to consider whether the negatives relate to <em>online</em> collaboration or to team projects in general.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>iPad Drives Tablet Growth</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>According to IDC, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2012/05/07/ipad-drives-tablet-growth-while-android-tablets-slump.aspx?=CTNU">worldwide tablet shipments</a> increased significantly (from 7.9m to 17.4m) in the first quarter of 2012, driven by strong iPad sales which accounted for about 68% of that figure; however, IDC reports a steep drop-off of Android sales.&nbsp; Meanwhile, on the smart phone front, Apple fell to second place as Samsung more than tripled its unit shipments to land in the top slot.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Learning Directions "Pulse" Survey</strong></p>
<p><em>[Elliott Masie]</em></p>
<p>The Masie Center recently conducted a <a href="http://www.masie.com/pulse1">Learning Directions &ldquo;Pulse&rdquo; Survey</a>, receiving responses from over 520 organisations worldwide.&nbsp; Some of the more notable findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greatest planned growth in learning activity mode is in the use of Webinars</li>
<li>Strongest interest in change and updates was in Leadership Development</li>
<li>40% show a strong interest in Social Learning but only 20% plan a growing utilisation with a strong piloting base</li>
<li>Mobile and Tablet Device use for Learning is being piloted by 30%</li>
<li>33% of organisations are reducing the use of face-to-face classrooms</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>STELLAR Project Survey</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tom Welch]</em></p>
<p>As part of the JISC-funded <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/stellar/?page_id=2">STELLAR</a> project (Semantic Technologies Enhancing the Lifecycle of Learning Resources), Library Services is investigating the value of non-current learning materials to help the University and the HE sector as a whole to understand how academics and other stakeholders view older study materials. &nbsp;The first stage is a <a href="http://survey.euro.confirmit.com/wix5/p924706528.aspx">survey of key stakeholders</a> &ndash; open until Fri 8 Jun &ndash; which aims to gather opinions on areas as such as: what should happen to OU learning materials when they are withdrawn from presentation?&nbsp; Is it important that they are kept and, if so, for how long?&nbsp; How can we best ensure that they are accessible over time?</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>ROLE Project</strong></p>
<p><em>[Alexander Mikroyannidis]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.role-project.eu/">ROLE project</a> is centred around the concept of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL), supporting learners in planning their learning process, searching for the resources independently, learning and then reflecting on the whole learning process and progress.&nbsp; In order to raise awareness about SRL and ROLE technologies, the project team has prepared an <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=7898">introductory course in LabSpace</a>.&nbsp; You are invited to complete this and then provide feedback on your perception of SRL in a <a href="https://fit-bscw.fit.fraunhofer.de/pub/bscw.cgi/39770946">10 minute survey</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Harvard Says it Can't Afford Journal Publishers' Prices</strong></p>
<p><em>[Paul Hoffman; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>Exasperated by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices">rising subscription costs charged by academic publishers</a>, Harvard University has encouraged its 2,100 teaching and research staff to make their research freely available through open access journals and to resign from publications that keep articles behind paywalls.&nbsp; The university&rsquo;s library, which pays around $3.5m each year in subscriptions, warned it could no longer afford the price hikes imposed by many large journal publishers.&nbsp; Prices for online journal access from two major publishers have increased 145% over the past six years, with some journals costing as much as $40,000.&nbsp; Research Libraries UK negotiated new contracts with Elsevier and Wiley last year after the group threatened to cancel large subscriptions to the publishers.&nbsp; The new deal, organised on behalf of 30 member libraries, is expected to save UK institutions more than &pound;20m.</p>
<p>David Willetts has declared he wants to make <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/britain-announces-plan-to-make-publicly-financed-research-freely-available/36256">all research paid for with public money freely available online</a>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Giving people the right to roam freely over publicly funded research will usher in a new era of academic discovery and collaboration, and will put the UK at the forefront of open research,&rdquo; he wrote.&nbsp; &ldquo;The challenge is how we get there without ruining the value added by academic publishers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Why Publishers Don't Like Apps</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Jason Pontin, writing in MIT&rsquo;s Technology Review believes <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/business/40319/">the future of media on mobile devices</a> isn't with applications but with the Web.&nbsp; This is partly because publishers remain wedded to the concept of the &lsquo;magazine&rsquo; but mainly because Apple, with their market domination of the iPad, charge a markup of 30% on apps which eats into most if not all of a publisher&rsquo;s profit margin.&nbsp; Pontin is frank about his own experiences at Technology Review: &ldquo;We sold 353 subscriptions through the iPad.&nbsp; We never discovered how to avoid the necessity of designing both landscape and portrait versions of the magazine for the app.&nbsp; We wasted $124,000 on outsourced software development.&nbsp; We fought amongst ourselves, and people left the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>eBooks vs pBooks</strong></p>
<p><em>[Lara Mynors; eLearn Magazine; Zite; Wired]</em></p>
<p>Time&rsquo;s Maia Szalavitz noticed that some <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2012/03/14/do-e-books-impair-memory/">eBook content seemed harder to remember on her new Kindle</a> compared to the paper equivalent.&nbsp; Research suggests that this may be the case when the subject matter is complex or students are under pressure. &nbsp;One theory is that physical books have more spatial landmarks which help readers remember information through its position on the page spread.</p>
<p>Joan Vinall-Cox, writing in <a href="http://elearnmag.acm.org/archive.cfm?aid=2159560">eLearn Magazine</a>, is having similar concerns, but thinks the issues may lie with a combination of how we scan the page and our ability (or not) to add annotations.</p>
<p>Boris writes on The Next Web about his <a href="http://thenextweb.com/media/2012/04/22/the-innovation-we-need-to-see-before-ebooks-can-completely-replace-pbooks/?awesm=tnw.to_1E84j">enthusiasm for e-books</a> and some of the technical and commercial limitations he thinks may be holding the medium back.&nbsp; He also questions the complete demise of paper, because many people, &ldquo;like the smell of paper and the fact that books are tangible, real, and even, romantic.&rdquo;&nbsp; The number of subsequent comments suggest he&rsquo;s touched a nerve.</p>
<p>And Wired&rsquo;s Damon Lavrinc investigates our love of the <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/05/why-flipping-through-paper-like-pages-endures-in-the-digital-world/">animated curled-edge page-flip</a>, noting that the latest upgrade to Instapaper now includes a flip.&nbsp; The expert view is that the page-flip animation is &ldquo;too long and complex&rdquo;, but they don&rsquo;t deny its appeal to users.</p>

<p><strong>Bodleian and Vatican to Digitise Ancient Texts</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-17687947">Bodleian Library and the Vatican's Biblioteca Apostolica</a> have received a &pound;2m award from the Polonsky Foundation to digitise 1.5 million Greek manuscripts, 15th Century printed books and Hebrew early printed books and make them available online.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Game Changers: Education and Information Technologies</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Educause has just published a useful new e-book, <a href="http://www.educause.edu/game-changers">Game Changers: Education and Information Technologies</a>.&nbsp; Edited by Diana Oblinger, the book is, &ldquo;a collection of chapters and case studies contributed by college and university presidents, provosts, faculty, and other stakeholders&rdquo;, although it does have a distinctly North American flavour.</p>
<p>Diana Laurillard has also just released her new book, <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2012/05/02/new-book-on-learning-design/">Teaching as a Design Science: Building Pedagogical Patterns for Learning and Technology</a>.&nbsp; Her premise is that teaching should be more highly regarded as a &lsquo;design profession&rsquo; and that, &ldquo;Every day, teachers design and test new ways of teaching, using learning technology to help their students.&nbsp; Sadly, their discoveries often remain local.&nbsp; By representing and communicating their best ideas as structured pedagogical patterns, teachers could develop this vital professional knowledge collectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Afterschool 'Code Clubs' to Teach Kids Programming</strong></p>
<p><em>[Ian Blackham]</em></p>
<p>A new project called <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-04/17/code-club">Code Club</a> has been established to teach young kids how to code through a network of after-school clubs.&nbsp; Co-founder Clare Sutcliffe explains, &ldquo;Each club is run by a volunteer who teaches from lesson plans devised by Code Club.&nbsp; We help the lovely volunteer approach their local school and pitch the idea to the head-teacher.&nbsp; They then run the club and teach for an hour after school each week.&rdquo;&nbsp; Clubs will run for 12 weeks and will be based on MIT&rsquo;s drag-and-drop Scratch tool (as used on the OU&rsquo;s TU100 module).&nbsp; The project aims to have a code club in a quarter of the UK's primary schools by 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial News </strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran;</em><em> Startup Smart]</em></p>
<p>After weeks of speculation, <a href="http://www.college-of-law.co.uk/About-the-College/Media-Centre/News-2012/17-April-2012--Governors-of-The-College-of-Law-announce-conclusion-of-Strategic-Review/">The College of Law</a> has today confirmed the sale of the legal education and training business, which will continue to be known as The College of Law, to European private equity firm Montagu Private Equity.&nbsp; The proceeds of the sale will contribute to a significant charitable fund (in excess of &pound;200m) that will promote the advancement of legal education and the study of law for future generations of students through bursaries, scholarships and grants.</p>
<p>For-profit HE company <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/laureate-eyes-ipo-471-million-pounds-hires-banks-221647401.html">Laureate Education</a>, which has former U.S. President Bill Clinton as honorary chancellor, has chosen Morgan Stanley and Barclays to lead an initial public offering that could raise as much as &pound;471m.&nbsp; Laureate Education runs a network of 60 accredited campus-based and online universities offering undergraduate and graduate degrees to more than 675,000 students around the world, according to its website.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.startupsmart.com.au/sell-a-business/blackboard-acquires-adelaide-based-elearning-company-netspot/201203275856.html">Blackboard has acquired two Moodle-related companies</a>, Australian NetSpot and Baltimore-based Moodlerooms.&nbsp; Moodle founder Martin Dougiamas understands that, &ldquo;these three companies have some good plans and synergies.&nbsp; Moodlerooms and NetSpot will remain Moodle Partners [and] have promised to continue providing Moodle services, participating in the community, and contributing financially to Moodle exactly as they always have.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>US Sues Apple and Publishers Over e-Book Prices</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>Apple and major book publishers are being sued by the US Department of Justice over the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17681137">pricing of e-books</a>.&nbsp; The US accuses Apple and Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Simon and Schuster and Penguin of colluding over the prices of e-books they sell.&nbsp; This lawsuit is over the firms' move to the agency model where publishers rather than sellers set prices.&nbsp; Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon and Schuster have already settled, but the case will proceed against Apple, Macmillan and Penguin &ldquo;for conspiring to end e-book retailers' freedom to compete on price&rdquo;, the DOJ said.</p>

<p><strong>CETLs Show Little Return on &pound;315m Investment</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>HEFCE has evaluated its largest-ever single initiative to improve teaching and learning &ndash; the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=419346">Centres for Excellence in Teaching and Learning</a> (CETLs) &ndash; and concludes that the &pound;315m spent over five years to fund 69 centres has had minimal impact on student learning: &ldquo;we do not believe the Cetl programme itself has led to material changes in non-participating higher education institutions and across the sector as a whole.&rdquo;&nbsp; THE describes it as, &ldquo;a vague policy, undermined by self-interest and badly managed in its execution.&nbsp; Must do better next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>OU iTunes U App Success</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian]</em></p>
<p>The OU&rsquo;s 52 courses developed for the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/appsblog/2012/apr/03/open-university-itunes-u-app">iTunes U app</a> have generated more than 50m downloads globally through the app and attracted more than 1m active subscribers.&nbsp; For example, The New Entrepreneurs course has more than 100,000 active subscribers through the iTunes U app, with six more courses having reached the 50,000 milestone.&nbsp; &ldquo;With more than 50 million downloads to date, we know that students value our high-quality learning materials, and that is really underlined by the speed with which we have reached one million iTunes U app course subscribers,&rdquo; says Martin Bean.</p>

<p><strong>How Education Apps Have Become a Priority for AT&amp;T</strong></p>
<p><em>[Pete Mitton]</em></p>
<p>AT&amp;T plans to spur the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57399089-94/how-education-apps-have-become-a-priority-for-at-t/?tag=cnetRiver">development of educational apps</a> and is planning an education-centric &ldquo;hackathon&rdquo; in June to find the smartest apps.&nbsp; The idea is to bring the Internet, video, social media and the concept of "gamification" to the learning process.&nbsp; The company plans to invest $250m over the next 5 years to improving education.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>A Short Critique of the Khan Academy</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates; Stephen Downes; Wired Campus;</em><em> Edudemic; PR Web]</em></p>
<p>Tony refers to Eric Bean&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2012/03/14/a-short-critique-of-the-khan-academy/">critique of the Khan Academy</a> and also adds some of his own thoughts, concluding that the content is valuable but is let down by its organisation and support structure (or lack of).&nbsp; <a href="http://educationaltechnologyguy.blogspot.in/2012/03/khan-academy-not-good-pedagogy-and-not.html">David Andrade</a> also has concerns, describing video lectures as being inherently, &ldquo;boring and do not allow the student to interact with the lecturer&rdquo;, plus the site provides no opportunities to apply newly acquired knowledge.&nbsp; These comments may be accurate but, looking at the <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan site</a>, I don&rsquo;t think it promises to be something it isn&rsquo;t &ndash; perhaps they should ask for their money back?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/ted-known-for-idea-talks-releases-educational-videos/35745">new TED-Ed channel</a> was announced a year ago, but videos are only now being added.&nbsp; Each is about 5 mins long, aimed at high school level and TED&rsquo;s curator, Chris Anderson envisions a teacher playing one in class at the start of a lesson &ldquo;to ignite excitement&rdquo; about the topic.&nbsp; It is hoped that within 3 months, new videos will be added at a rate of one per day.&nbsp; However, if you prefer the full length versions, Edudemic suggests <a href="http://edudemic.com/2012/03/25-ted-talks-perfect-for-classrooms/">25 TED Talks Perfect For Classrooms</a>.<br /><br /></p>
<p><a href="http://twig-it.com/">Twig</a> is a new site that offers more than 1,000 &ldquo;outstanding short films on science&rdquo;, some of which it makes freely available.&nbsp; The company has recently done a deal with Carolina Biological &ndash; a supplier of science teaching materials to 50% of US secondary schools &ndash; which will make Twig materials available to 180,000 teachers from May.</p>

<p><strong>The Higher Education Monopoly is Crumbling As We Speak</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>The Stanford AI project may seem like a distant memory now, but Wired&rsquo;s Steven Leckart considers its implications in some detail, together with Sebastian Thrun&rsquo;s assertion that, 50 years from now, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/03/ff_aiclass/all/1">there will be only 10 institutions in the whole world that deliver higher education</a>.</p>
<p>Similar sentiments are expressed by Kevin Carey in The New Republic.&nbsp; He sees initiatives such as Udacity, Khan and MITx as disruptive innovations that are much more responsive than traditional organisations.&nbsp; He also notes the parallel with industrial companies and the rate at which they come and go from the Dow Jones index (General Electric is one notable original member).&nbsp; He asks: <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/101620/higher-education-accreditation-MIT-university">Which colleges and universities will be the G.E. of the twenty-first century</a>, and which will be as forgotten as U.S. Leather?</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Tablet Ownership Triples Among US Students</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>An annual survey sponsored by the Pearson Foundation asked 1,206 college students and 204 college-bound high-school seniors about <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/tablet-ownership-triples-among-college-students/35764">tablet ownership</a>.&nbsp; A quarter said they owned a tablet, compared with just 7% last year, and 63% believe tablets will replace textbooks in the next five years.&nbsp; The survey also found that nearly 60% of students preferred digital books when reading for class, compared with about a third who said they preferred printed textbooks.</p>
<p>Despite the current boom in mobile devices and its effect on sales of other computers, forecaster IDC is predicting a resurgence for desktop and portable PCs in its latest industry survey.&nbsp; Annual growth is expected to be positive each year through to 2016, with desktops seeing modest single-digit gains and laptops seeing between 8-14% growth in that period. Total PC shipments are expected to reach 518.3 million units in 2013, according to <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2012/03/20/tablets-havent-killed-the-pc-yet.aspx">IDC's Worldwide Quarterly PC Tracker</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Many Professors Use Interactive Tools Ineffectively in Online Courses</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>A recent US study examined 26 high-enrolment online courses at two Virginia community colleges and found that <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/study-suggests-many-professors-use-interactive-tools-ineffectively-in-online-courses/35677">most professors relied mainly on text-based assignments and materials</a>.&nbsp; When they did decide to use interactive tools like online video, many of those technologies were not connected to learning objectives and did little to motivate students or encourage them to interact with each other.</p>
<p>But Prof Alex Golub describes his <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2012/04/09/essay-use-ipad-academics">two years of iPad use</a>, declaring it to be an &ldquo;indispensable&rdquo; academic tool.&nbsp; However, he also states that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a laptop, and it never will be ... As I and many other people have noted, the thing is for consumption, not production.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>ALT OER SIG</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tim Seal]</em></p>
<p>ALT has formed an <a href="http://www.alt.ac.uk/get-involved/special-interest-groups/oesig">OER SIG</a> which opened last month.&nbsp; Its aim is to, &ldquo;support, develop, sustain and influence policy in open education&rdquo; and Jonathan Darby and Tim Seal are at the helm.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/open?sort_by=created&sort_order=DESC&items_per_page=200&=Go">Oxford OER podcast site</a> has made some additions to its growing number of podcasts, including material from its African Studies Centre, Institute of Japanese Studies and Department of Social Policy and Intervention.</p>
<p>And a recent white paper from the European Learning Industry Group (ELIG) suggests that the <a href="http://www.elig.org/images/stories/docs/articles/openeducation_a4.pdf">commercial learning industry has not yet fully engaged with OERs</a>, in large part due to a perception that OE is a potential threat to existing learning business models.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Biomedical Online Research Network</strong></p>
<p><em>[OU; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>The OU&rsquo;s new <a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/biomedical-research-network/born/">Biomedical Online Research Network</a> (BORN) offers a simple way of presenting questionnaires or experiments online, thus providing an effective, non-intrusive and cost-effective tool for collecting research data from human participants.&nbsp; In addition, it houses a volunteer register aimed at encouraging OU students, staff and members of the public to participate in a range of online and &lsquo;live&rsquo; biomedical research studies.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s National Health and Medical Research Council will, from July onwards, require the published results of all research it helps pay for be made <a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/all-research-funded-by-nhmrc-to-be-accessible-free-of-charge-5486">publicly accessible in institutional repositories</a> within 12 months of publication.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin Adds ProQuest Dissertation Checking</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; University World News]</em></p>
<p>Turnitin&rsquo;s <a href="http://campustechnology.com/Articles/2012/03/12/Turnitin-Adds-ProQuest-Dissertations.aspx?=CTNU&p=1">iThenticate</a> service checks for plagiarism against a library of 20 billion current and archived Web pages, 200 million student papers, and 110 million articles from scholarly journals.&nbsp; It will shortly be expanded to include 300,000 dissertations and theses published since 2008 from ProQuest&rsquo;s Dissertations &amp; Theses Database.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, more than 45,000 students at 80 UK HEIs have been hauled before college authorities and found guilty of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/45000-caught-cheating-at-britains-universities-7555109.html">&lsquo;academic misconduct&rsquo;</a> ranging from bringing crib-sheets or mobile phones into exams to paying private firms to write essays for them.&nbsp; Greenwich University, with more than 900 cases, was the worst in the country.</p>

<p><strong>What Books to Read in Learning and Development?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Donald Taylor]</em></p>

<p><strong>50 Blog Postings on Learning Theorists</strong></p>
<p><em>[Donald Clark]</em></p>
<p>As this digest is released, Donald Clark should be just over halfway through his marathon <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/">50-blog-posts-on-learning-theorists-in-50-days</a>, which began on 18 Mar with <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/socrates-469-399-bc-method-man.html">Socrates</a>.&nbsp; Donald&rsquo;s style is readable and informative, and he dispels a few myths along the way - but his main problem is the number of people trying to extend his list through their enthusiastic comments and suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>Einstein Archives Available Online</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>The Hebrew University of Jerusalem is adding to the 900 Einstein manuscript images that have been available online since 2003.&nbsp; Now, with a grant from the Polonsky Foundation UK, which previously helped digitise Isaac Newton's papers, all 80,000 items from the <a href="http://alberteinstein.info/">Einstein collection</a> have been catalogued and enhanced with cross referencing technology.&nbsp; Around 2,000 documents (7,000 pages) from Einstein's personal and public life are available online and archivists will upload the remainder in the coming years.</p>

<p><strong>And Finally&hellip;</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS, BBC]</em></p>
<p>Does the last one of something seem better or more enjoyable than previous instances?&nbsp; To test this hypothesis, researchers at the University of Michigan recruited participants to <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/23/2/163.full">eat five different flavours of chocolates one by one</a>.&nbsp; They found that when the last chocolate was made salient, it was rated as more enjoyable and better-tasting than the other chocolates irrespective of flavour.</p>
<p>In that case, they&rsquo;ll be delighted at news that the first <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17623424">chocolate printer</a> will go into production later this month, allowing chocolate lovers to print their own custom-made sweets, layer by layer.&nbsp; Dr Liang Hao, from the University of Exeter, founded the Choc Edge company to commercialise the device after interest from retailers.</p>

<p><strong>MITx</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Tony Bates; THE]</em></p>
<p>MITx&rsquo;s first open class, <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/mitx-opens-enrollment-for-first-interactive-online-course-pilot-certificates-will-be-free/35396">Circuits and Electronics</a>, began on 5 Mar.&nbsp; Based on an introductory class offered to between 100 and 250 campus undergraduates, the course will help students make the transition from physics to electrical engineering and computer science.&nbsp; Open students will get grades based on homework assignments, activities in a gaming-style virtual lab, and tests.&nbsp; No MIT human intervention is planned - all interactions, responses and evaluation of submissions will be automated.</p>
<p>Tony Bates reflects on whether/how it will work, and whether it represents a welcome leap forward or just an online reinvention of the <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2012/02/15/will-mitx-work/">CAL and programmed learning of the 1970/80s</a>?</p>
<p>Martin bean writes in THE about <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=419264">the developing world&rsquo;s need for higher education</a> and his assertion that this can be met by the digital delivery of open educational resources.</p>
<p>The Times Higher also discusses MITx as part of a wide ranging article which considers: &ldquo;With novel credentials being developed and employers seeing the value of <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=419088">low-cost study based on open courseware</a>, Jon Marcus asks if the bricks-and-mortar elite will end up on the wrong side of history.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Worldwide Student Numbers Forecast to Double by 2025</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; The Telegraph]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120216105739999">global number of students enrolled in higher education</a> is forecast to more than double to 262 million by 2025, and more than half of these will be in China and India alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Average annual growth in demand for international higher education between 2005 and 2025 is expected to exceed 3% in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Central America and South America,&rdquo; writes higher education consultant Bob Goddard.&nbsp; As a result of this demand, the number of students seeking study abroad could rise to eight million &ndash; nearly three times more than today.</p>
<p>The number of full-time undergraduate courses on offer at UK universities has fallen by more than a quarter (27%) since 2006, according to a UCU report, <a href="http://www.ucu.org.uk/media/pdf/c/h/Choice_cuts_report_Feb12.pdf">Choice Cuts: How choice has declined in higher education</a>, which finds that the number of undergraduate courses available has decreased from 70,052 in 2006 to 51,116 in 2012, despite an increase in student numbers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/9128663/Cheapest-universities-and-colleges-to-take-more-students.html">&lsquo;Former Polys&rsquo;</a> are 20 years old this month and their popularity and student numbers continue to grow.&nbsp; They were helped by a recent announcement by David Willetts that 20,000 places have been removed from the HE system and redistributed: 9,643 places will be distributed to 35 former polys charging annual fees of less than &pound;7,500 and 10,354 places will go to 155 FE colleges.</p>

<p><strong>Pearson Sees Digital Publishing Income Beating Print in 2012</strong><br /><em>[Zite]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-pearson-sees-digital-publishing-income-beating-print-in-2012/">Pearson&rsquo;s digital revenue grew by 18%</a> to &pound;2bn through 2011 and the publisher forecasts, &ldquo;Revenues from digital and services businesses [are] expected to exceed revenues from traditional publishing businesses in 2012.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pearson-owned Penguin has sold 50 million apps and e-book since 2008 and the group reached 43 million students through digital learning services.&nbsp; e-Books now make up 12% of its global (&pound;125m) sales. &ldquo;We expect this percentage to increase significantly again in 2012,&rdquo; the publisher said.</p>
<p>Amazon has pulled more than 4,000 books from its e-shelves after <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_amazon_getting_impatient_with_book_publishe.php">publishers wouldn't budge for lower prices</a>.&nbsp; Google is cutting off partners in its e-book affiliates program because sales referrals are too low to be worthwhile.&nbsp; Although e-book sales are rising, print still brings in more revenue for publishers because consumers expect e-books to be cheaper and so publishers can't charge as much for them as they might like.</p>

<p><strong>How Important are Open eBook Standards to Universities?</strong><br /><em>[JISC; Pete Mitton; Wired Campus; ALT]</em></p>
<p>The ePub/eBook/iBooks debate continues.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/blog/how-important-are-open-ebook-standards-to-universities/">Ben Showers</a> writes on the JISC site about the effect of different (and open standards) on the university sector.&nbsp; He also refers to a recent and very useful JISC paper, <a href="http://jiscpub.blogs.edina.ac.uk/final-report/">Digital Monograph Technical Landscape: Exemplars and Recommendations</a>, which unpicks some of the technical and commercial landscape.</p>
<p>Inkling Habitat (mentioned last month) is attracting reasonable interest as a serious e-book authoring tool.&nbsp; A video from the recent O'Reilly TOC Conference of Matt McGinnis&rsquo;s presentation, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bborgjHF4&list=PL16E261CDB64A51AF&index=5&feature=plpp_video">The Death of the Page, the Dawn of Digital</a>, is worth a view, but you might want to skip forward to about 7:00 to miss some of the introductory stuff.&nbsp; Jenn Webb also reports from the conference about <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/02/the-ebook-evolution-toc.html">the e-Book revolution</a>, what&rsquo;s happened so far and where publishers expect/hope things will go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A free, open-source authoring contender is <a href="http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/booktype">Booktype</a> which, once installed on a Web server, allows teams of authors to work together to write and edit sections of books and chat with each other in real time about revisions.&nbsp; The finished product can then be easily published on e-readers and tablets, or exported for print-on-demand&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scott Hennessy writes of his experiences using <a href="http://newsletter.alt.ac.uk/2012/02/mobile-publishing-with-jutoh/">Jutoh</a> for mobile publishing.&nbsp; Jutoh costs &pound;24 per licence, runs on Windows, Linux and Mac and can also be carried on a USB stick.</p>

<p>MIT OpenCourseWare and textbook publisher Flat World Knowledge have teamed up to provide free, high-quality textbooks to learners accessing three <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/ocw-flat-world-knowledge.html">OCW Scholar courses</a>: Principles of Microeconomics, Introduction to Psychology and Solid State Chemistry.&nbsp; OCW Scholar courses include openly published course content (syllabi, lecture notes, assignments and exams) but are created specifically for independent learners, who typically have few additional resources available to them.</p>

<p><strong>Visual Impairment Support</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Jonathan Fine; Slashdot; JE]</em></p>
<p>Florida State University has agreed to pay two blind students $75,000 each after they successfully argued that a <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/150000-settlement-reached-in-blind-florida-state-students-e-learning-suit/35659">maths course relied on e-learning systems that were inaccessible to people with disabilities</a>.&nbsp; The students could not access software that was used for homework and tests and the course also relied on inaccessible remote-control &ldquo;clickers&rdquo; that allow students to answer multiple-choice questions during lectures.</p>
<p>The BBC reports on the increasing provision of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16984742">Braille</a> in many walks of life, notably on packaging, signage and device interfaces.&nbsp; There has also been a shift in emphasis in terms of what is provided; the RNIB&rsquo;s Pete Osborne observes, &ldquo;Manufacturers don't now say 'it'd be really nice if we could do Braille', they say we know we should, we need to know how.&rdquo;&nbsp; The article provides some useful examples of how Braille works and how blind people use it, including comments from David Blunkett and others.</p>
<p>Researchers at Georgia Tech University have built a free open-source app, <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/12/02/20/0136243/georgia-tech-iphone-app-could-help-blind-users-text">BrailleTouch</a>, that uses six large touch-screen buttons and speech synthesis to allow users to generate Braille text without needing to look at a the device's screen.&nbsp; Early studies with visually impaired participants proficient in Braille demonstrated that users can input up to 32 words per minute with 92% accuracy.</p>
<p>The Connexions OER site has just made available two topics with content specifically optimised for blind students: <a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11294/latest/">Physics Concepts</a> and <a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11349/latest/">Objected-Oriented Programming Concepts</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New iTunes U App and iBook Announcements</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; Jonathan Martyn; Mike Sharples; Yishay Mor; Mashable, Non Scantlebury]</em></p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s mystery &lsquo;education event&rsquo; last month saw some significant announcements including: a new <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/19/new-itunes-u-app-hits-itunes-with-over-500000-free-lectures-videos-books">iTunes U app</a> that provides access to<strong> </strong>over 500,000 free lectures, videos &amp; books; the launch of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/19/apple-announces-ibook-2-a-new-textbook-experience-for-the-ipad/">iBooks 2</a>, together with news that Pearson, McGraw Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt will sell US high-school textbook downloads for $14.99 each; and a free <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/19/apple-unveils-new-ibooks-author-tool-not-just-for-textbooks/">iBook Author</a> tool, but only available for Mac OSX (<a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/19/ibooks-author-app-review/">hands-on review</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/1201oihbafvpihboijhpihbasdouhbasv/event/index.html">Apple&rsquo;s 1hr video of the event</a> is available online.&nbsp; Key components (thanks to Jon Martyn) are: iBooks (circa 8&ndash;22 mins of presentation), iBooks Author (22&ndash;32 mins) and iTunes U (circa 47&ndash;56 mins).&nbsp; The OU was one of 6 universities featured in the latter segment, although it was not mentioned that <a href="http://www8.open.ac.uk/platform/news-and-features/ou-part-apples-itunes-u-app-launch">the OU provided 51 of the 100 initial courses</a> (and, by the end of the launch day, accounted for five of the top 10 downloads).</p>
<p>After the initial wow, some concerns started to surface: is iBook Author OER compatible? (<a href="http://openpad.wordpress.com/2012/01/20/ibook-author-is-it-oer-incompatible/">Patrick McAndrew</a>); Apple may claim ownership of work created using iBook Author (<a href="http://venomousporridge.com/post/16126436616/ibooks-author-eula-audacity">Dan Wineman</a> and <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/apples-mind-bogglingly-greedy-and-evil-license-agreement/4360?tag=nl.e589">Ed Bott</a>); and whether glitzy iBooks (&lsquo;interactive TV documentaries&rsquo;) will triumph over pedagogically sound ones (<a href="http://fm.schmoller.net/2012/01/apples-reinvents-the-text-book.html">Seb Schmoller</a>).</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Digital Publishing</strong></p>
<p><em>[Gill Gowans; Stephen Downes; Educause; MindShift]</em></p>
<p>The evolution of books into interactive, digital products is far from over, according to Henry Volans, head of digital publishing at Faber &amp; Faber.&nbsp; Speaking at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/jan/13/ipg-publishers-ebooks-apps-innovation">Independent Publishers Guild's digital quarterly meeting</a>, Volans said there is plenty more scope for innovation in book-apps and eBooks.&nbsp; Publishers are acutely aware of the threat from the wave of 99p competition, but they hope that quality will be their key weapon in the fight to retain and grow market share.</p>
<p>Wired reports on <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2012/01/why-education-publishing-is-big-business/">why education publishing is big business</a>, suggesting that this might account for Apple&rsquo;s growing interest.&nbsp; The article notes that education publishers are much bigger than other media companies that attract more attention.&nbsp; Pearson &ndash; the largest educational publisher &ndash; is far bigger and more profitable than AOL or The New York Times.&nbsp; Outside education, Pearson also owns Penguin (the world&rsquo;s second largest trade publisher), the Financial Times and 50% of The Economist.</p>
<p>And the latest data from Pew Internet shows that American <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/01/ereader-survey-amazon-houghton-mifflin-libraries.html">e-Reader and tablet ownership almost doubled</a> in the month over Christmas, rising from 10% to 19%.</p>
<p>A group of US universities has entered into a contract with McGraw Hill to create <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/01/18/universities-look-get-discounts-e-textbooks-students">discounts for students on digital course materials</a>.&nbsp; This follows concerns at the extent to which publishers are now in the driving seat when it comes to eTextbook pricing and licensing, particularly given that the lucrative second hand textbook market could soon disappear.&nbsp; Geoff Cain also blogs about similar doubts he has about the <a href="http://cain.blogspot.com/2012/01/oers-why-commercial-electronic.html">costs and licensing of commercial eTextbooks</a>.</p>
<p>Educause has formed an <a href="http://www.educause.edu/blog/aciavonne/JointheConversationontheFuture/245274">eTexts Constituent Group</a> to discuss the rapidly evolving domain of digital textbooks and to share ideas, analyses, experiences, and practical outcomes of using eTexts.</p>
<p>A new report, <a href="http://joanganzcooneycenter.org/upload_kits/ilearnii.pdf">iLearn II: An Analysis of the Education Category of Apple's App Store</a>, examines nearly 200 top-selling education category apps for Apple&rsquo;s iPad and iPhone with the goal of understanding this market&rsquo;s dynamics and trends.&nbsp; The analysis highlights industry best practices and future opportunities for developers, educators and researchers to influence the education category.</p>

<p><strong>Self e-Publishing</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; Yishay Mor; Edudemic; Zite]</em></p>
<p>iBook Author is a good tool, although it is probably aimed more at enthusiasts (teachers, etc) than professional users, but <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/14/an-answer-to-apple-inkling-creates-first-industrial-publishing-platform-for-interactive-ebooks">Inkling Habitat</a> aims to fill that gap.&nbsp; Habitat will enable publishers to easily deploy XML-based content, including multimedia, interactive quizzes, guided tours, 3-D exhibits and HD video. &nbsp;It allows publishers to push updates to every target platform (including iPad and HTML5-based players) once, while automatically customizing layouts for each device.</p>
<p>If all you want to do is create ePubs rather than apps or iBooks, Yishay Mor suggests that <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sigil/">Sigil</a> might be the solution you need, and the Edudemic site offers an insight into the process of <a href="http://edudemic.com/2012/01/make-your-own-textbook/">making your own textbook</a>, plus links to some useful resources.</p>
<p>The Scribble Press free iPad app lets <a href="http://the-gadgeteer.com/2012/01/13/kids-can-create-and-soon-be-able-to-order-printed-copies-books-with-scribble-press/">kids create and share their own books</a>, using the app&rsquo;s 50 story templates, over 500 drawing tools (markers, stamps, etc), layout tool, sticker collection and their own photos and imagination.&nbsp; Books are private unless you elect to have them vetted and shared in the public gallery.&nbsp; It will shortly also be possible to get printed copies made.</p>

<p><strong>e-Learning Industry Reports</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; Epic; Ground Report; Skillsoft]</em></p>
<p>The annual <a href="http://campustechnology.com/Articles/2012/02/06/The-6-Technologies-That-Will-Shape-Higher-Ed.aspx?Page=1">NMC Horizon Report</a> (copublished this year with Educause) focuses on the key technology areas likely to have a major impact on teaching and learning institutions within the next five years.&nbsp; Six of these were identified: near-term - mobile apps and tablet computing; mid-term - game-based learning and learning analytics; and long-term &ndash; gesture-based computing and the 'internet of things' (&ldquo;interconnected items in which the line between the physical object and digital information about it is blurred&rdquo;).&nbsp; The report also lists challenges which include institutional barriers to the adoption of new technologies and lack of digital literacy preparation among faculty.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t fancy registering and wading through the full report, an <a href="http://horizon.wiki.nmc.org/file/view/2012-Horizon.HE-Preview.pdf">eight-page summary</a> is also available.</p>
<p>Analysts Education Dynamics have released their annual <a href="http://educationdynamics.com/getattachment/Market-Research/2011-2012-eLearning-Index/eLIExecSummaryFinal.pdf.aspx">e-learning index</a>, based on prospective US student demand for online degrees and covering 3,400 degree programmes from more than 200 colleges and universities.&nbsp; At bachelor&rsquo;s level, demand has remained relatively unchanged with business degrees maintaining the largest percentage of market demand.&nbsp; But business masters degrees (including MBA) have seen the most precipitous decline in demand as a percentage of market share, with education showing the greatest growth in demand.&nbsp; Similarly at doctorate level, education is the largest field of study demanded by prospective students.</p>
<p>ASTD&rsquo;s annual <a href="http://www.skillsoft.com/about/press_room/press_releases/January_11_12_IndustryReport.asp">state of the industry report</a> has just been published.&nbsp; Evidence from 400+ US organisations suggests that employers spent $171.5 billion on employee learning in 2010, up from $125.8 billion in 2009, although learning hours per employee remained largely unchanged. &nbsp;40.1% of formal learning hours were delivered via technology-based methods and this included a notable increase in mLearning.</p>

<p><strong>Dramatic Growth of Mobile Data</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Cisco&rsquo;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/14/the-number-of-mobile-devices-will-exceed-worlds-population-by-2012-other-shocking-figures/">Visual Networking Index (VNI) Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update</a> examines in detail the dramatic growth we&rsquo;re seeing in the mobile Internet space, including the massive demands for mobile data, the growth of mobile video, and the rise of the smartphone as new gateway to the web.&nbsp; Global mobile data more than doubled for the fourth year in a row during 2011, with video accounting for 52% of that traffic.&nbsp; The report also concludes that the number of mobile devices will exceed world&rsquo;s population by the end of this year.</p>

<p><strong>Commerical e-Learning Developments</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian; Zite]</em></p>
<p>Pearson has bought a controlling stake in education firm <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/jan/18/pearson-tutorvista-india">TutorVista</a> for $127m.&nbsp; TutorVista provides technology and content to private and government schools, online tutoring to more than 10,000 students per month, a network of 60 centres across India delivering tuition courses and a full schools development service.&nbsp; Pearson derives around 70% of group revenue from the education sector, and 65% of that currently comes from the US.</p>
<p>Software supplier Assima has acquired <a href="http://www.sourcewire.com/releases/rel_display.php?relid=70090">Kaplan Learning Technologies</a> from Kaplan, Inc.&nbsp; The deal covers all assets and intellectual property associated with the STT Trainer and Atlantic-Link product lines but excludes the PerformIT product line.</p>

<p><strong>Public vs Private Education</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>William Leonard considers the different perspectives evident in <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20120202104115262">public vs private education in the US</a>, noting that, in 2007/08, the Apollo Group (University of Phoenix, etc) spent $800m on sales and marketing, against just $675m on teaching and classroom expenses.&nbsp; He wonders whether the two worlds are showing signs of convergence, citing some specific US public sector trends: tenure is on the demise; part-time faculty is on the increase; a growing number of traditional institutions are using direct marketing tactics; and some institutions are launching &lsquo;no-frills&rsquo; courses.</p>
<p>Derek Morrison reports on (and transcribes part of) a recent edition of Peter Day&rsquo;s &lsquo;World of Business&rsquo; on Radio 4.&nbsp; The programme considered <a href="http://www.auricle.org/auriclewp/?p=5647">the business of education</a> and included, &ldquo;some pretty insightful perspectives about the advance of the private sector into all levels of education but also offers some thought provoking contributions particularly from people like Martin Bean.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>UK Salary Surveys</strong></p>
<p><em>[Clive Shepherd; The Guardian]</em></p>
<p>UK learning and development recruitment agency, Blue Eskimo, has published its 2011 <a href="http://www.blueeskimo.com/salary-survey">training and e-learning work and salary survey</a>, based on responses from 813 clients.&nbsp; Key findings include: 60% had not received a salary increase in the past year; daily rates for contractors are shifting downwards, with more people moving into the &lt;&pound;300/day bracket; 80% work longer hours than they are paid for; 53% receive a company pension but 30% receive no benefits.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jan/16/vice-chancellors-9700-pay-rise?newsfeed=true">heads of UK elite universities</a> were awarded an average pay rise of &pound;9,700 (3.9%) last year, taking average earnings beyond &pound;333,000.&nbsp; Top of the form was Oxford's Prof Andrew Hamilton, who received a pay packet of &pound;424,000.&nbsp; The Guardian&rsquo;s list of the top 13 salaries does not include Martin Bean, so I guess the Audi will have to last another year.</p>

<p><strong>MITx</strong></p>
<p><em>[Adrian Bickers; Liz Mallet]</em></p>
<p>MIT has announced its first free course that will &ldquo;shatter barriers to education&rdquo;.&nbsp; An electronics course, beginning in March, will be the first prototype of an online project, known as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17012968">MITx</a>.&nbsp; The interactive course can be studied and assessed completely online and is designed to be fully automated, with successful students receiving a certificate.</p>

<p><strong>AI Professor Quits Stanford for Online Teaching Startup</strong></p>
<p><em>[MSNBC]</em></p>
<p>Sebastian Thrun, one of the two professors who taught the recent Stanford AI course for which 160,000 online students signed up, has given up his tenured academic position to found a startup that will deliver low-cost, online, university-level education.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46138856/ns/technology_and_science-innovation/t/professor-leaving-stanford-online-education-startup/">Udacity</a> joins a growing number of tech-driven efforts (such as the Khan Academy and Floating University) to revolutionize the traditional classroom model.&nbsp; &ldquo;Having done this, I can't teach at Stanford again,&rdquo; Thrun said. &ldquo;You can take the blue pill and go back to your classroom and lecture to your 20 students, but I've taken the red pill and I've seen Wonderland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Online University Education in Canada</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>The Canadian Virtual University consortium&rsquo;s glass is definitely half-empty.&nbsp; Its latest report, <a href="http://www.cvu-uvc.ca/Online University Education in Canada jan17 2012.pdf">Online University Education in Canada: Challenges and Opportunities</a>, finds that, &ldquo;Unfortunately, online education, particularly in Canada, has often been perceived as a poor fit with education and training needs (which is ironic, given online education&rsquo;s inherently flexible nature).&rdquo;&nbsp; The report also states that, &ldquo;Canada has weak national innovation indicators&rdquo; and, quoting Tony Bates, &ldquo;&hellip;unlike nearly every other country in the OECD, Canada does not have a national strategy to support e-learning or the use of technology in teaching.&nbsp; As a result Canada has lost its lead in e-learning and is slipping behind countries such as Australia and the UK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the University of Toronto&rsquo;s Prof Ben Levin argues that what the education system needs is <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2012/01/14/is-there-too-much-innovation-in-education/">not more innovation</a>, but tested and evaluated improvements.&nbsp; In particular, he singled out technology as an area that had failed to lead to improvements in the educational system.&nbsp; Similar sentiments came from a dean in a Canadian university who was heard to complain to a Director of Learning Technologies, &ldquo;All you guys want to do is to keep finding things to keep you employed. &nbsp;We don&rsquo;t need innovation; we need stability in our teaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Wolfram World</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jonathan Fine; Chris Hough; Zite]</em></p>
<p>The OU has received a &pound;1m grant from the Wolfson Foundation to help establish the <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=22814">Wolfson OpenScience Laboratory</a>, an online resource for undergraduates and more experienced graduates at the cutting edge of practical science teaching.&nbsp; The Lab will be a gateway to a range of scientific experiments and observations, many of which are developed by OU scientists.&nbsp; Although operated entirely online, users will be able to access data from real physical instruments and equipment, enabling them to carry out authentic and rigorous science investigations.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/index.html">Wolfram Demonstrations Project</a> currently contains over 7,000 interactive demonstrations (each defined as a &lsquo;visualisation of a concept&rsquo;) covering a wide range of topics from arts and business through to maths, technology and science.&nbsp; They are written by the Mathematica community and the source code is freely available for use and adaptation.&nbsp; The only downside is the need to install Wolfram&rsquo;s CDF player</p>
<p>Also just launched is the <a href="http://education.wolfram.com/">Wolfram Education Portal</a> (beta).&nbsp; The portal currently contains a dynamic textbook, lesson plans, widgets, interactive demonstrations and more, all built by Wolfram education experts.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll need to sign up for a free account to get full access to all materials.</p>

<p>Educause has released a new white paper, <a href="http://www.educause.edu/blog/pkurkowski/ELIReleasesNewWhitePaperonAnal/246045">Analytics in Higher Education: Establishing a Common Language</a>, which looks at the use of analytics in HE and, in particular, the multiple meanings and usage of similar terms as well as different terms with similar conceptual or functional definitions.&nbsp; The paper aims to present the different descriptions of the various types of analytics being discussed in the academic and practitioner literature.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2012/01/20/using-analytics-to-identify-students-at-risk/">Tony Bates</a> refers to a recent paper by Academic Impressions&rsquo; Daniel Fuchs on identifying students at high risk of drop-out or failure.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.academicimpressions.com/news/vetting-early-alert-technologies?qq=10915m255415fK">Vetting Early Alert Technologies</a> includes advice from Jennifer Jones of Minnesota State University&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about what to look for when introducing a software solution.&nbsp; There is also a link to a second paper, <a href="http://www.academicimpressions.com/news/identifying-risk-students-what-data-are-you-looking">Identifying At-Risk Students: What Data Are You Looking At?</a> which considers effective use of the data once you have your system in place.</p>
<p>Blackboard is expanding field trials of a new <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/about-bb/media-center/Press-Releases.aspx?releaseid=1646731">learning analytics solution for Blackboard Learn</a>.&nbsp; This builds on a Blackboard Analytics tool that was launched last year and is already in use with over 150 HE institutions.</p>

<p><strong>And Finally&hellip;</strong></p>
<p><em>[</em><em>Lara Mynors]</em></p>
<p>BBC News asks about Trendfear, or whether you ever <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16789155">get a nagging fear that trends are passing you by</a>?&nbsp; Any article that cites Douglas Adams&rsquo;s theory of new technology (everything that's already in the world when you're born is just normal, anything created between birth and the age of 30 is incredibly exciting and creative, but whatever is invented after you've turned 30 is against the natural order of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it) must be worth a read, and you might just learn about a few key newcomers.</p>

<p><strong>College of Law Ownership</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>

<p><strong>With Increased Fees, How Open Will the OU be?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>OUSA&rsquo;s Marianne Cantieri writes in The Guardian about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/dec/19/open-university-fees-increase?CMP=twt_gu">OU fee increases and their potential impact</a> on student numbers, particularly those from financially disadvantaged backgrounds.&nbsp; She is also not convinced that student loans will solve the problem.&nbsp; The majority of the 100+ comments on the article are positive and supportive of the OU&rsquo;s position.&nbsp; You are reminded that the <a href="http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/22316">e-petition</a> remains open for signature.</p>
<p>University World News contains a special report with articles addressing <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/topic.php?topic=SpecialReports">global issues facing HE</a>, including the funding situation, international student mobility, the performance of branch campuses and private funding.</p>

<p><strong>MIT to Offer Certificates to External Online Students</strong></p>
<p><em>[Paul Hollins]</em></p>
<p>Millions of learners have enjoyed free learning materials from MIT&rsquo;s OpenCourseWare project.&nbsp; Now the Institute is planning <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/MIT-Will-Offer-Certificates-to/130173/">MITx</a>, &ldquo;a virtual community of millions of learners around the world&rdquo;.&nbsp; MITx will, from this Spring, give anyone free access to an online-course platform. From where they can watch videos, answer questions, practice exercises, visit online labs, and take quizzes and tests.&nbsp; Whilst access is free, MIT plans to charge a &ldquo;modest&rdquo; fee for certificates that indicate a learner has mastered the content.&nbsp; It's unclear exactly how the assessment will work.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>What's the Right Price for Great Educational Content?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters;</em> <em>Pew Internet; Zite; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Audrey Watters considers the thorny question of <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/01/01/finding-the-right-price-for-great-educational-content/">what an organisation could/should charge for educational content</a>, using US maths company Mathalicious&rsquo;s new pricing plan as an example.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, her conclusions are along the lines of &lsquo;it depends&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pew Internet looked into the value of digital content a year ago and came up with some figures for <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Press-Releases/2010/Paying-for-Digital-Content.aspx">what percentage of users were paying for material</a>.&nbsp; Music and software came out top, with 33% of users having paid for it, 18% paid for newspapers/journals and 10% paid for e-books, although e-learning was not considered as a specific category.</p>
<p>Suzanne Kavanagh considered the position back in 2010 in respect of <a href="http://www.publishingtalk.eu/blog/conferences/free-or-fee-valuing-content-in-the-digital-era-part-2/">academic books</a> and her posting includes an interesting 24 min video by Bloomsbury Academic&rsquo;s Frances Pinter on &lsquo;rethinking the role and funding of academic book publishing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>More current is Mike Taylor&rsquo;s blog posting last week about the <a href="http://svpow.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/the-obscene-profits-of-commercial-scholarly-publishers/">obscene profits of commercial scholarly publishers</a>.&nbsp; He notes that Elsevier, Springer, Wiley and Informa all announced profits of 30%+ over the past year or so.</p>
<p>Finally, the Fordham Institute has just released a paper on <a href="http://www.edexcellencemedia.net/publications/2012/20120110-the-costs-of-online-learning/20120110-the-costs-of-online-learning.pdf">the costs of online learning</a>, although Stephen Downes has some lingering doubts about the robustness of the data and some of the assumptions made.</p>

<p><strong>Aakash Tablet Ships</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; Tony Bates; Yishay Mor; Mark Gaved]</em></p>
<p>India&rsquo;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/03/indias-low-cost-aakash-tablet-pre-orders-hit-1-4-million/">Aakash tablet</a> is a reality.&nbsp; The first 30,000 devices shipped in Dec and the waiting list now sits at 1.4m.&nbsp; Devices are priced at around &pound;30, with an additional government subsidy bringing this down to &pound;22 for students.&nbsp; Manufacturer Datawind is struggling to keep up with demand; it is also pushing an alternative &pound;40 tablet with a much better processor (700MHz Arm Cortex A8 vs the Aakash&rsquo;s 366Mhz Arm11), a bigger battery, a newer version of Android, and GPRS mobile data.</p>
<p>Another competitor for Indian students has emerged in the form of <a href="http://niyazshaikh.wordpress.com/2012/01/11/classpad-tablet-launched-for-education-sector/">Classpad</a>, available in three versions priced between &pound;95-&pound;180.&nbsp; Whereas Aakash is general purpose, Classpad aims specifically at education and, according to CEO Rohit Pande, "the software installed in Classpad tests students' problem solving, creativity and application of language skills. &nbsp;It provides them with personalized teaching as per their learning capabilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, launched last week at CES, comes one-laptop-per-child&rsquo;s new <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/01/09/olpc_tablet_ces/">$100 XO3 tablet</a>, featuring an 8&rdquo; LCD display, 1GHz chip, Wi-Fi, wind-up power and optional solar cell.&nbsp; OLPC&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/02/negroponte_tablet_airdrops/">Nicholas Negroponte</a> hopes to follow Professor Sugata Mitra&rsquo;s Hole-in-the-Wall principle of people teaching themselves: &ldquo;&hellip;we'll take tablets and drop them out of helicopters into villages that have no electricity and school, then go back a year later and see if the kids can read.&rdquo;&nbsp; Apart from Hole-in-the-Wall, there is further evidence that this approach <em>can</em> work because, according to Negroponte, there are now around 500,000 children in Peru who are teaching their parents to read using OLPC.</p>

<p><strong>Worldwide Internet Usage</strong></p>
<p><em>[Next Big Future]</em></p>
<p>The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) estimates that at the end of 2011 there were <a href="http://nextbigfuture.com/2012/01/internet-usage-at-end-of-2011-for-world.html">2.42 billion internet users in the world</a> and a shade under 6 billion active mobile subscribers.&nbsp; The top 3 internet users are China (485m), USA (245m) and India (100m).&nbsp; The UK is 8<sup>th</sup> with 51.4m.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Project Management for Instructional Designers</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Students from Brigham Young University, led by David Wiley, are putting the finishing touches on their new online textbook, <a href="http://idpm.us/#1">Project Management for Instructional Designers</a>.&nbsp; The book is an adaptation of Darnall &amp; Preston&rsquo;s Project Management from Simple to Complex,&nbsp; but the BYU students have replaced examples with those appropriate to instructional design, added video interviews and created interactive, mastery-check assessments.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Design Webinar</strong></p>
<p><em>[ALT]</em></p>
<p>To what extent should learning design be supported computationally?&nbsp; The eLearning Network presents a 90 minute webinar-based discussion between <a href="http://www.alt.ac.uk/events/what-extent-should-learning-design-be-supported-computationally">Diana Laurillard and Stephen Downes</a>, taking place online between 17.00 and 18.30 (GMT) on <strong>Wed 22 Feb</strong>.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Instructional Designers: To Degree or Not Degree?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Cammy Bean]</em></p>
<p>Cammy Bean has been surveying <a href="http://app.sgizmo.com/reports/7945/12263/05PW168LFAQL3H8RD02JLM2SWQ061F/?ts=1325772419">what academic qualifications are possessed by instructional designers</a>.&nbsp; Of the 506 responses he received (65% US, 10% India, 8% Canada, 6% UK; 58% corporate training, 22% HE), 63% did <em>not </em>have an ID-related degree, 2% did and 35% had an advanced degree.&nbsp; Of those without, 22% were studying for an ID qualification.</p>
<p>MacLean &amp; Scott conducted <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=1065-0741&volume=24&issue=3">similar research in 2007</a> with a smaller sample of 307 (35% UK, 28% US, 8% Canada).&nbsp; Looking at the UK picture, 21% had no specific training or qualifications in learning design, 4% had a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree, 33% had a Master&rsquo;s degree and 5% had a Doctorate.</p>

<p><strong>2012: A Time For Highly Connected Learning Specialists </strong></p>
<p><em>[Clive Shepherd]</em></p>
<p>Clive Shepherd suggests, in his first posting of 2012, that <a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2012/01/2012-time-for-highly-connected-learning.html#!/2012/01/2012-time-for-highly-connected-learning.html">the age of the generalist L&amp;D professional is over</a>: &ldquo;You will not be sufficiently marketable if you do a bit of everything in much the same way as everyone else.&nbsp; True we need some managers to pull everything together, but working for these people will be specialists, whether that's in highly-technical subject areas or in new, more scalable approaches to learning [&hellip;] To keep up-to-date and search out opportunities, L&amp;D professionals need to be more connected than ever before.&nbsp; To some degree that can happen in traditional ways, but more than likely it will mean networking online.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Meta EdTech Journal </strong></p>
<p><em>[Martin Weller; ALT]</em></p>
<p>Martin has used Wordpress Annotum to create a <a href="http://metaedtech.wordpress.com/">Meta EdTech Journal</a> which he intends to publish three times a year, collating some of the articles from other open access ed tech journals. &nbsp;He acknowledges that this can be easily done already using a number of tools including the humble blog, but he believes by looking and behaving &ldquo;roughly journalish&rdquo;, it begins to feel like a journal. &nbsp;He also thinks that authors might find it appealing that their articles no longer sit in just one journal, but may appear in dozens of different 'mashup' or meta journals.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s also looking for editors&hellip;</p>
<p>ALT has made its association journal <em><a href="http://www.researchinlearningtechnology.net/index.php/rlt">Research in Learning Technology</a> </em>open access with effect from 1 Jan.&nbsp; Articles dating back to 1993 are now freely available, including an early gem: <a href="http://www.researchinlearningtechnology.net/index.php/rlt/article/view/9462">Academics' use of courseware materials: a survey</a> by Laurillard, Swift &amp; Darby (1993) in which they find that 35mm slides were the most popular alternative format to textbooks, having been used by 46% of academics, followed videocassettes (35%).&nbsp; Only around a quarter of academics had used any form of computer based learning and less than half had ever seen any CBL programs in their field.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>EURODL Special Issue</strong></p>
<p><em>[Anne Howells]</em></p>
<p>The European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning (EURODL) has launched a special issue on <a href="http://www.eurodl.org/?p=special&sp=init2">Creativity and Open Educational Resources</a>.&nbsp; This includes papers on information literacy, student-produced material, quality, collaborative environments and learning via MOOCs.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>e-Textbook Costs and Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Tony Bates; Stephen Downes; Zite]</em></p>
<p>The Chronicle reports on a study, conducted over four semesters by <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/new-study-shows-e-textbooks-saved-many-students-only-1/34793">Daytona State College</a>, which compared the use of traditional print purchase, print rental, e-textbook rental, and e-textbook rental with an e-reader device.&nbsp; It found that e-textbooks still face several hurdles to adoption and, in the worst case, one course&rsquo;s students saved only $1 during three of the four semesters due to &ldquo;publisher pricing decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Alan Levine (via Stephen Downes) laments the bias shown in the article.&nbsp; They refer to the actual <a href="http://www.educause.edu/EDUCAUSE+Quarterly/EDUCAUSEQuarterlyMagazineVolum/AStudyofFourTextbookDistributi/242784">Educause report</a> and note that its findings were broader and more constructive: &ldquo;Institutions seeking to implement campus-wide e-text adoption should be prepared to address specific concerns, including faculty choice, infrastructure needs, student technological skills, cost savings, and instructional adaptation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of passing interest is a small study involving 24 families with young children aged 3-6.&nbsp; Given the choice between <a href="http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2012/for-reading-and-learning-kids-prefer-e-books-to-print-books/">reading e-books or print books</a>, the children preferred e-books and</p>
<p>comprehension between the two formats was found to be the same.&nbsp; However, when using enhanced e-books &ndash; those that have more bells, whistles and interactivity than regular e-books &ndash; children recalled fewer of the details in the content of the richer e-books.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kids were more focused on tapping things and that took away from their comprehension as well as the interaction between the parent and the child,&rdquo; said researcher Carly Shuler.</p>

<p><strong>CES Announcements </strong></p>
<p><em>[Stuff; TechRadar; CNET]</em></p>
<p>The annual consumer electronics show took place last week in Las Vegas, featuring a host of new device announcements and launches.&nbsp; Device of the moment seems to be the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/roundup/10-best-ultrabooks-at-ces-2012-1054355">Ultrabook</a> (thin laptop, longer battery life, instant-on), but other gizmos included:</p>

<p><strong>Commercial News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran; The Australian; Campus Technology;</em><em> Marketing Week; Kineo]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pearson.com/about-us/education/announcements/?i=1503">Pearson has agreed to pay $155m</a> for Global Education and Technology Group, a provider of test preparation services for students in China who are learning English.&nbsp; Global Education has a network of approximately 450 test preparation and training centres across 60 cities in China, plus an online course delivery platform for students and professionals.&nbsp; The acquisition expands Pearson&rsquo;s reach in China from eight cities to 60 and provides a platform to develop beyond English language teaching.</p>
<p>Pearson is also collaborating with <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/university-of-new-englands-lofty-online-plan/story-e6frgcjx-1226049369441">Australia&rsquo;s University of New England</a> to pursue growth in an expanded online market.&nbsp; VC, Prof Jim Barber, said Pearson's role would cover marketing, recruitment, courseware upgrades, online support and delivery of some UNE courses via its Pearson LearningStudio LMS.&nbsp; The courses could include in-demand professional programs, such as teaching and law, and will be pitched at working adults.&nbsp; &ldquo;Importantly, UNE staff will continue to write all course material, teach all courses and retain all academic control,&rdquo; said Barber.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/11/09/blackboard-nabs-cerbibo-ups-stake-in-chinese-education.aspx">Blackboard has acquired CerBibo</a>, a provider of higher education and K-12 online learning software and services in China. &nbsp;CerBibo was created in 2003 as a joint venture between Blackboard and the China Education and Research Network and it currently supports more than 270 Chinese academic organisations.</p>
<p>US HE software giant <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/education-technology-companies-get-go-ahead-to-merge/34604">Datatel plans to buy SunGard Higher Education</a> for $1.8bn, for which it is seeking a $1.2-billion loan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/sectors/telecoms-and-it/o2-studies-e-learning-market/3031868.article">O2 is preparing to move into the e-learning market</a> as part of diversification plans, but it has discounted talk of using its existing student e-learning portal &lsquo;O2 Learn&rsquo; as a launchpad for new products or services, claiming that would be &ldquo;cynical&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Kineo seems to be cementing its position as a leading e-learning supplier.&nbsp; The company came out strongly in Donald Clark&rsquo;s recent <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2011/11/uk-e-learning-companies-in-rude-health.html">financial assessment</a>, it picked up 4 accolades at last month&rsquo;s e-Learning Age awards, interest in its Totara (Moodle with frills) LMS is healthy and they have just opened a Chinese office.&nbsp; And now they&rsquo;re giving stuff away, such as a range of <a href="http://www.kineo.com/elearning-reports/">free e-learning guides and reports</a> and an iOS app on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kineo-health-safety-essentials/id472994576">health and safety essentials</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE News</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>In a letter to the Telegraph, more than 500 academics claim that giving <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8881937/Professors-warn-over-expansion-of-private-universities.html">profit-making companies access to state funding</a> will create a system in which institutions pursue short-term financial gains at the expense of a decent education.</p>
<p>24 new universities and former polytechnics and one FE College have <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8932400/University-fees-lowered-to-fill-degree-courses.html">lowered their tuition fees to below &pound;7,500 a year</a>, no doubt reacting to a 13% drop in applications so far this year.</p>
<p>Birkbeck&rsquo;s Prof Claire Callender believes <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20111202221307320">government reforms will decrease social mobility</a>, through a combination of factors such as fee increases, the AAB policy, a shift in emphasis from &lsquo;disadvantage&rsquo; to &lsquo;fairness&rsquo; and the devolution of some responsibilities from the state to institutions.</p>
<p>The EU has set 2020 as the target date by which an EU average of at least 20% of HE graduates should have had a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2011120816445063">period of higher education-related study or training (including work placement) abroad</a>&rdquo;, representing a minimum of 15 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System &#40;ECTS&#41; credits &ldquo;or lasting a minimum of three months&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Higher Education Research and Advocacy Network in Africa</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>The Higher Education Research and Advocacy Network in Africa (<a href="http://chet.org.za/programmes/herana/">HERANA</a>) has completed one of the most comprehensive studies of African universities ever undertaken.&nbsp; For the past four years, the initiative has conducted research into tertiary systems and premier universities in eight African countries, focusing on the roles of HE in economic development and democracy, as well as a comparative study of three OECD countries.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s too much to summarise here, but a <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/index.php?page=Africa">special edition of University World News</a> contains all the details.</p>
<p>UWN also presents a detailed article on the OU-led <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20111125211700484">Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa</a> (TESSA) project, a consortium of 18 universities across Africa focused on improving the training of elementary school teachers.&nbsp; The scheme has so far reached an estimated 400,000 teachers in 12 countries, and won an award at last month&rsquo;s World Innovation Summit for Education in Qatar.</p>

<p><strong>LORO Project Highly Commended in OPAL Awards</strong></p>
<p><em>[Anna Comas-Quinn]</em></p>
<p>The OPAL Awards for quality and innovation through open educational practices recognise outstanding achievements in the fields of OER policy, promotion and use. &nbsp;Information on the 2011 winners can be found on the <a href="http://www.oer-quality.org/">OPAL site</a>, as can specific information on the <a href="http://www.oer-quality.org/news/the-loro-project/">LORO commendation</a>. &nbsp;The jury found that the LORO project was <em>&ldquo;anchored in a clear vision and strategy and aims fundamentally to change the practice of both the academics and the student teachers to include processes of sharing, showcasing, adapting and re-using resources&rdquo;</em> and has resulted <em>&ldquo;in a highly focused intervention with clearly defined OER and OEP objectives, giving us evidence of its capacity to transform learning.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>One in Four New Courses Attracts no Students</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>A research project financed by HEFCE has analysed UCAS data from 2005 to 2008, finding that 23% of new undergraduate courses in that period <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=418366">did not recruit any students</a>.&nbsp; The project estimates that the start-up costs of face-to-face courses average around &pound;20,000, even before they are marketed to students.&nbsp; London Metropolitan University is already cutting its portfolio by 70% and its VC, Malcolm Gillies, said, &ldquo;courses are often determined by what staff wish to supply rather than what students wish to study.&rdquo;&nbsp; His view was echoed by Portsmouth&rsquo;s Peter Reader, who has previously accused academics of creating &ldquo;vanity courses&rdquo; that are of interest to them but not to students&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Net Generation and Digital Natives </strong></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;[ORO; Donald Clark;</em><em> Yishay Mor;</em> <em>Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>I may have mentioned this earlier in the year but it&rsquo;s now freely available in the ORO repository.&nbsp; <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/30014/">The net generation and digital natives: implications for higher education</a> by Chris Jones and Binhui Shao looks across national boundaries and unpicks some of the mythology surrounding student Ed Tech preferences and habits.&nbsp; For example: students persistently report that they prefer moderate use of ICT in their courses; there is no demand for changes to pedagogy, such as the introduction of group working; nor is there a natural demand for Blogs, Wikis and 3D Worlds that teaching staff and universities should feel obliged to satisfy.&nbsp; Finally, they could find no evidence of a demand for highly individualised or personal university services.</p>
<p>Donald Clark takes a different perspective on recent and emerging technologies, suggesting that <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2011/12/more-pedagogic-change-in-last-10-years.html">there has been more pedagogic change in 10 years than the last 1000 years</a> &ndash; and it&rsquo;s all driven by 10 technology innovations.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Mary Meeker's annual presentation on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/18/mary-meekers-2011-presentation-on-internet-trends-slides/">internet trends</a> is available via Scribd. &nbsp;If you can&rsquo;t face all 66 slides, highlights include&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Mobile Learners</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Educause; eLearn Magazine]</em></p>
<p>The University of Wisconsin&rsquo;s Suzanne Porath has conducted a <a href="http://www.rcetj.org/index.php/rcetj/article/view/115/251">literature review into text messaging by those aged 11-21</a>, focusing on the motivation, means, and methods of text messaging. &nbsp;In addition, she considers how adults have successfully engaged text messaging to access and inform youth about health-related issues.</p>
<p>Educause&rsquo;s 2011 report into <a href="http://www.educause.edu/Resources/MobileITinHigherEducation2011R/238470">Mobile IT in Higher Education</a> gathered data from 209 HEIs.&nbsp; Findings include: 90% of respondents expect spending on mobile-enablement to rise over the next 3 years, although 35% report zero current spending on mobile; and predicted heaviest demand will be for general communications (35%), followed by instruction (20%).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Learning Styles &hellip; or not?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>The answer to the perennial learning styles debate is almost certainly, &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;.&nbsp; Guy Wallace discusses the matter at length in last month&rsquo;s <a href="http://elearnmag.acm.org/archive.cfm?aid=2070611">eLearn Magazine</a> and his general thrust is that, whilst there is no clear evidence against the existence of &lsquo;learning styles&rsquo;, nor is there any strong evidence to support the efficacy of differentiating instruction by learning styles.</p>

<p><strong>UK Private Universities</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; The Guardian; THE; Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>Glynne Stanfield, a partner in the education group at Eversheds, predicts that a private equity firm or <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=417767&c=1">private higher education provider will buy a UK university</a> in whole or part &ldquo;within the next six months&rdquo; and thus gain its degree-awarding powers.&nbsp; The prediction by, comes as government documents reveal that a US private equity firm, Warburg Pincus, has twice met with David Willetts, the universities and science minister.&nbsp; Much more detail on this in a <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20111111214152532">University World News article</a> by Andrew McGettigan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/oct/17/coventry-university-college-half-price-degree?newsfeed=true">Coventry University College</a>, an offshoot of Coventry University, is recruiting students for "no-frills" professional courses including accounting, law and marketing, at a maximum cost of &pound;4,800.&nbsp; The university college is located in Coventry city centre and will be open 42 weeks a year, offering teaching from 7am to 10pm on weekdays, and until 4pm at weekends.&nbsp; However, students will not have access to the parent university's library, IT or sporting facilities.</p>
<p>BPP Law School is publicising January course starts, which it says has seen an overall increase in student numbers.&nbsp; Flexibility of this and other institutions is covered in this <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/student/postgraduate/postgraduate-study/give-yourself-a-competitive-edge-by-starting-your-course-in-january-2373309.html">Independent article</a>, but no mention of the ever-so-flexible OU.</p>
<p>The London branch of Indian-owned <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20111021095946629">TASMAC</a> (Training and Advanced studies in Management and Communication) went into liquidation last month, leaving around 1000 London School of Business students from more than 20 countries out of pocket and with just 60 days under UK visa rules to find another course.&nbsp; This has prompted calls by student bodies for a mandatory UK guarantee scheme for private colleges to prevent genuine students being left out of pocket when organisations fail or close for other reasons.</p>
<p>A new wave of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/oct/10/vocational-comprehensive-schools/print">university technical colleges</a> will open in England next year with businesses helping to shape the curriculum.&nbsp; The comprehensive schools for 14- to 19-year-olds will be backed by firms including Toshiba, Boeing and Rolls Royce.&nbsp; Schools may have a specific professional focus, such as one in Liverpool, specialising in life sciences and backed by the pharmaceutical firm Novartis, and one in Plymouth backed by the Royal Navy and Babcock.&nbsp; A school in Buckinghamshire will be jointly backed by Hewlett Packard, Research in Motion (Blackberry) and Cisco.</p>

<p><strong>The 10 Best Schools To Get An Ed Tech Masters Online</strong><br /><em>[Edudemic]</em></p>
<p>Edudemic publishes a list of <a href="http://edudemic.com/2011/10/online-masters-edtech/">10 Best Ed Tech Masters programmes</a>.&nbsp; However, they seem to have rather missed the point that one of the benefits of online learning is that it can transcend national boundaries; hence, there are no non-US providers listed.&nbsp; C- Must try harder.</p>

<p><strong>Planet Pearson</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Journal; Hack Education; Wired Campus; Giles Clark; e-Learning Guild</em><em>]</em></p>
<p>Pearson is teaming with <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2011/11/08/knewton-pearson-pair-up-to-deliver-customized-learning-experience.aspx">Knewton</a> to roll out the world&rsquo;s first Adaptive Learning Platform, designed to customise learning materials to meet students' exact needs by assessing what they know and how they learn best before tailoring lessons and textbook material accordingly.&nbsp; Pearson will integrate the technology into its digital offerings, beginning with the MyLab and Mastering series which receive more than 750,000 daily logins.&nbsp; Knewton was founded by former Kaplan executive Jose Ferriera and the company secured $33 million in funding last month to grow its technology.&nbsp; EdSurge examine the initiative in more detail, taking the view that <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/1678745/personalization-and-analytics-the-future-of-education">personalisation and analytics</a> will be at the heart of education in the future.</p>
<p>Pearson has announced <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/10/13/pearsons-free-lms/">OpenClass</a>, a cloud-based LMS that senior vice president Adrian Sannier claims is &ldquo;absolutely for free. No licensing costs, no costs for maintenance, and no costs for hosting. So this is a freer offer than Moodle is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pearson heavily promotes the fact that OpenClass is distributed through <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/google-says-pearsons-new-learning-system-is-not-a-shared-project/33861">Google&rsquo;s App</a> marketplace, and say that it was inspired by Google&rsquo;s popular e-mail and Web services platform. &nbsp;But Google&rsquo;s Tim Drinan, when asked to clarify the nature of the relationship, noted, &ldquo;There were some misleading headlines with the Pearson&rsquo;s announcement.&nbsp; What it&rsquo;s not is it&rsquo;s not a joint release, and it&rsquo;s not a shared product.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pearson.com/about-us/business-information/announcements/?i=1496">Pearson&rsquo;s Q3 sales</a> in US Education were up 1% and, in HE, more than eight million student registrations were generated for MyLabs subject-specific digital homework and assessment programmes (up 23%), and almost five million enrolments in online courses provided through Pearson's LearningStudio/eCollege (up 33%).&nbsp; MyLab registrations outside North America were up more than 30% on the same period last year to more than 600,000.</p>
<p>Blackboard has &lsquo;merged&rsquo; with <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/About-Bb/Media-Center/Press-Releases.aspx?releaseid=1614036">Edline</a>, another LMS/VLE supplier, mainly in the K-12 sector.&nbsp; Edline is currently installed in over 20,000 US schools; the company will become a division of Blackboard.</p>
<p>Brighton-based <a href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20111015/BUSINESS/110150313/Element-K-purchased-110M-by-competitor?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|Business">Element-K</a> has been bought a competitor in the generic e-learning field, Skillsoft, for $110m from former owners NIIT who bought Element-K in 2006 for $40m.</p>

<p><strong>Ed Tech Surveys</strong></p>
<p><em>[Anne Howells; Sloan-C; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Educause has released its 2011 <a href="http://www.educause.edu/Resources/ECARNationalStudyofUndergradua/238012">National Study of Undergraduate Students and Information Technology</a>, based on a survey of 3,000 students in over 1,200 US colleges and universities.&nbsp; Findings include the fact that &ldquo;students are drawn to hot technologies but rely on traditional devices&rdquo;, raising the immediate problem of how suppliers can support all the different devices and formats required.&nbsp; Just take a look at reported device ownership: Laptop (owned by 87% of those surveyed); iPod (62%); Smartphone (55%); Desktop PC (53%); MP3 player (29%); e-Reader (12%); Netbook (11%); and iPad (8%).</p>
<p>The ninth annual Babson/Sloan US online education survey, <a href="http://sloanconsortium.org/publications/survey/going_distance_2011">Going the Distance</a>, has just been published.&nbsp; Key findings are that: 31% of all HE students are taking at least one online course; the 10% growth rate for online enrolments exceeds the 2% for HE overall; academic leaders believe that student satisfaction is now equivalent for online and F2F courses; and 65% of HEIs say that online learning is a critical part of their long-term strategy.</p>
<p>The 2011 (US) <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/10/20/campus-computing-survey-mobile-apps-grow-cloud-adoption-slow.aspx">campus computing survey</a> has just been released, highlights of which include: an increase in the use of mobile apps (used by 55% of institutions compared with 33% a year ago); cloud computing being used for email but little else; Blackboard&rsquo;s LMS share falling as Moodle and Sakai rise; and an increase in the anticipated educational importance of e-books in the next 5 years.</p>

<p><strong>UK e-Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Computeach; Donald Clark;</em><em> Guardian]</em></p>
<p>According to Learning Light, Britain has the <a href="http://www.computeach.co.uk/IT-news/IT-Computer-Technology-News/IT-industry-news-Britain-has-biggest-e-learning-industry/800773053">largest e-learning industry in the EU</a>, with more than 400 companies specialising in e-learning for the corporate learning market alone.&nbsp; Their report predicted that corporate e-learning expenditure is growing at over 6% each year while many developers of e-learning solutions have reported increase in sales of over 20% pa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, nobody knows the UK e-learning industry quite like <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2011/11/uk-e-learning-companies-in-rude-health.html">Donald Clark</a>, and his assessment of the key players gets straight to the financial key points.</p>
<p>And now the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/government-computing-network/2011/oct/25/civil-service-e-learning?newsfeed=true">Civil Service</a> thinks it has discovered the benefits of e-learning and is predicting a &pound;90m saving with more L&amp;D activities moving from classrooms to computer screens, as evidenced by the 76% increase in online training days so far this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Hmm, there&rsquo;s nothing more dangerous than a government minister extrapolating a few beans into a grand claim.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no doubt that e-learning can help, but sometimes the snake oil doesn&rsquo;t cure grandma&rsquo;s cough.</p>

<p><strong>How Has Technology Affected Cheating and Plagiarism?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Edudemic]</em></p>
<p>Recent research by schools.com found that online technology is blurring the boundaries of what people regard as <a href="http://edudemic.com/2011/10/edtech-cheating/">cheating</a>, with 71% of respondents believing that copying from the Web is NOT &ldquo;serious cheating&rdquo; and 53% considering that cheating is &ldquo;no big deal&rdquo;.&nbsp; Some 82% of college/university alumni admitted to engaging in some form of cheating as undergraduates.</p>

<p><strong>The Future of Education</strong></p>
<p><em>[Non Scantlebury; Zite]</em></p>
<p>Steve Hargadon&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.futureofeducation.com/">Future of Education</a> site is very active at the moment, with a number of online interviews and discussions planned for the coming months.&nbsp; Recording are also available for previous conversations.&nbsp; Topics seem to include almost anything ending in a 2.0 &ndash; web&hellip; library&hellip; classroom&hellip; education&hellip; etc, etc.</p>
<p>And USC&rsquo;s Lloyd Armstrong considers <a href="http://www.changinghighereducation.com/2011/11/what-will-the-college-of-2020-look-like.html">what the College of 2020 will look like</a>, concluding that there will be greater use of online and blended learning, a 12 month academic calendar, fewer research universities and increased transfer opportunities &ndash; but student learning will be a key differentiating factor.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Rhodri Thomas; Inge de Waard; TechCrunch; Liam Green-Hughes]</em></p>
<p>The GSMA's Mobile Education project has recently published a paper, <a href="http://www.gsmaembeddedmobile.com/mobile-education/">The Mobile Proposition for Education</a>, describing some key educational scenarios where the use of mobile-enabled handheld technologies can deliver significant benefits. &nbsp;These include: vocational education and training, consistent connectivity for children, out-of-classroom education and collaboration, professional learning and development, literacy skills, and supporting students with learning difficulties and disabilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.online-journals.org/index.php/i-jim">iJIM</a> is an open access journal on m-learning and interactive mobile technologies.&nbsp; Vol 5, No 4 includes papers on performance support in HE, semantic web for tourism and adaptive m-learning for English language learning.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7cuatm_bqw">Networked Society: On the Brink</a> is an engaging 20 min film from Ericsson with contributions from industry notables on where we&rsquo;ve come in the past 15 years in terms of connectivity, where we might be going and how difficult it is to speculate beyond the short term with any degree of certainty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ericsson is also running a competition for people who <a href="http://www.ericssonapplicationawards.com/technology-good-apps-competition">have an idea for a mobile app</a> in the areas of &ldquo;social and economic development&rdquo; and &ldquo;energy and climate change&rdquo;.&nbsp; Good news &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to build the app, just film the problem and present a use case where your app could help.</p>

<p><strong>Kindle Fire Ships </strong></p>
<p><em>[Lara Mynors; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/reviews/2011/11/kindle-fire/all/1">Kindle Fire</a> begins shipping in the US this week, but Wired reviewer Jon Phillips is underwhelmed.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not impressed by the screen size, processing speed, lack of camera, lack of 3G, etc.&nbsp; These may be valid points, but comparing a $200 Fire with a $500 iPad hardly seems fair.</p>
<p>Abilene Christian University has just published a report on their three years&rsquo; experience of <a href="http://campustechnology.com/Articles/2011/10/24/Mobile-Initiatives-Breaking-Down-the-Walls-of-the-Classroom-at-Abilene-Christian-U.aspx?Page=1">using iPods, iPhone and iPads to support learning</a>.&nbsp; The findings are positive and, of the 149 faculty members surveyed, 89% bring mobile devices to class, 84% regularly use the devices in class and half of faculty report using the devices in every class.&nbsp; Over 80% report that mobility device usage has improved collaboration, communication and control in their academic experience.&nbsp; According to Director of Educational Innovation, Bill Rankin, &ldquo;Education used to be seen as a class - it was something that took place at this time, from 8 to 8:50 am Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in room 103.&nbsp; What we've seen is that that will totally change.&nbsp; Class is with me everywhere I go.&nbsp; I'm always connected with my classmates, with my teacher, with my learning content.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Demise of Flash</strong></p>
<p><em>[Pete Mitton; Mashable]</em></p>
<p>How do you admit the game is over for a piece of software without actually saying so?&nbsp; You &lsquo;halt further development&rsquo;, just as Adobe has now done for <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html">Flash on mobile devices</a>, stating that HTML 5 technology offers the best solution because it is &ldquo;universally supported&rdquo;.&nbsp; The Apple position certainly hasn&rsquo;t helped matters, but Flash is also hampered by increasing security concerns, accessibility shortcomings and the absence of right clicks and mouse-over on touch-screen devices.&nbsp; The company has also announced cessation of future support for Flash on <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/11/10/adobe-abandon-flash-tvs">digital home devices</a> such as HDTVs.</p>

<p><strong>Why Aren&rsquo;t Students Using E-Books?</strong><br /><em>[Mindshift; Stephen Downes; Chris Hough]</em></p>
<p>Library e-book provider eBrary has released some preliminary results from its 2011 <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/11/why-arent-students-using-e-books/">Global Student e-Book Survey</a>, suggesting that student e-book usage has not increased significantly in the past 3 years.&nbsp; So why such a different picture to the rosy one painted by Amazon?&nbsp; Reasons are many and varied, ranging from availability and cost of academic titles (plus no resale value) to functional limitations such as making and sharing annotations, highlights and notes and poor integration with other social tools.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for US students to pay $200 for a textbook but a new project, <a href="http://www.opencourselibrary.org/">Open Course Library</a>, co-funded by the State of Washington and the Gates Foundation has made materials available for 42 most common courses, with a further 39 planned for 2013.&nbsp; Books can be bought for $30 or used online at no cost.&nbsp; Materials are currently hosted on the <a href="http://cnx.org/lenses/sbctc/endorsements?b_size=100">Connexions</a> OER site and are available in various formats including PDF, ePub, XML and IMS Common Cartridge.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/v2/">National Library of Medicine</a> has digitised a number of notable antique books which can be examined in Flash turn-the-page format, often with audio descriptions and additional notes.&nbsp; Examples include Hooke&rsquo;s Micrographia (1665), al-Qazwini&rsquo;s Wonders of Creation (~1250) and the Edwin Smith surgical papyrus, dating back to around the 17<sup>th</sup> century BC.</p>

<p>The Freedom of Information Act may be bringing a whole new meaning to the term &lsquo;open&rsquo;.&nbsp; David Johnson has filed a request using the act to receive &ldquo;copies of all teaching materials&rdquo; for <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/coursemodule_material_etc#outgoing-163786">the OU&rsquo;s complete suite of Law modules</a>, citing the Information Commissioner's judgment against the University of Central Lancashire in 2009 in support of his claim.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not the world&rsquo;s greatest clipart fan but I can see the attraction of this free offering from <a href="http://www.designcomics.org/">Design Comics</a>.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve created a series of background scenes and a suite of characters with an extensive range of different poses and expressions, all in StarOffice format which will also open in PowerPoint.&nbsp; If you need to create some visual scenarios and don&rsquo;t have ready access to a graphic artist, they may just save the day.</p>

<p><strong>&lsquo;Talk to the Hand&hellip;&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Researchers at Carnegie-Mellon have &lsquo;Omnitouch&rsquo; demonstrated technology to allow <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/17/cmu-researchers-turn-any-surface-into-a-touchscreen">multitouch interfaces to be displayed on any surface</a>, including notebooks, body parts and tables, using a picoprojector and a 3D scanner similar to the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Kinect">Kinect</a>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve seen similar things before under the guise of augmented reality and the first video demonstrates it well, but what made this fascinating for me was a second video clip showing how the technology worked to identify fingers and gestures.</p>
<p>An offshoot of the Omintouch project sees the introduction of a microphone to increase the discrimination of the interface.&nbsp; Early experiments with <a href="http://chrisharrison.net/index.php/Research/TapSense.">Tapsense</a> show that the system can differentiate between a tip, pad, nail and knuckle, meaning that these could allow additional functions to be selected such as right-click, capitalisation or open/close object.</p>

<p><strong>Moodle 2 Beginner's Guide<br /></strong><em>[Nick Freear]</em></p>
<p>The full title of Nick&rsquo;s new book is <a href="http://www.scoop.it/t/moodle4-9-book">Moodle 2 for Teaching 4-9 Year Olds Beginner's Guide</a> and the examples he uses are certainly aimed at that age group but, from what I saw of the sample chapter on the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/moodle-2-for-teaching-4-9-year-olds-beginners-guide/book">Packt Publishing site</a>, the book could take a relative Moodle novice step-by-step through the basics of setting up and administering a range of Moodle activities for almost any age group.</p>

<p><strong>Higher Education?&nbsp; Myths, Mantras, Illusions and Delusions</strong></p>
<p><em>[Donald Clark; George Siemens]</em></p>
<p>Donald Clark gives his own perspective on this recent book by <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2011/09/higher-education-myths-mantras.html">Hacker &amp; Dreifus</a> and to what extent it may apply to the UK.&nbsp; He notes a number of shortcomings in both our teaching and research, suggesting, &ldquo;The core problem is the indirect subsidy of 2nd and 3rd rate research.&nbsp; Reduce research and you improve teaching and reduce costs.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s that simple.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whilst not everything is directly relevant, he concludes, &ldquo;We are now third in the world on the cost of Higher Education to students, with only S Korea and the US ahead of us.&nbsp; We would do well to listen to what these researchers have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Siemens considers <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2011/09/15/duplication-theory-of-educational-value/">the value crisis in higher education</a>.&nbsp; This is tricky because different things have a different perceived value to different people at different times, and the non-physicality of the internet, and the many &lsquo;free&rsquo; offerings it carries, further complicate life.&nbsp; He believes, &ldquo;Universities that thrive in the future will be those that recognize the need for new value point positioning.&nbsp; Some will pursue an integration approach to value creation, others will rely on world-class faculty, and still others will rely on huge research projects or successful sports teams.&nbsp; Those will be anomalies and outliers.&nbsp; The vast majority of universities that will educate humanity in the coming decades will be those that structure their value point on elements that cannot be easily duplicated and scaled, or at minimum, require input costs to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Trying to Save Administrative Costs</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates; University World News]</em></p>
<p>A recent study concluded that US universities are complex, decentralized institutions which <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/09/16/unc_berkeley_cornell_experience_show_where_administrative_cuts_can_be_made">waste a lot of money on redundant administrative activities</a> and could probably save money in the long run if they made big changes to their structure.&nbsp; The report notes that, &ldquo;multiple layers of management can exacerbate complexity&rdquo; and &ldquo;local optimization, although well-intentioned and efficient on an individual basis, has unintentionally undermined pan-university effectiveness.&rdquo;&nbsp; The article also refers to the <a href="http://www.deltacostproject.org/resources/pdf/Trends2011_Final_090711.pdf">Delta Cost Project</a>, whose report provides details of funding and spending at more than 2,000 US institutions over an 11-year period.</p>
<p>Hundreds of academics, including some from the OU, have published an <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110930190351674">Alternative White Paper</a> in response to government plans for universities. &nbsp;In it, they put forward their idea of what a public university should be for and draw attention to the wider public significance of the reforms and the threat they believe these represent.</p>

<p><strong>Rise in Stay-at-Home Students</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>This research by insurer Liverpool Victoria came out in April but is worth noting.&nbsp; The company predicts that, by 2020, 52% of all <a href="http://www.lv.com/media_centre/press_releases/press_release?urltitle=university-ghost-towns">younger students will choose a local higher education establishment</a> and stay with their parents, a significant rise from the current level of 21%.&nbsp; However, the research also shows that 48% of current stay-at-home students say that living at home has made it harder for them to feel fully involved in student life.&nbsp; Seven cities are predicted to see decreases in student numbers of more than 40%, with Newcastle topping the bill at -52%.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Hack Education; David Wilson]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhorn/2011/09/15/pearson-goes-bold-acquires-connections-education/">Pearson</a> has acquired Connections Education, an online virtual school provider that serves about 40,000 students in 21 US states.&nbsp; And the New York Times is questioning the probity of Pearson sending various US state education commissioners on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/education/19winerip.html?_r=2">free trips</a> to Helsinki, Rio and London in pursuit of &ldquo;educational excellence&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/13/us-mcgrawhill-idUSTRE78B1Y620110913">McGraw-Hill</a> has announced that it will be splitting into two companies.&nbsp; One would focus on its education division, now second only in size to Pearson, and the other would handle the company&rsquo;s financial business, including its ownership of Standard &amp; Poor.&nbsp; The company is also funding Unigo, an online resource for college students which will now power the student review section of the US News &amp; World Report&lsquo;s college rankings.</p>
<p>US textbook rental giant <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chegg-expands-into-7-billion-college-recruiting-market-increases-student-base-by-over-35-million-129882763.html">Chegg</a> continues to expand by buying Zinch, a website that connects high school students to colleges.&nbsp; Chegg is seeking to become the platform for college students to get their books, course schedules, college recommendations, tutoring, and more.</p>
<p>Pearson has joined Google to launch <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/pearson-and-google-jump-into-learning-management-systems/33636?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+chronicle2Fwiredcampus+(The+Chronicle:+Wired+Campus)">OpenClass</a>, a free LMS that combines standard course-management tools with advanced social networking and community-building, and an open architecture that allows instructors to import whatever material they want, from e-books to YouTube videos. &nbsp;The program will launch through Google Apps for Education and will be hosted by Pearson with the aim of freeing institutions from the burden of supporting theuir own LMS.</p>

<p><strong>Major Publishers Join e-Textbook Project</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>An <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/major-publishers-join-indiana-u-project-that-requires-students-to-use-e-textbooks/33156">e-textbook project at Indiana University</a> has the support of major publishers including McGraw-Hill and Wiley.&nbsp; Students on certain courses are required to pay a materials fee which gets them access to the assigned electronic textbooks or other readings for the course.&nbsp; The university essentially becomes the broker of the textbook sales, but their high bulk volumes ensure good prices.&nbsp; The university&rsquo;s vice president for information technology says that students save more money through the program than they would if they bought a printed book and resold it to the second-hand market.&nbsp; McGraw-Hill said the deal gave the university a 20% discount off its usual e-book prices.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Open Publishing</strong></p>
<p><em>[George Siemens; Stephen Downes; Zite; Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>George refers to a recent Canadian paper, <a href="http://ifets.info/journals/14_3/19.pdf">A Comparison of an Open Access University Press with Traditional Presses</a>, which finds that &ldquo;releasing academic books on open access does not lessen printed book sales online in comparison with traditional university presses using Amazon&rdquo;.&nbsp; He advises authors to think beyond the financial impact of a book and consider broader factors such as extending the reach of their work and connecting with colleagues.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the IET Capitalist Writers Guild dominates a new book, <a href="http://www.igi-global.com/book/web-based-learning/40272">Web 2.0-Based E-Learning: Applying Social Informatics for Tertiary Teaching</a>, with current and former OU staff contributing six of the 21 chapters.</p>
<p>For those interested in do-it-yourself, Christian Cantrell has updated the considerable amount of guidance he offers on his <a href="http://www.livingdigitally.net/2010/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-to-digitally-self-publish.html">Everything You Need to Know About How to Digitally Self Publish</a> web page.</p>
<p>Prof Daniel Flint wanted his students to read a white paper on public relations, a couple of case studies, an industry report, and a chapter of a forthcoming book.&nbsp; He used a build-your-own-textbook service called <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/New-Digital-Tools-Let/129309/">AcademicPub</a>, which compiled the material and resolved the rights issues.&nbsp; The result was a 100-page book which students could download for $14.95 or get in paperback for $27.</p>
<p>And Phil Davies, writing on the Scholarly Kitchen blog, asks: &ldquo;<a href="http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2011/09/19/have-journal-editors-become-anachronisms/">Are journal editors an anachronism?</a> A throwback to an age of print publishing that no longer exists?&rdquo;&nbsp; He argues that, in an age of self-publishing and overabundant information, the importance of journals and editors should increase rather than diminish.</p>

<p><strong>Increase in US e-Reader Use</strong></p>
<p><em>[David Vince; TechCrunch; PC Pro; Hack Education; Stephen Downes; Giles Clark]</em></p>
<p>BlackBerry shipped only 200,000 PlayBooks in three months whereas Apple sells that number of iPads in about three days, so can anything compete?&nbsp; Amazon hopes to hot things up with a series of announcements at the end of Sep.&nbsp; Its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/28/amazon-unveils-new-79-kindle-99-e-ink-kindle-touch">new model line-up</a> includes a basic Kindle at $79/&pound;89 (still with buttons but no full keyboard), a touchscreen model at $99/&pound;109 and a 3G version at $149/&pound;149.&nbsp; But star of the show was the new $199 Android-powered <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/28/amazon-kindle-fir">Kindle Fire</a>, with a 7&rdquo; colour touchscreen, wi-fi, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/28/amazon-silk">&lsquo;silk&rsquo; browser and cloud storage</a>.&nbsp; Within days, <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/gadgets/kindle-fire-pre-orders-exceeding-2000-per-hour-2011104/">Fire pre-orders</a> were rolling in at the rate of more than 2,000 per hour.</p>
<p>UK Kindle prices are apparently higher because our versions will not have adverts, and a launch date and price have yet to be announced for the Fire.&nbsp; There now also seems to be evidence to support the long held view that <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/370273/amazon-selling-kindle-fire-at-a-loss">Amazon sells each Kindle at a loss</a>, recouping this in book sale profits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/mid/1508/articleId/864/ctl/ReadCustom Default/Default.aspx">Harris Poll on e-books</a>, e-readers, books and readership finds that one in six Americans owns an e-Reader.&nbsp; Overall, 16% of Americans read between 11 and 20 books a year, with 20% reading 21 or more books.&nbsp; However, of those who own an eReader, 32% read 11-20 books a year and 27% read 21 or more.&nbsp; The most popular genre is mystery, thriller and crime &ndash; read by 47% of the 2100 respondents.</p>
<p>But MIT&rsquo;s Christopher Mims wonders, <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/mimssbits/27185/?ref=rss">Will E-Books Destroy the Democratizing Effects of Reading</a>, given the tight controls currently imposed by publishers?</p>
<p>The Publishers&rsquo; Licensing Society publishes a periodic <a href="http://www.pls.org.uk/services/accessibility1/Pages/Accessibility Newsletter issue 13 PDF.pdf">accessibility newsletter</a>.&nbsp; Issue 13 is currently available and includes a report that the RNIB has found that 43 of the Top 50 books were available as e-books, and that 41 of those were available on the Kindle with text-to-speech enabled (up from just 21 a year ago).</p>

<p><strong>iPad to Dominate Tablet Sales Until 2015</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian; Upside Learning; Nick Watson]</em></p>
<p>A Gartner report predicts that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/sep/22/tablet-forecast-gartner-ipad">Apple will ship nearly 47m iPads this year</a>, commanding 73% of the tablet market.&nbsp; It further predicts that tablets sell 60% as many units as PCs by 2015 &ndash; and iPad will still have almost half the market by then (148m of an estimated 326m devices).&nbsp; It does not currently see Windows taking off in a big way on tablets (just 11% market share by 2015).</p>
<p>However, two separate reports from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and DigiTimes suggest that Apple is revising down its sales forecasts for the next quarter and <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/09/26/rumor_apple_reduces_ipad_2_orders_by_25_could_drop_price.html">may reduce the iPad pricing</a>.</p>
<p>And a separate report by Ambient Insight predicts that the <a href="http://www.ambientinsight.com/Reports/MobileLearning.aspx">worldwide market for mobile learning will grow</a> from $3.2bn last year to about $9.1bn by 2015.&nbsp; The report analyses trends and current expenditure across varied markets, predicting the US, China and India to be the top buying countries by 2015.</p>
<p>India hopes its home-grown <a href="http://telegraphindia.com/1111006/jsp/frontpage/story_14592989.jsp">Aakash tablet</a> will satisfy its internal market at a bargain price of &pound;25.&nbsp; The spec is quite poor, with a slow processor, limited memory and a resistive touch screen which is less responsive than the capacitive system on most tablets.&nbsp; If they can deliver on the promise, it has the potential to make a huge difference but, as the BBC points out, India&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-15180831">$10 laptop</a>, announced in 2009, came to nothing.</p>

<p><strong>Using iPads to Teach Music</strong></p>
<p><em>[Zite]</em></p>
<p>Neil Johnston is on a mission to increase the use of new technology to encourage potential music students.&nbsp; This video shows what happens when you <a href="http://edudemic.com/2011/09/ipads-in-classroom/">take a classroom of students, add 24 iPads</a>, sound recording gear and a few live instruments.&nbsp; The resulting song has received so much acclaim that it&rsquo;s available to buy at iTunes.</p>
<p>Also on iPad is Steinway&rsquo;s new free <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2011/09/15/140502368/rethinking-sheet-music-with-a-few-bells-and-whistles?ft=1&f=1049">Etude 2 app</a> which aims to teach budding pianists by highlighting keys as the music progresses, following either a traditional score or switching to piano-roll mode (&agrave; la Guitar Hero).&nbsp; Most of the free scores are classical for copyright reasons, but more modern songs typically cost &pound;1.99 &ndash; which I find curiously high, given that I can buy MP3s for &pound;0.69.</p>

<p><strong>You Tube for Teachers</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Whiteboard Blog; Zite]</em></p>
<p>Although we already have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/education">YouTube/edu</a>, there is now a more specific <a href="http://www.youtube.com/teachers">teachers&rsquo; channel</a> which, apart from videos, also contains guides on how to use YouTube in the classroom, as well as curated video playlists that will be suitable for teachers to use.&nbsp; There is also a YouTube Teachers Community which will provide regular updates from the YouTube team, tips and tricks and best practices from other teachers.</p>
<p>BP has launched a <a href="http://www.bp.com/genericResource.do?categoryId=8043&contentId=7070791&nicam=vanity&nisrc=www.bp.com/bpes/howscienceworks">How Science Works Clip Bank</a> &ndash; aimed mainly at UK schools &ndash; which contains short videos, animations, slideshows and interactive activities which teachers and students can use &ldquo;to put science in a real-world context&rdquo;.&nbsp; And along similar lines comes a new beta site from Canadian organisation, <a href="http://www.spongelab.com/slxdev/index.cfm">Spongelab</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the OU broke a world record, having now achieved <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15150319">40m downloads from iTunes U</a>.&nbsp; 90% of these are streamed overseas and 70% go to mobile devices.&nbsp; The OU currently averages 275,000 downloads a week and its latest offering is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/60-second-adventures-in-thought/id468644795">60-Second Adventures in Thought</a>: six animations voiced by David Mitchell that explain six famous thought experiments.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Analytics</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Matthew Moran; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p><a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/315113/1/la2.pdf">Attention Please!</a> is a good paper on learning analytics by Eric Duval that encourages educators to go beyond simply tracking where students visited and for how long: &ldquo;one of the big problems around learning analytics is the lack of clarity about what exactly should be measured to get a deeper understanding of how learning is taking place&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If Google is your analytics tool of choice, Kissmetrics offers its 2011 version of <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/google-analytics-resources-2011/">50 Google Analytics Resources</a>.&nbsp; Or, if you&rsquo;re a Facebook page owner or platform developer, you could investigate <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/search/?q=insights">Facebook Insights</a> for reporting and analysing trends within user growth and demographics, consumption of content and creation of content.</p>
<p>And if you want to know who&rsquo;s doing what with their smart phones, Google has just launched <a href="http://www.ourmobileplanet.com/">Our Mobile Planet</a>: a site that, &ldquo;provides insights into smartphone usage and mobile attitudes. Use it to create custom charts that will deepen your understanding of the mobile consumer and support data driven decisions in your mobile strategy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Collaborative Tools for Study </strong></p>
<p><em>[MindShift; Matthew Moran; TechCrunch; Slashdot]</em></p>
<p>Instead of the typical Facebook prompt, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo; the <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/09/distractions-set-aside-facebook-as-a-study-tool/">Hoot.me</a> app asks its users &ldquo;What are you working on?&rdquo;&nbsp; Students can then join the live study sessions on that topic which can include video-conferencing and a &ldquo;smart chat&rdquo; function that allows you to type formulae in English which are then automatically translated into mathematical notation.&nbsp; Hoot.me also saves and archives study sessions so that people can search for answers in these.&nbsp; A screen-sharing option is also coming soon.</p>
<p>The London School of Economics has published <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2011/09/29/twitter-guide/">a guide to using Twitter in university research, teaching, and impact activities</a>.&nbsp; This includes general guidance on terminology and tweet styles plus more specific advice on using Twitter for research and teaching.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/20/google-plus-beta">Google+</a> has moved from field trial to beta, which means we can all sign up for it.&nbsp; It now boasts several new and improved features compared to the original, including search (for posts or people) and a much improved &lsquo;hang out&rsquo; &ndash; video chat, which now incorporates public broadcast, screen sharing and integrated Sketch and Google Docs.&nbsp; However, Chitika Insights reports that Google has <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/10/10/1624207/Google-Loses-60-of-Active-Users">lost over 60% of its active users</a> on Google+, prompting suggestions that people simply wanted to see what it was like before going back to Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>Truth, Lies and the Internet</strong></p>
<p><em>[Demos]</em></p>
<p>A new report from Demos, <a href="http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/truth-lies-and-the-internet">Truth, Lies and the Internet</a>, examines the ability of young people in Britain to critically evaluate information they consume online.&nbsp; The report reviews current literature on the subject, and presents a new poll of over 500 teachers, showing that that the web is fundamental to pupils&rsquo; school lives but many are not careful, discerning users of the information they find. &nbsp;This makes them vulnerable to the pitfalls of ignorance, falsehoods, cons and scams.</p>

<p><strong>Government Launches New e-Learning Selection Service</strong></p>
<p><em>[Virtual College]</em></p>
<p>The government has launched an <a href="http://www.virtual-college.co.uk/news/Government-launches-new-elearning-selection-service-newsitems-800749398.aspx">online lifelong learning accounts service</a> for adults who want to take up learning opportunities or develop new skills. &nbsp;The site offers a skills diagnostic tool to identify interests, strengths and needs, localised course and job searches, a CV builder and an eligibility checker to identify any government funds available to support the user's learning. &nbsp;It is hoped that 1m accounts will be opened by the end of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Encyclopedia of Life</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>EOL&rsquo;s version 2 site is now live, with a mission to &ldquo;increase awareness and understanding of living nature through an <a href="http://education.eol.org/">Encyclopedia of Life</a> that gathers, generates and shares knowledge in an open, freely-accessible and trusted digital resource [&hellip;] Expert curators ensure quality of the core collection by authenticating materials submitted by vetted content partners and individual contributors.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Digital Dead Sea Scrolls</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>The Israel Museum&rsquo;s new <a href="http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/">Digital Dead Sea Scrolls</a> site provides access to five complete digitised scrolls: the Great Isaiah Scroll, the Community Rule Scroll, the Commentary on Habakkuk Scroll, the Temple Scroll, and the War Scroll, plus short explanatory videos and background information on the texts and their history.&nbsp; All five scrolls can be magnified so that users may examine texts in exacting detail. &nbsp;Details invisible to the naked eye are made visible through ultra-high resolution digital photography shot at 1,200 mega pixels.&nbsp; In addition, the Great Isaiah Scroll may be searched by column, chapter, and verse, and is accompanied by an English translation tool and by an option for users to submit translations of verses in their own languages.</p>

<p><em>[Matthew Moran; Campus Technology; University World News; Joel Greenberg]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bpp.com/about-bpp/news/bpp-university-college-launche.aspx">BPP has set its 2012 fees</a> at &pound;5k per annum, or a &pound;12k charge for those who wish to complete their degree in 2 years.&nbsp; The company, which offers degrees in law, business, accountancy and finance, has already been highly visible in this year&rsquo;s recruitment round, with a presence on UCAS and Facebook, listings in the press (e.g. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/student/into-university/az-uni-colleges/bpp-university-college-2339050.html">The Independent</a>) and the offer that prospective students can <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BPPNews">tweet</a> clearing advisers directly.</p>
<p>US ed tech vendor EduTone will purchase Cambridge University Press&rsquo;s UK-based <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/08/24/yet-another-mix-of-tech-and-media-edutone-buys-global-grid-for-learning.aspx">Global Grid for Learning</a>, a digital content aggregation business boasting 1m digital video, audio, images, interactive activities and documents from 40 providers.&nbsp; GGfL will then become EduTone's distributor in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/red-tape-cuts-us-plan-for-adelaide-university-city/story-e6frgcjx-1226122417968">Kaplan</a> has dumped plans to establish a university in Adelaide, blaming complex regulatory approvals in Australia and the US.&nbsp; However, rival US group Laureate International Universities is pursuing its own bid to establish a university in the South Australian capital.</p>
<p>Roddy Boyd writes at some length on the Seeking Alpha site, unpicking <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/290299-blackboard-a-tale-of-2-companies">Blackboard&rsquo;s business model</a>, customer base, pricing and finances.&nbsp; Commenting on the future of CEO Michael Chasen after the company&rsquo;s recent sale to Presidium, he observes, &ldquo;there will always be a place in the world for a man who can sell people what they don&rsquo;t need at a price they can&rsquo;t afford.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>[University World News; The Independent; THE; Ian Blackham]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110827175757403">Student loans</a> have now become a central issue in the HE strategies of several countries.&nbsp; Bruno Dente and Nadia Piraino take a theoretical look at the components of such schemes, whether loan policies are effective and what criteria might make them so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OECD reports that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/sep/13/uk-young-people-education-oecd">Britain&rsquo;s tuition fees are the third highest in the developed world</a> and a report by HEPI warns that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/university-fees-may-fall-as-students-hold-out-for-a-better-deal-2339695.html">universities may have to reduce their fees</a> to an average of &pound;7,500 as they struggle to fill places.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=417218">Office for National Statistics</a>, the percentage of people in the UK with a degree has more than doubled from 12% in 1993 to 25% in 2010.&nbsp; The median hourly pay for differently educated groups was:</p>
<ul>
<li>No qualifications - &pound;6.93 </li>
<li>GCSE or equivalent - &pound;8.68</li>
<li>A-level or equivalent - &pound;10.00</li>
<li>Sub-degree - &pound;12.60</li>
<li>Degree - &pound;16.10</li>
</ul>
<p>But the report also shows that the worst paid 20% of graduates had lower earnings in Oct-Dec 2010 than those who left school with qualifications at 18, and the worst paid 15% earned less than those who left school at 16 with only GCSEs.</p>
<p>A report by the University of Birmingham found that only about 46% of 2009 <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14823042">engineering graduates</a> were in jobs directly related to their degree subject six months after leaving university.&nbsp; Some 20% were employed in roles that were not directly related to their degree but 24% were in &lsquo;non-graduate&rsquo; employment, for example working as waiters or in shops.</p>
<p>And a separate report from HEFCE suggests that the falling proportion of home students on <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=417364">postgraduate STEM courses</a> could threaten the viability of entire disciplines.&nbsp; The number of international students studying taught courses has almost doubled in eight years, whereas home students increased by just 1 per cent.&nbsp; In mechanical engineering, international student numbers grew from 22% of the total studying 2002/03 to 54% in 2009/10.</p>
<p>A planned <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/aug/31/liverpool-free-university-angry-government">Free University of Liverpool</a> partly represents a protest against rising tuition fees, but also evidences a longer-standing dissatisfaction with the current structure of HE.&nbsp; Founded by a &lsquo;committee&rsquo; of artists, activists and educators &ndash; who are offering their time voluntarily &ndash; the university's first course is a six-month foundation studies degree for just 15 students which will start next month.&nbsp; Next year should see the launch of a BA in cultural praxis.</p>

<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/microsoft-sold-450-million-copies-of-windows-7">Windows 7 has sold 450m copies since launch</a> (650,000 licences per day) but the tablet variant of its successor, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5839665/windows-8-slate-hands-on-its-fantastic-but-dont-sell-your-ipad">Windows 8</a>, was previewed earlier this week.&nbsp; It draws, not surprisingly, on many features and gesture-based interface design techniques from existing tablets and the Windows Phone 7.&nbsp; Early signs are promising, with Gizmodo claiming, &ldquo;It goes beyond what Apple has done by quite a bit&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual Education</strong></p>
<p><em>[Ian Blackham; Matthew Moran; Richard Easterbrook; Seb Schmoller]</em></p>
<p>The Telegraph&rsquo;s Emma Barnett asks whether <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8707442/University-education-goes-online-with-virtual-courses.html">virtual degrees are the future of university education</a>, in the light of future UK fees.&nbsp; She cites various examples including the free <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/science/16stanford.html?_r=1">Stanford AI course</a> mentioned last month.&nbsp; At the time, Stanford had had 8,000 expressions of interest; Barnett reports an increase to 53,000 &ndash; a class nearly four times the size of Stanford&rsquo;s entire student body &ndash; and <a href="http://fm.schmoller.net/2011/08/over-200000-people-have-signed-up-for-the-three-free-stanford-university-online-courses.html">Seb Schmoller</a> notes that the cohort has now grown to over 200,000.&nbsp; The two Stanford lecturers have devised an automatic system for grading homework submissions (which they admit would not work as well for arts courses) and are using Google Moderator to take students queries; the tool algorithmically finds the most popular and similar questions from a huge number of queries, allowing the lecturers to answer as many questions as possible in the most efficient way.&nbsp; They would also like to consider peer to peer marking in the future.</p>
<p>NYT&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/education/25future.html?_r=3&smid=tw-nytimes&seid=auto">Tamar Lewin</a> reports that, &ldquo;new online enterprises are making earning a college degree cheaper, faster and flexible enough to take work experience into account&rdquo;.&nbsp; Online services like Straighterline allow students to package their credits and top up to full qualifications without the cost of attending full-time institutions.&nbsp; Critics worry that the online courses are less rigorous and more vulnerable to cheating, and focus more on providing credentials for specific jobs than encouraging critical thinking.&nbsp; However, most experts agree that given the exploding technologies, cuts to university budgets and the growth of people expected to earn postsecondary degrees, there is no end in sight for online programs preparing students for careers in high-demand areas like business, computer science, health care and criminal justice.</p>
<p>More than three-quarters of US colleges and universities now offer online classes, according to a <a href="http://pewsocialtrends.org/2011/08/28/the-digital-revolution-and-higher-education/2/">Pew Internet survey</a>, and 23% of graduates have taken a course online.&nbsp; Some 51% of college presidents say online courses provide the same educational value to one taken in a classroom, but just 29% of American adults agree, although that figure does rise to 46% amongst adults who have actually taken an online course.</p>

<p><strong>HE Social Media Adoption Soars</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Mashable; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>The University of Massachusetts has been analysing the <a href="http://www.umassd.edu/cmr/studiesandresearch/socialmediaadoptionsoars/">use of social media</a> in US colleges and universities since 2007/08.&nbsp; Its latest report shows that HEIs are experimenting more and re-evaluating their use of new communication tools and that 100% are now using some form of social media, with Facebook the most prevalent (98% of the 456 interviewees), followed by YouTube (86%) and Twitter (84%).</p>
<p>And a Nielsen survey shows that Americans now spend 23% of their internet time on <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/12/23-percent-online/">social networks</a>.&nbsp; Nine of the 10 most popular social networks were dominated by women (LinkedIn being the exception).&nbsp; Women also watch more video content than men, although men watch longer videos.</p>
<p>InSites Consulting has taken a broader view with <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/stevenvanbelleghem/social-media-around-the-world-2011">Social Media Around the World 2011</a> and is packed with so many relevant stats that I won&rsquo;t even begin to try and summarise them here.</p>

<p><strong>Education at a Glance: 2011</strong></p>
<p><em>[George Siemens]</em></p>
<p>OECD&rsquo;s 2011 version of <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2011/09/14/education-at-a-glance-2011/">Education at a Glance</a> contains almost 500 pages of useful data, including teacher salaries, the impact of student background on performance, educational attainment and employment, educational access, and so on.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Not So Digital Natives</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Zite]</em></p>
<p>IET has published a recent paper, <a href="http://agent4change.net/resources/research/1088-open-university-research-explodes-myth-of-digital-naive.html">Older Students&rsquo; use of Digital Technologies in Distance Education</a>, that &ldquo;explodes myth of &lsquo;digital native&rsquo;,&rdquo; according to reviewer Gerald Haigh.&nbsp; The research is based on a survey of more than 4,000 OU students, aged 20 to 60.&nbsp; It concludes that while there are clear differences between older and younger people in their use of technology, there&rsquo;s no evidence of a clear break between two separate populations.</p>
<p>Students in Canada are also not as digitally native as researchers expected.&nbsp; They may be addicted to Facebook and slaves to their smartphones but, as universities spend millions on e-learning tools to help cater to this tech-savvy generation, current students say they prefer, and are <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/09/08/students-give-e-learning-a-grade-of-incomplete/">learning more in classes when a live lecturer stands at an unadorned podium</a> than in sessions full of technological bells and whistles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harvard&rsquo;s Prof Eric Mazur and University of Maryland&rsquo;s Prof Joe Redish are shunning technology <em>and</em> lectures in favour of a highly successful <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/09/dont-lecture-me-rethinking-how-college-students-learn/">peer-instruction</a> approach.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Latest on iTunesU</strong></p>
<p><em>[Catherine Chambers]</em></p>
<p>There are two OU offerings related to the anniversary of 9/11: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/itunes-u/9-11-reflections-on-political/id462788535">Reflections on political leadership</a> comprises 7 audio podcasts in which Drs Richard Heffernan and Simon Bromley discuss the consequences of September 11th and the impact it had on the United States' hegemony, its global leadership and its diplomatic and military strategy.&nbsp; <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/itunes-u/9-11-attack-on-wires-for-ipod/id463994829">Attack on the Wires</a> contains 3 videos that give a snapshot of how communications company AT&amp;T dealt with the unprecedented technological challenges during the course of the disaster, when they handled in excess of 400 million calls.</p>
<p>The Linux operating system is 20 years old and the OU presents a series of audio podcasts (available via <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=458394174">iTunes</a> or the <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/oulearn/computing-and-ict/podcast-linux-01">OU podcast site</a>), presented by MCT&rsquo;s Blaine Price and including contributions from Linus Torvalds.&nbsp; The series begins with the origins of Linux but then moves on to include broader topics including open source software and cloud computing.</p>

<p><strong>Zite</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jeff Cobb]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.missiontolearn.com/2011/09/zite/">Zite</a> is an iPad app that allows you to construct a &lsquo;magazine&rsquo; based on personal topics and feeds of interest.&nbsp; You can drill into items and rate or share them and the app learns your preferences over time so it can present new content that is more relevant.&nbsp; Yes, it&rsquo;s effectively a glossy aggregator but I it works really well - I was getting interesting, relevant information <em>and</em> good design.&nbsp; Google Reader is certainly more succinct but Zite is considerably more engaging.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; BBC; Zite; Liam Green-Hughes; Tony Hirst; Rhodri Thomas; ASTD]</em></p>
<p>Google Education has provided seed funding for the opening of the <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/08/23/mit-opens-center-for-mobile-learning-with-app-inventor-research.aspx">MIT Center for Mobile Learning</a> which will focus on new mobile technologies, apps, and their uses in education, including location applications, mobile sensing, data collection and reality gaming.&nbsp; Their first project will study and extend, for educational technology use, App Inventor (AI) for Android, a tool developed by Google Labs to allow anyone to create apps by using a graphical interface of buttons and menus in a browser.&nbsp; Directors of the new centre include Eric Klopfer, leader of MIT&rsquo;s <a href="http://education.mit.edu/projects">STEP</a> programme, and Mitchel Resnick, responsible for the <a href="http://scratched.media.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> visual authoring tool.</p>
<p>According to the Office for National Statistics, 45% of UK internet users are <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14731757">going online via mobile phone</a> data connections, compared with 31% in 2010.&nbsp; The most rapid growth was among younger people, where 71% of internet-connected 16 to 24-year-olds used mobiles (compared to just 8% aged 65+).&nbsp; Domestic internet use also rose, with 77% of UK households now having access to a net connection.</p>
<p>Similar research by IDC predicts that the <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2011/09/12/idc-mobile-web-users-2015/">number of US mobile web users</a> will grow annually by a compound growth rate of 16.6% between 2010 and 2015, meaning more people will then access the web by this method than on desktop machines.&nbsp; The study also predicts that the total number of Internet users in the world will reach 2.7 billion, or 40% of the world&rsquo;s population, in 2015.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/achartengine/">AChartEngine</a> is a Google charting library for Android applications that supports a range of chart types, singly and in combination.&nbsp; Charts can be built as a &lsquo;view&rsquo; that can be added to a view group or as an &lsquo;intent&rsquo; that can be used to start an activity.</p>
<p>JISC has launched a new guide, <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/digiemerge">Emerging Practice in a Digital Age: A guide to technology-enhanced institutional innovation</a>.&nbsp; This is augmented by a <a href="http://bit.ly/mobilelearninginfokit">Mobile Learning infoKit</a>, a practical guide for educational institutions planning to implement mobile learning initiatives. &nbsp;The current version (0.1) comprises a wiki-based resource collating information and guidance from JISC and others sources.</p>
<p>KMSI surveyed 200 learning technology users in the US to solicit their <a href="http://www.kmsi.com/white_paper27.htm">mobile learning preferences</a>.&nbsp; The ability to switch between Smartphone, mobile, laptop, and desktop devices without losing progress and scores or having to restart was of major importance, as was the ability to search for and use learning objects, PDFs, MS Office files and other file formats for just-in-time or just-enough performance support, although 22% claimed they had no need for e-reader devices.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Learning Analytics</strong></p>
<p><em>[George Siemens]</em></p>
<p>George Siemens notes that learning analytics is getting substantial attention in education (IET has just published a <a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/strategy-unit/offices/lto/docs/Whitepaper_LearningAnalytics.doc">white paper</a>), but he thinks it&rsquo;s a multifaceted term that needs to be broken down so it can be meaningfully used.&nbsp; With this in mind, he offers <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2011/09/03/learning-analytics-higher-education/">a presentation</a> he gave earlier this month to UNISA in Pretoria which reviews some analytics trends, their implications for education and potential links with connectivism.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Free Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Stephen has published <a href="http://www.downes.ca/files/FreeLearning.pdf">Free Learning</a>, a 240 page collection of essays relating to e-learning, open educational resources and copyright.&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2011/08/19/stephen-downes-ebook-on-openness/">George Siemens</a> it covers, &ldquo;a wide territory of Downes&rsquo; work in open education, covering almost a decade.&nbsp; It includes a few classics (to the degree that our field has classics), such as his discussion with Dave Tosh (co-founder of Elgg) on the role of openness in economics or earning a living and numerous encounters with David Wiley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://change.mooc.ca/">Change MOOC</a> began its 36-week run on Monday and Stephen has launched a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/themoocguide/">MOOC Guide</a>, the purpose of which is to offer an online history of the development of the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and use that to describe the major elements of a MOOC, together with practical tips for success and contributions from former MOOCers.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>WriteCheck</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.writecheck.com/static/home.html">WriteCheck</a> is a new service for students made by the same company that makes the anti-plagiarism software, Turnitin, which is used by many universities (including the OU) to check for plagiarism.&nbsp; For $7, as well as checking grammar and spelling, WriteCheck also checks for plagiarism.&nbsp; Some academics are understandably concerned that this will allow students to change just enough to avoid being identified as a plagiarist.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>e-Books</strong></p>
<p><em>[</em><em>Matthew Moran; Wired Campus;</em><em> TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bookriff.com/">BookRiff</a>, currently in Beta, allows users to create, buy and sell digital and printed books.&nbsp; &ldquo;Create books by mixing content from virtually any source: published books, your own files, web sites&hellip; you name it.&nbsp; You pick the mix and the order &amp; we'll deliver your custom book &ndash; digital or printed &ndash; to you and anyone else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/new-site-brazenly-trades-pirated-e-textbooks/32966">LibraryPirate</a> is encouraging users to make digital scans of their printed textbooks and post them to the site for others to share, with the site now boasting 1,700 textbooks that can be downloaded via BitTorrent.&nbsp; Edward McCoyd, director of digital policy for the Association of American Publishers, claims LibraryPirate exaggerates the cost of electronic textbooks, which he says are often 60% cheaper than printed versions.&nbsp; He also points to research that suggests the average US student spends more each year on movie tickets than on textbooks.</p>
<p>Sony has launched its $150 ultra-light <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/31/sonys-latest-kindle-killer-is-worlds-lightest-ereader">PRS-T1 e-Reader</a>.&nbsp; It weighs 168g/6oz (around 70% that of a Kindle), is 8.9mm thick and has a 6&Prime; e-ink touchscreen plus 5 function buttons.&nbsp; The T1 offers WiFi and comes with 2 GB of flash memory preinstalled, storing up to 1,200 eBooks, and a microSD card can provide an additional 32 GB.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>HTML5 Video Player</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Nick Freear]</em></p>
<p>Zencoder has developed <a href="http://videojs.com/">videojs</a>, a free, open-source, javascript-based HTML5 video player.&nbsp; It comes well documented (including some comprehensive <a href="http://www.lynda.com/HTML-5-tutorials/HTML5-Video-and-Audio-in-Depth/80781-2.html">video tutorials</a> on Lynda.com) and supports most recent browsers, plus fallback support for IE 6, 7 and 8.&nbsp; Android and iOS are supported and plugins are provided for Wordpress, jQuery and Drupal.&nbsp; The current main drawback is somewhat limited accessibility.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Free Content</strong></p>
<p><em>[ALT; Jane Hart; Open Culture]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercise/0">Codecademy</a> is billed as, &ldquo;the easiest way to learn how to code.&nbsp; It's interactive, fun and you can do it with your friends&rdquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a little simplistic and I had to stoke up Firefox to get it working properly, but I did find myself learning-by-doing some JavaScript without too much trouble.</p>
<p>The Virtual Experiments Team at <a href="http://ve.soton.ac.uk/index.html">Southampton University</a> has launched a new website and several new virtual experiments, covering electronics, computer science and chemistry.&nbsp; There is also a link to a similar site at <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/virtualexperiments/experiments.html">Reading</a> that contains a slightly broader portfolio.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bullbearings.co.uk/">BullBearings</a> is a virtual online trading website that allows users to set up virtual stocks and shares and embark on conventional trading or spread betting &ndash; for personal interest or in competition with friends.</p>
<p>The Alcohol Learning Centre is making one of its e-learning programs freely available.&nbsp; Alcohol Identification and Brief Advice (<a href="http://www.alcohollearningcentre.org.uk/">Alcohol IBA</a>) helps professionals identify and advise those individuals whose drinking might be impacting on their health, but there&rsquo;s a lot of useful information in there for us consumers.</p>
<p>Great Courses has a portfolio of around 350 pay courses featuring top academics and high quality material.&nbsp; However the Open Culture site has links to <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2011/09/10_free_lectures_by_greatcourses.html">10 sample lectures</a> for those who want to experience what &lsquo;great&rsquo; really looks like.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a child of the 60s, you&rsquo;ll be well aware of musician James Taylor.&nbsp; Well, the drugs have worn off, he&rsquo;s still going strong and his latest venture is to offer <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2011/08/james_taylor_gives_free_acoustic_guitar_lessons_online.html">online acoustic guitar lessons</a>.&nbsp; The pedagogic approach is interesting because he doesn&rsquo;t actually &lsquo;teach&rsquo;: he shows in close detail how to play and assumes the learner has enough basic knowledge to emulate the moves.</p>

<p><strong>76 EdTech Resources You May Have Missed</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><em>[Zite]</em></p>
<p>These lists can be a bit hit and miss but I liked this one from <a href="http://jeffthomastech.com/blog/?p=11388">Jeffrey Thomas</a> simply because of its diversity.&nbsp; It contains press articles, tools, hints and tips, links to other listings and a whole section of iOS items.&nbsp; It does have a mainly schools focus, but you&rsquo;re bound to find something useful.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;O</strong><strong>U Fees</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; Guardian; BBC]</em></p>
<p>OU fee increases have received widespread coverage in the media and blogosphere, but what is most interesting is not so much the stories themselves, but the mass of comments that follow most of them.&nbsp; For example, this initial <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=416866">article in THE</a> includes comments such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;For me this is a disaster, I'm over 50&hellip;&rdquo;;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The course fees are now totally unrealistic&rdquo;;</li>
<li>&ldquo;It is the government - not the OU - which is responsible for the increase&rdquo;; and</li>
<li>&ldquo;My exposure to the OU has been entirely positive&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a more recent article in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/aug/08/open-university-fees-rise">Guardian</a> focused on the implications for older and casual learners, attracting more incisive comments such as, &ldquo;all the tutors sound like Wallace and Gromit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A separate Guardian article reports on HEFCE analysis regarding <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/aug/04/fewer-students-expected">student numbers</a> once fee increases bite.&nbsp; This shows that 56 universities are anticipating a drop in the number of full-time undergraduates they take from the UK or the European Union next year.&nbsp; On average, universities expect a 2% fall, although one institution predicts a 20% drop and five others expect greater than 10%.&nbsp; However, 24% expect an increase and a fifth anticipate no change.</p>
<p>Smaller higher education institutions in England would be able to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14403445">gain university status</a>, under government proposals to remove the current requirement for universities to have at least 4,000 students.&nbsp; It would allow about 10 colleges, which already have their own degree-awarding powers, to become full universities.</p>

<p><strong>Blackboard Announces Collaboration With Major Textbook Publishers </strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Publishers Macmillan, Pearson, Cengage and Wiley have announced tighter links between their advanced <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/blackboard-announces-collaboration-with-major-textbook-publishers/32228">e-textbook platforms and Blackboard</a>, following an earlier deal with McGraw-Hill last year.&nbsp; Students will continue to purchase access to the online-textbooks through traditional retailers but will benefit from single-sign-on access through the campus network.&nbsp; Lecturers will find it easier to transfer grades etc from the publishers&rsquo; systems to Blackboard&rsquo;s gradebook.&nbsp; Blackboard&rsquo;s Matthew Small says, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t about a storefront - this is about making these things more interoperable.&nbsp; Now 90-plus percent of all of the digital-learning platforms are going to be integrated into Blackboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McGraw-Hill&rsquo;s newly launched <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/07/18/mcgrawhill-campus-to-make-resources-free-through-any-lms.aspx">Campus</a> suite includes a learning and teaching platform, custom publishing, an adaptive study tool and searchable lecture capture service.&nbsp; It also</p>
<p>provides unlimited access to the company's entire library, including eBooks, assessment tools, presentation slides, and multimedia resources.&nbsp; The suite integrates with major LMS/VLEs including Blackboard and Moodle.</p>

<p><strong>British Library Group Develops Tool to Analyse Journal Pricing</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>As <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/british-library-group-develops-cost-benefit-tool-to-analyze-journal-pricing/32532">libraries rethink blanket deals with some publishers</a>, a new tool developed by the Research Libraries UK group should help them make the best cost-benefit analysis they can based on usage statistics and pricing information.&nbsp; The group has <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/british-research-libraries-say-no-to-big-deal-serials-packages/32371">taken a public stand</a> against the high cost of some Big Deals and this new tool allows analysis of the value-for-money of publisher packages and to determine whether there would be cost savings to be made from moving back to title-by-title purchasing.</p>

<p><strong>E-learning Surveys</strong></p>
<p><em>[Kineo; Chief Learning Officer; Tony Bates; Virtual College; Seb Schmoller]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/b2bmediaco/elearning_20110708/#/24">E-learning Magazine</a> has surveyed 790 organisations, primarily US based, and found that 100% of them &ldquo;have or plan to implement an enterprise learning and workplace technology initiative in the near future&rdquo;.&nbsp; Key trends include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stable spend on e-learning in corporate but significant increases in planned e-learning spend in the public sector, possibly as part of cost reductions</li>
<li>62% said 24/7 access to learning content was critical</li>
<li>Virtual classrooms are on the increase with 75% of corporates using them.</li>
<li>Mobile learning is also on the increase, with 15% of public sector and 18% of corporate organisations currently using some form of mobile learning; increases are planned in both sectors</li>
</ul>
<p>Ambient Insight&rsquo;s latest survey, <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2011/07/21/k-12-to-see-double-digit-growth-in-e-learning-through-2015.aspx">The Worldwide Market for Self-paced eLearning Products and Services: 2010-2015</a>, shows that the worldwide market for Self-paced eLearning products and services reached $32.1 billion in 2010, the five-year compound annual growth rate is 9.2% and revenues will reach $49.9 billion by 2015.&nbsp; Spending in the US is slowing down, but pre-K-12 will dominate all other segments (with 16.8% growth predicted), including the traditionally strong US healthcare and higher education sectors.&nbsp; However, a survey by the <a href="http://clomedia.com/articles/view/4518">Software &amp; Information Industry Association</a> &ndash; its fourth annual investigation into US educational institutions&rsquo; progress towards embracing technology and e-learning &ndash; suggests that K-20 institutional progress slowed in 2010 compared with 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p>The Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada has published <a href="http://www.aucc.ca/_pdf/english/publications/trends-2011-vol1-enrolment-e.pdf">Trends in Canadian Higher Education</a>.&nbsp; Exact figures will relate to national circumstances, but some of the trends are noteworthy: part time student numbers are static whereas full time are growing steadily; under-22 is the fastest growing age group (over-35s are static); full time Master&rsquo;s enrolments are booming, with business studies the most popular discipline (also true for international students), but most popular PhD is physical/life sciences and technologies.&nbsp; China has been Canada&rsquo;s top source of international students since 2001.</p>
<p>And Webanywhere has released an updated <a href="http://www.e-learningcentre.co.uk/News_and_views/UK_e_learning_market_update">UK eLearning Market Research report</a>, now available on Learning Light&rsquo;s e-Learning Centre website.&nbsp; The Nov 10 original report has been given a mid-year 2011 update, based on Learning Light's forecasting model with inputs from the overall economic performance of the UK, rises in adoption levels of e-learning, close tracking and analysis of public sector procurement patterns, and of course conversations and observations of what's happening in the market.&nbsp; An overall UK growth rate of 12% is predicted for 2011, with mobile learning, social learning and virtual classrooms the current hot topics.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.virtual-college.co.uk/news/Mobiles-online-virtual-trainers-and-augmented-reality-are-elearnings-future-800696199.~">International E-Learning Association</a> sees things a little differently and is predicting augmented reality, mobile learning and the use of virtual online coaches as representing the future of e-learning and wider online training.&nbsp; Its president, David Guralnick, also believes the use of virtual reality to encourage and motivate learners is something that will happen &ldquo;sooner rather than later&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh please, not again.&nbsp; Have we learned nothing from forays into virtual reality in the 90s with Superscape and similar tools, plus more recent dabbling with Second Life?&nbsp; The 3D spatial properties of most e-learning content and scenarios are either unimportant or non-existent &ndash; and going into a virtual environment to access and learn such material is just extravagant gimmickry.&nbsp; Interestingly, BP&rsquo;s Nick Shackleton-Jones offers a similar sentiment in his thoughtful presentation, <a href="http://fm.schmoller.net/2011/07/the-future-of-learning-and-technology-.html">The Future of Learning and Technology</a>.</p>

<p><strong>iMac (not iPad) Propels Apple to No 3 US Sales Slot</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>According to two recent market research reports, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/07/15/imac-not-ipad-propels-apple-to-no.-3-slot.aspx">Apple took 10.7% of US market share</a> for computers - including desktops and laptops, but excluding the iPad and iPhone - in the second quarter of 2011.&nbsp; Only one other top-5 manufacturer, Toshiba, saw positive growth in the United States during the quarter.&nbsp; Gartner reports that, &ldquo;Apple showed the strongest growth among the top-tier vendors in the [US], as it climbed from fifth place to third, overtaking Acer and Toshiba.&nbsp; The preliminary findings show Apple's performance far exceed the industry average, partly driven by an iMac refreshment that attracted both consumers and buyers in the education sector.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>University Unveils the CNN of Universities</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110716144422487">Global Campus Network</a> is expected to make Canada&rsquo;s Ryerson University a hub for up to 4,100 HEIs worldwide within the next couple of years by using full high-definition streaming technology and existing broadband networks.&nbsp; The Skype-like technology was developed initially as a teaching tool in 2010 to show radio and television arts students what it was like to be connected to live news stream networks like CNN and to deal with content derived from around the world.&nbsp; However, the project went international when Global Campus Network created its first permanent university connection with colleagues at the University of Auckland, with project director, Richard Grunberg, noting, &ldquo;There is almost no delay in the interaction between one or many collaborators. The interaction is almost natural.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Floating University</strong></p>
<p><em>[Pete Mitton]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.floatinguniversity.com/">Floating University</a>, &ldquo;a new educational media venture for the digital generation, which creates and distributes online multimedia curricula, rich in text, video, animation and graphics&rdquo; aims to bring together a selection of the best thinkers and scholars to teach courses on the ideas that cut across their fields and connected them.&nbsp; Their first course, &lsquo;Great Big Ideas&rsquo;, launches this autumn and will be offered by Harvard, Yale and Bard.&nbsp; Each hour-long lecture explores the keys questions in one of 14 major fields, lays out the methods for answering them and makes a case for the relevance to the student and the significance to humanity.&nbsp; So, video lectures, plus a claim on the site that it will be &ldquo;the Facebook of textbooks&rdquo;.&nbsp; It seems the Nuremberg Funnel may be alive and well, but it now has a network connection.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Degree ROI</strong></p>
<p><em>[Sys-Con Media; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>According to the (US) eLearners.com site, 80% of adult learners indicated that their interest in online education was career-related.&nbsp; The site now contains <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/node/1931789">salary guides</a> for 30 different degree programs and career fields to help prospective students evaluate the return on investment on the online degree programs they might be considering.&nbsp; These guides not only discuss estimated earning potential, but also offer information about possible careers, skills learned and courses they can expect within programs.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/77938">Edupunks&rsquo; Guide to a DIY Credential</a> is a new free e-book, financed by the Gates Foundation that seeks to help learners use online resources to chart alternative paths to affordable credentials.&nbsp; Although directed at low-income students, author Anya Kamenetz blogged that she also hopes to reach professors and administrators who want to take advantage of &ldquo;the latest technology, social media, and collaborative learning&rdquo; to cut costs while improving education.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Data Visualisation</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; Catherine Chambers; Tony Hirst]</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of good visualisations because, as we submerge in yet more data, it will become increasingly important for sense-making. &nbsp;<a href="http://wondergraphs.com/tour">Wondergraphs</a> offer Flash-based drag-and-drop graph creation that makes presentation of tabular data in different formats and styles about as easy as it gets.&nbsp; If you prefer your data as infographics, <a href="http://visual.ly/">Visual.ly</a> has over 2000 examples on offer to inspire you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.data-art.net/">DataArt</a> is a collaboration between the BBC and University of Westminster that aims to visualise BBC data in a creative and informative way that makes it accessible and appealing to both experts and non-experts alike.&nbsp; In the US, the <a href="http://www.smallmeans.com/new-york-times-infographics/">New York Times</a> is one of a few newspapers that have a team dedicated to data visualisation and information design, examples of which can be found on the Small Labs site.</p>

<p><strong>InstaGrok</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://instagrok.com/">InstaGrok</a> is a new search engine aimed specifically at learning and education.&nbsp; It still looks a little rough around the edges but it is only an alpha; however, some of the functionality and methods of categorisation/filtering do look useful &ndash; and they do set it apart from the standard Google offering.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Learning Design</strong></p>
<p><em>[Clark Quinn;</em> <em>JE;</em> <em>Clive Shepherd]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/designjot/id447686146?mt=8">DesignJot</a> is an iApp that supports the learning design process by asking the designer to answer questions that lead to strategies, objectives/outcomes, activities, content and structure.&nbsp; The app supports note-taking and sketching, plus tips and best practice advice (including practitioner video clips).&nbsp; There are some inevitable issues with file formats but the benefits of being mobile are that it becomes a working tool that can be taken to and shared with the design stakeholders.&nbsp; Customer ratings suggest that, in the right circumstances, it can be quite a useful aid.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Connie Malamed has launched an <a href="http://theelearningcoach.com/mobile/instructional-design-guru/">Instructional Design Guru app</a> which defines over 450 terms associated with learning experience design, drawn from the fields of instructional design, cognitive psychology, social media, multimedia, technology and law.&nbsp; She refers to it as a &ldquo;reference and performance support app for instructional designers&rdquo;.&nbsp; On this side of the pond we call that a Glossary.</p>
<p>Clive Shepherd has been posting up a series of <a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2011/08/practical-guides-rolling-off-press.html">practical guides for digital learning content designers</a>.&nbsp; They are aimed not so much at full-time designers but more for the increasing numbers of learning professionals who fulfil an occasional design role.&nbsp; Titles available so far provide advice on creating learning podcasts, slide shows, screencasts, videos, learning scenarios and learning tutorials.</p>

<p><strong>OERs</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes;</em> <em>Elliott Masie; Wired Campus</em><em>]</em></p>
<p><a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28384">Sir John Daniel</a> is interviewed on the Creative Commons site about his views on open educational resources and the role of intergovernmental organizations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since two-thirds of the 54 [British Commonwealth] member states are nations with populations of 2 million or less, they have fewer resources to spend on content creation ... COL helped them start a &lsquo;virtual university&rsquo;, which is not a new institution but a collaborative network where countries and institutions can work together to produce course materials as OER that they can all adapt and use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Learning has also just published a freely-downloadable <a href="http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=357">Basic Guide to Open Educational Resources</a>.&nbsp; And, as part of the build up to his Learning 2011 conference in Nov, Elliott Masie has published a freely-downloadable <a href="http://www.learning2011.com/strategies">Learning Strategies</a> e-Book.&nbsp; Its 100+ pages include contributions from CNN, Shell, Lloyds Bank and the CIA.</p>
<p>In a novel twist Stanford University is not only opening its next course on <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/stanford-u-offers-free-online-course-in-artificial-intelligence/32622">artificial intelligence</a> free to anyone online, but they have also promised to issue grades and certificates to those virtual attendees.&nbsp; The online course will run in tandem with the physical class, which normally attracts around 200 regular students, from Oct to Dec.&nbsp; Professors are unsure how many will sign up for the free online class but interest appears high, with more than 8,000 people already expressing interest.</p>

<p><strong>Crowdsourced Research</strong></p>
<p><em>[David Wilson; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>The University of Oxford&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2011/110726.html">Ancient Lives</a> site is putting hundreds of thousands of images of fragments of papyri written in Greek online.&nbsp; Researchers say that &lsquo;armchair archaeologists&rsquo; visiting the website can help with cataloguing the collection and could make amazing finds, such as the recent discovery of fragments of a previously unknown &lsquo;lost&rsquo; gospel which describes Jesus Christ casting out demons.</p>
<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-public-playing-a-molecule-building-game-outperforms-scientists/32835">EteRNA</a> is a web-based game that uses the brainpower of biology novices to understand molecules key to life and disease.&nbsp; RNA (DNA&rsquo;s single-stranded relative) plays a key role in cell function and the game allows researchers to farm out some of the intellectual legwork behind RNA design to 26,000 players, rather than a relatively few lab workers.&nbsp; Players are given an RNA puzzle design that they must fill in with components to produce the most plausible solution.&nbsp; The community of players then votes for the blueprint it thinks will have the best chance of success in the lab and Stanford researchers select the highest-rated blueprints and actually synthesize them, reporting back the results to inform future designs.</p>

<p><strong>BenchPrep</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://benchprep.com/">BenchPrep</a> supports preparation for (US) exams and tests by providing materials and interactive quizzes from established content providers like McGraw Hill and Wiley, plus social features that act as a real-time virtual study groups.&nbsp; These allow subscribers to hold discussions, ask questions, add and share notes or YouTube videos.&nbsp; The startup currently offers 17 courses and has about 150,000 users, but a further 100 courses are planned.</p>

<p>For those who fancy developing their first mobile app, the Harvard Extension School is offering, as open courseware, its <a href="http://cs76.tv/2011/spring/">Building Mobile Applications</a> course.&nbsp; The lectures, seminars and project materials include videos, slides and source code for HTML5, Android and iOS apps.</p>
<p>Tribal Labs is offering a free 18 page report on <a href="http://www.triballabs.net/2011/07/cross-platform-mobile-app-development/">Cross-platform mobile development</a> which considers 22 commercial and open source frameworks/tools, three of which &ndash; Rhodes, Appcelerator and Phonegap &ndash; are considered in greater detail.</p>
<p>If you specifically wish to target iOS, Jill Campbell (via LinkedIn) suggests the <a href="http://ipadappsplus.com/ipad-apps/how-to-create-ipad-apps/">iPadAppsPlus</a> site as a source of good design advice, followed by the use of development tools such as <a href="http://www.appmakr.com/">AppMakr</a>, <a href="http://www.appsgeyser.com/?gclid=CPWo4pnxzqkCFdBrKgodsgehMg">AppsGeyser</a>, <a href="http://www.appomator.com/">appOmator</a>, <a href="http://www.buzztouch.com/pages/">Buzztouch</a> and <a href="http://mobile.conduit.com/">Conduit</a>.</p>
<p>Adobe has launched a new tool called <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/farewell_flash_adobe_launches_html5_web_animations_tool_adobe_edge.php">Adobe Edge</a> which will allow creative professionals to design animated Web content using Web standards like HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.&nbsp; Aimed to coexist with Flash rather than replace it, Edge is Adobe's big bet on how to solidify its market position as the Web goes increasingly mobile (and therefore Apple-flavoured).</p>
<p>Finally, if you have an existing Flash app and want to make it iOS-friendly, you could try to convert it to HTML5 using Adobe&rsquo;s <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/wallaby/">Wallaby</a> or Google&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.googlelabs.com/show_details?app_key=agtnbGFiczIwLXd3d3IVCxIMTGFic0FwcE1vZGVsGKHQvQIM">Swiffy</a>.<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Higher Education White Paper</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; The Guardian]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/hereform/all-documents/">white paper and supporting documents</a> are on the BIS web site and THE has several related articles: <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=416654">For-profit HE providers</a> are to be given full access to the student loans system on condition that they agree to follow the same rules on standards, quality, oversight and fair access as publicly funded institutions.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=416660">HEFCE</a> is likely to be transformed into a &ldquo;consumer champion&rdquo; with beefed-up powers to act on concerns raised by other bodies such as the Quality Assurance Agency, and well regarded institutions will have <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=416662">less frequent, light-touch inspections</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jul/12/higher-education-administration">final list of 2012 tuition fees</a> has been published, showing that more than a third of HEIs are planning to charge the maximum &pound;9,000. &nbsp;The estimated average fee across the sector is &pound;8,393, which drops to &pound;8,161 when fee waivers for poorer students are included. &nbsp;The 2012 HE equivalent of Lidl seems to be Leeds City College, with fees of &pound;6,200.</p>
<p>David Willetts flew to South America last month to pursue a deal that would bring <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/jul/10/david-willets-students-brazil-deal">10,000 fee-paying Brazilians to study in the UK</a>, funded by their government to the tune of &pound;18,700 per head.</p>

<p><strong>Two English Universities Considering Going Private </strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; The Guardian]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-13988920">Two English universities are actively considering becoming private institutions</a>, meaning they would no longer get direct government funding for research or teaching, according to a survey of vice chancellors by management consultants PA Consulting Group.&nbsp; The 2 unnamed institutions are not part of the Russell Group, but a &ldquo;substantial minority&rdquo; of the 165 institutions contacted reported wanting to minimise their dependence on government-controlled activities.</p>
<p>The Guardian reports that a forthcoming whitepaper could herald the dawn of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/jun/17/tuition-fees-increase-return-polytechnics">a new generation of polytechnics</a>, born out of a combination of high-end HE fees and a desire by some school leavers for more vocational qualifications.&nbsp; Oxford academic, Donald Fraser, has also recently called for 100 universities to be turned into polytechnics so that funding can be concentrated in &ldquo;40 or 50 well-funded universities&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Private provider BPP has been approached by &ldquo;several&rdquo; institutions about the possibility of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/jun/21/bpp-private-bid-run-public-universities">running services such as IT support, estate management and procurement</a>.&nbsp; A spokeswoman for BPP said, &ldquo;we are currently in serious discussions with three universities about how we can support their continued development, but it is still at the early stages and, of course, subject to the content of the higher education White Paper.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, she stressed that the talks were not about &ldquo;taking over&rdquo; any universities.</p>

<p><strong>Student Complaints about UK HE Rise by a Third</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-13755493">Student complaints against universities in England and Wales</a> have reached record levels, the HE ombudsman's annual report shows.&nbsp; Complaints rose by 33%, the fifth consecutive annual increase, with one in five cases fully or partially upheld.&nbsp; Rob Behrens, head of the adjudicator's office, said the rise reflected a more "consumerist" attitude among students, heightened by the prospect of a sharp increase in tuition fees.&nbsp; For the first time the report names two universities, Westminster and Southampton, which failed to comply with the adjudicator's rulings.</p>

<p><strong>Blackboard Sale Agreed </strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/private-equity-firm-to-buy-blackboard-for-1-64-billion/32058">Blackboard has announced a $1.64bn buyout</a> by private-equity firm, Providence Equity Partners.&nbsp; Ray Henderson, president of Blackboard Learn, said that access to private capital will ensure that Blackboard will be able to put money into product development or big acquisitions although, having already swallowed up Angel and WebCT in recent years, there aren&rsquo;t too many of those left.&nbsp; Perhaps their biggest headache is how to cope with those annoying competitors who give stuff away for free.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>New Media Could Kill Lecturing Jobs</strong></p>
<p><em>[Ross Mackenzie; USA Today]</em></p>
<p>Carol Dann writes in THE, &ldquo;I have a sneaking suspicion that we <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=416428&c=1">university lecturers are so good at incorporating new media</a> into our work that we may do ourselves out of a job.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh Carol, please smell the coffee.&nbsp; Take a look at all the lousy PowerPoints, poor photos, hissy audio, shaky video and inappropriate fonts and colour choices out there.&nbsp; Being &ldquo;good at incorporating new media&rdquo; is easy with modern tools.&nbsp; Incorporating good media in a good way is much harder.&nbsp; She notes, &ldquo;With so many more learning tools, you would think that the standard of learning would improve. But I don't think it has for the majority of students.&rdquo;&nbsp; I rest my case.</p>
<p>An increasing number of US universities are <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/college/2011-06-28-instruction-outsourcing_n.htm">outsourcing instructors for e-learning courses</a>.&nbsp; Proponents see this as another innovative way to cut costs, access bigger markets and add expertise to classrooms, but opponents worry that it will threaten faculty jobs, diminish interaction between students and professors or even turn colleges into diploma mills.&nbsp; In a recent example, Missouri State University will pay the Poynter Institute $6,500 to teach one journalism class, higher than the $2,400 it would pay to a per-course instructor.&nbsp; But students will pay $275 per-credit-hour to take the Poynter class online, whereas those in a &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; class are charged $194 per credit hour.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>e-Learning for Carers</strong></p>
<p><em>[JE]</em></p>
<p>The Royal College of General Practitioners has launched a <a href="http://www.onmedica.com/newsarticle.aspx?id=1678234e-c39f-4183-b7eb-cba18be63b56">new educational programme</a> - created in partnership with the Department of Health, The Princess Royal Trust for Carers and The Children's Society - to help support more than six million people in the UK who are full time carers. &nbsp;Professor Nigel Sparrow, the chair of RCGP professional development board said, "We estimate that there are one in ten patients in every practice who care for a relative or friend who is sick, disabled, or frail. &nbsp;Carers have been found to often neglect their own healthcare needs for several reasons and in many cases it is only a matter of time before they become ill." &nbsp;The programme consists of an e-learning package, printed publications and workshops. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.e-lfh.org.uk/demo.html">e-learning</a> is aimed primarily at GPs and other health workers and includes information about the valuable part that carers of all ages have to play in supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society, and the ways in which GPs and their teams can organise their practices and work with carers to achieve this.</p>

<p><strong>e-Book Publishing</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed; </em><em>Ian Blackham; TechCrunch; Lara Mynors; David Vince; Stephen Downes; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>With the big publishers pressing ahead with e-book versions of their main titles, is there space for regional <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/06/16/university_presses_look_to_apps_and_other_digital_platforms_to_attract_new_audiences">e-book publishing aimed at smaller potential audiences</a>?&nbsp; Some smaller US commercial and academic publishers believe so, but believe the secret of success is not to clone their printed works but to take advantage of multimedia and features such as geo-tagging (e.g. for travel-related books).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Philip Jones suggests that <a href="http://futurebook.net/content/role-book-editor-needs-change">it is time for the role of the book editor to change</a>, otherwise they risk losing control of the book to the &ldquo;digital department&rdquo;.&nbsp; HarperCollins&rsquo; Charlie Redmayne suggests, &ldquo;Editors need to become not just editors of books, but people with the content vision, and there are not enough editors in the industry who have those skills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amazon has bought UK supplier, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/04/amazon-acquires-uk-based-online-book-retailer-the-book-depository-for-international-expansion">Book Depository International</a> for an undisclosed sum.&nbsp; The Book Depository is one of the fastest growing booksellers in Europe, offering over six million books which it ships free of charge to over a million customers in 100 countries.</p>
<p>Google and the British Library have announced a collaborative project to make over <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/british-library-google-puts-thousands-of-books-online-2300357.html">250,000 out-of-copyright books</a>, dating from 1700 to 1870, available for online users.&nbsp; Works will include feminist treatises written in 1791 on French Queen Marie Antoinette and 1858 plans by the Spanish inventor Narciso Monturiol for the first combustion engine-powered submarine, entitled "A Scheme for Underwater Seafaring: the Ichthyneus or Fish-Boat".&nbsp; Over 30,000 items, including maps, photos and extracts from the Magna Carta, are already available online via the <a href="http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/index.html">BL&rsquo;s online gallery</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2011/07/first-google-ebooks-integrated-e-reader.html">iriver Story HD</a> &ndash; launching in the US at $140 &ndash; is the first e-reader integrated with the open Google eBooks platform, through which users can buy and read Google eBooks over Wi-Fi.&nbsp; This will provide over-the-air access to hundreds of thousands of Google eBooks for sale and more than 3 million for free.</p>
<p>A portion of <a href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/collection/darwinlibrary">Charles Darwin&rsquo;s vast library</a> has been digitized and is available online.&nbsp; The collection contains 1,480 scientific books, including 330 of the most heavily annotated and is fully indexed, allowing readers to search through transcriptions of the naturalist&rsquo;s handwritten notes.</p>
<p>Barry Cull presents a good paper in First Monday about <a href="http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3340/2985">online digital text and implications for reading</a>.&nbsp; There is a thorough literature review, with a particular focus on the reading behaviour of emerging university students; he then considers research into college students&rsquo; preferences for print and digital text (including signs of an aversion to reading dense text of almost any kind), and the cognitive neuroscience of reading on screen.</p>
<p>The University of Western Ontario is making more than <a href="http://www.ivey.uwo.ca/media/releases/2011/110620.htm">500 business case studies</a> available for sale through Apple&rsquo;s iBookstore, at a cost of $3.99 each.</p>
<p>South Korea has promised <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/07/04/south-korea-promises-paperless-schools-by-2015/">paperless schools by 2015</a> and plans to spend $2bn on developing digital text books, which would then be available on students&rsquo; school-supplied tablets.</p>

<p><strong>Google+</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Martin Weller; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pontydysgu.org/2011/07/my-first-opinion-of-google-thumbs-up/">Graham Attwell</a> has been giving Google+ a thrashing and he likes what he sees, although <a href="http://davecormier.com/edblog/2011/07/04/google-google-makes-the-same-mistake-on-the-three-questions-for-tech-adoption/">Dave Cormier</a> is more sceptical.&nbsp; <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2011/07/categorisation-angst-the-monoamorous-and-google.html">Martin Weller</a> thinks laterally and wonders what it means in terms of our relationship with technology and who we categorise as &lsquo;friends&rsquo;, and <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/professors-consider-classroom-uses-for-google-plus/32131">Jeff Young</a> speculates on what it might mean for education (although I seem to recall that we did that two years ago when <a href="http://www.dontwasteyourtime.co.uk/elearning/google-wave-in-education/">Wave</a> was about to change the world).</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Web Usage</strong></p>
<p><em>[BCS; Mark Thomas; Giles Clark]</em></p>
<p>More than one billion unique visitors around the world clicked on to Google Sites in May, according to <a href="http://www.comscore.com/">comScore</a>, an increase of 8% over the past year.&nbsp; Microsoft sites were in second place (905m) with Facebook third (713m).&nbsp; The report also showed Israeli users to spend the longest time on social networking websites (10.7 hrs/month) with the UK was in 11<sup>th</sup> place (5.3 hrs).&nbsp; The comScore site also contains a couple of useful free reports: <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Presentations_Whitepapers/2011/2010_Mobile_Year_in_Review">2010 Mobile Year in View</a> and <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Presentations_Whitepapers/2011/2010_Europe_Digital_Year_in_Review">2010 Europe Digital Year in View</a>.</p>
<p>According to StatCounter, Google&rsquo;s <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/story/11/07/02/0017237/Chrome-Hits-20-Share-As-IE-Continues-Slide">Chrome</a> browser now has more than 20% market share as measured by total surfing (as opposed to number of users).&nbsp; On the same measure, IE has fallen to 44% and Firefox is at 28%.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be put off by the title &ndash; the <a href="http://www.ipg.uk.com/data/pp/pp032/docs/WigginDES.pdf">2011 Digital Entertainment Survey</a> by UK media law firm, Wiggin, presents a detailed picture of the current state of digital media, including online activities and attitudes, device ownership and use, consumption of media types, piracy and social networking.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Malware</strong></p>
<p><em>[BCS; Threatpost; Richard Hubbard]</em></p>
<p>Panda Security has released a report in collaboration with the Spanish National Cyber-Security Advisory Council (CNCCS) on the history, current state and future of mobile malware.&nbsp; The <a href="http://press.pandasecurity.com/usa/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/CNCCS-Smartphone-Malware-Full-Report-Translated-06-7-11-FINAL.pdf">Smartphone Malware Report</a> aims to raise awareness of the threats affecting mobile devices as well providing tips individuals can follow to avoid falling victim to mobile threats.</p>
<p>Google has suspended at least 10 suspicious applications from the Android Market after researchers at NC State announced they had discovered a new and particularly stealthy piece of spyware, dubbed <a href="https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/uniquely-stealthy-spyware-found-and-removed-android-market-061311">Plankton</a>, lurking in Android applications there.</p>
<p>Kaspersky Lab reports that a new botnet (a collection of infected computers controlled by cybercriminals) called <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20075725-17/tdl-4-the-indestructible-botnet/">TDL-4</a> might just be indestructible: &ldquo;The owners of TDL are essentially trying to create an 'indestructible' botnet that is protected against attacks, competitors, and antivirus companies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Social Media Revolution 2011</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jane Hart]</em></p>
<p>Erik Qualman has shortened and updated his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SuNx0UrnEo&feature=player_embedded">social media revolution</a> video with 2011 data.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s thought provoking and well worth 2:30 of your time.&nbsp; However, if you prefer more of a corporate flavour and can spare 13 min, Red Sky Vision&rsquo;s <a href="http://vimeo.com/25234403">Social Media @ Work</a> is also worth a watch.</p>
<p>In May 2011, 26.8 million people in the UK visited <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13925893">Facebook</a> and membership has grown by 41% between 2009 and 2011 although, among older users, the figure was 84% according to research firm Nielsen.&nbsp; Twitter also enjoyed a record month, reaching 6.14 million unique visitors (up 34% from April).&nbsp; The number of women aged over 65 using the site grew by 96% over the same period, although there are signs that younger users are drifting away.&nbsp; Finally, LinkedIn clocked-up 3.6 million unique UK visitors in May &ndash; 57% more than in April.</p>
<p>Also, here&rsquo;s a fascinating short video showing how news of the <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2011/06/global-pulse.html">Japanese earthquake</a> was tweeted and then re-tweeted in the hour after the first shock.</p>

<p><strong>The History of English&hellip;in Ten Minutes </strong></p>
<p><em>[Catherine Chambers; ALT;</em> <em>Stephen Downes; JE]</em></p>
<p>Based on U214 (Worlds of English), &lsquo;The History of English&hellip;in Ten Minutes&rsquo; uncovers &nbsp;the sources of English words and phrases from Shakespeare and the King James Bible to America and the Internet.&nbsp; There are 10 one-minute bites in cartoon form with voicing by Clive Anderson, available via <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=446081667">iTunesU</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PLA03075BAD88B909E">YouTube</a>.&nbsp; At the time of writing, they occupy 10 of the top 12 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/education?b=400&s=edu&t=m">&lsquo;most viewed&rsquo; slots on YouTube EDU</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ClipsFromALT#g/u">ALT channel on YouTube</a> now contains presentations from the 2008, 2009 and 2010 ALT conferences.&nbsp; Top rated clips include Donald Clark&rsquo;s &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lecture me&rdquo;, Hans Rosling's &ldquo;A fact-based world view&rdquo;, Martin Bean's &ldquo;A journey in innovation&rdquo; and Sugata Mitra's &ldquo;The hole in the wall&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I am fascinated by the hole in the wall, but <a href="http://flosse.blogging.fi/2011/06/10/independent-learning-and-progressive-inquiry/">Teemu Leinonen</a> argues that Mitra&rsquo;s claims that the kids are self-directed is oversimplified and that Mitra himself fills the role of teacher: &ldquo;There is a clear and clever teacher&rsquo;s intervention: A professor asking students to study, giving them a new tools (computers) empowering them, giving them self-confidence and motivation.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is of course true but it points to an interesting model, because Mitra is applying something very close to a higher education pedagogic approach to lowly-educated primary school kids, to great effect.</p>
<p>Another positive example of empowering young learners comes from John Hunter&rsquo;s TED talk on <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/john_hunter_on_the_world_peace_game.html">the world peace game</a>.&nbsp; If you can&rsquo;t spare all 20 mins, the story starts in earnest at about 7:15.</p>

<p><strong>Transforming Curriculum Delivery through Technology</strong></p>
<p><em>[ALT]</em></p>
<p>A new JISC guide, <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/curriculumdeliveryguide">Transforming curriculum delivery through technology: Stories of challenge, benefit and change</a>, is now available. &nbsp;The publication summarises the headline benefits of technology in curriculum delivery made evident by the work of the 15 projects in the JISC Transforming Curriculum Delivery Through Technology programme.</p>

<p><strong>What Managers Really Want </strong></p>
<p><em>[Clive Shepherd]</em></p>
<p>Clive has been scrutinising the Towards Maturity <a href="http://lmmatters.com/docs/Reinventing_Leadership_Development.pdf">Reinventing Leadership Development</a> report, based on a survey of 180 UK organisations.&nbsp; He considers one particular table which shows the <a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2011/07/what-managers-really-want.html">preferred delivery media of managers at different levels</a>, noting a general receptiveness to mobile and online media but also how preferences vary between managers of different seniority/experience/age.</p>

<p><strong>75 Tips to Reduce eLearning Costs</strong></p>
<p><em>[e-Learning Guild]</em></p>
<p>The e-Learning Guild has published another in its series of free online books.<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.elearningguild.com/content.cfm?selection=doc.2030&utm_campaign=ebook-cost&utm_medium=email&utm_source=elg-membera">75 Tips to Reduce eLearning Costs</a> is compiled from responses from eLG members and includes advice on productivity tools, social learning, reuse, VLE/LMSs and outsourcing.&nbsp; It also addresses the question, &ldquo;Does lower cost mean lower quality?&rdquo;&nbsp; Interestingly, I couldn&rsquo;t find a single mention of open educational resources &ndash; are these regarded by the commercial sector as just an educational fad?</p>

<p>The Association of Educational Publishers and Creative Commons are jointly working on the <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2011/06/project_to_establish_common_ed.html">Learning Resources Framework Initiative</a> to create a standard coding language for all searchable educational content on the Web.&nbsp; The project is being funded by grants from the Gates and Hewlett foundations and is supported Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin, as well as other publishers, education technology providers, and institutes.&nbsp; This all follows last month's announcement that Google, Yahoo and Bing would all contribute formatting tags to schema.org, a library of standardized formatting tags.</p>

<p><strong>Private HE Provision</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian; BBC; University World News; Giles Clark; THE]</em></p>
<p>HEFCE has warned the government about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/may/22/risk-damage-uk-universities-ignored">the risks of promoting private suppliers of HE</a>, advising that, &ldquo;The short-term and long-term goals of private providers may not match the national interest.&nbsp; Private providers may only focus on those subjects, and those kinds of students, that are most profitable.&rdquo;&nbsp; If suppliers&rsquo; main motivation is simply receiving student loan income, pedagogic and pastoral support may be limited, leading to poor completion rates.&nbsp; Telling figures released by the House of Commons library show graduation rates among full-time students in the UK were 61% at not-for-profit institutions, but only 17% at for-profit colleges.&nbsp; UCU&rsquo;s Sally Hunt noted, &ldquo;The government was clearly warned of the many dangers for-profits pose, particularly to our proud international reputation for excellence,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;As events in America have shown, the for-profit model is fraught with danger for students and taxpayers alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prof AC Grayling is to be Master of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13659394">New College of the Humanities</a>, a privately-owned college which will open in Sep 2012.&nbsp; Fourteen notable academics are so far involved, including biologist Richard Dawkins and historian Sir David Cannadine.&nbsp; Degrees will cover five subject areas - law, economics, history, English literature and philosophy &ndash; and students will also take 3 &lsquo;intellectual skills&rsquo; modules in science literacy, logic and critical thinking and applied ethics.&nbsp; Planned fees are &pound;18,000 but some assisted places will also be offered.&nbsp; However, the initiative is causing <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/jun/09/grayling-abused-over-new-college-plans">disquiet amongst some students and academics</a>.</p>
<p>The potential role of <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110527210018386">the private sector in global HE</a> was highlighted at a forum in Canada last month, when 120 university and corporate leaders from more than 20 countries met to explore how best to expand across international borders.&nbsp; Between 1997 and 2010, the number of US students enrolled in for-profit schools increased by 440%, while the overall HE system only grew by 10%, and in India, more than half of post-secondary students study at private institutions.</p>
<p>Investment site The Motley Fool takes a look at <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/international/2011/06/01/can-pearson-stay-on-top.aspx">Pearson&rsquo;s financial situation</a> and how it stacks up against competitors such as McGraw-Hill, Apollo (BPP, University of Phoenix) and Washington Post (Kaplan).&nbsp; The Times Higher takes a more specific look at how <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=416359">BPP is revising down its UK profit forecasts</a>.</p>

<p><strong>MMU New Online Degrees</strong></p>
<p><em>[JE; University World News]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://pr-usa.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=737506&Itemid=30">Manchester Metropolitan University</a> and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants have formed a partnership to offer two new entirely online degrees.&nbsp; A BA in Sustainable Performance Management launches this month, with an estimate enrolment of 300-400 per course, and an MSc in Strategic Business Management follows in Sep.&nbsp; Technology, hosting and infrastructure is outsourced to Core Learning Services (CLS).&nbsp; Students are assessed on their responses to a case study based report, together with a presentation they make to their tutors.&nbsp; There are also formative assessments - in the form of short, multi-choice and other, more discursive questions - which are included in the e-learning content and a discussion forum.&nbsp; The development timeline is interesting: CIMA contacted MMU in Aug 10, CLS were contracted in Nov 10 and the first course is launching in Jun 11.</p>
<p>However, not all collaborations are made in heaven, even if they involve a prestigious partner.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110603183329570">Malaysian University of Science and Technology</a> came close to insolvency earlier this year and is having to restructure and reinvent itself after collaboration with MIT turned sour.&nbsp; Despite a target of some 500 students, just over 200 are currently enrolled (up from just ten students in 2007).&nbsp; &ldquo;MIT insisted on having control over the curriculum in Malaysia and its delivery, and it also insisted on having control over the admission of students.&nbsp; There was not enough adaptation to local circumstances,&rdquo; claimed one anonymous MUST staff member.</p>

<p><strong>International Students</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; New York Times]</em></p>
<p>International post-secondary student numbers are estimated to have risen from 2m (2001) to 3.3m (2009), with over 400,000 (13%) of these in the UK.&nbsp; The Institute of International Education's Atlas Project has just published <a href="http://atlas.iienetwork.org/">Student Mobility and the Internationalization of Higher Education: National Policies and Strategies from Six World Regions</a>.&nbsp; The report examines the current situation in 17 countries, considering both &lsquo;push&rsquo; and &lsquo;pull&rsquo; factors that cause students to study abroad.&nbsp; The authors note that drivers include much more than quality and cost: &ldquo;international students increasingly care about affordability, value for their money and post-education prospects&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But why travel when you can do it online?&nbsp; NYT reports on the success of the Kuala Lumpur-based <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/16/world/asia/16iht-educLede16.html?_r=2">Asia e-University</a> which offers online courses and currently has around 5,000 students in the region, thanks to recent improvements in broadband infrastructure.&nbsp; The university has developed its own courses but is increasingly working with international partners, such as for its joint MBA with Denmark&rsquo;s International Business School of Scandinavia.&nbsp; The report also describes the growth of other similar organisations in Asia and notes that China is now home to 68 online colleges.</p>

<p><strong>US Publishers Criticize Federal Investment in OERs</strong></p>
<p><em>[</em><em>Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some transatlantic d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.&nbsp; Educational publishers are strongly objecting to a $2bn federal grant program that will support the development of <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/publishers-criticize-federal-investment-in-open-educational-resources/31483">freely available online college course materials</a>, with comments such as: &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s very dangerous for them to be in the product business,&rdquo; (Pearson); &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see the point in the government collecting up taxpayer money and trying to rebuild an industry from scratch,&rdquo; (McGraw-Hill); and &ldquo;I fear when big bucks from government is put into certain places, it actually stops pushing people to innovate,&rdquo; (Blackboard).</p>

<p><strong>Costs v Benefits of a (US) Degree</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Slashdot]</em></p>
<p>The Nexus Research and Policy Center (which shares the same parentage as the University of Phoenix) has published <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/05/12/study_examines_costs_benefits_of_bachelors_degrees_across_institutional_categories">Who Wins? Who Pays? The Economic Returns and Costs of a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree</a>.&nbsp; The authors report that, &ldquo;a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, whether from a public, a not-for-profit, or a for-profit institution, pays a handsome net financial reward in comparison to a high school diploma&rdquo;.&nbsp; Their analysis suggests benefits in the range $230k to $552k (depending on the type of institution) over a lifetime for degree holders compared with those without.&nbsp; However, some others in the sector have been critical of the study&rsquo;s underlying assumptions and generalizations.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Pew Internet has released <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703509104576325611317227614.html">Is College Worth It?</a> &ndash; an amalgamation of two recent US surveys of the general public and college presidents.&nbsp; 94% of adults with children said they expect them to attend college and 53% were saving to pay for it, but 57% say the US HE system fails to provide students with good value for money and 75% believe college is too expensive for most Americans to afford.&nbsp; However, 86% of college graduates say that college has been a good investment for them personally, estimating that they earn $20,000 a year for having obtained a degree.&nbsp; 38% of college presidents believe that US HE is headed in the wrong direction and only 19% of them see it as the best in the world (although this rises to 40% among presidents of highly selective colleges and universities).</p>
<p>And finally, Georgetown University has published an extremely detailed study into <a href="http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/hpi/cew/pdfs/whatsitworth-complete.pdf">the economic value of college majors</a>.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>US Post-Secondary Landscape</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>The Instructional Technology Council (ITC) considers <a href="http://www.itcnetwork.org/images/stories/itcannualsurveymay2011final.pdf">the Impact of eLearning at Community Colleges</a>.&nbsp; The preamble is lengthy and very US-centric but the survey itself (p7) presents some useful data and trends, showing a 9% growth in enrolments in online programmes, greater use of remote tutors and the beginnings of a drift away from Blackboard towards other LMS/VLEs.</p>
<p>A &lsquo;first look&rsquo; report from the National Center for Education Statistics contains a mass of data on enrolments, graduations and finances from more than 6,700 different <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2011/2011230.pdf">US post-secondary institutions</a>.&nbsp; Although it&rsquo;s considerably more detailed than the ITC report, the absence of an executive summary or conclusions makes it quite difficult to unravel &ndash; so perhaps one for enthusiasts only.</p>

<p><strong>US Self-paced eLearning Market Forecast</strong></p>
<p><em>[Ambient Insight]</em></p>
<p>Ambient Insight has just published <a href="http://www.ambientinsight.com/Resources/Documents/Ambient-Insight-2010-2015-US-Corporate-eLearning-Market-Executive-Overview.pdf">The US Corporate Market for Self-paced eLearning Products and Services: 2010-2015 Forecast</a>.&nbsp; This shows a 2010 total market of $6.8bn in 2010, rising at just 0.9% to reach $7.1bn by 2015.&nbsp; However, some sectors are more buoyant, such as healthcare which has an 18% growth rate.&nbsp; Ambient believes the corporate segment currently accounts for 37.4% of the total US Self-paced eLearning market.</p>

<p><strong>Digital's Next Frontier: Education</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t describe this 20 min talk by <a href="http://edtechdigest.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/trends-rupert-murdoch-in-the-edtech-space/">Rupert Murdoch</a> at last month&rsquo;s e-G8 Forum as &lsquo;electric&rsquo; but it certainly strikes a chord.&nbsp; He describes the failings he sees in modern one-size-fits-all education (&ldquo;a jobs program for teachers and administrators&rdquo;) and gives examples of technology-based success stories that have broken the mould: &ldquo;We must begin by exciting the imaginations of our young people.&nbsp; The key is not a computer or a tablet or some other device; the key is the software that will engage students and help teach them concepts and how to think for themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Educause Top Ten IT Issues</strong></p>
<p><em>[Educause]</em></p>
<p>The 2011 <a href="http://www.educause.edu/2011IssuesResources">Current Issues Survey</a> has just been published by Educause and &lsquo;mobile computing&rsquo; debuts at #5 in the top-ten higher education IT issues critical for strategic success.&nbsp; The top four remain the same as in last year&rsquo;s survey: Funding; Administrative/Resourcing/Information Systems; Teaching and Learning with Technology; and Security.</p>

<p><strong>Remote Tutoring</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; JE]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2011/05/19/need-help-with-class-motuto-puts-a-live-tutor-in-your-pocket/">Motuto</a> offers real time online tutor support for Grade 7-12 subjects via an iPad/iPhone app which gives users access to a pool of tutors.&nbsp; Communication is via text, photos and a two-way whiteboard.&nbsp; The app and your first 20 mins come free, after which support costs 5$ per 20 min session.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.24-7tutorials.com/">24-7 tutorials</a> offers a similar service, but extending up into HE.&nbsp; The service uses real-time text and audio technology to connect students and tutors, with one-to-one sessions priced at &euro;15 per 20 mins.&nbsp; Founder, Eileen O&rsquo;Duffy has spent the past six months recruiting freelance tutors from teaching and professional backgrounds.&nbsp; Her initial target is Irish and UK curricula/students, but she already has plans to expand into Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Learning to Teach Online </strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>UNSW&rsquo;s Simon McIntyre and colleagues have assembled the <a href="http://online.cofa.unsw.edu.au/learning-to-teach-online/ltto-episodes">Learning to Teach Online</a> web site which hosts a series of guidance and case study episodes, each of which comprises a video and supporting PDF.</p>
<p>But Georgia&rsquo;s Rob Jenkins asks <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Why-Are-So-Many-Students-Still/127584/">why so many students are still failing online?</a>&nbsp; He suggests that the US sees, &ldquo;success rates in online courses of only 50% - as opposed to 70-to-75% for comparable face-to-face classes&rdquo; and that his own suggestion of preparing/testing new students for online readiness &ldquo;was met with stony silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Tablet Roundup</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jakob Nielsen; ASTD; Wired Campus; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Earlier research by Jakob Nielsen found some serious flaws in the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/mobile/ipad/">usability of iPad applications</a>.&nbsp; One year on, there are still problems, including read&ndash;tap asymmetry (content that was large enough to read but too small to tap) and touchable areas too close together, leading to accidental activation and often no quick way to go &lsquo;back&rsquo;; there were also examples of low discoverability (active areas that didn't look touchable).&nbsp; Researchers also found that users often disliked typing on the touchscreen and thus avoided registration screens.&nbsp; The good news for users is that apps are generally becoming more consistent and standardized, making them easier to operate.&nbsp; On the ASTD site, Connie Malamed offers <a href="http://www.astd.org/LC/0611_malamed">10 Tips for Designing M-Learning and Support Apps</a>; many of these are obvious, but we occasionally need obvious things to be pointed out to us.</p>
<p>Barnes &amp; Noble has launched a <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/06/01/hands-on-with-the-new-nook-watch-out-amazon">touch-screen Nook e-reader</a> in the US &ndash; with a 6&rdquo; monochrome e-ink screen, no page-turn latency and an estimated 2 month battery life (twice that of Kindle, and with 37 fewer buttons) &ndash; for $139.</p>
<p>The US Dept of Education has released a new guide to laws and rules colleges must follow to ensure e-reading devices and other <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/education-deptartment-clarifies-e-reader-accessibility-rules/31507">emerging technologies are accessible</a> to all students.</p>
<p>A Pearson survey of 1,200 US college students found that 69% think <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/students-say-tablets-will-transform-college-though-most-dont-own-them/31465">tablets will transform higher education</a>, and 48% said tablets will replace printed textbooks within the next five years.&nbsp; But how many actually owned a tablet?&nbsp; Just 7%.</p>
<p>Similar investigations by Nielsen Research suggest that only around <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/05/18/despite-the-hype-just-5-percent-of-u-s-owns-a-tablet-says-nielsen/">5% of US consumers own a tablet</a>.&nbsp; In UK that figure falls to about 1.7% (most of whom seem to work in universities&hellip;)</p>

<p><strong>e-Books</strong></p>
<p><em>[Engadget; TechCrunch; InsideHigherEd; BBC; Simon Rae; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/19/kindle-books-officially-take-over-print-sales-at-amazon-pulp-st/">Amazon</a> has announced that digital book sales (excluding free downloads) now exceed those of <em>all</em> hardcover and paperback print titles &ndash; at a rate of 105:100 in April.&nbsp; The company also notes that it is selling more ad-supported Kindle readers at $114 than the normal $139 version.&nbsp; The ads do not obstruct the reading experience but appear in screensaver mode or at the bottom of the reading list; the ad-supported device is not available in the UK.</p>
<p>Citi analyst Mark Mahaney estimates that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/07/kindle-10-percent-sales-amazon">sales of Kindle and digital books</a> will account for 10% of Amazon&rsquo;s revenues in 2012.&nbsp; He believes, thanks to the Kindle, Amazon&rsquo;s US book business is growing faster than at any point in the last ten years.</p>
<p>Despite encouraging e-book sales in the commercial and fiction sectors, the same cannot be said for education.&nbsp; A survey by the <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/06/01/e_books_becoming_a_greater_priority_of_university_presses_in_the_age_of_ipad_and_kindle">Association of American University Presses</a> suggests that e-book sales or licenses accounted for less than 3% of total revenue for most university presses at the end of last year.&nbsp; However, there are signs that this has risen towards 10% in the early months of this year, but the majority of these have been &lsquo;backlist&rsquo; titles (more than a year old) even though publishers direct their marketing effort at new &lsquo;frontlist&rsquo; titles.</p>
<p>A student at California&rsquo;s Foothill College has filed a grievance arguing that a $78 fee he had to pay in addition to the $85 registration fee amounted to a <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/california-community-college-student-questions-legality-of-e-textbook-fees/31599">double charge</a>.&nbsp; The additional fee gave him access to a Pearson Web site with an e-textbook, quizzes, homework questions and other material.&nbsp; However, the e-textbook expires 12 to 18 months after a student signs up, a condition that might be considered a violation of the provision, although the college argues that because students can print out that text at any time during the course, the fee at Foothill remains on the right side of US law.</p>
<p>The British Library is launching a new iPad app which will make more than 60,000 <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13683880">19<sup>th</sup> Century books</a> available.&nbsp; However, unlike e-books, the app uses scanned copies of original editions so users will have access to original illustrations.&nbsp; The paid-for app will be launched in full this summer but, until then, a thousand titles can be browsed for free.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nap.edu/topics.php">National Academies Press</a> publishes over 200 new books, reports and podcasts each year on scientific, social, engineering health and educational topics - and over 4,000 are offered as free PDFs, such as <a href="http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13078">Learning Science Through Computer Games and Simulations</a>.</p>
<p>Given that shamelessly ripping-off content is the sincerest form of flattery, a <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/yale-u-complains-that-chinese-university-press-plagiarized-free-course-materials/31609">Chinese university press</a> appears to be selling transcripts of free <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/">Open Yale</a> courses, contrary to the terms of the site&rsquo;s Creative Commons licence.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC</strong></p>
<p><em>[George Siemens; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>It had to happen.&nbsp; George and Stephen&rsquo;s dabbling days are over and they&rsquo;re now assembling the <a href="http://change.mooc.ca/">mother of all open online courses</a> (MOOC).&nbsp; Registration is open and the draft programme runs for 36 weeks, starting on <strong>12 Sep</strong>, presented/facilitated by an e-learning &lsquo;A&rsquo; list which includes our own Martin Weller, Grainne Conole and Tony Hirst, plus other luminaries such as Diana Laurillard, Allison Littlejohn, Tony Bates and Terry Anderson.</p>

<p><strong>Spider Scribe </strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2011/05/spider-scribe-mind-mapping-with-images.html">Spider Scribe</a> is an online mind mapping tool that can be used individually or collaboratively.&nbsp; What makes it slightly different is that users can include images, maps, calendars, text notes and uploaded text files.</p>

<p><strong>Augmented Reality Examples </strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Mashable]</em></p>
<p>According to Stephen, Neil Lynch&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.primaryschooltools.com/page/Augmented+Reality">Primary School Tools</a> site offers, &ldquo;Everything you wanted to know about augmented reality, and then some.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then along came Gary Hayes and the <a href="http://www.personalizemedia.com/top-ten-augmented-reality-gamified-life-talks/">Top Ten Augmented Reality &amp; Gamified Life Talks</a> on his personalizemedia site.&nbsp; But Clark Quinn has some doubts about the purpose and value of gamification, which he outlines in a post entitled <a href="http://blog.learnlets.com/?p=2106">engagification</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the world of sharp suits and skinny lattes, Sam Ewen believes augmented reality, projection mapping and Kinect hacking are <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/06/08/augmented-reality-marketing-2">poised to change marketing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NHS Mobile Apps</strong></p>
<p><em>[Epic; BCS]</em></p>
<p>As reported last month, Epic continues to work closely with the NHS and the company has now made two mobile apps &ndash; adult drug calculations and compatibility of injectable medicines &ndash; freely available for <a href="http://www.epic.co.uk/news/press-releases/epic-launches-nhs-mobile-learning-apps.html">iPhone/Pad</a> and <a href="https://market.android.com/search?q=nhs&so=1&c=apps">Android</a>.</p>
<p>NHS has launched an <a href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/News/LatestNews/MobileAppLaunch">NHS Direct app</a> so, thanks to cutting edge technology and 3G wireless protocols, you no longer have to wait until you get home to discover that you should take two aspirins &ndash; you can now have this confirmed within seconds whilst on the move.</p>

<p><strong>Looking Through the Lens </strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; TechCrunch]</em></p>

<p>Fotopedia has so far achieved 3.2m downloads of its first four photo apps.&nbsp; It has now launched a fifth, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/07/fotopedia-national-geographic">Dreams of Burma</a>, in partnership with National Geographic.</p>

<p><strong>Fees &amp; Funding</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>Universities UK has warned that institutions could be <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=415863">breaking competition law</a> simply by sharing information on costs or other &ldquo;strategically significant matters&rdquo;, such as support for poorer students.&nbsp; The warning comes as scrutiny intensifies over the decision by a large number of English institutions to aim for the maximum level of &pound;9,000 undergraduate tuition fees for 2012-13.</p>
<p>London Met is taking a shock-and-awe approach to the financial situation by <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=415961">closing some in-progress humanities courses</a>.&nbsp; This raises concerns that some current students may not be able to complete their studies, although VC Malcolm Gillies doubts this will be the case.&nbsp; However, the situation prompted one staff member to comment, &ldquo;Shameful, utterly shameful! &nbsp;I am embarrassed ever to have worked at an institution run by this man - he not only lacks any sense of moral responsibility, but of corporate too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Analysis of university business models by The Parthenon Group suggests that at least a third and perhaps up to <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=416111">half of all university courses in the UK are loss-making</a>, and many teaching-led universities have departments with no &ldquo;meaningful existence&rdquo; that are being kept afloat by profits from other areas.&nbsp; HESA data show that, for a group of about 50 general teaching institutions, a large chunk of their activity is focused on offering five subject areas - business, IT, design, teacher training and nursing.&nbsp; The rest of their resources are spent on several other departments, which are &ldquo;almost certainly&rdquo; losing money.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Public vs Private</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>The government has announced plans to extend support and loans to <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110415201034208">students attending private sector institutions</a> in England to the same level as for state sector students, stoking fears that private institutions will be able to cherry-pick lucrative courses.&nbsp; But David Willetts believes the announcement, &ldquo;is an important step towards the goal of public spending following the decisions of learners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>HEPI has just published <a href="http://www.hepi.ac.uk/455-1969/Private-Providers-in-UK-Higher-Education--Some-Policy-Options.html">Private Providers in UK Higher Education: Some policy options</a>, finding that the UK&rsquo;s 670 private providers are mostly very small and focused on a limited number of professional disciplines.&nbsp; The report concludes that government policies mean that private HE is set to grow further, but not necessarily at the expense of public HE.&nbsp; They urge the creation of a rigorous regulatory system to encourage private providers that offer high quality and keep out those that do not.</p>
<p>BPP is entering into partnership with Swindon FE college to offer <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-13055624">law and business degrees</a>, beginning this September, in an example of the kind of initiative that ministers seem keen to encourage.&nbsp; BPP's CEO Carl Lygo claims, &ldquo;During the past year, we have been approached by a staggering number of publicly-funded providers who are actively pursuing ways in which to continue to provide quality education and training, or, in many cases, to seek help in order to survive.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also, in a separate <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/may/09/carl-lygo-bpp-university-college?CMP=twt_fd">Guardian interview</a> discussing the likelihood of rising fees impacting on numbers going to university, Lygo states, &ldquo;I suspect the Open University, FE colleges and the private sector will all have a role to play in moving towards more career-focused degrees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deutsche Welle also reports on BPP&rsquo;s success, together with that of the <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15024830,00.html">University of Buckingham</a> and its two-year degrees.&nbsp; The site also notes that, in Germany, around 25% of universities are already privately run.</p>

<p><strong>Who has Pearson Bought this Month?</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Independent; Reuters]</em></p>
<p>Pearson has bought education technology company <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/pearson-pays-230m-for-us-education-it-group-2275270.html">Schoolnet</a> for $230m. &nbsp;The company supports more than 5 million students in the US and the acquisition will help Pearson to compete for further US government contracts relating to e-learning services for schools.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a proposed acquisition of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/keyDevelopments?symbol=EDDgb.PZ">Education Development International</a> &ndash; a provider of vocational educational qualifications and assessment services &ndash; has been delayed so the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) can consider the deal&rsquo;s compliance with competition law.&nbsp; Over 80% of EDI shareholders voted in support of the deal.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Blackboard Ripe for Takeover?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>Blackboard has announced that it is considering <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/b090b7e6-6ad8-11e0-9744-00144feab49a.html#axzz1K35oJ4lJ">proposals to acquire the company</a>, although it did not disclose who the suitors might be.&nbsp; The news generated a 30% rise in Blackboard&rsquo;s stock price, to its highest point since 2007, valuing the company at around $1.7bn.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Tablet Wars</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; The Guardian; BBC; BCS; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Another month, another new tablet.&nbsp; RIM&rsquo;s Blackberry PlayBook has hit the (N Amercian) streets, <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/04/21/rim-sold-45000-playbooks-opening-day/">selling 45,000 on its first day</a> (compared with 330,000 for the iPad last year).&nbsp; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/22/blackberry-playbook-launch-date-price-specs">UK sales</a> should begin in &lsquo;Quarter 2&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Asus sold out of its $399 <a href="http://uk.asus.com/Eee/Eee_Pad/Eee_Pad_Transformer_TF101/">Transformer tablet</a> within hours of launch.&nbsp; A contributory factor could be the snap-on keyboard which makes it easier to do work requiring more than a few words of input and, thanks to its cunning extra battery, extends productivity from an estimated 9.5 to 16 hours.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13192354">Sony plans to introduce two Android tablets</a> later this year: one will have a conventional 9&rdquo; touchscreen, while the other will feature dual 5.5&rdquo; displays that fold closed.&nbsp; Sony will add several non-Android features including the ability to stream video and music to TVs and stereos.&nbsp; The devices may also offer gaming and integration with its PlayStation network.</p>
<p>The Educational Technology Debate site contains three recent items on tablets: Jonathan Nalder considers <a href="http://edutechdebate.org/tablet-computers-in-education/what-the-post-pc-era-means-for-education/">What the Post-PC Era Means for Education</a>, David Risher believes <a href="http://edutechdebate.org/tablet-computers-in-education/ereaders-will-transform-the-developing-world-in-and-outside-the-classroom/">eReaders will transform the developing world</a>, but <a href="http://wayan.com/">Wayan Vota</a> sounds a note of caution in <a href="http://edutechdebate.org/tablet-computers-in-education/tablets-are-good-content-is-better-and-teachers-are-the-best-educational-ict-investment/">Tablets are Good, Content is Better and Teachers are Best</a>.</p>
<p>Recent research by Canalys shows that the <a href="http://www.canalys.com/pr/2011/r2011043.html">worldwide &lsquo;PC market&rsquo;</a> (which it defines as all desktops, notebooks, netbook and pads) grew by 7% in 2011 (Q1), mainly on the back of tablet sales.&nbsp; Apple is now firmly in the top 5 list of vendors, with growth of 188% and having sold 74% of the 6.4m pads shipped in Q1.</p>
<p>The iPad currently concludes Edudemic&rsquo;s romp through <a href="http://edudemic.com/2011/04/classroom-technology/">educational technology since 1650</a>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s fascinating is how many things appeared much earlier than you might have imagined; however, the high spot (or low spot, if you&rsquo;re a constructivist) was surely 1957, which saw the arrival of two gems: the Reading Accelerator and Skinner&rsquo;s Teaching Machine.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Get a Degree by 'Blended Learning'</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>This is novel.&nbsp; The Guardian reports that it is now possible to get a degree by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/apr/19/distance-blended-learning-degrees">blended learning</a> (&ldquo;one of the fastest-growing trends in education&rdquo;) whilst simultaneously holding down a full time job.&nbsp; Surely that could never catch on?</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>e-Book Corner</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch;</em> <em>Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>The Association of American Publishers latest sales report shows a year-to-date <a href="http://www.publishers.org/press/30/">increase in e-Book sales</a> of 169%, whilst print declined by 25%.&nbsp; The e-increase is thought to include a large number of purchases by those who received e-Readers and tablets for Christmas.</p>
<p>Amazon and OverDrive are introducing a service in 11,000 US public and educational libraries which will allow Kindle owners to <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/04/20/amazon-partnering-with-overdrive-to-bring-kindle-library-lending-to-11000-libraries-across-the-us/">check out e-Books from their local library</a>.&nbsp; Whispersync technology will then preserve digital notes and bookmarks in case the user checks the book out again or purchases it through Amazon.</p>
<p>However, yet another survey casts doubt over <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1751160/the-kindle-cant-yet-replace-paper-computers-for-students-study">the effectiveness of e-Readers in education</a>: 39 first-year students at the University of Washington participated in a pilot study of Amazon's large-screen Kindle DX.&nbsp; By seven months into the study, fewer than 40% were using the Kindle for schoolwork because of poor note-taking support and difficulties in &lsquo;skimming&rsquo; text and looking up references.&nbsp; The study also found, &ldquo;The digital text also disrupted a technique called cognitive mapping, in which readers used physical cues such as the location on the page and the position in the book to go back and find a section of text or even to help retain and recall the information they had read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Educational Sites Provide Fuel for Plagiarism</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>iParadigms, the company behind plagiarism software <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/05/02/educational-sites-provide-ample-fodder-for-plagiarism.aspx">Turnitin</a>, examined the sources for 110 million content matches in 40 million student papers submitted over a 10-month period.&nbsp; It found one third of matched content derived from online Web 2.0 sites where people contribute and share content, a quarter came from legitimate educational sites, 15% had ties to sites specifically promoting &lsquo;academic dishonesty&rsquo; and 7% could be found in Wikipedia.&nbsp; The next four most popular sources for word-for-word content were: answers.yahoo.com, answers.com, slideshare.net, and oppapers.com.</p>
<p>And a US economist believes <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/online-courses-should-always-include-proctored-finals-economist-warns/31287">online courses should always include proctored final exams</a>.&nbsp; Cheryl Wachenheim noted that, in online sections whose final exam was unproctored/open-book, her students&rsquo; exam grades were roughly the same as for classroom-based students who took proctored/closed-book finals, but online sections that were asked to take proctored/closed-book final exams performed at least 15 percentage points worse.&nbsp; She also reports anecdotal evidence that students work in groups to compile huge caches of test-bank questions, quoting one student as saying, &ldquo;We may not learn the material, but we are guaranteed an A.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Learning and Talent Development 2011</strong></p>
<p><em>[Clive Shepherd]</em></p>
<p>CIPD published its annual <a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/hr-resources/survey-reports/learning-talent-development-2011.aspx">UK learning and development survey</a> last month which rather confirms findings in previous years that we appreciate e-learning, but not because we necessarily think it&rsquo;s the best method.&nbsp; Only 10% of those surveyed rated it as the &ldquo;most effective&rdquo; approach (down from 12% last year), but shrinking budgets have caused 54% to use more of it; e-learning is also likely to be more heavily used in larger organisations, particularly in the public sector.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>m-Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Epic; Campus Technology; TechCrunch; Educause]</em></p>
<p>Epic has published a research study into <a href="http://www.epic.co.uk/assets/files/Mobile_learning_NHS_Research_Report.pdf">mobile learning in the NHS</a> which considered the potential benefits of mobile learning for the healthcare workforce, as well as likely challenges and how they could be overcome.&nbsp; More than 170 NHS staff participated, from a variety of practitioner and managerial job roles and the research was peer reviewed by Dr Chris Davies, Head of the E-learning Research Group at Oxford University, and John Traxler, &ldquo;the UK&rsquo;s only Professor of Mobile Learning&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jasig, an international HE consortium, is launching a new open source project called <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/04/25/open-source-group-seeks-support-from-higher-ed-for-mobile-initiative.aspx">uMobile</a> and is calling on universities to contribute.&nbsp; The project will be built on Jasig&rsquo;s uPortal framework and will provide portal-like functionality on mobile devices, initially with features like campus maps, directories, RSS feeds, calendars, course schedules, campus news, and other tools common to mobile portal apps.&nbsp; Early development will focus on providing native apps and browser-based portal functionality on iOS and Android devices.</p>
<p>A recent Nielsen survey of US mobile users suggests <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/26/nielsen-consumer-desire-for-android-grows-unlike-ios-and-blackberry/">Android is just edging ahead of Apple</a> as the preferred operating system for consumers who plan to get a new smartphone.&nbsp; Blackberry and Windows are a rather distant third and fourth&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adobe added that it anticipates there will be 131 million smart phones with Flash installed by the end of 2011.&nbsp; <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/04/11/creative-suite-5.5-boosts-html5-and-mobile-development.aspx">CS5.5</a> incorporates several new features and tools such as Adobe Flash Builder 4.5 which adds support for mobile Flex projects by letting developers build apps that run on Android, iOS and BlackBerry tablets.&nbsp; It also includes new mobile support for ActionScript and HTML5 emulation, plus useful code snippets for common functions such as accelerometer and multi-touch gestures, as well as saving and loading data.</p>
<p>Monarch Media has released a library of open-standard learning objects (<a href="http://www.monarchmedia.com/oslo/">OSLO</a>), built using technologies such as HTML5, XML, JQuery, PHP, and Ajax.&nbsp; The objects run in most browsers without the need for plugins or Flash and are supported by mobile devices such as iPad and Android.</p>
<p>Useful advice for m-learning designers and developers in Educause&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.educause.edu/blog/jberg/MobileAppDevelopmentConsiderat/227853">seven things you should know about mobile app development</a>.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Usability of Mobile Apps</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jakob Nielsen]</em></p>
<p>I find Nielsen&rsquo;s research into usability often provides useful information and advice (provided one remembers that it is aimed at general users rather than specifically at e-learning) and his latest study into <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/screen-space-use.html">interface design for small-screen devices</a> is no exception.&nbsp; However, I&rsquo;m not sure I needed to know that Amazon's <em>Add to Cart</em> button is 0.0003 m<sup>2</sup> in size on a typical monitor, and that &ldquo;You could crowd almost 800,000 <em>Buy</em> buttons onto the floor space of the average American home&rdquo;.&nbsp; Sigh.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Social Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[JE; Stephen Downes; Wired Campus; Matthew Moran; Jane Hart]</em></p>
<p>We Are Social is a &lsquo;conversation agency&rsquo; which helps organisations to, &ldquo;listen, understand and engage in conversations in social media&rdquo;.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be put off it that all sounds a bit corporate &ndash; their <a href="http://wearesocial.net/">weekly social mashups</a> contain all manner of interesting and useful tidbits about who&rsquo;s doing what with social media.</p>
<p>The Ontario College of Teachers has released <a href="http://www.oct.ca/publications/PDF/Prof_Adv_Soc_Media_EN.pdf">Professional Advisory: Use of Electronic Communication and Social Media</a>, advising members to make appropriate use of social media with students, but to keep social and professional lives separate and to avoid things such as making, &ldquo;impulsive, inappropriate or heated comments&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A recent survey by AOL concludes that <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110428005399/en/AOL-Research-Content-Fuel-Social-Web">content is the fuel of the social web</a>, finding that: around a quarter of social-media messages contain links to content; 27 million content sources are shared daily in the USA; and, &ldquo;the most-often shared content is from a trusted source that provides helpful information&rdquo;.&nbsp; Researchers tracked 10,000 messages between 1,000 participants over a 10 day period.</p>
<p>The plethora of social sites and tools creates an open market for personal thoughts and comments.&nbsp; A useful infographic from Laurel Papworth gives some advice on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silkcharm/5656114078/">responding to negative comments online</a> but, for one university, things have already gone too far: <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/israeli-university-sues-google-to-remove-former-students-blog/31260">Technion-Israel Institute of Technology is suing Google</a> to force it to remove a blog by a former student which it believes slanders its program for American medical students.</p>
<p>The US Performance Management Institute has released a study into the use of social media as a tool for connecting healthcare consumers and providers (dubbed, you&rsquo;ve guessed it, &ldquo;Health 2.0&rdquo;).&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hpminstitute.org/Era_of_Twitter">Healthcare performance management in the era of Twitter</a> considers various biopsychosocial benefits, but there is undoubtedly an underlying corporate cost-saving message, supported by case study examples.</p>
<p>And Jane Hart has been busy, updating her examination of <a href="http://c4lpt.co.uk/handbook/state.html">Learning &amp; Working in the Social Workplace</a> and launching <a href="http://c4lpt.co.uk/shareandlearn/">Share&amp;Learn</a>, &ldquo;a new collaboration platform where members can share links, resources, ideas, experiences, tips, etc about the use of learning and performance trends, technologies and tools, and learn from one another.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Belt-Tightening, Oxford Style</strong></p>
<p><em>[David Wilson]</em></p>
<p>Prof Andrew Hamilton, VC of Oxford, has written at length explaining <a href="http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/vc/news/studentfunding/">the university&rsquo;s plans for fees and bursaries in 2012</a>.&nbsp; However, let nobody expect that fee increases will result in lashings of extra Ch&acirc;teauneuf-du-Pape at high table.&nbsp; &ldquo;At Oxford, we have calculated that a new undergraduate tuition charge of close to &pound;8,000 a year would be required simply to make up for lost public investment.&nbsp; So any idea that the new funding regime heralds a major cash bonanza is very wide of the mark.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll cope, Andrew.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>The State of UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; Gill Marshall]</em></p>
<p>THE has been busy compiling some useful data of late.&nbsp; Firstly, we have figures and analysis of <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=415610">VC salaries and academic backgrounds</a>; there is also a detailed breakdown of <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=415728&c=2">the financial state of each institution</a>, based on data from a forthcoming Grant Thornton report.&nbsp; Finally, their latest list of <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=415618">proposed tuition fees</a> makes depressing reading for 2012 students and their parents (yes, I am).&nbsp; A slightly different list comes from the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-12880840">BBC</a>, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/mar/25/higher-education-universityfunding">The Guardian</a> has its own version, which the ever-industrious <a href="http://blog.ouseful.info/2011/04/08/a-first-quick-viz-of-uk-university-fees/">Tony Hirst has visualised</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Differential Tuition Fees</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>The University of Tennessee is introducing <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/mar2011/bs2011037_440411.htm">differential tuition fees on its business courses</a> as student numbers have more than doubled in the past seven years to 5,300 whilst tuition staffing has remained static at around 120.&nbsp; This autumn&rsquo;s entry will be charged an extra $50 for each credit hour, adding approx $3,200 to the cost of their tuition over four years, raising about $4 million which will be spent on a dozen extra staff and reduced class sizes.&nbsp; Of the 162 public research universities in the US, 92 now have at least one undergraduate program with differential tuition, with 18 having introduced the practice in the past three years.</p>

<p><strong>UK Averages 21% University Drop Outs</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tread Carefully in Online Education</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; University World News; Stephen Downes; Pete Mitton]</em></p>
<p>e-Learning experts from three US public universities who spoke at the Sloan Consortium&rsquo;s annual conference on blended learning warned that <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/think-youll-make-big-bucks-in-online-ed-not-so-fast-experts-say/30663">generating money</a> is &ldquo;one of the worst reasons&rdquo; to get into online and blended learning, citing the recent failure of the University of Illinois&rsquo;s Global Campus and older examples like NYUonline.&nbsp; But, in contrast, the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s up-front investment has paid dividends &ndash; blended and online courses account for 30% of the institution&rsquo;s offering and, discounting faculty salaries, generate an ROI of about 20:1.&nbsp; Outsourcing was also discussed and Josh Jarrett of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation said it was rumoured that the USC&rsquo;s deal with 2tor had earned the university about $6m during the first year of operation.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/reversing-course-u-of-california-to-borrow-millions-for-online-classes/30853">University of California</a>, having resisted online learning for years, is now taking the plunge and plans to borrow up to $7m to fund development.&nbsp; UWN reports on the recent healthy growth in virtual universities &ndash; many based on collaborative ventures &ndash; in the <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110401190727550">Gulf States</a>.&nbsp; And Canada&rsquo;s Contact North presents a detailed study into <a href="http://www.contactnorth.ca/PDF/Online Learning in Australia - April 2011.pdf">Online Learning in Australia</a>, based on an examination of Open Universities Australia (a $70m for-profit consortium that offers a single point of online access to university courses offered by consortium members) and eWorks, comprising 140 partner organizations supporting the Learning Object Repository Network (LORN)&nbsp;</p>
<p>PayPal&rsquo;s Peter Thiel thinks that, after the dot-com boom and the housing crash, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/10/peter-thiel-were-in-a-bubble-and-its-not-the-internet-its-higher-education/">the next bubble to burst will be higher education</a>.&nbsp; &ldquo;A true bubble is when something is over-valued and intensely believed,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Education may be the only thing people still believe in in the United States. &nbsp;To question education is really dangerous. &nbsp;It is the absolute taboo. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s like telling the world there&rsquo;s no Santa Claus.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Growth in Online MBAs</strong></p>
<p><em>[Nick Watson; Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>The FT has issued a <a href="http://media.ft.com/cms/c10627ec-4b79-11e0-89d8-00144feab49a.pdf">special report on online learning</a>, it also <a href="http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/online-mba-2011">lists online MBAs</a> and examines the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/53a0a23e-4b71-11e0-89d8-00144feab49a,dwp_uuid=3315d002-4b76-11e0-89d8-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=traffic/email/content/BizEd/March/memmkt#axzz1GgLCof5k">evolution and divergence of the online MBA marketplace</a>, in which two US premium examples are described: Brown University ($95,000) and North Carolina ($89,000).&nbsp; However, in the UK, Ashridge has seen online provision allow them to reduce costs and break into overseas markets such as Ghana and Nigeria.&nbsp; Martin Bean is also quoted espousing similar global aspirations, noting that less than 10% of OU students live outside the UK but nearly 90% of the 31m downloads of OU material from iTunesU come from outside the UK.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12766562">Peter Scott</a> cites the same figures with slightly less gravitas but much more coolness in a related BBC news item.&nbsp; He also get more column inches on where the OU is going with free and paid-for content and why he thinks it&rsquo;s a better model than having to fill lecture rooms with students according to timetabled slots.</p>

<p><strong>Strong Support for Educational Technology </strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; JE; Paul Hollins]</em></p>
<p>Cisco has commissioned research into <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/03/14/survey-finds-strong-support-for-educational-technology.aspx">attitudes towards educational technology</a>, through telephone interviews with 500 educational administrators and IT decision-makers (approx 50:50 schools:FE/HE) in 14 countries.&nbsp; Most people surveyed saw potential for technology to improve student employment prospects; distance education opportunities; personalisation; student engagement; communication, collaboration and teamwork, and research capabilities. Technology is also seen as a way of reducing costs.</p>
<p>The Huffington Post reports on the successful implementation of virtual learning in the K-12 level at the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-young/florida-virtual-school-e-learning_b_842313.html">Florida Virtual School</a> (FLVS), with more than 250,000 students currently&nbsp; completing or supplementing their traditional classroom coursework, although the Post ventures the interesting view that, &ldquo;in a perfect world, no student would be forced to take a class online&rdquo;.</p>
<p>NYT reports that more than 1 million US K-12 students took an online course in 2007-8, up by 47% over two years, but there are concerns that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/education/06online.html?ref=education">cost-cutting</a> is currently the main driver and that this is impacting on the quality, both of the materials themselves and the nature of learning that results (e.g. finding and pasting information via Google or Wikipedia).</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Australian iPad First</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>The University of Adelaide has become the first in the world to give an <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110318125650211">iPad to every first-year science student</a> as part of a curriculum shake-up.&nbsp; 700 first-year students on all 22 bachelor degree science courses will use the iPad as one of their core learning tools, making teaching material &ldquo;more accessible, more relevant and more frequently updated, providing the flexible learning environment students are looking for.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the Chronicle and the FT review the same <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/ipads-bane-or-boon-for-college-teaching/30385">studies into educational iPad use</a>, they reach quite different conclusions.&nbsp; The Chronicle takes more of a pedagogic angle and sounds a note of caution, particularly over the usability of the finger-touch interface and the fact that, &ldquo;for their online final exam, 39 of the 40 students put away their iPads in favor a laptop.&rdquo;&nbsp; The FT takes a more upbeat, student-focused view: the devices are great for reading, and just plain cool.&nbsp; My casting vote?&nbsp; Never underestimate the power of cool.</p>
<p>Two <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/03/22/samsung-galaxy-tabs-8-9-and-10-1-are-official/">new Samsung Galaxy Tabs</a> &ndash; with 8.9&rdquo; and 10.1&rdquo; screens &ndash; have been announced.&nbsp; This will make comparisons with the iPad easier than with the current 7&rdquo; model and it will be interesting to see how they fare, both against iPad2 and also Motorola&rsquo;s (overpriced?) Android <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2011/04/07/xoom-too-expensive-try-these-inexpensive-android-tablets-instead/">Xoom</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Net Generation &ndash; Or Not</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Paul Hollins; BCS; Rebecca Ferguson; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>Jim Shimabukuro is concerned over Mark Bullen&rsquo;s claims about <a href="http://etcjournal.com/2011/03/10/7478/">the Net Generation</a>.&nbsp; He notes that many new phenomena are denigrated (recalling from his childhood that Elvis appearing live on the Ed Sullivan Show was considered &lsquo;dangerous&rsquo;) and is not convinced by the research evidence cited by Bullen (and others) in support of NetGen.&nbsp; Shimabukuro regards much of this as, &ldquo;reviews of literature masquerading as research and studies with limited generalizability and often conflicting or confounding findings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talking of dubious data, how do the folks at <a href="http://www.idea.org/blog/2011/03/17/black-hole-of-tweets-new-research-on-which-tweeters-get-attention/">Idea</a> know that 99.95% of tweets, &ldquo;evaporate into the ether, scrolling off the feed, leaving scarcely a trace&rdquo;?&nbsp; There are now apparently 460,000 new Twitter accounts opened each day but about 40% of these will not send a single tweet, 80% will tweet fewer than ten times and 25% will have no followers.</p>
<p>Lucie Russell, a director of UK charity YoungMinds, believes <a href="http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/39555?src=ebcs">cyber-bullying</a> leading to depression and other mental health issues is an increasing phenomenon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Social networking can be a very isolating experience if it isn't combined with face to face interaction with one's peers.&nbsp; Social networking in itself doesn't lead to depression in young people, but it can contribute to it.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, she also noted that networks such a Facebook can play a key part in helping people develop and maintain friendships.</p>
<p>The Association of Internet Researchers&rsquo; Air-L list is tracking the implications of <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/how_recent_changes_to_twitters_terms_of_service_mi.php">Twitter&rsquo;s change to its terms of service</a> which could restrict academics&rsquo; ability to collect or export datasets for analysis.&nbsp; Some <a href="http://listserv.aoir.org/pipermail/air-l-aoir.org/2011-March/023403.html">inside information</a> from Amanda Lenhart sheds light on what may or may not be possible.</p>
<p>Princeton English professor Jeff Nunokawa &ndash; a firm believer that &ldquo;you hunt where the ducks are&rdquo; &ndash; has <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/princeton-professor-gains-cult-status-with-3200-essays-on-facebook/30582">joined his students on Facebook</a>, having now created 3,200 essays using the Facebook notes feature.&nbsp; The essays vary in length but a growing number of students are appreciative of the ability to dip in and out as their need and mood dictates.&nbsp; And Elizabethtown College&rsquo;s Kirsten Johnson wondered how <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/professors-with-personal-tweets-get-high-credibility-marks/30635">personal posts on Twitter and Facebook</a> affected her credibility, so she created three accounts on Twitter for three fictional &ldquo;professors&rdquo;.&nbsp; One account was filled personal tweets (&ldquo;Feeling good after an early morning swim at the rec center&rdquo;), the second with scholarly ones (&ldquo;Working on a study about how social-networking sites can be used in educational settings&rdquo;), and the third with a combination.&nbsp; When 120 students were surveyed, they rated the personal professor the highest on measures of competence, trustworthiness, and caring.</p>
<p>Finally, this quote from Stephen, based on classroom observations by <a href="http://www.connectedprincipals.com/archives/3141">Jonathan Martin</a>, speaks for itself: &ldquo;When the topics appeared relevant to students, the note-taking pages appeared; when the topics veered to the arcane and irrelevant, the screens veered to Facebook, gaming sites, and other distractions ... (when) asking questions to facilitate conversation, something else fascinating happened.&nbsp; Nearly half of the screens veered away from both note-taking pages and distractions; appearing instead were Google, Wikipedia, and other information source sites ... I think of this as parallel processing, and it is going to be pretty hard to persuade me this is anything but positive practice by our students.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Who Has Pearson Bought This Month?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>Pearson and McGraw-Hill are taking a &lsquo;minority stake&rsquo; in <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/embargoed-publishers-invest-in-inkling-producer-of-digital-textbooks/30525">Inkling</a>, an electronic textbook start-up which rebuilds existing print textbooks from scratch in a multimedia-rich format designed for the iPad. Although the company currently only offers <a href="http://www.inkling.com/titles/">14 titles</a>, it plans to have developed and launched 100 by the end of the year.&nbsp; Inkling&rsquo;s approach contrasts with that of CourseSmart, a competitor with a much larger library of titles that creates digital books that largely recreate the format of printed textbooks.&nbsp; CourseSmart&rsquo;s approach is &ldquo;a short-sighted folly,&rdquo; said Matt MacInnis, Inkling&rsquo;s chief executive. &ldquo;Sticking a PDF on a screen is operating within all of the constraints of the print book and realizing none of the potential of the iPad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pearson has launched a <a title="http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/244000" href="http://www.pearsonschool.com/LanguageCentralScience">new series of science apps</a> for school students, covering life-, earth-, and physical science. &nbsp;The apps have been downloaded more than 30,000 times since debuting on iTunes in February and they feature interactive activities, flashcards, self-assessment tests of understanding (including a Trivia Challenge quiz), and skills-development tools.</p>

<p><strong>Learning While Working</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jay Cross]</em></p>
<p>CEDEFOP (the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training) has published <a href="http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/publications/17770.aspx">Learning While Working</a>, a report on key trends in adult learning in the workplace which covers the whole spectrum of what, where, why and how to train adults.&nbsp; The data will be useful for those interested in vocational training, but they could probably live without insightful EU-funded observations such as, &ldquo;In the present economic downturn, we are facing unparalleled challenges&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, the report does contain my new favourite word, &lsquo;flexicurity&rsquo;.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>OERs - Daniel v Conole</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Sir John Daniel writes on the <a href="http://www.col.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=130">Commonwealth of Learning blog</a>, &ldquo;the Open Educational Practices movement, developed by Germany's Ulf-Daniel Ehlers and the UK's Gr&aacute;inne Conole, struck me as a bit flaky.&rdquo;&nbsp; He believes assessment and accreditation have to be part of the mix, referring to work by Southern Queensland&rsquo;s Jim Taylor as being closer to the mark.&nbsp; This may certainly be true of an OER university, but there&rsquo;s a whole other world out there that wants to use OERs in a less formal, more just-in-time way.&nbsp; Stephen Downes is not convinced either: &ldquo;I honestly don't see why it's flaky when Ulf-Daniel Ehlers and Gr&aacute;inne Conole (or any of the rest of us) do it, but not flaky when Jim Taylor proposes it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Sir John&rsquo;s other comments in the same blog posting is that &ldquo;innovating on too many fronts at once scares off students&rdquo;.&nbsp; I think he&rsquo;d be astonished at just how younger learners take these things in their stride, and there is no better evidence of this than a recent report from America&rsquo;s Project Tomorrow.&nbsp; Based on a <a href="http://www.tomorrow.org/speakup/speakup_congress.html">survey of 300,000 K-12 students</a>, here&rsquo;s what they report on 6<sup>th</sup> graders (aged 11-12):</p>
<ul>
<li>50% have a cell phone and an additional one-third say they have a smart phone</li>
<li>Almost half of girls and over a third of boys are regularly updating their social networking site (despite the fact that they are not old enough to legally register on many of these)</li>
<li>25% are already using an e-textbook</li>
<li>22% regularly participate in 3D virtual reality worlds</li>
<li>Half take tests online and three times as many have taken an online class as in 2005</li>
<li>Their number one complaint is that school filters and firewalls block websites they need for their schoolwork</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Knowledge, Networks and Nations</strong></p>
<p><em>[George Siemens]</em></p>
<p>The Royal Society&rsquo;s <a href="http://royalsociety.org/uploadedFiles/Royal_Society_Content/Influencing_Policy/Reports/2011-03-28-Knowledge-networks-nations.pdf">Knowledge, networks and nations: Global scientific collaboration in the 21st century</a>, is a thorough assessment of the current scientific research landscape and the potential for international collaboration.&nbsp; It contains a wealth of case studies, data and analysis &ndash; and these are not trivial figures: &ldquo;Today there are over 7 million researchers around the world, drawing on a combined international R&amp;D spend of over US$1000bn (a 45% increase since 2002), and reading and publishing in around 25,000 separate scientific journals per year.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>We Choose the Moon</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Hirst]</em></p>
<p>The John F Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.wechoosethemoon.org/">We Choose the Moon</a> site is very nicely done - stitching together images, animation, audio and video to recreate the Apollo 11 lunar mission.&nbsp; It amply illustrates the gulf between a well-designed (albeit at a cost) multimedia package and simply providing &lsquo;a bunch of assets&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Also, congratulations to Tony on winning the <a href="http://blog.ouseful.info/2011/03/24/tso-openup-competition-opening-up-ucas-data/">2011 TSO OpenUp Competition</a> by opening up UCAS course code information.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s one of those solutions looking for an application, but Tony (and the judges) believe that being able to tap into the raw data will make it possible for third parties to construct useful tools and services based on all the courses offered for undergraduate entry.</p>

<p><strong>e-Books</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Lara Mynors; Matthew Moran; TechCrunch; Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Xplana&rsquo;s Rob Reynolds discusses the dramatic increase in <a href="http://blog.xplana.com/reports/digital-textbooks-reach-the-tipping-point-in-the-u-s-higher-education-a-revised-5-year-projection/">US sales of digital textbooks</a>.&nbsp; They currently represent only 3% of the market, but that has doubled in a year and is projected to exceed 25% in 2015 and 40% ($1.5bn) two years later.&nbsp; The popularity of iPad and Kindle are noted as significant factors, but so too will be the emerging rental and OER markets, plus increased scalability of production offered by the new ePub3 standard.</p>
<p>NYT reports that 66% of US public libraries now <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/business/media/15libraries.html?_r=1&hp">lend e-books free of charge</a>, on the expectation that they can do this, one reader at a time, an unlimited number of times.&nbsp; However, HarperCollins is now enforcing new restrictions on its e-books that makes them expire after they have been checked out 26 times.</p>
<p>Kindle users can now search, browse, buy and download from a library of 50,000 <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/03/kindle-can-now-buy-download-audio-books-over-wi-fi/">Audible audio books</a>, direct from their device over a Wi-Fi connection.&nbsp; And the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/21/amazon-gives-kindle-book-swapping-service-lendle-the-axe/">Lendle</a> service &ndash; which allowed Kindle users to lend or swap e-books, just once, for 14 days &ndash; was launched just two months ago but has now been withdrawn by Amazon.</p>
<p>California State University reports on a pilot <a href="http://www.convergemag.com/classtech/California-State-University-Shares-E-book-Pilot-Results.html">digital textbook programme</a>, in which 3,870 students on 30 courses at five campuses participated.&nbsp; 53% considered e-books easy to use (22% did not) but the respondents split into equal thirds in terms of being satisfied, neutral or dissatisfied with their experience.&nbsp; &ldquo;That satisfaction has to be significantly improved,&rdquo; said CSU&rsquo;s Gerry Hanley, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have a third dissatisfied and a third neutral and only have a third like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Researchers &lsquo;Kinect&rsquo; Data to Make Faster Diagnoses</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Minnesota are <a href="http://www.mndaily.com/2011/03/10/researchers-‘kinect’-data-make-faster-diagnoses">using the Xbox Kinect to diagnose children</a> who show symptoms of an array of mental disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder. &nbsp;It can be quite difficult to assess children younger than 6 years old but a video monitoring system comprising several Kinect cameras stationed around a small room takes footage of a child playing with toys without intrusion. &nbsp;These feeds are then analysed and converted into data that can be presented to doctors as evidence.</p>

<p><strong>The Cost of Online Learning: $12.50 Per Hour?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Tony Bates has been looking into the <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2011/03/22/the-cost-of-online-learning-12-50-an-hour/">costs of developing e-learning</a> for a while now (I think a book is in the pipeline) but this is probably his most detailed posting to date.&nbsp; Based on a Canadian fully online masters programme, he provides whole-life development and support costs, study hours and enrolment details to come up with $12.50 per hour, per head.&nbsp; Interestingly, this figure is supported by a blog comment from Jim Farmer, who came up with a cost of about $10 per 50 mins when doing a similar analysis two years ago with US data.</p>

<p><strong>IRRODL Special Issue</strong></p>
<p><em>[George Siemens; Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>The latest issue of Athabasca&rsquo;s IRRODL is a special, focussing on <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl">connectivism</a>, co-guest-edited by George Siemens and Grainne Conole.&nbsp; The journal reflects on how the dramatic social and technological changes have impacted on education since 2004, when connectivism was presented as a new theory of learning that addresses learning in complex, social, networked environments.</p>
<p>Grainne is also guest-editing a special issue of the European Journal of Open, Distance and E-learning (EURODL) on <a href="http://www.eurodl.org/">Fostering Creativity &ndash; The Use of Open Educational Resources</a>, for which a call for submissions is currently open until 2 May.</p>

<p><a href="http://mindsnacks.com/">MindSnacks</a> offers &ldquo;awesome mobile learning games&rdquo;, currently for French and Spanish language tuition, but the company has just received $1.2m of funding to develop further apps.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/03/22/fitfu/">FitFu</a> turns your iPhone into an exercise motivation tool.&nbsp; It allows you to set up a fitness schedule and goals, and reminds you when to exercise.&nbsp; Using the iPhone's built-in accelerometer, it can count your reps out loud, track your personal best and tell you when you meet your goals.&nbsp; Couple that with <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2011/04/05/too-lazy-to-count-calories-now-you-can-just-take-a-picture-of-your-meal/">MealSnap</a>, which allows you to take a photo of your meal, from which it estimates (sort of) the calorie count, and you&rsquo;ll be ready for the beach before you know it.</p>

<p><strong>Cambridge Ideas</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran; Catherine Chambers]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sms.cam.ac.uk/collection/535809">Cambridge Ideas</a> is a sort of East Anglian TED Talks, although the latter doesn&rsquo;t claim to be backed by &ldquo;eight centuries of brilliant academic thought&rdquo;.&nbsp; If the quality of the material is inversely proportional to the modesty of their claims, there should be some cracking stuff here.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, OU presence on iTunesU goes from strength to strength.&nbsp; Having clocked up more than a quarter of a million downloads of last month&rsquo;s <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/women-in-science-audio/id424356834">Women in Science</a> podcasts, we now hold the coveted Number 1 spot with <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/war-intervention-development/id380225789">War, Intervention and Development</a>, based on material from the post graduate module TU875.</p>

<p><strong>Who Has Pearson Bought This Month?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Giles Clark; Wired Campus; Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>Pearson is acquiring <a href="http://www.stockmarketwire.com/display/?id=4097888§ionId=standardNews">Education Development International</a> (EDI plc), a provider of educational and training qualifications and online assessment services.&nbsp; The move will &ldquo;complement Pearson's existing work-based learning business and will create an enlarged qualifications group offering a comprehensive range of vocational and academic services to the UK and international markets&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Moving across to <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/02/22/blackboard_evolves_its_business_strategy_in_light_of_market_saturation_in_higher_ed">Blackboard</a>, Inside Higher Ed&rsquo;s Steve Kolowich wonders what an LMS/VLE company should do once it realises that most institutions now have an LMS/VLE.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the company appears to have a cunning plan.</p>
<p>In this 6 min podcast, Felice Nudelman, executive director of education for the New York Times, explains how <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/podcast-the-new-york-times-joins-colleges-to-create-online-courses/30018">NYT has developed its own digital-learning platform</a> and is beginning to collaborate with colleges.&nbsp; Students get a long-term collaborative experience, she says, involving faculty members and reporters from the New York Times newsroom.</p>

<p><strong>Are VLEs Still Relevant?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>JISC&rsquo;s Transformation Curriculum Delivery through Technology programme has now concluded, having looked at 15 projects (7 using Moodle) involving over 60 different technologies.&nbsp; Christina Smart looks at how <a href="http://www.elearning.ac.uk/features/vlesindelivery">VLEs are being used to support curriculum innovation</a> in four of those projects, and discusses why, despite all their shortcomings, VLEs are still are the heart of curriculum development.</p>

<p><strong>Working Smarter Daily</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jay Cross; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Imagine a band containing all your favourite musicians, or a team with all your favourite players.&nbsp; Jay Cross has done the same for news.&nbsp; Now I know we can all use aggregators to do this for ourselves, but Jay and his colleagues at the Internet Time Alliance have come up with a nicely designed solution to save us the bother.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.workingsmarterdaily.com/">Working Smarter Daily</a> brings topical stories relating to learning, teaching, performance and technology from a selection of key figures in these fields, and it comes in three attractive colours &ndash; web, email or RSS.</p>
<p>However, if you prefer RSS feeds but hate the fact that stories are often truncated, forcing you to click-through to read them, <a href="http://fulltextrssfeed.com/">Full Text RSS Feed Builder</a> allows you to enter the URL of a feed and receive a full-text feed URL you can use anywhere.</p>

<p><strong>What Makes a Good e-Learning Game?</strong></p>
<p><em>[eLearn Magazine; Jeff Cobb; Pete Mitton]</em></p>
<p>Educational games still seem to generate quite mixed reactions, particularly from some managers in the adult learning arena.&nbsp; Perhaps the secret is to call them &lsquo;simulations&rsquo;?&nbsp; Assuming you do choose to press ahead, <a href="http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&article=153-1">Simon Egenfeldt-Nielsen</a>, writing in eLearn Magazine, considers firstly what educational games are all about, and secondly what makes the good ones good.</p>
<p>A good current example of a serious game is <a href="http://www.missiontolearn.com/2011/02/spent-urban-ministries/">Spent</a>, developed for US charity Urban Ministries.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve just lost your job, you&rsquo;re down to your last $1,000 and you have to make it through the month, coping with problems and balancing income/outgoing decisions.&nbsp; Jeff Cobb describes it as &ldquo;not a terribly complex game, but it is very effective&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Tina Barseghian reports in the Huffington Post on a recent presentation by Arizona State&rsquo;s Prof James Gee on whether <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tina-barseghian/education-technology-video-games_b_829460.html">video gaming is good for kids&rsquo; brains</a>.&nbsp; He cites ten research-validated reasons why video games are good for learning, mostly relating to motivators such as challenge, risk-taking and problem-solving.</p>

<p><strong>Free Learning Materials</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran; Chris Hough; Wired Campus; Tony Bates; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>I have a confession to make.&nbsp; Once I went to the BBC Academy&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/collegeofproduction/">College of Production</a> website, I couldn&rsquo;t get away.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s full of advice and guidance from professionals in the art of media production &ndash; and being BBC, it&rsquo;s engaging and well produced.&nbsp; So, if you want tips on filming, interviewing, editing, devising a game show, producing Chris Evans on radio or Graham Norton on TV, dive on in.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.o2learn.co.uk/index.php">O<sub>2</sub> Learn</a> is a free collection of video lessons from teachers that can help students of all levels from kids tussling with the Key Stages to GCSE and A-Level students.&nbsp; Examples include analysing text, big bang theory, musical cadence, the Romeo and Juliet weather forecast and that all-time classic: a snake eating a mouse.</p>
<p>Struggling to understand the concept of transverse wave motion?&nbsp; This video of Alom Shaha&rsquo;s sticky tape, BBQ skewer and <a href="http://www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/elibrary/resource/2096/wave-machine">jelly baby wave machine</a> should sort you out.</p>
<p>Does the world need another free university lecture site listing material from the usual suspects such as Berkeley, MIT, Oxford and Yale?&nbsp; The folks at <a href="http://lecturefox.com/">Lecturefox</a> obviously think so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TED also thinks it may be missing a trick, hence the soon-to-be-launched <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/ted-known-for-big-idea-conferences-pushes-into-education/30094">TED-Ed</a>, featuring some re-edited and recategorised existing TED talks, plus some new (and probably shorter) material aimed specifically at education.</p>
<p>The Open Educational Quality Initiative (OPAL) &ndash; an international network of 7 organisations (including the OU) to promote innovation and better quality in education and training through the use of OERs &ndash; has published <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2011/03/06/european-report-on-barriers-to-the-use-of-open-educational-resources/">Beyond OER</a>.&nbsp; This latest report notes that, &ldquo;the current focus in OER is mainly put on building more access to digital content.&nbsp; There is little consideration of whether this will support educational practices, promote quality and innovation in teaching and learning&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_for_Assessment_and_Credit_for_Students">OER for Assessment and Credit Project</a> will provide opportunities for OER learners who are interested in earning formal academic credit for their learning.&nbsp; The project will also contribute to the design and development of the recently announced OER university.</p>

<p><strong>Can Self-Study Be Social?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Clive Shepherd]</em></p>
<p>Clive wonders, <a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2011/03/can-self-study-be-social.html">can self-study be social?</a>&nbsp; He refers not to group interaction but to the learner&rsquo;s relationship with the author.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you read a book, one that has an author with a name written on the cover, the book acts as a useful mediator between the author and you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He believes the same could be true for e-learning, so you would know who wrote/designed it and it would be written using a conversational tone, with the author's personality shining through.&nbsp; &ldquo;Web 2.0 content - blog and forum postings, YouTube videos, etc - is consumed with gusto because it has personality.&nbsp; Policy manuals, corporate brochures and self-study compliance courses are not, because they don't.&nbsp; With most e-learning, you feel like you're interacting with a corporation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>CoursePark</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.coursepark.com/">CoursePark</a> is a social learning environment that supports an online course marketplace offering packages for employee training and client training.&nbsp; Course selection is a lot like iTunes, with genres, new arrivals and popular courses highlighted.&nbsp; However, the courses themselves are mostly page-turning with animations and quizzes built in.&nbsp; The company claims to have 25,000 registered users.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>The Amaze Generation</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran; T3; Beccy Dresden; CNET]</em></p>
<p>This looked promising.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.amaze.com/amazegeneration/">Amaze Generation</a> is a five-year longitudinal study into the habits and preferences of young technology users, and the initial report is certainly thorough.&nbsp; Then you get to the sample details and discover they&rsquo;re tracking just 20 kids, currently spanning a relatively enormous age range of 10-15.&nbsp; Never mind, the quotes are good: Google is &ldquo;a piece of software you can find everything on&rdquo; and Twitter is &ldquo;for old people&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If only the Amaze generation can talk mum into parting with around &pound;500 (or a &pound;40 monthly contract), they can soon get their hands on the new Sony Ericsson Xperia Play, dubbed the <a href="http://www.t3.com/news/xperia-play-gets-march-31st-uk-release-date?=54351">Playstation Phone</a>.&nbsp; Six games come pre-installed, including The Sims and FIFA 10, with the UK launch on 31 Mar.</p>
<p>Or perhaps they&rsquo;d prefer an <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/tag/ipad-2/">iPad2</a>.&nbsp; Netted even suggests some <a href="http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=ea7544b086a8473bd90e4c1e3&id=aff3864681&e=3f9e94039d">educational apps</a>.&nbsp; J P Morgan Research estimates that a total of <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19736_7-20041557-251.html">81m tablets will be built this year</a>, but that only 48m will actually ship.&nbsp; This will leave a sizeable glut on warehouse shelves, although JPM predict these will mostly be in the non-Apple warehouses.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Content Is Twice as Difficult</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jakob Nielsen]</em></p>
<p>Nielsen reports on research from the University of Alberta, showing that learners using an iPhone-sized screen <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/mobile-content-comprehension.html">scored less than half in comprehension tests</a> than an equivalent PC-based group.&nbsp; He attributes this not just to screen/text size, but to a host of compounding factors including slower download speeds, no keyboard and no mouse rollover or right-click.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>I'm a Celebrity, Let Me Fix Your Education System</strong></p>
<p><em>[Donald Clark]</em></p>
<p>Hell hath no fury like a ranting Donald Clark.&nbsp; This month he offers a critical appraisal of that well known head teacher, <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2011/03/im-celebrity-let-me-fix-your-education.html">Jamie Oliver</a> and his motivational chums, including David &ldquo;you are all here because you failed&rdquo; Starkey.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>eBooks</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Matthew Moran; Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Cengage Learning has announced a new e-textbook publishing platform, <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/textbook-publisher-announces-‘app’-approach-to-learning-materials/30090">MindTap</a>, which allows professors to customise material by adding their own slides, video lectures, articles, or plug in apps and free online content from elsewhere.&nbsp; The offering comes bundled with Cengage&rsquo;s Aplia electronic test-bank system, videos and other materials that the company owns the rights to, including the archives of Newsweek.&nbsp; Students read material via a standard Web browser displaying two side-by-side windows: one containing a page of a textbook and the other allowing users to open another app within the system, such as a notebook page to type and share notes, or any of the other apps that a professor enabled for his or her course.</p>
<p>Many libraries are scratching their collective heads about how to deal with e-Books.&nbsp; Now, 150 public and academic US libraries are responding through a new collaborative venture which will allow users to access e-books owned and stored at libraries other than their home libraries.&nbsp; The initiative will use <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/collaboration-seeks-to-provide-easier-access-to-e-books/30054">Open Library</a>, an existing e-book lending service, as a means to curate the more than 80,000 e-books that partner institutions have offered up as part of the initial push.&nbsp; Open Library allows users to check out an e-book that can be read through a Web browser or downloaded as a PDF or ePub file.&nbsp; After an allotted checkout period, the e-book self-destructs.</p>
<p>However, despite their fondness for social networking and cell phones, <a href="http://www.bisg.org/news-5-603-press-releasecollege-students-want-their-textbooks-the-old-fashioned-way-in-print.php">most students prefer physical books to e-Books</a>.&nbsp; Nearly 75% of students to recently respond to a major new research survey from the Book Industry Study Group said they prefer printed texts, citing a fondness for print's look and feel, as well as its permanence and ability to be resold.&nbsp; Only around 12% of students - mostly males, and often MBA-seeking or distance learners - prefer e-Books because of their lower cost, convenience and portability; these students also like online supplemental materials such as quizzes.</p>
<p>Tony Bates reports on a presentation by 11 University of Cincinnati psychology seniors at a recent Educause event.&nbsp; They had compared the content of <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2011/02/17/online-search-versus-168-textbook/">traditional college texts</a>, one of which costs $168, to content they found for free on the Web, finding the online material to be as good as the material in the textbook.</p>

<p><strong>Web O&rsquo; Wonder</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; CNET]</em></p>
<p>Mozilla&rsquo;s <a href="https://demos.mozilla.org/">Web O&rsquo; Wonder</a> exhibits creative ways to interact with the Web using modern Web technologies.&nbsp; This includes, for example, a preview of the features and effects that are available in HTML5 and CSS3.&nbsp; In addition to the interactive demos, with Web O&rsquo; Wonder you can learn more about how each demo works, what technologies have been used and watch behind the scenes video interviews with the creators.&nbsp; However, the standard health warning applies: to view any demos tagged with WebGL, you&rsquo;ll need a suitable browser such as newer versions of Firefox or Chrome.</p>
<p>Talking of Browsers, Mozilla has updated the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-20041864-92.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20">Firefox 4 beta</a> to release candidate status, offering a series of stability, compatibility and performance tweaks over earlier versions.&nbsp; Google has just released <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20040627-264.html">Chrome 10</a>, with faster JavaScript, password synchronisation, and a revamped preferences system, but no support for H264 video.&nbsp; Finally, Microsoft should be launching <a href="http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-20031279-12.html">IE9</a> today (14<sup>th</sup>), allowing sites to be pinned to the Windows task bar, with pages able to act more like desktop applications with things like notifications; there is also improved security and performance, faster start times a new JavaScript engine.</p>

<p><strong>One Day on Earth</strong></p>
<p><em>[Mashable]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/01/18/one-day-on-earth-archive/">One Day on Earth</a> initiative last year invited participants to contribute video clips to build a collective worldwide picture of our lives on 10.10.10.&nbsp; The project will culminate in the release of a feature-length documentary but, for now, the results are available via a geotagged video map, featuring all content&nbsp; and searchable by topic, popularity and location.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Storify</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://storify.com/">Storify</a> offers the functionality to &ldquo;turn what people post on social media into compelling stories.&nbsp; Collect the best photos, video, tweets and more to publish them as simple, beautiful stories that can be embedded anywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d looked at this on a slow news day I might have been underwhelmed, but I first visited the site last Friday and was able to track news from the Japan earthquake from a variety of sources (YouTube clips, tweets, ABC, CNN, the UN, etc) as they had unfolded that morning.</p>

<p><strong>Budgets, Costs and the Awful Truth About Vice Chancellors</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; BBC; University World News; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>THE comments, &ldquo;Will the last person to leave UK higher education please turn the lights off...&rdquo; as it brings <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=415081">details from HEFCE of the planned &pound;180m cuts</a>.&nbsp; The universities of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-12356393">Birmingham and Nottingham</a> have announced plans to work more closely and share some academic staff, but insist that it is not a merger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new report from HEPI warns that the proportion of applicants failing to gain a university place is set to increase substantially, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110206072324823">pushing up the cost to students</a> as the government restricts public funds.&nbsp; The proportion failing to receive offers rose from 6% of applications in 2003 to nearly 14% in 2010.&nbsp; The number of unsatisfied applicants increased by 60%, from 38,000 in 2009, to 62,000 in 2010.</p>
<p>Forbes looks at the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2011/02/01/college-education-bubble-opinions-contributors-louis-lataif.html">funding crisis from a US perspective</a> and there are concerns in <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-13/brown-cuts-imperil-california-dream-that-fueled-silicon-valley.html">California</a> that Gov Jerry Brown&rsquo;s proposed 16% cut in the HE budget &ndash; $1.4bn of a $25.4bn state deficit &ndash; will jeopardize the flow of talent that powers California&rsquo;s knowledge-based economy.&nbsp; Annual tuition for residents, which was less than $4,500 a decade ago, is scheduled to rise to at least $11,124 in the next school year.</p>
<p>Irish graduates would have to repay a debt of at least &euro;25,000 under a student loan scheme being considered by the Dept of Education, which is widely expected to back a <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0112/1224287329426.html">study now, pay later</a> model proposed by former minister for education Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe two years ago.&nbsp; On average, it would take each graduate 10 years to repay their loan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/jan/13/european-student-numbers-soar-scotland">Scottish</a> ministers fear its universities have become a cheap option for EU students facing rising fees at home, although quirk of EU law means English students are required to pay.&nbsp; Latest admissions figures show the number of students from other EU countries taking up places at Scottish universities has nearly doubled in a decade to almost 16,000 last year, at a cost of nearly &pound;75m.</p>
<p>The Telegraph reports that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8274663/Row-over-hike-in-university-vice-chancellors-pay.html">senior university pay</a> rose by as much as a fifth last year and that every UK VC now earns more than the Prime Minister, prompting claims that universities were showing an &ldquo;arrogant disregard&rdquo; for public opinion in the light of recent tuition fee increases.</p>
<p>And Amanda Goodall presents research evidence which she claims demonstrates that the most <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20110128224139908">successful universities are those led by academics/researchers</a> rather than leaders with a strong management or technical background.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/With-Lawsuit-For-Profit/126042">Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities</a> is suing the US Dept of Education on the grounds that three new rules - one designed to prevent misrepresentation in recruiting, another to end the tying of compensation to enrolment, and a third to give states greater oversight over distance education - exceed the department's authority, were developed with inadequate due process, and, in at least one case, are unconstitutional. &nbsp;The association's president said his group's 1,500 member colleges felt it was the only choice because good-faith efforts at negotiations with the department had failed.</p>
<p>Tales are surfacing in the US about underhand tactics that have seen some <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Disgruntled-Students-Start/126078/">Kaplan students</a> being billed for classes they didn&rsquo;t take and loans they did not request.&nbsp; Led by former student Shannon Croteau &ndash; who was 11 classes away from graduating with a bachelor's degree in paralegal studies when she discovered she was out of financial aid, $30,000 in debt at that the degree would be worthless in her home state of New Hampshire &ndash; a group of former students are demanding that parent company, The Washington Post, shut down Kaplan University until improvements are made.</p>
<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/new-web-venture-offers-syndicated-courses/29042">Omnicademy</a>, a for-profit institution conceived at Louisiana State University, hopes to allow professors to syndicate their courses this Autumn, by uploading material from courses they&rsquo;re already teaching and offering this to students at other colleges through the Omnicademy site.&nbsp; Each course will be supervised and maintained by a proctor who is selected or approved by the professor, but all grades have to be approved by a professor.&nbsp; Universities can review the courses and decide which ones they want to adopt and offer credit for.&nbsp; &ldquo;One could look at this as similar to transferring a credit from another university,&rdquo; said Joel Thierstein, executive director of the open-source education project Connexions. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t get a course at your university, you go to another one and move the credit over.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>&hellip;Or Perhaps the Future is (almost) Free?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Gill Smith; COL;</em> <em>Stephen Downes; Rebecca Ferguson; Jane Hart; Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>Universities in Australia, Canada and New Zealand, backed by UNESCO, are planning to launch an <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=415127">OER university</a>, drawing together existing free online learning materials from around the world and developing new OERs to create whole degree programmes that can be studied online for free.&nbsp; Allowing for assessment costs, it is hoped that these degrees could cost up to 90 per cent less than a traditional qualification gained through on-campus study.&nbsp; And UNESCO&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.col.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=123">Sir John Daniel</a> speculates on whether the future of universities lies in teaching or research.</p>
<p>The African Virtual University (AVU) has launched an <a href="http://oer.avu.org/">Open Education Resources portal</a> with resources in English, French and Portuguese.</p>
<p>Version 0.9 of <a href="http://sociallearn.open.ac.uk/">SocialLearn</a> is now live and staff and research students with an OUCU are invited to join a pre-release trial.&nbsp; This is your chance to take a look at the SocialLearn toolkit, try it out and provide comments and suggestions &ndash; either informally or by completing a survey in March.</p>
<p><a href="http://instructionaldesignfusions.wordpress.com/2011/01/03/quora-a-social-network-built-for-learning/">Quora</a> is &ldquo;a continually improving collection of questions and answers created, edited and organized by everyone who uses it&rdquo;.&nbsp; Users of this learning-flavoured social network can connect to it using their existing Facebook or Twitter account.</p>
<p>And 19-year-old Dale Stevens is so unimpressed with life as a US undergraduate, he is launching an <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/disgruntled-college-student-starts-uncollege-to-challenge-system/29631">UnCollege</a>, hoping to encourage participants to pay $100 a month to access the college web site and a network of mentors.</p>

<p><strong>Who Has Pearson Bought This Month?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Giles Clark; Campus Technology; Wired Campus; Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Pearson has paid $127m for a controlling stake in <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/news/pearson-buys-controlling-stake-tutorvista.html">TutorVista</a>.&nbsp; The Bangalore-based educational technology company supplies content to over 3,000 classrooms across India and provides online tutoring to approximately 10,000 students per month.&nbsp; It also operates a network of 60 centres across southern India that support local schools and deliver English language courses for university entrance exams.</p>
<p>Twenty US colleges and universities are running pilots of a blend of course management functionality and textbook content.&nbsp; The integrated digital course system &ndash; a combination of <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/01/27/blackboard-and-mcgraw-hill-test-new-course-system-in-20-pilots.aspx">Blackboard&rsquo;s VLE and McGraw-Hill's Connect and Create</a> &ndash; offers a single point of access, learning tools, class content, customised textbooks (using faculty materials and McGraw-Hill content) and automatic grading.</p>
<p><a href="http://sophia.org/">Sophia</a>, a social teaching site with 38,000 registered users that describes itself as &ldquo;a mash up of Wikipedia, YouTube, and Facebook&rdquo;, has attracted funding from Capella Education, the corporation behind the online educator Capella University.&nbsp; And <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2011/02/09/an-independent-view-of-capella-university/">Tony Bates</a> links to two recent blog posts by Joshua Kim on Capella.</p>

<p><em>[eLearning Guild; Tim Seal]</em></p>
<p>McGraw-Hill plans to develop <a href="http://investor.mcgraw-hill.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=96562&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1520051&highlight=">mConnect</a>, an open-standard mobile learning platform designed to bridge the skills gap in emerging markets. &nbsp;Initial pilots will focus on the most critical needs for India's students and workers: test preparation for entrance into universities that will best prepare them for the workplace and English-language training, an increasingly essential skill in the global economy. &nbsp;Harold McGraw III said, &ldquo;In a country with more than 700m cell phones, mobile learning will help level the playing field for education in India in ways never before possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rapid Intake's new <a href="http://www.rapidintake.com/products/mobile/mobile-learning-studio/">mLearning Studio</a> will allow development of materials - including support for text, images, audio, video and multiple choice or true/false quizzes - in both Flash and HTML5 formats, allowing learners to access them on a computer or mobile devices such as iPhone, iPad, Android or Blackberry.</p>
<p>And the University of Kent&rsquo;s Zack Whittaker wonders if and why smart phones and m-learning are a <a href="http://newsletter.alt.ac.uk/g23n25yg6msxs0bzfbh4xk">technology that universities are trying to ignore</a>?&nbsp; In this ALT article, he considers the various applications, technologies, user preferences and potential hurdles.</p>

<p><strong>2011 Horizon Report</strong></p>
<p><em>[Educause; Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>Educause&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.educause.edu/Resources/2011HorizonReport/223122">2011 horizon report</a> was released last week, describing, &ldquo;six areas of emerging technology that will have significant impact on higher HE and creative expression over the next one to five years&rdquo;.&nbsp; Seeing e-books and mobile devices on the one-year horizon is no great surprise, but more interesting is the two-to-five-year category, containing augmented reality, game-based learning, learning analytics and gesture-based computing. &nbsp;So is it just a coincidence that <a title="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/02/08/blackboard-buys-into-data-analytics.aspx" href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2011/02/08/blackboard-buys-into-data-analytics.aspx">Blackboard</a> seems to be edging into data analytics and business intelligence, having recently acquired iStrategy?</p>
<p>I reported on the annual <a href="http://www.astd.org/TD/Archives/2010/Jan/Free/1001_eLearning_Whats_Old.htm">ASTD e-learning survey</a> last month but here&rsquo;s a bit more detail and commentary from Allison Rossett and James Marshall.&nbsp; They note that, despite obvious advances in technology and online connectivity, &ldquo;the habits identified in this study are not much different in 2009 than they were in 1989&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, a survey by the National Union of Students showed that 42.9% of students would like academics and teachers to make more use of technology.&nbsp; Lifelong Learning UK has published advice on <a href="http://www.lluk.org/england/embedding-technology-in-teaching-and-learning/">embedding technology in teaching and learning</a> in the form of a literature review, a 10 minute presentation and 2 minute video overview.&nbsp; They conclude that, &ldquo;peer to peer support is shown in our research to be far more effective than formal training&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Do Universities Really Teach Critical Thinking?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Donald Clark]</em></p>
<p>The Collegiate Learning Association (CLA) has released the findings of a four-year longitudinal study of over 2,300 students at 24 US institutions into <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2011/01/huge-study-do-universities-really-teach.html">what factors are associated with learning in HE</a>.&nbsp; Findings include: students typically spend just 16% of each week studying (vs 51% socialising); students who studied alone did better than those who studied in groups; students avoided courses that involved a lot of reading and writing; and they had made no significant improvements in critical thinking, complex reasoning and written communication.</p>

<p><strong>Education Pays</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Interesting chart from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on <a href="http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm">the value of different levels of education on salary and unemployment</a> plus some analysis and thoughts from <a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2011/01/25/on-the-monetary-value-of-an-education-and-bad-statistics/">Daniel Lemire</a>.&nbsp; He notes that &ldquo;ambition is probably a great predictor for income, irrespective of your level of education&rdquo;, although of course it could be that very ambition that leads people to pursue higher levels of education in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Collaborate to Compete</strong></p>
<p><em>[Ross MacKenzie]</em></p>
<p>HEFCE&rsquo;s online learning taskforce has released an issues paper subtitled <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/hefce/2011/11_01/">Seizing the Opportunity of Online Learning for UK HE</a>, which concludes that those UK HEIs prepared to make online learning a central focus will be able to develop responsive, engaging and interactive education that is both high quality and cost-effective, and hence remain globally competitive against the challenge from international and private providers.&nbsp; The report makes six recommendations including: use of online learning to enhance student choice and meet learners&rsquo; expectations; realignment of training and development to support academics to play a leading role in online provision; and the development and sharing of open educational resources to enhance efficiency and quality.</p>

<p><strong>Medical e-Learning Initiatives</strong></p>
<p><em>[JE; eLearn Magazine; BBC]</em></p>
<p>Forty eight <a href="http://www.biosciencetechnology.com/News/Feeds/2011/02/sections-international-news-students-take-a-bite-out-of-e-learning-with-apple-/">biological sciences students at the University of Leeds</a> have been issued with an iPad as part of a 3-month e-learning project which will study how students' use of iPad technology changes into their academic performance, study skills and overall student experience. &nbsp;The iPads are preloaded with a number of educational apps and multimedia content including e-books, an online encyclopaedia and biological models such as a 3D brain app.</p>
<p>Medical students at the University of Ottawa&rsquo;s Faculty of Medicine now have their curriculum for the first two years online, with PDAs largely replacing reference books, and employees at Ottawa Hospital have been encouraged to replace pen and paper notes with iPads.&nbsp; Transitioning from written to <a href="http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&article=152-1">digital examinations</a> seemed to be the next logical step and piloting is currently underway using QuestionMark software.&nbsp; With 150 students taking seven examinations, it is hoped that this will reduce the time and cost of preparing, completing, marking and reporting on approx 35,000 pieces of paper each year.</p>
<p>A new course from the University of East Anglia teaches <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12250471">breast cancer and breast reconstruction surgery</a> via a mix of 80% e-learning and just 20% practical skills. &nbsp;The online components include video lectures, seminars and group discussions, and all students are practising surgeons, so learn the practicalities of operating in their daily work. &nbsp;Assessment takes place throughout the length of the two-and-a-half year course and includes training days at the Royal College of Surgeons plus visits from local trainers who act as mentors.</p>

<p><strong>Who Owns Student Inventions?</strong><em> </em></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>A team of journalism students at the University of Missouri designed an iPhone app &ndash; NearBuy &ndash; which won first place in a competition and has been downloaded over a quarter of a million times since its release.&nbsp; The <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/iphone-app-raises-questions-about-who-owns-student-inventions/29265">students decided to assert their ownership</a> and to ask the university to waive any rights, arguing that student inventions, even if fostered to some degree by faculty mentors, stood apart from the work done by faculty members using university resources.&nbsp; Administrators ultimately agreed with the students but it required the institution to rewrite its intellectual-property policies.</p>

<p><strong>Best and Worst University Web Sites</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>A graduate of the Ricky Gervais school of diplomatic relations, UK Design Shack's Joshua Johnson has assessed <a href="http://designshack.co.uk/articles/graphics/best-and-worst-design-50-university-websites-from-50-states">fifty US university web sites</a> and is underwhelmed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Universities represent some of the highest concentrations of talented and intelligent individuals anywhere on the planet.&nbsp; These are institutions built around people literally engaging in lifelong education.&nbsp; They create amazing inventions, cure diseases, and move civilization forward in countless ways.&nbsp; So why can&rsquo;t they bust out a decent web design?&rdquo; &nbsp;The reason? &nbsp;&ldquo;Design by Committee.&nbsp; Two heads may be better than one, but ten to twenty heads gets you an ugly website.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Google Resources </strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>The Google Apps Marketplace, launched a year ago, now includes an <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/search?categoryId=25&orderBy=RATING&type=INSTALLABLE">education category</a>, aimed principally at Google&rsquo;s 10 million Google Apps for Education users.&nbsp; The current offering of around 20 apps has a distinct schools focus, although I note that it includes Aviary&rsquo;s excellent free suite of web content editing tools which works directly in Google Docs.</p>
<p>The eHow site contains 40 useful &lsquo;how to&hellip;&rsquo; videos explaining various aspects and <a href="http://www.ehow.com/videos-on_114_use-google-documents.html">features of Google Docs</a>.</p>
<p>As an example of what can emerge when you allow developers to spend 20% of their time on projects that interest them (what, no business case&hellip;?), Google has launched its <a href="http://www.googleartproject.com/">virtual art gallery</a>.&nbsp; Using the same functionality as Google street view, it allows users to explore 17 galleries including MOMA, Tate Britain, the Rijksmuseum and the Hermitage.&nbsp; A &lsquo;Create an Artwork Collection&rsquo; feature enables users to save specific views of any of the 1000+ artworks and build their own personalised collection.&nbsp; Comments can then be added to each painting and collections shared.</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s Good to Talk Technology</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus]</em></p>
<p>A LinkedIn group for college professors has grown into an online community with more than 6,000 participants, representing, &ldquo;all disciplines, functions, and levels within the higher-education ecosystem around the world&rdquo;.&nbsp; The <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/new-online-portal-lets-professors-talk-technology/29417">Higher Education Teaching and Learning Portal</a> (HETL) serves as a forum for professors to seek and share advice about teaching, and often about how (or whether) to bring technology into the classroom.</p>
<p>This is timely because e-Book publishers report that the biggest hurdle for greater adoption of <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/publishers-struggle-to-get-professors-to-use-latest-e-textbook-features/29683">interactive textbooks</a> is getting professors to use the new features.</p>

<p>ASTD&rsquo;s 2010 state of the learning and development industry report has been released and, whilst the full version will cost you $500, there is a <a href="http://www.astd.org/TD/Archives/2010/Nov/Free/1110_2010+State+of+the+Industry.htm">free synopsis</a>.&nbsp; ASTD reports continued growth despite the recession, with annual spend per head rising slightly from $1,068 (2008) to $1,081 (2009).&nbsp; Average cost per learning and development hour rose from $52 to $63 because the US workforce has shrunk while investment remained fairly static.&nbsp; 36.5% of learning is delivered/facilitated electronically and about three quarters of this happens online.&nbsp; &lsquo;Reuse&rsquo; has improved with, on average, each hour of learning content being used 59.5 times (versus 44.8 in pre-recession 2007).</p>

<p><strong>2010 (UK) Learning Technology Benchmark</strong></p>
<p><em>[Towards Maturity]</em></p>
<p>Towards Maturity has published its fourth <a href="http://www.towardsmaturity.org/article/2010/06/02/towards-maturity-2010-learning-technology-benchmar/">Learning Technology Benchmark survey</a> which, this year, features input from 400 organisations (35% public sector).&nbsp; The survey examines what successful organisations are doing to deliver business results with learning technologies and what others can learn from them.&nbsp; It finds that, amongst the top quartile, 76% of staff are using e-learning and, compared with conventional methods, e-learning is saving these organisations 21% in costs, 27% in study time and moving from idea/need to delivery 32% faster.</p>

<p><strong>Pearson to Offer Degrees?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Pearson, which already owns exam board Edexcel, hopes to be given degree-awarding powers.&nbsp; Universities Minister David Willetts has made no secret of his intentions to open up the university sector to more private providers, and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11990787">Pearson plans to offer degree courses</a> in business, engineering, IT and health and social care to begin with, at &ldquo;very competitive&rdquo; prices; it is also considering offering degrees in nursing, education and hospitality and tourism.</p>

<p><strong>How Does Phoenix Measure Up?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Tony Bates unpicks <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2011/01/02/how-does-the-university-of-phoenix-measure-up/">Phoenix&rsquo;s 2010 annual report</a> and, whilst he can&rsquo;t fault their profitability ($1.04bn pre-tax in 2009) or the opportunities provided for disadvantaged minorities, he is less impressed by some pedagogic aspects.&nbsp; He contends that &ldquo;prejudices against the University of Phoenix are misplaced&rdquo; but concludes, &ldquo;Overall, I would give the University of Phoenix a C+.&nbsp; It meets a real need, and sets and achieves realistic academic goals for the students it attracts, as far as it goes.&nbsp; However, it does not succeed in giving the majority of students who enrol what they are seeking, a degree in a reasonable amount of time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>PwC Open University Unveils Free Learning Material</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) has unveiled its own <a href="http://www.pwc.com/us/en/open-university/topic.jhtml">free online university</a> covering topics related to business, finance, healthcare and technology.&nbsp; The site is in its infancy and some topics contain only a single &lsquo;course&rsquo; with limited supporting material, but Stephen speculates that the UK HE funding situation may mean a PwC-branded MBA is not too far fetched.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Social Tools</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; James Davies; eLearn Magazine; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Richard Byrne has compiled a free 83-page online book of <a href="http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2010/12/super-book-of-web-tools-for-educators.html">tools for educators</a>, with descriptions of each and suggestions on how to use them.&nbsp; It has quite a schools bias but there are still plenty of useful lessons and links.</p>
<p>I mentioned the latest Pew Internet report on online activity last month, but Mashable presents a useful <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/12/16/generations-internet-infographic/">infographic showing how activity varies with age group</a>.&nbsp; Virtual worlds sit firmly in last place, with less than 9% of any age group participating, followed by blog publishing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the University of Minnesota&rsquo;s Michelle Everson thinks <a href="http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=opinion&article=156-1">all educators should consider blogging</a> - partly to record what worked and what didn&rsquo;t and also to form new professional relationships through the comments.</p>
<p>Whilst there is still no official Facebook app for the iPad, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/02/facebook-ipad-facepad">Facepad</a> app has just been released which includes some useful Twitter-like functionality.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Shy Students Using Facebook Have Better Quality Friendships</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS; OU Life]</em></p>
<p>There is speculation about the effectiveness of collaborative activities for shy students.&nbsp; To test this, Marquette University&rsquo;s <a href="http://spr.sagepub.com/content/27/7/873">Levi Baker and Debra Oswald</a> surveyed 207 undergrads about their shyness, Facebook usage and the quality of their friendships.&nbsp; They found that, among more shy students, greater use of Facebook was associated with feeling closer to and more satisfied with friends and feelings of a greater sense of social support.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our findings refute warnings that computer-mediated communication use might cause shy individuals to become even more socially withdrawn and isolated,&rdquo; the researchers said.</p>
<p>The OU ranks third in an evaluation of nearly 2,000 European universities employing social media recently published by <a href="http://www.scienceguide.nl/201012/top-10-of-social-media-in-he.aspx">ScienceGuide</a>, a Dutch news portal for research and HE.&nbsp; According to ScienceGuide, the OU has 8,700 Twitter followers and 35,000 Facebook members; more than 60% of all university Twitter followers are connected to UK institutions. They also account for 42.4 per cent of all Facebook members.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Students&rsquo; Web Use</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jakob Nielsen]</em></p>
<p>The Nielsen Norman Group conducted observational research with 43 students in 4 countries (Australia, Germany, UK and USA) to investigate <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/students.html">web site preferences and behaviour</a>.&nbsp; He found that students are multi-taskers who move through websites rapidly, often missing the item they come to find.&nbsp; They're enraptured by social media but reserve it for private conversations rather than studying or seeking corporate information.&nbsp; He also comments on two myths: firstly, students <strong>are</strong> comfortable with technology but that does <strong>not</strong> mean they are technical experts; and they <strong>do</strong> appreciate multimedia but they <strong>don't</strong> want to be blasted with motion and audio at all times.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Tablets and Digital Textbooks</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; NetworkWorld; JE]</em></p>
<p>This quite long post on the <a href="http://blog.xplana.com/2011/01/tablets-are-the-new-black-for-digital-textbooks/">Xplana blog</a> covers a lot of ground, including predictions of an explosion in tablet use by students (and a forecast graphic from Forrester Research), design issues and implications of the open source and rental e-textbook market.</p>
<p>Tablets were also hot news at last week&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/011011-ces-2011-in-summary-all.html">CES</a> in Las Vegas, with around 80 announcements of new devices &ndash; featuring a range of operating systems (including the latest Android 3.0 &lsquo;Honeycomb&rsquo;), screen sizes, resolutions and features such as hi-res cameras, slide out keyboards and docking methods.&nbsp; In contrast, the world of netbooks, notebooks and desktops was notable by the thin layer of dust and occasional tumbleweed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a book is worth reading, it&rsquo;s worth discussing.&nbsp; Copia is the place to do both.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.thecopia.com/home/index.html">Copia</a> allows users to browse and buy eBooks, then discuss them online with others.&nbsp; Creating a free account gives access to 7 eBooks, plus downloadable readers for PC, Mac and iPad.</p>

<p><strong>I Think, Therefore iPod</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>John Searle is well known in philosophy circles, having been teaching the subject since 1959.&nbsp; Now, those nice folks at Berkeley have recorded three of Searle&rsquo;s courses &ndash; <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2010/12/philosophy_with_john_searle_three_free_courses.html">the philosophies of language, mind and society</a> &ndash; and made them available online.&nbsp; They join a host of other materials, including over <a href="http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses">250 free online courses</a> on the Open Culture site.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed Space Shuttle Launch Video</strong></p>
<p><em>[Engadget]</em></p>
<p>NASA has released detailed slow-motion footage of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/12/nasas-space-shuttle-launch-videos-are-spectacularly-incredible/">space shuttle launches</a> with commentary from space programme experts. &nbsp;If you fancy seeing 45 mins worth of 1,000 gallons of fuel per second being burned from a gazillion different camera angles, this could be your lucky day.</p>
<p>The NASA site also contains an excellent <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/iotd.html">multimedia library</a> which includes videos, 3D models, podcasts and an image-of-the-day.</p>

<p><strong>iPhone App Translates Text in Images</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/world-lens-translates-words-inside-of-images-yes-really">Word Lens</a> is an iPhone app that can translate text in images from English to Spanish and vice versa.&nbsp; The $4.99 app uses OCR and, whilst not perfect, it performs reasonable word-for-word translation of signage, menus, etc.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Harder-to-Read Fonts Boost Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS]</em></p>
<p>Cutting across many investigations into the most readable fonts for onscreen learning comes research from Connor Diemand-Yauman and colleagues which suggests that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2010.09.012">awkward to read fonts encourage deeper processing of material</a>.&nbsp; 28 participants (aged 18 to 40) studied material in Arial, Comic and Bodoni, with the latter fonts yielding recall test scores around 15 percentage points higher than Arial.&nbsp; A second study with 220 Ohio high school pupils used fonts such as Comic, Haettenschweiler and Monotype Corsiva (plus handwritten notes that had been blurred by shaking in a photocopier) and these again yielded higher scores than plain fonts.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Learning and Forgetting</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Will Thalheimer has tried to unpick some of the myths surrounding <a href="http://willthalheimer.typepad.com/files/how-much-do-people-forget-v12-14-2010.pdf">remembering and forgetting</a>.&nbsp; He examined 14 previous studies dating back to 1917 and found the outcomes to be inconclusive in terms of defining any form of X% rule.&nbsp; However, there was strong evidence to suggest that methods of teaching and learning (structure, relevance, pace, clarity, reinforcement, etc) do have a positive effect on longer-term remembering.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>How Long Does it Take to Create eLearning?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Clive Shepherd]</em></p>
<p>Right up there with &lsquo;how quickly do people forget?&rsquo; comes &lsquo;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bchapman_utah/how-long-does-it-take-to-create-learning">how long does it take to develop e-learning?</a>&rsquo;.&nbsp; Bryan Chapman wanted answers so he asked 249 organisations with in-house development capability (6% H.E.) and gathered a surprising amount of detail.&nbsp; An average 1hr unit comprising simple content and questions typically took 79hrs to design, develop and test at an in-house cost of around $10,000.&nbsp; Greater interactivity and multimedia took this to 184hrs ($18k) whilst simulation and gaming was close to 500hrs ($50k).</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Crafting e-Curriculum That Inspires</strong></p>
<p><em>[JE]</em></p>
<p>Education Week has published the third in a series of reports on e-learning.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/collections/e-learning-2011-winter/index.html">Crafting e-Curriculum That Inspires</a> examines how US K-12 schools are working to create digital curricula and online courses, looking particularly at common-core academic standards, teaching social skills to virtual school students, blended learning and the evolving role of e-assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Nature Launches Open-Access Journal</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>The Nature Publishing Group is launching <a href="http://www.nature.com/srep/marketing/index.html">Scientific Reports</a>, an online open access journal covering biology, chemistry, physics and earth sciences.&nbsp; Like the Public Library of Science's PLoS ONE journal, Scientific Reports will be entirely open access and will publish every submission deemed by a rapid peer-review process to be technologically sound - including those reporting useful negative results.&nbsp; The importance of articles will be left to readers to judge via comments and metrics such as how often papers are downloaded, emailed and blogged about.&nbsp; Review, production and hosting costs are recovered via an article-processing charge (APC), currently set at &pound;890 but rising to &pound;1100 next year.</p>

<p><strong>Who Owns Your Digital Downloads? (Hint: It&rsquo;s Not You)</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/who-owns-your-digital-downloads-hint-its-not-you/2831?tag=nl.e539">Ed Bott</a> compares ownership rights of physical CDs and books versus digital downloads from iTunes and Amazon.&nbsp; Buried within those online terms and conditions that we all accept are clauses such as this from Amazon: &ldquo;You do not acquire any ownership rights in the Software or Digital Content as a result of downloading Software or Digital Content&rdquo;.</p>

<p><em>[Stephen Downes; eLearn Magazine]</em></p>
<p>Google Labs has come up with a <a href="http://bodybrowser.googlelabs.com/">human body</a> version of Google Earth, although it requires an HTML5-capable browser with WebGL (e.g. Chrome or Firefox 4) to run.</p>
<p>The Aarhus Social and Health Care College in Denmark is piloting a project called <a href="http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&article=144-1">BODYexplorer</a>, a dynamic, interactive, branching program aimed particularly at disadvantaged learners who may be more prone to suffer from lifestyle diseases such as obesity.&nbsp; Learners engage in an exploratory journey in the human body, travelling along the animated body's natural lines of the blood, lymph system, and nervous system, solving problems and challenges &ndash; such as imbalances, symptoms and other variables &ndash; along the way.</p>

<p><strong>iPad Changes the Educational Portable Computing Landscape</strong></p>
<p>Interesting record of an Educause conference discussion led by Rob Abel.&nbsp; About 15% of the 100+ audience believed that the <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/articles/nov2010iPad.cfm">iPad &ldquo;changes everything&rdquo;</a> &ndash; seeing great potential for the device in improving education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Ross MacKenzie]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to reserve judgement on the grounds that, in their time, radio, TV, 12&rdquo; laserdiscs, virtual reality and even Second Life were also going to change education beyond recognition.&nbsp; I think iPad is a design triumph, but it&rsquo;s a middle class device because that&rsquo;s how Apple has priced it (do you know any PC manufacturers who are making <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9150045/Apple_makes_208_on_each_499_iPad">52% profit</a> per box?) and it doesn&rsquo;t really offer much that&rsquo;s new, just different ways of doing things we could already do.&nbsp; iPad 2 will plug some feature gaps, but what may really &lsquo;change everything&rsquo; is the first decent iPad clone &ndash; because there are millions of people out there who want that functionality and convenience, but also want to pay &pound;100-&pound;200 less on the understanding that they may not be quite as cool.&nbsp; According to yesterday&rsquo;s Sunday Times, the Dixons/Currys <a href="http://www.dixons.co.uk/gbuk/Advent_Vega-1228-commercial.html">Advent Vega</a> (&pound;250, due soon) may be a good bet.</p>

<p><strong>Seven-year Costs of an Online Masters Programme</strong></p>
<p>Tony Bates has been investigating <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2010/10/25/open-content-and-the-costs-of-online-learning/">the costs of offering a fully online master's degree programme</a> from a &lsquo;major research university&rsquo; over seven years using open content. &nbsp;Of the $2.85m whole life costs, he estimates that 24% was planning and development, 9% maintenance, 36% delivery and 31% admin and overheads.&nbsp; These costs excluded technology, software and infrastructure.&nbsp; There were an average of 67 students per year and, whilst the programme broke even in year 3, it took until year 7 to recover the early-years&rsquo; deficit.</p>
<p>For those currently pursuing OERs, empty boxes and wrap-arounds, Tony notes that, &ldquo;Open content is not going to lead to major cost savings in online learning. &nbsp;Even without creating new content, someone will have to select, assess and modify open content, or provide some kind of curriculum framework or guide for students studying a subject or topic.&rdquo;&nbsp; Furthermore, &ldquo;If we want to bring the costs of online teaching down without sacrificing quality, we need to focus on administration and overheads.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>OU eBooks Available on iTunes</strong></p>
<p>The Telegraph reports that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/expateducation/8096232/Open-University-makes-e-books-available-on-iTunes.html">the OU has made 100 eBooks available via iTunes</a>, with a further 200 to follow by the end of the year.&nbsp; For some reason, the newspaper thinks this will be of particular appeal to the expat community who, according to the photograph, are easily distinguished by their inability to fit headphones properly.</p>

<p>Oxford has also made <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/shakespeares-first-folio/id400639473">Shakespeare's First Folio</a> - 36 texts, including their original spelling -available in ePub format on iTunes.&nbsp; The university has also made available six plays by contemporaries of Shakespeare, including The Duchess of Malfi by John Webster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Librarians were urged at a conference at the British Library last month that they must &ldquo;change the behaviour of academics to &lsquo;<a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=414052">stop them craving books</a>&rsquo; as libraries shift their focus to digital resources&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, concerns were also expressed about the value of the virtual library: Cambridge&rsquo;s Prof Mary Beard described libraries as social places where she had been known not only to eat, but also to have sex and get drunk.&nbsp; Now I understand what those giant bean bags are for&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/rdreports/2010/rd18_10/rd18_10.pdf">Student perspectives on technology &ndash; demand, perceptions and training needs</a> has been produced for HEFCE by the NUS.&nbsp; It provides an overview of the level of demand from new and potential students for online learning in UK HEIs, plus students&rsquo; perceptions of that learning.&nbsp; Highlights include: 90.1% (<em>N=</em>213) agreed that the internet has benefited their studies, although 43.3% preferred to use a combination of both printed and electronic resources for their work.&nbsp; Opinion was divided over whether mobile phones or PDAs should be used to assist learning &ndash; 37.3% agree, 35.4% disagree and 27.4% remain neutral. &nbsp;There was dissatisfaction over what/how ICT is used: 42.9% would like academics and teachers to use ICT more; VLE content should be updated more frequently and PowerPoint and Smartboards were viewed as &lsquo;outdated&rsquo;.</p>

<p>A related report (both with the Online Learning Task Force hovering in the background) is Oxford&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/rdreports/2010/rd17_10/rd17_10.pdf">Study of UK Online Learning</a> which concludes that the majority of ODL offered by UK HEIs is at Masters level.&nbsp; The report includes a number of case studies, including the OU, and qualitative findings include the view that &ldquo;technology was described as vital but not central&rdquo;, &ldquo;The inherent advantages of ODL as a mode of delivery for students in full-time work was identified&rdquo; and &ldquo;In many cases, ODL offerings have evolved from a &lsquo;cottage industry&rsquo; style approach with developments led wholly at departmental level.&nbsp; While this approach was seen to have many benefits, not least ensuring academic quality and promoting innovation, it was also seen as a challenge and a potential barrier to expanding provision.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ukprwire.com/Detailed/Business/SURVEY_SHOWS_THE_RISE_OF_VIDEO_IN_LEARNING_113778.shtml">Video is increasingly being incorporated into e-learning courses</a> to engage learners and improve learning effectiveness, according to a new survey by commercial supplier Video Arts.&nbsp; Of 535 learning professionals surveyed, 83% use video in classroom-based training courses. Video is also used in their organisations for short pieces of bite-sized learning (52%); for informal learning (34%); to support one-to-one coaching (25%); in self-authored e-learning courses (22%) and for mobile learning (7%).&nbsp; 79% of learning professionals source their video content by buying it off the shelf; 39% shoot their own video clips and 19% use external providers to custom-create their video content.</p>

<p><strong>Changing Educational Paradigms</strong></p>
<p>I mentioned the compelling <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rsa+animate&aq=0">RSA Animate</a> series of illustrated expert talks a few months ago and I&rsquo;ve also plugged <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">Sir Ken Robinson&rsquo;s TED Talk</a> on creativity in education.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtube_gdata_player&v=zDZFcDGpL4U&gl=GB">Changing Education Paradigms</a> combines both into a clip that&rsquo;s well worth 11 minutes of your time.</p>

<p><strong>Life on Earth</strong></p>
<p>Wired magazine reports that the $5bn-per-year college textbook industry remains 99 percent paper-based, but a new 59-chapter digital biology textbook, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/wilson-free-biology-textbook/?goback=.gde_1515307_member_32881991#ixzz13WAoV74Z">Life on Earth</a>, aims to change all that by including rich media (such as animations and video interviews with Nobel laureates), interactivity and Web 2.0 services.&nbsp; Production costs are estimated at around $10m, although the project currently has funding for just 10% of that.&nbsp; K-12 distribution will be free of charge, partially offset by a small fee (estimated at about 10% the cost of a comparable printed book) for university use.&nbsp; Chapter 1 &ndash; cell division &ndash; should be available within a few weeks.</p>
<p>[Tony Bates]</p>
<p>However, a survey of 627 US campus students found that 76% would <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/students-remain-reluctant-to-try-e-textbooks-survey-finds/27866">pick a printed book over an e-textbook</a> if the choice was left entirely up to them (no change on last year).&nbsp; About 13% of the students said they had purchased an e-book in the past three months, but most did so because a digital edition was required by their professor.&nbsp; The survey found that only 8% own an e-reader device such as a Kindle or Sony Reader.&nbsp; The most popular device listed for electronic reading was the iPhone.</p>

<p><strong>The Future According to Moodle and Blackboard</strong></p>
<p>Interesting 7 min video from Jeff Young featuring interviews with Moodle&rsquo;s Martin Dougiamas and Blackboard&rsquo;s Ray Henderson on how they each see <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/video-face-off—moodle-v-blackboard/27865">the future of their LMS</a>.&nbsp; Conclusion?&nbsp; Future learning is destined to be even more collaborative, instant and mobile.</p>

<p>One serious restriction on eLearning in India is the lack of computers.&nbsp; Devki Infonet aims to overcome this by moving into the franchising business, whereby communities of learners come together in one classroom, sharing one large screen.&nbsp; The Institute of Cost and Works Accountants of India, the Institute of Company Secretaries of India and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India are now offering classes through <a href="http://www.livemint.com/2010/09/17194422/Edyounet--Easy-virtual-learni.html?h=B">Edyounet</a> and have established 15 franchisees with an average of 20 students per centre.</p>

<p><strong>Online Degrees and Online Dropouts</strong></p>
<p>The Times Higher believes <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=413647">the face of higher education will change for ever in 15 years</a> and JISC reports that <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/online-degrees-set/to-soar-in-the-UK/prweb4551754.htm">online degrees are taking off in the UK</a>, helped by a push from government and increasing tuition (and living) costs.&nbsp; Contributions in this press release include commentary from the OU&rsquo;s Niall Sclater and Leicester&rsquo;s Gilly Salmon.</p>

<p>A new study by Kennesaw State University finds that <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/blogPost-content/27108/">students drop out of online classes</a> at rates 15-20% higher than traditional ones.&nbsp; Using undergraduates in a business course, professors experimented with: calling students at home; quizzing them on the syllabus; helping to steer them through the virtual classroom; encouraging them to develop personal connections with classmates; and breaking them into small groups for discussions and team projects.&nbsp; Half the students got this extra attention and half didn't &ndash; and it made no difference to dropout rates. Thy repeated the experiment and got the same results.&nbsp; &ldquo;If someone was going to drop out of the class, they were going to drop out of the class,&rdquo; says Stacy M.

<p><strong>How to Put Universities Out of Business</strong></p>
<p>Robert Cosgrave writes on <a href="http://tertiary21.blogspot.com/2010/09/how-to-put-universities-out-of-business.html">how to put universities out of business</a>.&nbsp; He looks at what they do (generate graduates), why they do it (to help employers filter potential recruits) and he then considers what would happen instead if universities didn&rsquo;t exist.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a bit simplistic (I always thought universities dabbled in a bit of research as well) but there is some food for thought.</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>Talking of food (I know, these links are priceless&hellip;) SHM consultant Paul Gillooly suggested at the OECD's Institutional Management in Higher Education conference that <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20101008113849939">universities should be run more like supermarkets</a>.&nbsp; But David Staley, speaking at this week&rsquo;s Educause conference, thinks <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/what-if-we-ran-universities-like-wikipedia/27612">universities should be run like Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently, there&rsquo;s much more to social media than your teenage kids telling all their mates that they&rsquo;re &ldquo;really fed up&rdquo;.&nbsp; Charities and social-good organisations have seen tangible benefits, such as Red Cross which used text messages to raise $5 million in relief funds for Haiti.&nbsp; Mashable has put together five examples of <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/09/15/5-trends-social-good/">trends for social good</a>, plus commentary on how things might go in the future.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/social-networking-can-bring-students-stress-as-well-as-connection-survey-finds/27526">technology and mental health poll</a> of 2,207 undergraduates at 40 US colleges reveals that social media do not always have positive effects.&nbsp; For instance, 40% say they have at least 500 friends on Facebook but hardly interact with most of them.&nbsp; About 90% said they used Facebook and sent text messages to friends in the previous week and 60% said that if someone failed to respond immediately, they puzzled over why.&nbsp; About a quarter said they would be relieved if they shut off their cellphones and computers, while 57 percent said a social-media blackout would make them more stressed.</p>

<p><strong>University iPad Programs Get Mixed Response</strong></p>
<p>Several universities have recently experimented with providing <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/blogPost-content/27046/">free iPads to students</a>, with mixed early results now starting to emerge.&nbsp; At George Fox University, Oregon, only 10% of freshmen opted for iPads, with 90% choosing MacBooks and this has made it hard for lecturers to integrate them more fully into the curriculum; limitations on iPad multi-tasking and printing have also caused problems.&nbsp; Seton Hill University has rolled out iPads plus an e-book app called <a href="http://www.inkling.com/">Inkling</a> which allows students to access interactive graphics and add notes as they read along; faculty members can access the students' marginalia to see whether they understand the text and they can also remotely receive and answer questions from students in real time.</p>

<p><strong>First UK Private University in Decades to be Created</strong></p>
<p>Universities minister David Willetts has cleared the way for the UK's first new <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10756830">private sector university</a> for more than 30 years by allowing London-based BPP - part of the group that owns the University of Phoenix - to become a university college.&nbsp; BPP has 14 regional branches offering law and business degrees; it now plans to expand into health and teaching degrees.&nbsp; The UCU warned that an expansion of the private sector would be a &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; and that the creation of a new private university was the &ldquo;beginning of a slippery slope&rdquo;.</p>
<p>[BBC]</p>
<p>The Times Higher describes <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=412473">StraighterLine</a> as the &ldquo;Ryanair&rdquo; of university instruction.&nbsp; It offers no-frills courses designed by former professors that can be provided at students' convenience and transferred towards degrees at other institutions.&nbsp; They are delivered online and feature collaborative study groups and live tutorials, with advisers available via email.&nbsp; Each course costs only $39 plus $99 a month for the duration.&nbsp; StraighterLine would not disclose specific data but claims its enrolment equalled that of a small university less than six months after commencing full operations.&nbsp; It has also just announced a partnership with Thompson Rivers University in Canada.</p>

<p>In Brazil, Pearson is taking a &pound;326m stake in the learning systems division of Sistema Educational Brasilerio (SEB).&nbsp; The deal will more than double the size of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/epic/pson/7905172/Pearson-takes-326m-stake-in-Brazil-education-group.html">Pearson's education business in Brazil</a> and includes an agreement that will ensure that SEB's remaining schools and higher education institutions remain &ldquo;major customers&rdquo; of Pearson.&nbsp; Pearson said Brazil is one of the world's largest education markets with 56m students and an educational materials market valued at about $2bn.</p>

<p>The idea that online learning is a &ldquo;poor substitute&rdquo; for campus provision is a myth, according to Dame Lynne Brindley, chief executive of the British Library and chair of the UK's <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=412768">Online Learning Task Force</a>.</p>

<p><strong>US Colleges Hire Companies to Build Their Online Courses</strong></p>
<p>The Chronicle reports that, &ldquo;As more colleges dip their toes into the booming <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Outsourced-Ed-Colleges-Hire/66309">online-education business</a>, they're increasingly taking those steps hand-in-hand with companies like Embanet.&nbsp; For non-profit universities trying to compete in an online market aggressively targeted by for-profit colleges, the partnerships can rapidly bring in many students and millions of dollars in new revenue.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, there are concerns that the quest for profits will compromise standards (e.g. multiple-choice exams).&nbsp; According to Tony, &ldquo;Underlying all this is the belief that online teaching is second rate and therefore can be contracted out without loss to the institution.&nbsp; Big mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Tony Bates]</p>
<p>Tony also reports an article in Inside Higher Ed which looks at whether institutions should focus primarily on <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/07/23/online">local markets for online students</a>.&nbsp; A 2008 Sloan Consortium study found that, &ldquo;Institutions believe that online will open up their enrolments to more students from outside of their normal service area [&hellip;] However, the reality is that this has not yet occurred in any large numbers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Richard Garrett, managing director of Eduventures, says that in routine surveys his firm has done over the last three years, roughly 65 percent of online learners have said they prefer an institution with a physical presence within 50 miles.&nbsp; See also <a href="http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/DefaultFiles/SendFileToPublic.asp?ft=pdf&FilePath=c:\\\\\\\\Websites\\\\\\\\ccrc_tc_columbia_edu_documents\\\\\\\\332_796.pdf&fid=332_796&aid=47&RID=796&pf=Publication.asp?UID=796">Effectiveness of Fully Online Courses for College Students</a> by Smith-Jaggars &amp; Bailey (2010).</p>

<p><strong>Bill Gates On Online Learning</strong></p>
<p>On p9 of his <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/annual-letter/2010/Pages/education-learning-online.aspx">2010 Annual Letter</a>, Bill Gates describes the potential for online learning and also gets to the heart of a growing problem: the fact that there's more and more of it out there. &nbsp;This makes it increasingly difficult to know whether the link you're about to follow will lead to something at the level or quality you need, so it looks like the Gates Foundation may be about to fund some investigation into standards.</p>
<p>[JE]</p>
<p>He also spoke on the subject at the recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/06/bill-gates-education/">Techonomy</a> conference, claiming that, &ldquo;Five years from now on the web for free you&rsquo;ll be able to find the best lectures in the world.&rdquo; &nbsp;He also noted that western textbooks are three times longer than the equivalents in Asia, often because they are written by committee, meaning that more things are simply added on top of what&rsquo;s already in there.</p>

<p><strong>OU Course Production, 1971</strong></p>

<p><strong>Young Students Flock to OU</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/jun/29/open-university-young-students?&CMP=EMCEDUEML1210">A quarter of new OU students are aged 17-25</a>, a 36% increase on last year, according to this very positive article in The Guardian.&nbsp; Tuition and accommodation fees plus the shortage of campus-based university places are regarded as significant factors in this trend.</p>
<p>[Pete Mitton]</p>
<p>Donald Clark picks up on this and weighs in with some <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com/2010/06/ou-key-to-future-of-he.html">passionate support for the OU</a> and how it operates (&ldquo;the single greatest education institution in the UK&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s shameful is that other universities haven&rsquo;t taken the model more seriously&rdquo;). &nbsp;Also interesting is some of the discussion that follows Donald&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>[JE]</p>
<p>Further positive commentary from the BBC on the OU being the first to reach <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/10446141.stm">20 million downloads from iTunesU</a> &ndash; that&rsquo;s 8% of the 250 million worldwide total from all educational providers.&nbsp; George Siemens wonders, &ldquo;Does OU see a return on its investment in creating and sharing resources via iTunes?&rdquo;&nbsp; Answers on a postcard&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Blackboard Buys Elluminate</strong></p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t sue them, buy them?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/07/08/blackboard">Blackboard</a> has announced that &ldquo;Elluminate, Wimba, and Blackboard will join forces to bring together the leading technology products for synchronous learning and collaboration.&rdquo;&nbsp; The takeover cost Blackboard $116m and the new company will be called Blackboard Collaborate.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s the OU roadmap looking, Niall?</p>

<p><strong>UK Public Lukewarm on e-Readers</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to urge caution over educational technology without appearing to be a Luddite.&nbsp; For that reason, I&rsquo;ve been quietly questioning whether we&rsquo;re all getting a bit carried away with iPhones, Kindles, iPads and other cool devices.&nbsp; Yes of course we have to investigate the possibilities and how we could deliver and support them at scale &ndash; but what does the typical student on the Clapham omnibus really want?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/in-depth/feature/119078-reading-the-future-2010.html">The Bookseller</a> recently worked with consultancy The Next Big Thing to investigate how 3,000 British book-buying consumers engage with books.&nbsp; Highlights include: only 26% of respondents had ever heard of a Kindle and only 41% knew what a Sony Reader was, although 60% had heard of the iPad.&nbsp; A combined 70% said they were &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; (36.8%) or would &ldquo;definitely not&rdquo; (32.3%) buy an e-reader in the coming year.</p>
<p>[Giles Clark]</p>
<p>On a similar theme, even if students are happy to use new technologies, there is a limit to their enthusiasm.&nbsp; <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Reflections-on-Teaching-with/24556/?sid=wc">Brian Croxall</a> reflects on his experiences of getting students to use Web 2.0 gizmos such as Google Docs, Twitter, Wave, Wikis and Zotero: mainly positive but beware of &lsquo;tool fatigue&rsquo;.&nbsp; And, as Stephen notes, &ldquo;you can't just take these new technologies and cram them into an old-word course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>Perhaps <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2010/06/22/kno-to-launch-higher-ed-specific-e-reader.aspx">Kno</a> is the answer: an e-Reader developed specifically for the HE market.&nbsp; An autumn release is planned and the twin-colour-screen wi-fi device will support Flash, HTML5, PDF and ePub formats.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.kno.com/index.html">promo video</a> suggests it&rsquo;s worth looking out for, although no mention yet of price or battery life.</p>
<p>[Campus Technology]</p>
<p><a href="http://worldebookfair.org/">WorldeBookFair.com</a> claims to hold 3.5m eBooks that can be read or downloaded. &nbsp;This is free until 4 Aug and then $8.95 per year thereafter.</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>But where would any eBook be without its animated &lsquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/08/microsoft-tries-to-patent-virtual-page-turning-technique–should-apple-be-worried/">page-turn</a>&rsquo;?&nbsp; Standby for pistols at dawn as Microsoft claims to own the patent.</p>

<p><strong>Tablets to Become Dominant</strong></p>
<p>Forecaster, Forrester Research, is predicting that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/17/forrester-tablets-outsell-netbooks">tablet sales</a> in the US will overtake netbook sales by 2012, and desktops by 2015.&nbsp; They expect 3.5m tablets to be sold this year (although I note that iPad sales have already topped 2m), growing to 20.4m in 2015.&nbsp; The predicted shape of the 2015 market is: 17% netbooks, 18% desktops, 23% tablets and 42% laptops.&nbsp; No mention of e-Readers, so perhaps Forrester thinks they&rsquo;ll have come and gone by 2015&hellip;?</p>
<p>[TechCrunch]</p>

<p><strong>Jeff Bezos's mission</strong></p>
<p>Much like the OU of a few years ago, Amazon is discovering it&rsquo;s no longer the only game in town.&nbsp; They reported profits of $299m in the last quarter but the threat from Barnes &amp; Noble and others has seen them reduce Kindle prices from $259 to $189.&nbsp; Despite this, founder Jeff Bezos remain upbeat about new markets and different devices, as this <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/06/29/jeff-bezos’s-mission-compelling-small-publishers-to-think-big/">CNN/Fortune interview</a> shows.</p>
<p>[Giles Clark]</p>
<p>Amazon is to start selling new e-books that come embedded with audio and video.&nbsp; &nbsp;It will also shortly offer a product called <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/amazon-to-launch-web-based-book-previews/">Kindle Previewer for HTML 5</a> that will allow readers to view samples of books directly from within a Web browser.</p>
<p>[Giles Clark]</p>

<p><strong>Digital Objects</strong></p>
<p>The latest issue of Chicago&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/issue/view/315">First Monday</a> journal is devoted to digital objects.&nbsp; This includes a paper from LSE which seeks to, &ldquo;&hellip;develop <a href="http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3033/2564">a theory of digital artefacts</a>.&nbsp; The venture assumes that digital technologies of all varieties and breeds share a limited set of qualities that places them apart from other non&ndash;digital devices and systems (paper&ndash;based) for managing information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Google Maps</strong></p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s a thing.&nbsp; A group of programmers have written a program that takes London Underground source data to display animated real time (more or less) <a href="http://traintimes.org.uk/map/tube/">Underground train positions overlaid on a Google map</a>, and then they give the code away.&nbsp; Whatever happened to capitalism?</p>
<p>[Jonathan Fine]</p>
<p>Take a Google map and let people pin their historic photos to it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where <a href="http://www.historypin.com/">Historypin</a> comes in.&nbsp; The site is still in beta but it&rsquo;s a nice idea, currently let down only by the lack of photos &ndash; but I guess that&rsquo;s where we come in&hellip;</p>
<p>[George Siemens]</p>
<p>Or, if you&rsquo;re more into charts than maps, Tony reports that Google has been busy with those too, with additional support for <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/docs/gallery/compound_charts.html#embeddedcharts">compound and embedded charts</a>, plus an API to render <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/docs/gallery/formulas.html">TeX formulae into web images</a>.</p>

<p><strong>An Introduction to Social Media</strong></p>
<p>If you thought Ning, Jing and Dimdim were characters from the Mikado, you really need Jane Hart&rsquo;s excellent <a href="http://c4lpt.co.uk/academy/ism/index.html">Introduction to Social Media</a>.&nbsp; It not only explains and gives examples of numerous different tools but, being social, it also allows you to record your own experiences and ideas.</p>
<p>[Jane Hart]</p>
<p>Nobody does lists of lists quite like Jeff Cobb, and that includes his recent guest post from Karen Schweitzer, <a href="http://www.missiontolearn.com/2010/06/lifelong-learning-social-networks/">20 Social Networks for Lifelong Learners</a>.</p>

<p><strong>RSAnimate</strong></p>
<p>RSA has come up with a compelling series of animated videos.&nbsp; Take some presentations by notable thought leaders &ndash; such as Dan Pink talking about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc">drive, motivation and reward</a>; or Prof Philip Zimbardo on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3oIiH7BLmg">the secret powers of time</a> &ndash; and play the audio over a time-lapsed sequence of animated text and imagery of the key points.&nbsp; Very well done and quite compelling.</p>

<p><strong>US Online Study </strong></p>
<p>A recent US study found that <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2010/06/blackboard_online_learning_rep.html">27% of high school students</a> were enrolled in at least one online course in 2009, up from 14% enrolled in 2008.&nbsp; Online learning also appears to run in the family: students with a parent who had taken an online course were twice as likely to take or explore taking their own virtual course. And more parents than ever &ndash; 33% &ndash; reported having enrolled in an online course for work or pleasure.</p>

<p><strong>HTML5</strong></p>
<p>Interest in HTML5 is now extending well beyond the programmer community.&nbsp; For those newbies amongst you, it&rsquo;s not just a newer version of current HTML &ndash; it will allow multimedia and greater interactivity to be built into sites without the need for separate apps and plugins.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a simple <a href="http://www.focus.com/images/view/11905/">graphical summary</a> (including a comparison with Flash), Microsoft has some demos on their <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/">IE9 test drive site</a> and there&rsquo;s a 50 min <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdDc7sWjCL4&feature=channel">video overview</a> from Google&rsquo;s Brad Neuberg.</p>

<p><strong>Sixty Symbols</strong></p>
<p>The University of Nottingham&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.sixtysymbols.com/">sixty symbols</a> site contains &lsquo;videos about the symbols of physics and astronomy&rsquo;, including a fascinating description of how to filter out the sound of vuvuzelas from our world cup commentary.&nbsp; But if you also want to know about Hanny's Voorwerp or Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat, these short videos are quite compelling.</p>

<p>The University of California has called time on its subscription to <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/U-of-California-Tries-Just/65823/">Nature magazine</a> (and 66 others from the same stable) after its publisher announced plans to raise the cost of California's license for its journals by 400 percent next year.&nbsp; The university is also encouraging academics to refrain from submitting or reviewing further papers and to resign from editorial boards.</p>

<p>Nearly 65% of teaching staff and students have used an e-book to support their work, study or leisure, according to the JISC national e-books observatory project.&nbsp; Now, further work funded by JISC-TechDis has investigated how to help disabled readers use e-book resources effectively.&nbsp; A practical guide, <a href="http://www.techdis.ac.uk/resources/files/e-books leaflet final.pdf">Towards accessible e-book platforms</a>, advises on aspects such as how to control magnification, colour change, keyboard access and text to speech.</p>

<p>You may remember that one of the drivers behind Amazon&rsquo;s larger screen Kindle DX was to hit the education market.&nbsp; However, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2011938870_kindle24.html">recent trialing of the DX</a> at the University of Washington has revealed disappointing results.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don't read textbooks in the same linear way as a novel,&rdquo; said one 23-year-old, &ldquo;you have to flip back and forth between pages, and the Kindle is too slow for that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amongst MBA students at the University of Virginia, 80% said they would not recommend the $490 device as a study aid.</p>

<p><strong>University of California Goes (Grudgingly) Online</strong></p>
<p>Elite US universities have avoided online education, but the <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/In-Crisis-U-of-California/65445">University of California</a> want to break that mould, with plans to spend $5m+ on a pilot project that could clear the way for the system to offer online undergraduate degrees and push distance learning further into the mainstream.&nbsp; Some diehards oppose the plans whilst others wonder why it&rsquo;s taken so long; for example, more than half of the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s 53,500 students already take at least one online course each year.</p>

<p>A new <a href="http://www.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/display.asp?k=5KSCG4J39DHB&lang=en">OECD report</a> analyses to what extent investments in technology enhance educational outcomes.&nbsp; One of the most striking findings is that the digital divide in education goes beyond the issue of access to technology (less than 1% of 15-year-olds in the 30 OECD countries has never used a computer).&nbsp; A second form of digital divide has been identified: the one existing between those who have the right competencies to benefit from computer use, and those who do not.&nbsp; (Follow the &lsquo;look inside&rsquo; link for a full version but with limited functionality).</p>

<p>Interesting 15-min TED<sup>x</sup>NYED talk from Brigham Young&rsquo;s Prof David Wiley about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb0syrgsH6M">openness in education</a>, in which he argues that knowledge should be treated as non-competitive, &ldquo;I can give some of my expertise to you without giving it away&rdquo;.&nbsp; He also contends that, in a digital online world, we&rsquo;ve never been in a better position to do this.</p>

<p>A survey by the US eLearning Guild has shown <a href="http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/111/">Moodle to be the most popular LMS/VLE</a> for the second year running, followed by Blackboard.&nbsp; Desire2Learn and Sakai, both about to be included in a <a href="https://in-tendhost.co.uk/openuniversity/">learning platform study for the OU</a>, don&rsquo;t make the listing.</p>

<p><strong>US Students Take Longer to Gain Degrees</strong></p>
<p>A report from the US National Bureau of Economic Research has found that the <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w15892">time taken to achieve a BA degree has increased</a> from a mean of 4.69 years in 1972 to 4.97 years in 1992.&nbsp; Looking at non-top-50 universities, the mean time to graduate is 5.08 years, with only 34.7% achieving a BA within four years.&nbsp; The report attributes this not to students&rsquo; abilities or the quality of their schooling, but more to worsening staff:student ratios and the need for students to conduct paid work alongside their studies in order to cover tuition and living costs.</p>
<p>[Tony Bates]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100507211002996">Separate research</a> by professors Philip Babcock and Mindy Marks found US students in 1961 spent an average of 40 hours per week on academic work but, by 2003, that had fallen to just 27 hours.&nbsp; Marks believes there may be two factors influencing this: first, professors want more time for research so they set less work; second, students give better course evaluations to easier courses.</p>

<p>According to this latest <a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Teens-and-Mobile-Phones.aspx?r=1">Pew Internet report</a>, 75% of US 12-17 year-olds now own cell phones, up from 45% in 2004, and 88% of teen cell phone users are text-messagers.&nbsp; 54% of teens are daily texters, with a third sending more than 100 messages per day and girls texting much more than boys.&nbsp; Of those who own smartphones:</p>
<ul>

<p>And a study by the University of Maryland suggests that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2010/04/23/technology/tech-us-internet-addicts-life.html">US students are hooked on cellphones, social media and the Internet</a> and showing symptoms similar to drug and alcohol addictions.&nbsp; 200 students were asked to give up all media for one full day and, after 24 hours, many showed signs of withdrawal, craving and anxiety along with an inability to function well without their media and social links.</p>

<p>[The Xplanation]</p>
<p>Researchers in Ohio looked at 2,000 students enrolling in 14 psychology courses across the state who were given the option of purchasing a print copy of their textbook for $134 or an e-text version for $50.&nbsp; They found 22% purchased the e-text &ndash; some for economic reasons, but 41% of these reported <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2010/04/22/u-cincinnati-and-ohiolink-research-digital-textbook-adoption.aspx">preferring a digital textbook to the printed version</a>.&nbsp; Traditional-aged college students were 1.73 times more likely to purchase the electronic text than students 24 years or older.</p>

<p>The Blackboard dispute over LMS/VLE patents may have recently reached a conclusion, but a number of LMS companies now find they are being sued by IPLearn, a group which periodically seems to file claims under the questionable <a href="http://trends.masie.com/archives/2010/3/29/613-government-and-learning-lawsuits-hit-lms-field-again.html">Business Process Patent</a> statue, a decade ago.&nbsp; Elliott believes IPLearn may be on shaky ground.&nbsp; For example, they claim invention of this from 1999: &ldquo;A method and a system to teach a user a subject based on his questions. &nbsp;The system allows the user to control his learning process, and helps to fill in gaps of misunderstanding in the subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gasp.&nbsp; Does this mean we&rsquo;ll have to pay royalties on &lsquo;sitting with Nellie&rsquo;?</p>

<p>Parents of Year 8 pupils at Davison High School in Worthing are being asked to contribute to the costs of <a href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/5070136.Worthing_school_asks_parents_to_buy_children_iPads/">Apple iPads</a>, which the school wants every Year 9 pupil to use in lessons as part of its new eLearning project, beginning in September. &nbsp;In the letter, the school's deputy headteacher said: "As a technology college we believe in the power of electronic learning tools such as laptops, netbooks and tablet PCs and the difference they can make to achievement in school."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Impact-of-the-Internet-on-Institutions-in-the-Future.aspx">Pew Internet</a> has surveyed 895 internet experts and other internet users and found that 72% agreed with the statement: &ldquo;by 2020, innovative forms of online cooperation will result in significantly more efficient and responsive governments, business, non-profits, and other mainstream institutions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many respondents also elaborated with written explanations that expressed significant concerns over organization&rsquo;s resistance to change.&nbsp; The consensus among them was that businesses will transform themselves much more quickly than public and non-profit agencies</p>

<p><strong>Links Between Internet Use and Loneliness</strong></p>
<p>A longitudinal survey of 754 people showed that, as web browsing increased from 2004 to 2005, their <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2009.11.002">loneliness also tended to increase</a>.&nbsp; Increased forms of web communication, instant messaging, chat rooms and news groups (but not email) also went hand in hand with increased loneliness.&nbsp; Finally, more web browsing over time was linked with reduced life satisfaction, whilst more non-email web communication over time was linked with reduced life satisfaction.&nbsp; However, the researchers note that increased loneliness may well encourage people to spend more time online, rather than web time causing loneliness.</p>

<p>Remember the Leitch report, from back in the days when funding was plentiful and tweets were what Jonathan Ross bought his kids?&nbsp; Richard Lambert, director general of the CBI, says that the ambitions set out in the <a href="http://www.trainingjournal.com/news/2746.html">Leitch report</a> - that the UK should be in the upper quartile of OECD countries for skills by 2020 - are &ldquo;wishful thinking&rdquo;.&nbsp; Speaking to delegates at the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) <em>Skills, Jobs, Growth </em>convention, Lambert said the global skills challenge had changed beyond recognition as a result of both economic and social factors.&nbsp; [TJ Online]</p>

<p><strong>Credibility of Online Degrees</strong></p>
<p>The old chestnut of &lsquo;real degrees&rsquo; pops up with monotonous regularity although, with <em>Business Weekly</em> reporting in Jan that the US is home to 810 bogus universities, perhaps the doubters have a point.&nbsp; Indiana University&rsquo;s <a href="http://elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&article=112-1">Craig Howard</a> has been teaching online for two years and sees things differently.&nbsp; He thinks a lot of the problem lies in perceptions: people expect online learning to be shorter, easier to learn and easier to cheat.&nbsp; [eLearn Magazine]</p>
<p>University of South Florida&rsquo;s ECampus supports more than 84,000 enrolments in 2,000-plus distance learning modules each year.&nbsp; Executive director, Kathleen Moore, believes there are <a href="http://www.usnewsuniversitydirectory.com/four-myths-online-experience.aspx">four myths about e-learning</a>: it will be easier than classroom; there won&rsquo;t be much interpersonal activity; students fear their lack of technical skills (&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t upload my paper&rdquo; is becoming the new &ldquo;dog ate my homework&rdquo;); and employers won&rsquo;t rate it as a &lsquo;real&rsquo; degree.&nbsp; [JE]</p>

<p>Responding to veiled threats from Grainne Conole, I&rsquo;ve created a presence on Cloudworks so you can now follow the <a href="/cloudscape/view/1967">e-Learning Digest Cloudscape</a> which will be updated each month.&nbsp; This brings the added benefits that (a) non-OU staff can get easy access and (b) readers can enter the Web 2.0 world of comments and discussion.&nbsp; And while you&rsquo;re there, why not take a look around?&nbsp; I believe some of the stuff on Cloudworks written by other people is quite good as well.</p>
<p>Has Grainne hired Max Clifford?&nbsp; &lsquo;<a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100123090752488">E-learning expert urges caution and balance</a>&rsquo; profiles some of her current thoughts and work, &ldquo;There is too much hype around technology,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp; &ldquo;It needs to be more critical.&nbsp; You have to be aware that there are always pros and cons.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Haiti 360</strong><strong>&deg; Video</strong></p>
<p>Be patient with this one because it gobbles bandwidth, but it is worth the wait.&nbsp; Essentially it&rsquo;s a 3 min clip from a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2010/01/world/haiti.360/index.html">camera car driving through Port-au-Prince</a>, but the car is capturing 360&deg; panoramic data along its route, meaning the point of view can be changed and zoomed with a mouse drag and the clip paused at any point.&nbsp; The educational possibilities for taking virtual exploration beyond fixed-point QTVR are surely too good to be missed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>One consistent flaw with most panoramic images (including those from Haiti) are the image degradation as soon as you try to zoom in for a close-up.&nbsp; Jeffrey Martin spent 4 hours last Oct taking 600 high definition pictures of <a href="http://www.360cities.net/prague-18-gigapixels">Prague from the top of its TV tower</a> which he then stitched together to create a single panoramic image of 192,000 pixels by 96,000 pixels, offering extraordinary levels of detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Children who are heavy users of <a href="http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/news.cfm/newsid/14">mobile phone text abbreviations</a> are unlikely to be problem spellers and readers, a new study funded by the British Academy has found, surprising many who believe that textisms are vandalising the English language.&nbsp; Dr Clare Wood of Coventry University studied a sample of 8-12 year olds over an academic year, finding that levels of &ldquo;textism&rdquo; use could even be used to predict reading ability and phonological awareness in each pupil by the end of the year.&nbsp; &lsquo;Phonological awareness&rsquo; refers to a child&rsquo;s ability to detect, isolate and manipulate patterns of sound in speech. &nbsp;For example, children who can tell which words rhyme, or what word is left if you remove a letter, have particularly high levels of phonological awareness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Kaiser Family Foundation in the US has just released <a href="http://www.kff.org/entmedia/mh012010pkg.cfm">Generation M<sup>2</sup>: Media in the Lives of 8- to 18-Year-Olds</a>, based on a survey 2000 people.&nbsp; Lots of food for thought, including the fascinating fact that young people spend an average of 7:38 consuming media each day (up from 6:21 five years ago), but manage to pack in 10:45 worth of media content because of multitasking.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>McGraw Hill Brings Higher Ed Content to Dualbook</strong></p>
<p>Last month&rsquo;s digest brought news of the new <a href="http://www.entourageedge.com/">enTourage eDGe</a> interactive dualbook that combines an e-book reader, notepad and tablet netbook in one device.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/releases/education/20100105.shtml">McGraw-Hill Education</a> has announced a strategic alliance with its makers, enTourage Systems, to deliver McGraw-Hill's HE content to the device.&nbsp; Students purchasing McGraw-Hill titles will not only be able to read the text, but take and share notes online, search for phrases, listen to accompanying audio and view images and video in full colour.&nbsp; McGraw-Hill will make nearly 100 of its top-selling HE titles available for purchase through the enTourage Systems' e-book store, spanning disciplines such as business, economics, science, math, humanities, foreign languages and social sciences.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>eLearning Growth in HE</strong></p>
<p>A new report from the <a href="http://www.quickanded.com/2010/01/steady-long-term-trends-rule-the-world.html">Sloan Consortium</a> shows a steady rise in student enrolments in eLearning classes. &nbsp;Over 4.6 million (US) students were taking at least one online course during the fall 2008 term.&nbsp; This represents a 17% increase over the previous year and far exceeds the 1.2% growth of HE students overall.&nbsp; Even if you&rsquo;re not interested in the report, it&rsquo;s worth watching Kaplan&rsquo;s US TV commercial, which sadly didn&rsquo;t make the 2010 Oscar shortlist.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BBC Technology Principles</strong></p>
<p>The BBC has published a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/img/Technology_Strategy_Public_Master_FINAL_25_01_10.pdf">Technology Strategy document</a> which outlines the direction for technology activities within the corporation for the next two to five years.&nbsp; Author <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2010/01/bbc_technology_strategy_princi.html">Spencer Piggott</a> writes, &ldquo;The world has changed and technology is increasingly at the fore of everything the corporation does.&nbsp; There has been a fundamental shift in the pace of change of both business (think cloud computing) and consumer technologies (iPhone/notebooks); alongside this of course there has been a massive change in audience behaviour in line with these developments.&nbsp; The fact is we can't rest on our laurels; this new direction is a response to these internal and external demands on the BBC.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you replace the words &lsquo;corporation&rsquo;, &lsquo;audience&rsquo; and &lsquo;BBC&rsquo;, it seems to have a ring of OU-ness about it.</p>

<p><strong>You Can Lecture, But Can You Teach?</strong></p>
<p>Eric Sotto argues that protests against the idea that <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=410056">academics be given teacher-training</a> are misguided.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is generally agreed that people whose work affects the wellbeing of others must possess a qualification that attests to their competence to do this work.&nbsp; Thus anyone who prescribes a medication, fits a gas cooker or advises on investments must hold a relevant qualification.&nbsp; But there is one exception.&nbsp; People who teach at a university clearly affect the wellbeing of students, but they are not required to hold a qualification that attests to their competence to teach.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Researchers and Technology</strong></p>
<p>JISC is undertaking a 3-year longitudinal study of doctoral students to see how they approach research tasks.&nbsp; The latest interim <a href="http://explorationforchange.net/attachments/054_Summary Report Final.pdf">Researchers of Tomorrow</a> report is based on responses from more than 5,400 doctoral students, 38% of whom belong to Generation Y (born between 1982 and 1994).&nbsp; Highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>80% of doctoral students were looking for secondary materials, especially published works, rather than raw data sets and archives of primary sources.</li>
<li>Google and Google Scholar were the starting points for nearly a third of successful searches, while one in seven used a citation database.&nbsp; Around half of respondents (and more amongst engineering and computing researchers) reported using wikis, which the report assumed probably meant &lsquo;wikipedia&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Less than a third had received any formal training in a range of online research methodologies, including use of online datasets, access to online alert services and data mining skills</li>
<li>73% of researchers still download or print materials (or both) for later reference, but nearly half read or scan the information while online. </li>

<p>Stephen mentions this set of <a href="http://techhappy.wordpress.com/2009/12/21/">60 links</a>, all aimed at kids and mostly covering fairly predictable ground such as maths, grammar and basic science.&nbsp; However, I was particularly intrigued by MSNBC&rsquo;s arcade game, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24056447">Newsbreaker</a>.&nbsp; The aim is to engage kids by playing a classic &lsquo;block breaker&rsquo; game, collecting and then reading news stories.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I found I was so busy moving the paddle to hit the ball that most of news stories floated gracefully off the screen before I could read their title.&nbsp; Dreadful design, or sad no-hoper at the controls&hellip;?</p>

<p>Typical.&nbsp; You wait ages for something on user-generated content and then two come along together.&nbsp; Ari-Matti Auvinen&rsquo;s paper on <a href="http://www.elearningeuropa.info/files/media/media21212.pdf">Quality in peer-produced eLearning content</a> describes some production approaches and principles, and proposes a validation approach based on peer review.&nbsp; Stephen suggests that critical readers would be more effective, &ldquo;You can't set up an educational system by vetting the quality of every resource; it's just too labour-intensive. &nbsp;But if you prepare your readers to assess resources for themselves, you can make a much larger body of resources available to them.&rdquo;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>HE Funding Cuts</strong></p>
<p>More details of the latest 'Mandelson cuts' emerged over the Christmas break. &nbsp;These are in addition to the &pound;600m cuts to HE set out in the pre-Budget report, prompting warnings that <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=409782&c=1">&pound;915m (12.5%) is to be slashed</a> from the sector over three years, equating to about &pound;190 per student.&nbsp; [THE]</p>
<p><strong>Laptops for All </strong></p>
<p>Gordon Brown pledged this week to provide &pound;300m for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jan/11/gordon-brown-free-laptops-broadband">free laptops and broadband access</a> for low income families as part of the government's guarantee that all parents will be able to access school reports about their children's progress online &ndash; by 2010 for secondary schools, and 2012 for primary schools.&nbsp; Speaking to an international education forum, he said: &ldquo;We want every family to become a broadband family, and we want every home linked to a school.&nbsp; For those finding it difficult to afford this, today I can announce the nationwide rollout of our home access programme to get laptops and broadband at home for 270,000 families.&nbsp; It will mean all families can come together, learn together and reap rewards together.&rdquo; &nbsp;[Guardian]</p>
<p>I can think of various political comments it would be unwise to make here, so let&rsquo;s try a simple economic question: is this really the best way to spend &pound;300m right at the moment?</p>
<p><strong>Tories Pledge on Vocational Training</strong></p>
<p>Shadow skills minister John Hayes is backing a rethink on <a href="http://www.trainingjournal.com/news/2634.html">vocational training</a>, claiming his party would work to dispel the myth that academic learning was more important than practical achievement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most academic learning at least to first degree level is derivative,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most creative learning and most practical learning, at a much more fundamental level, requires some degree of originality.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s put to rest once and for all the myth that book learning is the only way that people find fulfilment.&rdquo;&nbsp; [Training Journal]</p>
<p>The Tories have also pledged to delay the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=409991&c=1">research excellence framework</a> (REF, the planned replacement for RAE) by up to two years if elected.&nbsp; [THE]</p>
<p><strong>iTunesU Breaks 100m Downloads</strong></p>
<p>iTunesU has reached a new milestone, recording more than <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10418611-37.html">100 million downloads</a>, since its launch in 2007.&nbsp; According to Apple, one of the most popular areas of iTunes U has been that of the Open University, whose learning categories include Arts and Humanities, Business and Management, Childhood and Youth, Health and Social Care, Law, Psychology, and Science.&nbsp; More than 175 HE organizations currently provide content to iTunes U, including Princeton, UCLA, Harvard, MIT, Oxford and Yale.&nbsp; [Pete Mitton]</p>
<p><strong>CES 2010</strong></p>
<p>The Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was awash with product launches last week. &nbsp;Look out for:</p>

<p><strong>Nexus One </strong></p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s Android-based <a href="http://www.google.com/phone">Nexus One</a> (&ldquo;phone meets web&rdquo;) was launched in a blaze of glory and media hype.&nbsp; The BBC&rsquo;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8442205.stm">Rory Cellan-Jones</a> reports from Google HQ and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/05/google-nexus-one-the-techcrunch-review/">TechCrunch</a> also gives a comprehensive review.&nbsp; The <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.1.html">Android 2.1 SDK</a> is now also available for download.</p>

<p><strong>One Laptop Per Child Update</strong></p>
<p>One laptop per child (OLPC) is approaching its third birthday. &nbsp;Uptake of the XO-1 has been patchy and it never hit the $100 target cost, but a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8428147.stm">touch screen tablet - the XO-3</a> - is planned for 2012 and should cost "well below $100". &nbsp;[BBC]</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Sponsors Innovative Teaching and Learning Research project</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has announced that its <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/13/microsoft-innovative-teaching-research">Partners in Learning</a> program is sponsoring the Innovative Teaching and Learning (ITL) research project, led by SRI International . &nbsp;The global research program intends to &ldquo;broadly investigate&rdquo; the effects that ICT has in transforming teaching and learning at the school and education system level. &nbsp;Microsoft says it will invest $1 million annually in the multi-year study in partnership with the governments of Finland, Indonesia, Russia and Senegal.&nbsp; [TechCrunch]</p>
<p><strong>The Future for Education</strong></p>
<p>Lord Puttnam is amongst a group of worthies behind a new initiative to try and change the way we think about education.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.wearethepeoplemovie.com/">We Are the People We&rsquo;ve Been Waiting For</a> website but the jewel in the crown is a 77min documentary for which, curiously, you have to send away for a DVD.&nbsp; I have done and I found it well made and thought-provoking - but I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking that the very people who will watch this film are likely to be those who don&rsquo;t need much convincing.&nbsp; My quote-of-the-movie comes from US teacher, Rebecca Mead, &ldquo;School systems that have standardised tests are no longer educating students; they&rsquo;re teaching students how to take tests.&nbsp; At the end of the day, you&rsquo;re not going to have a multiple-choice job.&rdquo;&nbsp; [JE]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although his production quality doesn&rsquo;t quite reach Puttnam standards, George Siemens sings from a similar hymn sheet in his 9 min video, asking <a href="http://www.masternewmedia.org/how-to-design-schools-and-a-new-education-system-for-the-future/">is it possible to de-school society?</a></p>
<p>According to the New York Times, &ldquo;an American kid drops out of high school at an average rate of one every 26 seconds.&nbsp; In some large urban districts, only half of the students ever graduate.&nbsp; Of the kids who manage to get through high school, only about a third are ready to move on to a four-year college.&rdquo;&nbsp; This matches one of the many messages in &lsquo;We are the people&rsquo; and, in a bid to create a new generation of educational leaders, Harvard is launching a three year, tuition-free doctorate which will include a final year field placement.&nbsp; It will initially offer places on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/05/opinion/05herbert.html?_r=1&sudsredirect=true">Ed.L.D</a> to just 25 candidates.&nbsp; [Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>Lev Gonick considers the year ahead for <a href="http://blog.case.edu/lev.gonick/2010/01/06/2010_the_year_ahead_for_it_in_higher_education">IT in Higher Education</a> (key words: funding; bleak).&nbsp; And &lsquo;Democracy&rsquo; brings a long article from Kevin Carey on <a href="http://www.democracyjournal.org/that_old_college_lie.html">that old college lie</a>, reminding us that colleges &ldquo;&hellip;see themselves as occupying an exalted place in human society, for which they are owed deference and gratitude.&nbsp; They cherish their priests and mysteries, and they are disinclined to subject either to public scrutiny.&rdquo;&nbsp; [George Siemens]</p>
<p>And a salutary EdTech lesson from Korea, where the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology has spent about $250 million to install <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/12/117_57559.html">65-inch electronic blackboards</a> in 256 middle and high school classrooms across the country, only to find they are little used because of a lack of suitable content.</p>
<p><strong>Wiley Joins 150 Publishers in the Scribd Store</strong></p>
<p>Wiley has joined Simon &amp; Schuster, Barnes &amp; Noble, O&rsquo;Reilly and many others to offer eBooks in the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/15/scribd-store-wiley">Scribd Store</a>, which lets people embed and share documents in a Flash viewer.&nbsp; Scribd has been partnering with publishers since March to also sell downloadable digital versions of their books.&nbsp; These are available as PDFs, and excerpts can be shared through the Scribd reader. &nbsp;This strategy (and a similar model from DocStoc) is seen as a counterweight to the closed Kindle store.&nbsp; [TechCrunch]</p>
<p>Spring Design, developer of the dual-screen <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/05/spring-design-google-alex-ereader">Alex eReader</a>, has struck a deal with Google that gives users access to more than 1m Google Books.&nbsp; The device, just launched, is a Google Android-based platform with Web browser, Wi-Fi connectivity, audio and video playback and image viewing in a variety of formats.&nbsp; [TechCrunch]</p>
<p>Ray Kurzweil is coming at eBooks from a different direction by presenting a platform rather than a physical device.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/12/blio-ray-kurzweil-book/">Blio software</a> is free and available currently for PCs, iPod Touch and iPhone.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have high-quality graphics and animated features.&nbsp; Other e-readers are very primitive,&rdquo; says Kurzweil.&nbsp; One of Blio&rsquo;s major advantages over current e-book readers is that the software offers a full color experience as opposed to e-Ink&rsquo;s monochrome, and text-to-speech is built in.&nbsp; [Pete Mitton]</p>
<p><strong>BBC Allows Free Access to Journalism Training Resources</strong></p>
<p>The BBC has long provided a range of free and very good online training materials on sites such as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/learning/onlinecourses/">BBC Learning</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/skillswise/">Skillswise</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/revision/">Bitesize</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/raw/">Raw</a>.&nbsp; But now, the BBC Academy is making previously &lsquo;internal&rsquo; resources from its <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/journalism/skills/">College of Journalism</a> available to the public (and therefore its competitors), giving free access to training materials, tips and masterclasses from journalists such as Jeremy Bowen, Robert Peston and John Humphrys.&nbsp; [People Management]</p>
<p><strong>3D Worlds</strong></p>
<p>I don't normally post links to slides on the grounds that you often 'had to be there'; however, for Jane Hart, I'll make an exception. &nbsp;Jane is most well known for her ever-growing list of <a href="http://c4lpt.co.uk/Directory/">learning tools</a>, currently approaching 2,000 (1,400 of which are free), and her presentation on <a href="http://c4lpt.co.uk/articles/oeb3d.html">3D worlds</a> from last month's Online Educa conference showcases top sites and tools specifically for creating avatars and 3D environments.&nbsp; [JE]</p>

<p><strong>Rant of the Month</strong></p>
<p>Ewan McIntosh blogs about Patrick Dunn&rsquo;s <a href="http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2010/01/elearning-video-game-designers.html">four pointers to the chasm between eLearning and video game designers</a>, but he is so wrong.&nbsp; If there is truth in any of the four pointers, it relates to: (1) an eLearning industry of 10 years ago, and when internet connections were made along wet string; (2) so called &ldquo;e-learning&rdquo; developed by software or video companies without a learning designer in sight; or (3) something that&rsquo;s been cobbled together by an enthusiast with a tool &ndash; which allows me to wheel out my all-time favourite quote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all well and good to introduce a technology that enables the man in the street to give vent to his creative ability, but what if he does not have any?&rdquo;&nbsp; (John Barker (1993), &lsquo;Training for multimedia&rsquo;, <em>Inside IT</em> (74) p15)</p>

<p>Denise Blake reflects on the experience of <a href="http://elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&article=105-1">teaching her first online M.Ed</a> in the US.&nbsp; No big surprises, but some useful references to why and how adults engage in higher education.&nbsp; [eLearn Magazine]</p>
<p><strong>Understanding HE Data</strong></p>
<p>The US Institute for HE Policy (IHEP) has just published <a href="http://www.ihep.org/assets/files/publications/s-z/(Report)_The_Spaces_Between_Numbers-Getting_International_Data_on_Higher_Education_Straight.pdf">The Spaces Between Numbers: Getting International Data on Higher Education Straight</a>, which seeks to answer four questions about data used in comparing higher education in the US with that in other countries, particularly the 30 advanced post-industrial democracies that are members of the OECD.&nbsp; What did they find?&nbsp; They found a mess because, perhaps not surprisingly, countries collect, analyse and report data differently.&nbsp; [Stephen Downes]</p>
<p><strong>in education</strong></p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s University of Regina presents <a href="http://ineducation.ca/article/editorial">in education</a>, a new peer-reviewed, open access journal which, in its first issue, covers topics such as blogged assignments, cyber-bullying, and the impact of Web 2.0 on control of learning in HE.&nbsp; [Stephen Downes]</p>
<p>Also new is <a href="http://journal.elnet.com.au/index.php/impact/">Impact</a>, the journal of applied research in workplace e-learning from Australia.&nbsp; Issue 1 covers heutagogy and e-learning, connectivism, and knowledge in a connected world, amongst many other varied topics.&nbsp; [ALT]</p>
<p><strong>Analysing Networked Learning Practices in HE and CPD</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Chris Jones is co-editor of a new book, <a href="https://www.sensepublishers.com/product_info.php?products_id=943">Analysing Networked Learning Practices in Higher Education and Continuing Professional Development</a>, part of Sense Publications&rsquo; Technology Enhanced Learning series.&nbsp; Yours for just $49, or you can preview the first two chapters free of charge.&nbsp; [ALT]</p>
<p><strong>Adventure Learning</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/755">Adventure Learning</a> (AL) is an approach for &ldquo;the design of digitally-enhanced teaching and learning environments grounded in experiential and inquiry-based education&rdquo;.&nbsp; This paper in Athabasca&rsquo;s IRRODL reviews the adventure learning literature and describes current practice and future opportunities.&nbsp; [IRRODL]</p>
<p>Also, in the same issue, a <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/741">Review of Distance Education Research (2000 to 2008)</a> based on analysis of 695 published papers.&nbsp; [IRRODL]</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Internet Report </strong></p>
<p>Morgan Stanley presents an extremely comprehensive report on the rapidly changing <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/institutional/techresearch/mobile_internet_report122009.html">mobile internet market</a>.&nbsp; The full 424 page version is about 50Mb in size, but can be downloaded in sections or as a slide show.&nbsp; [George Siemens]</p>
<p><strong>World Map of Social Networks</strong></p>
<p>Remember the days when large swathes of the world atlas were coloured pink?&nbsp; Well green is the new pink, as this <a href="http://www.vincos.it/world-map-of-social-networks/">world map of social networks</a> shows how Facebook dominates the English speaking nations, with over 350m subscribers.&nbsp; QQ is the dominant force in China, where the number of Internet users is expected to double to 840m by 2013.&nbsp; [TechCrunch]</p>
<p>According to The Telegraph, 20 per cent of all <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/6857918/Facebook-fuelling-divorce-research-claims.html">divorce petitions</a> now contain references to Facebook.&nbsp; Mark Keenan, MD of Divorce-Online says the most common reason seems to be people having &lsquo;inappropriate chats&rsquo; with people they were not supposed to.&nbsp; [Telegraph]</p>
<p><strong>Digital Archive</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/dec/11/bbc-british-library-digital-archives">BBC and the British Library</a> are collaborating on a project to open up the institutions' archives, with the aim of giving the public greater online access to a vast cultural treasure trove.&nbsp; They hope to provide access to the British Library's archive of more than 150m items collected over the past 250 years, as well as nearly 1m hours of TV and radio output from the BBC, which has been broadcasting since 1922.&nbsp; [Giles Clark]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2009/12/bufvc.aspx">British Universities Film and Video Council</a> (BUFVC) last month called on universities and colleges to take urgent action to safeguard hundreds of thousands of hours of archive TV and radio programmes, many of them stored on VHS cassettes and taking up close to 20 km of shelving across all academia.&nbsp; [JISC]</p>
<p><strong>Learning Styles and Manuals</strong></p>
<p>The very mention of learning styles can be the educational equivalent of lobbing a hand grenade into a crowded room.&nbsp; <a href="http://mikecaulfield.com/2009/12/16/learning-styles-and-manuals/">Mike Caulfield</a> offers a slightly different angle: &ldquo;Rather than argue about whether we should tailor specific instruction to learning style, presumably so students can better regurgitate material into blue books, why not create environments that function more like the real world, where differences in problem-solving style are the strength of teams and communities (and marriages) &ndash; places where the planners can plan and the hackers can hack? &nbsp;That means project-based, collaborative education, education that helps students answer much more pressing questions than the stuff on the test. &nbsp;Stuff like how they might design their place in life better by understanding both their strengths and limitations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Discuss.&nbsp; [Stephen Downes]</p>

<p>An enterprising Indian organisation set up the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/02/google-school-googlle/">Googlle Institute of Software Studies</a>, complete with a very familiar looking logo.&nbsp; A few days later, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/10/googlle-google-logo/">the logo had changed</a> but the name remained.&nbsp; So, will students be beating a path to their door?&nbsp; Probably not as quickly as Google&rsquo;s lawyers.&nbsp; [TechCrunch]</p>
