<p class="Paragraph SCXW67448036">Building up a portfolio of evidence is an established assessment process for a range of qualifications and is particularly suited to many vocational&nbsp;subjects&nbsp;where it is necessary to demonstrate skills and competencies&nbsp;(Wagner, 1998).&nbsp; Traditionally, portfolios have been paper-based, with folders of handwritten and printed evidence being collated for assessment and verification by awarding bodies.&nbsp; However, over the past ten years, many qualification providers have adopted the use of electronic or e-portfolios, enabling computer-based collation and&nbsp;assessment&nbsp;of evidence&nbsp;(Beetham, 2005).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Universities are in constant transformation adapting to new global trends. In the scenario of disabilities, the university has still the challenge of giving value to permanent changes since the implementation of the European Higher Education (EEES). In this sense, due to its methodological characteristics, the UNED has always attended the highest number of university students with disabilities and consequently has created has the University Disability Assistance Centre (UNIDIS) to support these students. <br />A strong point to assure the inclusion of students with disabilities is the assessment process. The evaluation of learning must be adapted by diverse ways to guarantee the equity and performance. Sometimes this process generates some dissonances with the normative precepts established to achieve "usual" purposes. In this sense, the main objective of our research is to analyse the elements (believes, values, practices, attitudes ...) that determine the subjectivity of students with disabilities through adaptations in their assessment at UNED. <br />We present some main lines that place us in the process to evaluate needs to support adaptations for students with disabilities at UNED and the advances in our research.</p>]]></description>

<td colspan="2" valign="top">
<p>Open Essayist, developed by The Open University, UK, seeks to provide automated reflective feedback to learners on draft essays. The underlying idea is to present a computer-based analysis of the most important parts and key words in the writing, so that learners can compare those to what they intended to convey, and adjust their writing in the light of that comparison. Importantly, no summative judgement is made of the essay.</p>
<p>Learners upload their draft essay, and the system then generates a series of different views based on analysis of the text, including: the most prominent words and a graphical view of their distribution through the text; the key sentences in the text, with hints to aid reflection; and a graphical view of the structure of the essay.</p>
<p>The tool is intended as a formative, developmental tool rather than for summative assessment.</p>

              <title>Peer assessment: development of experience from e-LATE(D)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8877</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8877</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>e-LATE(D)</strong><br />&ldquo;Elearning and Teaching Enhancements (for Social Sciences)&rdquo; (e-LATE(D)) is intended for social science faculty staff to familiarise them with the techniques and pedagogy of online learning. It is 14 weeks long, and is in its fourth presentation (Jan 2015). Participants are invited to create a learning activity or modify one for online delivery. A link between this and Openpad is now being piloted.</p>
<p><strong>Peer assessment</strong><br />The activity is peer reviewed and then modified taking the peer reviews into account. (We use the term &ldquo;peer review&rdquo; to distinguish the less or more formal activity of providing critical comments from the activity of providing a mark.)</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong><br />Building on the obvious popularity of the peer review approach, the e-LATE(D) team obtained funding under the New Models of Assessment and Tuition Programme to research the experience of the participants and suggest guidelines for future work with undergraduates. Outputs of the research were:<br />- a literature review<br />- report on questionnaire and interview data from participants<br />- practice guidelines<br />- a suggestion for a pilot at level 1.</p>
<p>The outputs can be found at the e-LATE(D) Peer Assessment home page. (https://intranet7.open.ac.uk/collaboration/strategic-plan/study/assessment/scholarship_projects/peer_assessment/SitePages/Home.aspx)</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />The research found a high degree of engagement and satisfaction with the peer review process the participants had conducted on e-LATE(D). The experience was reported as thought-provoking, and gave many participants the opportunity to reconsider and in some cases rejuvenate their own teaching practice, as well as gaining new insights into teaching and learning processes, in particular the experience of being a learner. A number of themes emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li>uncertainty and anxiety, associated with working outside of the participants&rsquo; &lsquo;comfort zone&rsquo;</li>
<li>understanding of the need for thorough preparation for both tutors and students, including a clear pedagogical rationale for the process as well as clear practical guidelines for activities</li>
<li>despite uncertainty, the process was viewed as positive and helpful and developmental, focussing the participants on long term learning goals and on better learning practices, as well as on the subject-based content of the assignment projects</li>
<li>new relationships emerging between student and student, and between student and tutor, producing the possibility of deeper understandings of the learning as a collaborative process</li>
<li>greater engagement with the idea of independent learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Literature review</strong><br />The review covered the pedagogical purposes of peer assessment, questions of design, the effects it has and its effectiveness in enabling independent learning, the validity, authority and fairness of such assessment, tools (intellectual, technological and physical), and possible differences between formative and summative peer assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Questionnaire report</strong><br />The questionnaire covered the overall experience of the participants and their experience of different types of assessment, both in the OU and at other institutions; their experience of preparation for the e-LATE(D) peer assessment exercise; their experience of the exercise itself; their feelings of engagement with the task, and its effects on the collaborative process in general. The conclusion is quoted here:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The responses from our 17 respondents illustrate many of the pedagogic and practical issues that teachers consider in developing and conducting assessment. All were experienced assessors, yet many felt to some degree apprehensive, even scared, by the demands of an unfamiliar process, mirroring what many undergraduate students feel. The importance of good preparation is emphasised, along with a clear framework, supportive oversight by the moderator / tutor, and a system dealing with breakdowns in the process. For many their view of the purpose of assessment was not changed, but their appreciation of nuances and of how good assessment can be achieved was affected. In terms of the wider learning outcome of developing students as part of a learning community, there was some evidence that the peer assessment activities achieved this: (in response to Q 4.1) &ldquo;I thought it would be a hassle, but it made me care more about eLATE(D) as a whole&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These responses will underline our appreciation of both the practical and pedagogic issues surrounding peer assessment and the shape we give to the proposal for a pilot scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Interview report</strong><br />Follow up interviews with a subset of those who responded to the questionnaire covered uncertainty, expertise, being an assessor, being a student, the peer experience, and preparation. We discovered that what being a peer assessor does for the student is central to the process. Several participants referred to learning more through assessing (and through the related practice of monitoring). They acquired a different, more rounded view of what the peer assessment activities and the staff development module as a whole are trying to achieve. The following exchange sums up the process well:</p>
<p>Interviewer: &ldquo;[H]as your experience of assessment on e-LATE(D) changed the way you approach your own teaching and learning in general ... You&rsquo;ve put in your comment &lsquo;much more reflective&rsquo;. You sound like a pretty reflective person actually, so has it really made you much more reflective?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Participant: &ldquo;Yes it has; it really did change how I felt about what I do. I have always been careful about how I write [feedback] because as I said I have taken a distance learning degree with the OU myself, but &hellip; that was way back and I sort of forgot a little bit what it felt like and it made me revisit that and you know it was really good. It made a huge difference actually&rdquo;</p>
<p><br /><strong>Practice guidelines</strong><br />A three page summary of practice guidelines covers the forms and purpose of peer assessment, preparing the assessment strategy, how to build the marking scheme and how to organise the activity. These guidelines are indebted to RMIT's (2008), &lsquo;Self and Peer assessment&rsquo;. (http://mams.rmit.edu.au/71ra0k9io8yzz.pdf)</p>
<p><br /><strong>Pilot proposal</strong><br />A pilot proposal was produced. The proposal is intended for use in a level 1 social science module but could be adapted to any level and any faculty. The proposal covers the process, the learning outcomes, the marking scheme, tutor preparation, student preparation, and timing of the activity. The proposal included several resources: <br />- an introductory note for tutors<br />- sample material for introductory session for tutors<br />- an introductory note for students<br />- sample material for introductory tutorial for students (includes separate ppt resource)<br />- a review framework for students<br />- example scripts for peer assessment exercise (Example A used in screencast &ndash; see 7)<br />- a review example screencast for students</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Title:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Using ePortfolio's for the collection and management of assessment evidence in KS3.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Narrator:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">A technology teacher and coordinator with an interest in the role of eportfolio systems in educational development (KS3- KS4), reflection and the assessment of learning.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Situation:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The American International School where the project tool place is one example in a growing trend of privately owned K-12 educational institutions that seeks to prepare the children of expatriate adults for higher education. The students could generally be categorized as being multinational, multilingual and operating at a higher developmental stage that would be expected on average and with a greater degree of maturity and collective responsibility.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project was conducted with two groups of Year 8 students aged between 13 and 14 Years. The project was complete over the course of 8 weeks with 4 hours of contact time per week. Students were divided into teams of three or four and assigned roles and responsibilities: these were Team Leader, Researcher(s) and Designer.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Task:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The theme of the project was Digital Literacy. This involved a student investigation into Bias/Propaganda in the Media as well as developing Internet searching skills and developing skills with cloud based tools such as Dropbox and Google Docs in order help them complete the project. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The final part of the project was to create an ePortfolio as a container capable of storing visual and auditory content including text, images, video and sound. This was created in order to display evidence of their work directly against the learning standards of the project. To do this we decided to use Google Sites.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students created an introductory page and then subsequent&nbsp;pages for each learning standard that project covered. Students were free to include whatever evidence of their work they thought best demonstrated their competance in the meeting of the standard.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Teaching and Learning standards were taken and adapted from<a href="http://www.iste.org/STANDARDS"> ITSE</a>&nbsp;technology standards.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>To contribute to project teams to produce original works or solve problems</strong>. This was done in the form of a collaborative presentation.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. To locate, organize, analyze, evaluate, synthesize, and ethically use information from a variety of source and media.</strong> This included the recording digital sources in a &lsquo;Sources Table&rsquo;.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. To evaluate and select information source and digital tools based on the appropriateness to specific tasks.</strong> This involved the evaluation of digital sources and their suitability for use. Again, this needed to be added to a &lsquo;Sources Table&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Evaluate and select information sources and digital tools based on the appropriateness to specific tasks.</strong> This task involved providing evidence that the team had used collaborative tools such as Google Apps, Drive and Dropbox to complete the project. Evidence of this was to be provided in the form of screenshots. Some analysis had to be provided in terms of the strength and weaknesses of the tools being used.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. A written reflection of the project in terms of how successful the team was in meeting the learning objectives of the project.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">1. To understand different propaganda techniques commonly used in the media (Inquiry)</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students wrote a list of questions they had concerning &lsquo;the media&rsquo; and the role that they play.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">2. Evaluate sources of information for trustworthiness, validity and reliability.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students investigated the &lsquo;Kony 2012&rsquo; video for reliability and trustworthiness. Develop a set of amendment questions to the makers of the video.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students prepare a group presentation on Israel and Palestine conflict &nbsp;that was reliable and trustworthy. Presentation had to be created according to a design specification and that was informative and interesting for the audience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">3. Students are taught to be able to find, locate and disseminate information from appropriate, reliable and legal sources.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students taught how to develop their Internet searching skills to find information more quickly and effectively. Students use TLD modifiers and search modifiers to restrict searches of information in order to answer prescribed questions.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students to &nbsp;research information as a group on the Israel and Palestine conflict , share, research tasks and collate findings in a single presentation. Information sources recorded in a the &lsquo;Sources Table&rsquo; and evaluated for reliability and propaganda.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">4. Students are able to share work and information and an efficient digital manner using attachments, Dropbox and Drive.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students use Google Drive and Dropbox to create shared folders, documents and communicate both synchronously and asynchronously.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">5. Students create an ePortfolio in Google Drive</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Student embed evidence against each of the learning standards of the project into the ePortfolio.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">6. Project Review</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students complete an individual reflection. This is done in the form of a structured essay</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Results/Reflections</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">An example of finished ePortfolios can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/thuysicteportfolio2/">here </a>and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marytranicteportfolio/">here</a>. All students involved in the project submitted an ePortfolio of which some were fully completed and others partially completed. I will discuss the issues encountered below.</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Evidencing work directly against learning standards was a revelation in fostering students interest , understanding and pride in their own, and each others, contributions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Outcomes-based assessment strategies were favoured because this gave the students a greater choice in how they meet the requirements of the project. However, summative assessment of the project was done using a rubric (shared with the students) that contained no mechanism for giving credit to those students who were active participants in meeting the learning standards but then subsequently failed to show evidence of this activity in the ePortfolio. This process then may not have fairly recognised the true progress and achievements of those students whose contributions were more tacit. With hindsight this problem could have been overcome with more on-course learner tracking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Students were not being assessed on the ePortfolio itself nor on the majority of the digital tools that they used throughout the project. Yet, success in this project was determined by what they displayed in the end. We therefore need to ask the question as to whether the technical knowledge required to create and maintain the ePortfolio unfairly disadvantaged those students who may have ended up being assessed more on their technical prowess than on the knowledge they were meant to have acquired. Diagnostic skills test before the project may have helped overcome such issues.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. The decision to incorporate student reflection into the ePortfolio was made in order that students could reconsider and makes a story out of their own learning experiences. This was an extremely beneficial exercise both for them, and for me as a teacher, in order that we could gauge progress.</p>
<p>5. Assessment of the project and then the process of providing individual feedback was an exhaustive and time consuming. Rather than providing so much assessment summatively based solely on an end &ldquo;product&rdquo; , &nbsp;it may have been preferable to break down the task into smaller parts and feedback on those instead.</p>]]></description>

<p class="main">The secret teacher speaks for himself; we don't know how many other teachers and lecturers would endorse this condemnation of curriculum abuse.&nbsp; But he may well get a cheer from educators who would not call themselves &lsquo;teachers&rsquo; or &lsquo;lecturers&rsquo;.&nbsp; Education has agencies other than schools-and-colleges.&nbsp; Every locality has some such free-standing voluntary agency or social enterprise. organising help in what is called &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="main">My shot at explaining all this is set out in an earlier <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8484">account of education and policy</a>.&nbsp; I examined influences on education, the beliefs they call upon, and the risks they pose.&nbsp; Here I ask how education can respond to those pressures, by forming and activating stakeholder groups as part of civil society.&nbsp; Civil society, by definition, acts independently of commercial and political pressures.&nbsp; And stakeholder groups give voice to that independence.&nbsp; This blog asks what kind of conversations about education that independence sets up.&nbsp; It means probing what different groups want from curriculum, what commitments they each seek, and what varied outcomes they try to realise.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">The possibilities are far-reaching, especially when education for selection is set alongside education for well being.&nbsp; I look for what gets argued when education for competitiveness is set alongside education for fulfilment.&nbsp; The term &lsquo;learning-for-living&rsquo; crops up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">Curriculum development needs all the independent support it can find in schools and colleges.&nbsp; But an independent education may need civil society more than is yet obvious, even to the secret teacher and his allies.&nbsp; This blog faces the probability that education will be privatised; government is in no position to resist the leverage of commercial interests looking for new markets.&nbsp; Thinking about the future of education needs, then, to grapple with all the possibilities - if not in the public service then in civil society.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">It&rsquo;s a long-term project - bigger than a parliament.&nbsp; But Labour is calling for local communities, in partnership with businesses, to be free of arbitrary demands for unsustainable growth, and working for locally-valued outcomes.&nbsp; Those calls resonate with the forward-looking possibilities signposted here.</p>

<p class="intro">Most people can answer to their own satisfaction the question &lsquo;what&rsquo;s education for?&rsquo;.&nbsp; Everybody has some experience to go on.&nbsp; But agreement in a group is less likely - people have different experiences.&nbsp; Some claims are at such levels of word-playing malleability to be useless: talk of &lsquo;inspiration&rsquo;, &lsquo;confidence&rsquo;, &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo; and &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; can obscure more than it illuminates.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not easy for stakeholders to get enough detail on the action that such claims call for.&nbsp;&nbsp; They need to get to grips with how far such underlying priorities can stretch...</p>

<p class="sub"><strong>education, interests and 'noises-off'</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/education-a-very-short-introduction-by-gary-thomas/2002267.article">Gary Thomas</a> has distilled curriculum thinking into an hour-or-so of reading.&nbsp; He maps a six-thousand-year history of education.&nbsp; I find his account riveting - it&rsquo;s of a struggle.&nbsp; In the blue corner, an insistence on the need for formal and reliable facts.&nbsp; In the red, trust in the case for an open and progressive process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, before the bruising starts, it&rsquo;s a pointless match - have you ever come across an unprocessed fact? or a fact-free process?&nbsp; So we should be able to find a consensus.&nbsp; But it's hard to find.&nbsp; Educators and their stakeholders need to understand why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author helps by taking a close look at pragmatics, constructivism and marketisation.&nbsp; I've tried here to take account of all that.&nbsp; But I can't help noticing that the author leaves out pretty-well all of what neurology, the social sciences and cultural theory bring to an understanding of curriculum.&nbsp; So where are the clues to understanding?&nbsp; Are they in what we can see included? or in what we can't see because something's left out?&nbsp; We'd have to ask who ignores what?&nbsp; And why would they do that?</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve managed to set out here, I find it hard to lose the suspicion that this is not really a debate about ideas, it&rsquo;s about whose interests are being served.&nbsp; A content-driven factual understanding of how things are suits some, and they are glad to see it included.&nbsp; A process-driven curriculum addressed to critically scrutinising how things got this way will upset some apple-carts</p>
<p>Assembling this account of what educators can do has repeatedly come across those conflicting interests.&nbsp; Any claim made, or research reported, or policy announced stands in a frawework of one set of interests or another...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>neo-lib&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; shareholder &lt; &gt;&nbsp; cosmopolitan&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; street-level&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; civil society&nbsp; &lt; &gt; stakeholder</strong></p>
<p>It also finds the interests managed in a range of settings...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>systemic&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; institutional &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; conversational</strong></p>
<p>Some of this is &lsquo;noises-off&rsquo; - hard-to-decipher murmers of what is somewhere being canvassed, or the wangling of manoeuvres, or - eventually - what turns out to have been downright misleading.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found some of what is signposted here in the news, but the news can also be a daily parade of immediate events, short-term consequences and facile solutions.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s too little time, space or attention-span to pose uncomfortable questions - just enough for evasive answers.&nbsp; Claims to transparency are so narrowly framed as to be laughable.&nbsp; Education needs larger frameworks, demanding disclosing answers.&nbsp; Am I paranoic to sense that there's some probing to do here?</p>
<p>And probing done before any compromises are made.&nbsp; A resolution can only be negotiated from what is put on the table.&nbsp; There's no compromise with absolute beliefs.&nbsp; And compromise with partial disclosure is a commitment to little that's worth having.&nbsp; Garry Thomas&rsquo;s story is in part an account of what kind of limp resolutions are left dangling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educators are not responsible for any of this, but neither can they afford to ignore it. This account of what they can do is widely-enough framed to take account of the gamut of interests and the reach of exchanges.&nbsp; So there&rsquo;s a lot here.&nbsp; But the more educators take into consideration, the more bases for action they can search.&nbsp; And this blog has argued that the action can include root-and-branch curriculum reform - with or without the support of the 'noises off'.</p>

              <title>Evaluation plan for OER module for teacher training</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3 align="center"><strong>Evaluation Plan </strong></h3>
<h3 align="center"><strong>OER module for teacher training</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><strong>Introduction and Background</strong></strong></h4>
<p>This evaluation plan follows similar procedure of the course &laquo;Inclusion and Accessing Technology&raquo;, developed in the scope of an European project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partners agreed to adapt it to their national context and validate it on different modalities, on a tutor base and on a self-study approach. In either case, each partner will have to present a report with the results of the evaluation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the partners has already validated the course with a group of 23 SEN teachers, belonging to a network of ICT Resources Centres for Special Needs, who acted as participants and as evaluators at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A pair of facilitators conducted the course on a peer base and dialog with the participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This OER module will be added to the course and will be delivered as a single learning unit as well. This issue will be discussed with the european partners, according to the following plan.</p>
<h4><strong>Purposes</strong></h4>
<p>The purposes of the evaluation are to improve the new module according to suggestions from the point of view of participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The module will follow a formative evaluation as the previous course did. The participants will be SEN teachers that will act as participants and evaluators as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assessment of participants -&nbsp;the teachers had to create an eportfolio and gather the assignments of each topic (4 topics), a technical forum to discuss difficulties with tools (the use of some Web. 2.0 tools were required) and a thematic forum for each topic were open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end, the participants who fulfilled all tasks received a certificate as validators of the course.</p>
<h4><strong>Audiences</strong></h4>
<p>Two groups of participants/evaluators will be involved.</p>
<ol>
<li>Teachers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that have SEN pupils in their classes</li>
<li>SEN teachers belonging to the ICT Resources Centres for special needs.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Decisions and Questions</strong></h4>
<p>Each european partner will decide in which modality (tutor-based, self-study) to run the course and/or just the OER module.</p>
<p>Each partner will decide which target teachers to involve.</p>
<p>Each partner will adapt the new module (translate/replace resources, adapt activities).</p>
<p>Each partner will apply the evaluation method and tools agreed so that a final report may be produced and eventual comparisons and conclusions will be extracted.</p>
<h4><strong>Methods</strong></h4>
<p>The participants will be informed of the evaluation purposes and the need for their feedback along the course/learning unit and, in particular, at the end with their feed-back on an evaluation forum of discussion and an online questionnaire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Sample</h4>
<p>The participants from whom data will be collected for the evaluation are identified.&nbsp; The<br />facilitators will also be evaluators themselves.</p>
<h4>Instruments</h4>
<p>The former course was run in Moodle Platform and the final topic focused on the course evaluation with a forum with several lines of discussion.</p>
<p>An evaluation questionnaire was produced in Moodle and replied by each participant.</p>
<p>The same instruments may be used and eventually adapted once more.</p>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>The evaluators will be teachers, it won&rsquo;t be possible to involve other professionals, graphic designers, ICT experts, researchers.</p>
<h4>Logistics and time</h4>
<p>The final evaluation report will integrate the national reports of each partner.</p>
<p>A report template will be agreed and followed.</p>
<p>An English version of the course/OER module is provided and each partner will make the necessary adaptations to each context.</p>
<p>The evaluation questionnaire will be provided as well and translated to each language.</p>
<p>The final report will have to be delivered till the end of 2013, therefore each partner will have to plan and validate the course/OER module within that deadline.</p>
<h4>Budget</h4>
<p>Each partner has a European budget for the whole project, but no specific expenses are devoted to course evaluation.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>I love the simplicity of <a class="zem_slink" title="Jenga" href="http://www.hasbro.com/games/en_US/jenga/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Jenga</a>. </strong></p>
<p>Simplicity has a purity about it. Don't knock it. Behind its functionality and its look and feel there will be some hard thinking. Keep it simple, stupid (<a class="zem_slink" title="KISS principle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">K.I.S.S</a>) may be a training cliche but there is considerable truth in it. I've now had three years here at <a class="zem_slink" title="Open University" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.025,-0.705555555556&spn=0.01,0.01&q=52.025,-0.705555555556 (Open University)&t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">the OU</a> and here on this Student Blog platform (short of five days). I've been working on my ideas regarding learning and e-learning design in particular. Courtesy of THE OU hosted <a title="OLDS Mooc 2013" href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course">OLDs MOOC 2013</a> (Online Learning Design - <a class="zem_slink" title="Massive open online course" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Massive Open Online Course</a>) I'm experiencing what feels like undertaking an 8 week written examination - the contents of my brain are being pushed through the cookie cutter.

<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<p>Learning events or activities, moments that make the participant smile, think, reflect, nod in agreement, understand, be informed and generally feel good about the world and this particular learning experience. Hit them with some of this, as the say so succinctly across the Atlantic - at the 'get go'.</p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xUqWmeLuB0QOqucJi6k559MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zR7R8ogXYIc/UQtZAD_QDfI/AAAAAAAAi3Y/aeF3UVn7Dfk/s288/The%20bad.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<p>The effort required and built into the learning. OK, we want them to love this too, and you can if you're 'in the flow', have done your work, have wrestled with what you didn't understand, asked for help, listen to fellow students, gone out of your way to do extra reading and research until you have it, one way or another.</p>
<p><strong>There needs to be assessment.</strong></p>
<p>An assignment is a soft assessment to me - though like everyone I have terrible days when the thing just slips through my fingers like a snowball on the beach. A dissertation or end of module assignment is tougher, but tough and 'bad' in a certain way - like commitment to a triathlon. And a good analogy as working on and developing three issues at 2,000 words a pop is about right. And you won't get far if you leave training to the week before. It's a slow burn.</p>
<p><strong>The 'bad' has to be the written examination.</strong></p>
<p>They have to be hated and feared, and like learning lines for that school play, you have to get it right on the night (or day). And what do you do if you act? You have good lines to learn, you learn and rehearse your lines and you practice, and do a test run or two. The curtains going up is the equivalent of your turning the examination paper over. I feel the fear from a year ago - April 2012. I hadn't sat a written exam in 30 years. All my undergraduate and school-boy fears came back. I used rusty techniques that had last seen service during my first degree. Bad is good. You want to do everything not to feel like you are naked on stage - a dream we all have when faced with such an 'exposing' test? <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/wWqqYfaV0PTh72j4OhD1ldMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IvhCwe5Layc/UQtZGBhaShI/AAAAAAAAi3g/Q-hkvFUPdk8/s288/The%20ugly.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Ugly</strong></p>
<p>Shock 'em. Not scare the witless. Have up your sleeve some smart stuff. Whether an idea or the technology offer a creepy and certainly memorable surprise. Boring a student into making a fact or issue stick is like throwing mud at a brick wall - it'll stick, it'll coagulate and build up, but is easily washed away in a shower and destroyed in a storm. Use storytelling techniques perhaps, better still, follow the pattern of a ghost story. Scare them? I'm back on fear I guess. We humans are fearful of many things and will go out of our way to avoid, run away or confront our fears. As I said, the idea here isn't to lose your students, but to empathise with them, understand the ugly side of their learning experience then help them confront their worst fears. It is ugly having to tackle the parts of a subject that stink, but inevitably these are the blocks at the base of JENGA.</p>
<p>My primary colours for learning design, not red, blue and yellow, but good, bad and ugly. We'll have to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So can I apply it? And can I go back to bed now?</strong></p>
<p>Which leads me to another theme - we no longer simply bring work home with us, we take it to bed and sleep with it. If this pisses you off then let me introduce you to 'working with dreams'. If you are prepared to get up for an hour in the dead of night, or can flick on a light without invoking divorce then scribble stuff down to catalyse the thought in the morning. Can work wonders, can produce nonsense, can just be some things you need to put on the supermarket shopping list ... or another dream of being naked on the stage, not knowing your lines and needing the lo but all the exits are locked and the orchestra has stopped and you have to say something. <em>Which, courtesy of the wonders of the mind, has me in the front row of a performance of The Tempest at the University Theatre, Newcastle when I was 13 or 14. Caliban was naked, covered in mud and wearing a prosthetic erect penis.</em></p>
<p><strong>HORROR!</strong></p>
<p><em>P.S. And give me 20 minutes searching the Internet and I will be able to name the actor, date the show and possibly even find a picture. Perhaps you'd like to have a go. But before you do so, be very fearful of what the search terms you use might throw up. </em> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>P.P.S. I've given up (for now). It may have been David Suchet or Jim Carter. The production was in 1974 at the University Theatre.&nbsp;</em></p>]]></description>

<h2 dir="ltr">My Dream</h2>
<strong><strong>I have come to the OLDSMOOC to understand how 21st Century learning designers are expressing and measuring learning outcomes in open educational environments.  My hope is to immerse myself in the OLDSMOOC activities and learn from participant experts/explorers by observing/questioning decisions about activities and the indicators/measures/assessment of learning gains.<br /><br />It is my dream to find ways to better express, collect, measure, report the learning gains of self-directed language learners registered with my publicly funded organization.  <br /><br />My situation (context)</strong></strong>
<div dir="ltr">
<table><colgroup><col width="351" /><col width="273" /></colgroup>

<tr>
<td>Overview:<br />
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">not-for-profit organization, providing language learning resources/support to Self-directed learners, 1600 registered learners, 300-350 active every month; w/2.5 FTE instructors</li>
<li dir="ltr">funding received from government to provide language learning supports/resources to newcomers</li>
<li dir="ltr">access to learning resources at no cost to learners everything online</li>
<li dir="ltr">activities for learners include: drop-in online classes, access to modules from Literacy to Intermediate, additional lessons, assignments, tests, community discussion board, 4 week courses, weekly tips, learners encouraged to develop Personal Language Learning Environments, access to an</li>
<li dir="ltr">most of these activities are self-assessed, answer keys, community discussion, journal reflections</li>
<li dir="ltr">instructors feedback on baseline assessments, guide to further resources, deliver synchronous classes, weekly tips, moderate discussion board and feedback on journal reflections</li>
<li dir="ltr">learners can pick and choose the content and activities they want to engage in; there is no requirement to complete</li>
<li dir="ltr">work completed within an LMS</li>
<li dir="ltr">learners have access to a learning portfolio within the LMS to show evidence of work but not a requirement</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>Example<br /><br />Learner: focus on writing, completes only writing activities, receives feedback on writing and then leaves. We have examples of writing improvement, but each learner is different in their gain, collection is time consuming. Sometimes a testimonial comes; or feedback on survey (10% returns).<br /><br />Learner: focus on listening, uses links from Twitter, wiki, etc. doesn’t login to LMS for 3 months.  Gets a reminder call, and they have been completing activities on recommended resources.  We have no data on language gains.</td>

<table><colgroup><col width="348" /><col width="276" /></colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Challenge:<br />
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Funders, understandably, want ‘proof’ of learning gains, reliable/valid measures of project impact on clients.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Our organization reports primarily on learner activity (number of hits, logins, hours in LMS, number of calls, journal reflections...) as measures of activity or impact.  Learning gains are reported in learner testimonials or feedback surveys that are ‘only’ self-reflections of learning.</li>
</ul>
Achieve:<br />
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">As I move through this OLDSMOOC, I would like to understand how designers are assessing learners in open environments.</li>
<li dir="ltr">I would like to have more examples/ ways to collect data on learner achievement.</li>
<li dir="ltr">I would also like to be directed to articles, books, research on assessment of SDL</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>Example<br /><br />I have a list of new assessment activities for self-directed learners.<br /><br />I have a bibliography of literature/research reflecting the good, bad and ugly of SDL learning gains.<br /><br />I have innovative ideas to change the current learning options provided to learners to better meet their learning needs and at the same time the needs of funders!  (True dream?)</td>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">What do I do/know: reflect on current assessment practices (strengths/weaknesses)</li>
<li dir="ltr">What does group know: ask for feedback on current assessment; ask for new ideas; observe/question assessment choices in other projects.</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a fairly routine type of activity.&nbsp; For a totally online course (actually the onramp to a longer face-face course)</p>
<p><strong>Context: </strong>Ski patrol Pre Hospital Emergency care course.</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> I have access to Moodle with a few question addons (the drag and drop types from the OU: https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=category&amp;id=29<br />Trying to avoid complext tools so tutors can actually tweak questions/add/reuse questions etc.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>my first problem has to do with the level of questions.&nbsp; I know we can create matching, drag and drop, multichoice type questions quite easily.&nbsp; However short answers are a problem: there is no built in manually marked short answer type in Moodle, nor any add-ons that I know about.</li>
<li>Next, what can be done to create automated higher order questions?</li>
<li>Thirdly, I've had difficulty getting good images.&nbsp; I've tried various places, and have a few more leads to follow up.&nbsp; eg: given this scenario, what would you do first, and to have video/image as well as text/audio.</li>
</ol>
<p>A very small niche market: there are not many ski patrol schools around.</p>
<p>How to package this to it runs nicely.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>eSubmission of work has been around since the dawn of man. OK well not that long. But for certain subject areas (ECS for example) at least as long as the internet has been mainstream.</p>
<p>Students love <strong><em>eSubmission</em></strong>, but staff, on the whole staff haye <strong><em>eMarking</em></strong> it for a vareity of reasons.</p>
<p>These include:<br />- The perceived cost transfer from students to staff for printing<br />- Staring at a screen for hours while marking might give them a headache<br />- They miss the freeform 'scribble on page' approach<br />- They hate ANY kind of marking</p>
<p>In many cases these fears / annoyances are unfounded, but moving an academic unit from paper to eMarking is always a struggle.</p>
<p>Past experience has given me a number of general pointers on good practice in how to improve the staff eMarking experience, I'd like to explore this area further.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>SAFeSEA (Supportive Automated Feedback for Short Essay Answers) is a new EPSRC-funded research project in the Institute of Educational Technology at the UK&rsquo;s Open University.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to provide an effective automated interactive feedback system that yields an acceptable level of support for university students writing essays in a distance or e-learning context.</p>
<p>The project will explore the development of natural language processing tools for essay summarising, the definition of effective models of feedback and the design of web-based wrappers to orchestrate the tools and evaluate different supportive approaches.</p>
<p>Higher education institutes across the UK and around the world will benefit either by adopting and further developing the technologies developed within this project or by utilising the research results to inform their own feedback procedures for work carried out online.</p>
<p>Additionally, the research communities for technology-enhanced learning, feedback and e-learning will be able to reuse the results for crafting bespoke feedback systems and utilising the resulting software.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, students in higher education can benefit from the research, as will students in secondary schools in the future.</p>
<p>The project team is led by Dr. Denise Whitelock, and includes Professor John T. E. Richardson, Dr. Nicolas Van Labeke, Bethany Alden (all from IET), Dr. Stuart Watts (Information Balance), Professor Stephen Pulman and Dr. Debora Field (both from Oxford University).</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The 'map my programme' tool employs a set of free google apps to graphically display all the hand-in dates for each course /unit/module and display, in real time, the types of assessment used across a programme and the effect of that assessment has on the learning journey of the students at any one point as well as the marking load for the academic. It can also be used to see if there is duplication of effort, or synergy bewteen courses. Core to this process are the dates when formative and summative assessments are set and subsequently submitted – students do not want to have a bunching of coursework and staff need to manage their workload! You can download guidance materials and request a trial at: http://www.mapmyprogramme.com/</p>
<p>There is no charge for using this tool but you will need a google account. </p>]]></description>

<p><strong>This event will be recorded -Stadium link&nbsp;TBA</strong></p>
<p><strong>Presentation:</strong>&nbsp; This event will provide opportunities to engage with this challenge, and talk through what we can expect and how to ensure that this works well for&nbsp;all participants. There will be time&nbsp;to compare notes and discuss what solutions might work best, or are working best with a strong emphasis on discussion rather than presentation. Here are some of the questions that we expect to engage with:</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>How can we make sure that assessment based on students producing and reviewing multimedia do does not disadvantage disabled students? </li>
<li>What level of Assessment Literacy does this require from students and how can we support development of this? </li>
<li>How can we get sufficiently representative work from students including what can be complex media items and discussion on into the&nbsp;OU assessment system &#40;technically and operationally&#41;? </li>
<li>What are the implications and expectations here on tutors when marking this work? E.g. what do they need to access and what not? </li>
<li>Students may wish to embed or draw in media artefacts which they have placed outside the&nbsp;OU walled garden. How to accommodate this? </li>
<li>What proportion of the assessment should be based on the artefact itself? </li>
<li>Using&nbsp;OpenDesignStudio&nbsp;for commenting on artefacts&nbsp;in more open ways &nbsp;- what have more experienced users learned from this?&nbsp;How are students reacting to sharing their work for assessment&nbsp;like this? </li>
<li>What assurances and processes (date stamps, etc) do they need for this to be rigorous in terms of the&nbsp;OU exams systems? </li>

              <title>Assessing informal learning: a case study using historical audio guides</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6367</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6367</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This paper presents the findings from a study that investigated how geolocated audio could be used to provide opportunities for public learning of history.&nbsp; The project, utilising mobile media and informal learning, was a collaboration between academic and community-based historians interested in enhancing public understanding of selected aspects of the history of Nottingham.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was concerned with supporting the enhancement of historical literacy, historical &lsquo;empathy&rsquo;, and participants&rsquo; abilities to draw informed conclusions about contested historical subject matter.&nbsp; The historical subject matter was the 1831 Reform Riots in Nottingham, around which a local community history group designed a guided &lsquo;history walk&rsquo;.&nbsp; The project supported a realisation of this walk and also gathered participant responses from both a &lsquo;people-led&rsquo; walk and an alternative &lsquo;technology-led&rsquo; version of the walk, where a media experience was delivered to participants through handheld devices that triggered the playing of audio files with information contained from different historical sources at specific locations of relevance to the Reform Riots around the city of Nottingham.&nbsp; Responses were recorded via a combination of methods: by questionnaires filled in immediately after each walk, researcher observations, and debriefing sessions of selected participants.</p>
<p>The audio tours were designed to enable public learning of historical events, through three interdependent aspects (see Figure 1 below):</p>
<ol>
<li>Attaining historical literacy (i.e. learning basic facts about the Reform Riot: what happened in the period of the riot?)</li>
<li>Experiencing &lsquo;empathy&rsquo; with historical subjects (i.e. what was this period and these events like for different people?)</li>
<li>Developing historical interpretation skills (i.e. responding to and evaluating accounts from a variety of perspectives: how were these events and their causes viewed from differing and/or conflicting perspectives?)</li>
</ol>
<p>These three aspects &ndash; or objectives &ndash; are thought to be hierarchical, where the first objective (historical literacy) must be gained before the second one (historical empathy) can be achieved.&nbsp; Historical interpretation, the third objective, can only be achieved once participants have experienced historical empathy.</p>
<p>This conference presentation will examine the extent to which participants in both walks showed evidence of having achieved these objectives, the value of having done so, and also suggests how the objectives can be used in the design process of authoring similar experiences to enable informal learning to occur.</p>]]></description>

              <title>How is evidence-based literature informing e-Assessment practice: Findings from an HEA project</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6352</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6352</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the main drivers for Learning has long been acknowledged as the Assessment that students must undergo during the course of their studies (Rowntree, 1987). The &ldquo;backwash effect&rdquo; of assessment (Biggs, 1996), such as &ldquo;students only learn what is assessed&rdquo;, highlights how the results influence certain assessment practices. There is now a sea change in attitudes to assessment where, quite rightly, the role of assessment is focused to support student learning (Assessment for Learning Group, 2002). Providing students with constructive, timely and &ldquo;easy to understand&rdquo; feedback is taking centre stage in this new culture of assessment (Havnes &amp; McDowell, 2008) and has gained increased interest throughout the HE Sector with the advent of electronic assessment.</p>
<p>There is now a growing body of literature about the role that electronic assessment and feedback is playing in the HE Sector and one of the salient questions of the day is how is this literature informing practice to support student learning?</p>
<p>This paper reports on a study commissioned by the Higher Education Academy and undertaken by The Open University and the University of Southampton to investigate this question through addressing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consult the academic community about which references on assessment and feedback with technology enhancement are most useful to practitioners</li>
<li>Prioritise evidence-based references i.e. those that are peer reviewed and have data to support their practice</li>
<li>Synthesise the main points from these references</li>
<li>Provide signposts for readers to locate the original documents for further study</li>
</ol>
<p>The aim of this desktop research was to support the Higher Education Sector in its use of technology to enhance learning and teaching by providing a comprehensive and useful synthesis of evidence based practice in this domain.</p>
<p>The findings revealed that the majority of publications were practitioner-led case studies. The references that were recommended to the team were clearly having an impact on current practice and were found to be valuable by the practitioners. The key messages from these case studies were consistent and often gave detailed and practical guidance for other academics. Most of the recommended literature focused on the objectives that can be met using technology-enhanced assessment and how the assessment and feedback loop can be designed to make best use of the technology.</p>]]></description>

There will be space and opportunity for engaging  with potential futures of technology-enhanced learning as well as  interrogating what familiar concepts such as &lsquo;interdisciplinarity&rsquo; and  &lsquo;research-based teaching&rsquo;  really mean in practice.</p>
<p>In an exciting collaboration, Martin Conreen, who lectures in  Goldsmiths' Design Department, and Mark Miodownik, Professor of  Materials and Society at University College and Royal Institute  Christmas Lecturer, will be giving the keynote.</p>
<p>Other key speakers include education campaigner and journalist  Melissa Benn, Glasgow School of Arts education leader Professor Linda  Drew, Goldsmiths cultural scholar Professor John Hutnyk, audio learning  innovator Andrew Middleton and Kings College neuroscientist and Wellcome  Collection adviser Richard Wingate.</p>
<p>The event is free - <a href="http://futuretense.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">but you must register</a> -&nbsp; and <a href="http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/travel-fund" target="_blank">you may be able to get funding to attend</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A note from me on Cloudworks...</strong></p>
<p>I first encountered Cloudworks while studying on H800 last year, so this seemed like a good place to create a space around the event.&nbsp; I think I might be a little rusty, so any feedback on my attempt is most welcome!</p>

<p><strong>Guest of Honour: Stephen Crowne, former Chief Executive, Becta</strong></p>
<p>This seminar will bring together key policymakers with  stakeholders to consider the future role of technology in education.   Discussion will focus on the direction of government policy following  the closure of Becta, and will explore new procurement models as schools  become increasingly autonomous. The role of technology providers, the  integration of new and existing technologies into the classroom, the  potential use of technology as an assessment tool and schools' need to  ensure value for money will all be considered. The seminar will also  look at the skills required for employers, particularly those involved  in the growing digital economy, and how the curriculum can cater for  these needs.<br /><br />We are delighted that <strong>Stephen Crowne</strong>, former Chief Executive, Becta has agreed to deliver a keynote address at this seminar.<br /><br />At this early stage <strong>Andrew Goff</strong>, Director, Interactive Learning eXperience; <strong>Andy Palmer</strong>, Head of Skills, BT; <strong>Professor Simon Peyton-Jones</strong>, Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research and Chair, UK Computing at School Working Group and <strong>Ian Potter</strong>,  Chair, Maths and Computing Headteacher Steering Group, Specialist  Schools and Academies Trust and Headteacher, Bay House School, Hampshire  have also kindly agreed to speak. <br /><br /><strong>Lord Knight of Weymouth</strong>,  former Minister of State for Schools and Learners has kindly agreed to  chair the first half of this seminar.

              <title>Analysing Tutor Feedback for e-Assessment Systems</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5306</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5306</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Presentation by Denise Whitelock as part of the learning analytics sympsium at CAL 2011.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of today&rsquo;s education is that students expect better feedback more frequently and more quickly. Unfortunately, resource pressures are high and feedback is often produced late or under time pressure. This is an unsatisfactory situation for the students who complete the UK National Students Survey and clamour for more timely feedback. Lack of tutor response is affecting university ratings with respect to this survey and producing prompt feedback is on Vice-Chancellors&rsquo; agendas in order to improve universities&rsquo; rankings. However, does just-in-time feedback improve student learning? Will not the quality of feedback play a role here?</p>
<p>In order to answer these questions, the written feedback given to students at The Open University by their tutors in three different subject domains was analysed and then modelled in order to provide a tool that would support tutor reflection on feedback. The first part of the paper will discuss that analysis and how it influenced the development of &lsquo;Open Mentor&rsquo;, an open-source tool that guides tutors into giving appropriate feedback.</p>
<p>The second part of the paper will present findings from the analysis of tutor feedback in the History domain and illustrate how it shaped the production of an electronic formative assessment tool for History students, &lsquo;Open Comment&rsquo;, which provides an automated feedback response.</p>
<p>Open Mentor: The classification system used for Open Mentor was based on that of Bales (1950). Bales&rsquo; system was originally devised to study social interaction, especially in collaborating teams; its strength is that it brings out the socio-emotive aspects of dialogue as well as the domain level. Bales&rsquo; model provides four main categories of interaction: positive reactions, negative reactions, questions, and answers. These interactional categories illustrate the balance of socio-emotional comments that support the student. We found that tutors use different types of question in different ways, both to stimulate reflection, and to point out problem areas in a supportive way. These results showed that about half of Bales&rsquo; interaction categories strongly correlated with grade of assessment in different ways, while others were rarely used in feedback. This evidence of systematic connections between different types of tutor comment and level of attainment in assessment was the basis for the design of Open Mentor.</p>
<p>The classes of Bales model are domain-independent &ndash; it proved successful in classifying feedback in a range of different academic disciplines An automatic classification system, therefore, can be used in all fields, without needing a new set of example comments and training for each different discipline.</p>
<p>Open Comment: The second section of the paper reports on the feedback engine and pedagogical principles that drove the development of Open Mentor. The pedagogical rationale for this system was to engage students in a series of electronic formative assessment tasks that would provide more free-text entry but also provide automatic feedback. It built on earlier work on Open Mentor (Whitelock &amp; Watt, 2007).</p>
<p>The guidance text arose from the analysis of expert tutor feedback in several Arts disciplines. A range of techniques was employed to elicit the processes they used to provide appropriate feedback. These ranged from role-play (as a student) to analysing collections of real answers and constructing sample solutions.</p>
<p>A preliminary analysis of 68 History assignments together with 100+ assignments from different disciplines revealed a common pattern of tutor responses. These were clustered around the main categories of praise, advice on structure and presentation, particular misunderstandings, and developing and understanding particular issues.</p>
<p>Some Thoughts</p>
<p>With the continued pressure on staff resources, making individual learning work is always going to be a challenge. However it is achievable as long as we maintain our empathy with the learner. Tools can help us achieve this through providing frameworks that support reflection on our social interaction in order to provide emotional support as well as the conceptual guidance that learners need.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><br />The goal of this workshop is to develop the notion of technology-enhanced <br />formative assessment (TEFA) further, combining expertise from pedagogy, <br />educational measurement, cognitive science and information technology. The <br />workshop aims at promoting formative assessment and evaluation as a component <br />for extending existing or new technology-enhanced learning approaches. <br />Formative assessment has already demonstrated its positive impact on learning <br />in general, and helps the learner to achieve self-regulation skills. Furthermore,<br />learner models can provide valuable information for the adaptation of learning <br />resources and processes in the online learning environments of today.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Helen Barefoot, Dominic Bygate, Mark Russell and myself are going to present a poster in the IBLC on how to make an existing peer assessment activity more efficient, so students have better learning experience and staff can use their time more effectively. The technology we used included a web based data gatherer to collect students' perception of how peer assessment helped them to improve their learning and reflection on what they have done well and what areas they need to work on in future.</p>
<p>How is technology helping you gain efficiency in your assessment and feedback?</p>

              <title>Using Pre-released Third Party Articles in the Final Assessment: Course: T324 - Keeping Ahead in ICT</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3202</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3202</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The second part (Part 2) of the examination in this course is worth 60% and&nbsp;is based on third-party articles that are issued to students in advance mid-way through the course and are made available in the exam room. This approach&nbsp;was first used in 2007 and performance has been similar from the two cohorts who have taken this new style exam. Overall pass rates are high although it does appear that students, in spending more time preparing for Part 2 and despite detailed advice, are sometimes not giving Part 1 (short, comparatively straightforward questions covering the whole course) due attention. Slight changes are planned for 2009 with formative CMA quizzes planned for 2010.</p>
<p>Whilst pre-release examinations are not new to the OU, it is novel for undergraduate teaching of ICTs (Information Communications Technologies). This form of assessment means students can be asked rather more demanding questions, but without having to rely completely on memory &ndash; it therefore represents a desire for an ECA sitting somewhere between a traditional examination and a labour-intensive projects and that does not place too great demands on memory for the student.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This pilot research project&nbsp;set out to investigate the use of an online decision-making maze tool as a form of eAssessment task more motivating and relevant to practice-based students.The concept to be reusable with different decision-making and problem-solving activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project was trialled with nursing students who are required to make clinical decisions about patients' health and well-being, responding to changes in&nbsp;a patient's condition which may occur within very small time-frames.</p>
<p>The context&nbsp;built on a realistic clinically-based case study. The approach allowed for exploration and the construction of&nbsp;decisions, based on evidence presented as multiple rich media resources for students to explore.</p>
<p>Options were scaffolded to allow three possible decisions at each decision point with students&nbsp; justifying their decisions in a reflective log which captured their evidence at each stage.</p>
<p>The case study evolved over time, allowing students to review the results of their decisions at each stage. Students&nbsp;were offered two attempts after which they receive feedback, depending on the route through the maze they have chosen.</p>
<p>The assessment system captures their scores and averages the two attempts in the final feedback. The reflective log acts as a record of their reflections and justifications and has the potential to feed into a qualitative piece of assessment, such as a TMA.&nbsp; The tool has the additional potential to be used as a collaborative activity with groups of students.&nbsp;<br /><br />This approach allows students to construct their view and apply their knowledge in a safe environment where decisions can be rehearsed and explored before application in practice.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>KYN107 is the first of four practice-based courses&nbsp;for the Pre-registration Nursing Programme and uses formative and summative iCMAs for reviewing and revising&nbsp;Anatomy, Physiology and&nbsp;Medication calculations.</p>
<p>This example use of iCMAs is innovative because it brings a number of successful elements together in a range of activities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a variety of question types: drag and drop; tick all that apply; multiple choice; text input and select from options.</li>
<li>different difficulty levels, starting with easier questions to build confidence</li>
<li>detailed graded feedback for each of three possible attempts</li>
<li>reference to where the information is covered in the course</li>
<li>plain mode versions (for accessibility / SENDA compliance)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;The summative iCMAs use randomised question content per student, to reduce the possibility of plagiarism. Three versions have been developed for each summative question and the versions appear randomly for each student logging onto that iCMA.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Assessing enquiry-based learning </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2676</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2676</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introducton </strong></p>
<p>Enquiry-based learning (EBL) usually results in students achieving, creating or experiencing a wide range of: learning outcomes, products arising from learning, processes as part of their learning, contexts in which learning occurs, social structures underpinning learning.</p>
<p>This poses some real challenges for assessment tasks, criteria and feedback, as the tendency can sometimes be to resort to standard approaches that particularly don't benefit the students, but that do assign reliable grades. We need to realise that the demands on staff and student are significant, as support is required to follow an unfamiliar research process, adjust to a new context, and master an ability; on a student by student basis.</p>
<p>I want to outline four principles that help us to deal with this variety that students encounter. <br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Contingency</strong></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Assessment is formative to the extent that evidence about student performance is elicited, interpreted, and used by teachers, learners or their peers, to make decisions about the next steps in research processes ...&nbsp; (adapted from Black and William, 2009)</p>
<p>We need to capitalise on the moments of contingency that arise naturally within enquiry-based learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unpredictable and uncertain aspects of work within authentic contexts.</li>
<li>Research processes unfold over time, with scope to shift direction in light of&nbsp; evidence or to plug gaps in understanding. </li>
<li>Opportunity for discussion as an integral aspect of the learning</li>
<li>Contingency ties in to one of the most substantive benefits of research-led learning, namely student motivation. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong><br /><br />Given this great variety across student learning, we still need to value efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be realistic in the extent of the research involved or recognise the demands via credit size </li>
<li>Students conduct research in groups or pairs </li>
<li>Use of coursework requirements: a condition that a student must meet to pass a module or assignment ... and combine this with </li>
<li>sampling of student work and the involvement of others in commenting on student work (e.g. self, peers, GTAs, clients, professionals, technicians ...)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Alignment</strong><br /><br />The varied range of learning does pose challenges for the consistency of the entire student experience. We need to pay particular attention to alignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning outcomes: we need to make sure that the challenge is fully explicit. Do your outcomes integrate words into them such as 'appreciate uncertainty and limits of knowledge, manage own learning, initiate projects, initiative and personal responsibility, decision making in unpredictable circumstances, complex contexts, autonomously, identify a range of solutions, ...'? This favours an increased use of formative assessment and alternative examination papers and other assessment tasks.</li>
<li>Products arising from learning: Assessment to incorporate reports, papers, artefacts, logs, performances, personal accounts, ... How can we integrate these into assessment?</li>
<li>Processes involved in learning: Directly assess or give feedback on student contribution to the processes involved, as with facilitating group-work, managing own learning or dealing with uncertainties or un-forseen eventualities. If you are not taking advantage of all this work and these naturally arising products, then the chances are that the student will need to spend more time learning than someone on a similar comparable module that is not based around EBL. (Is that fair?)</li>
<li>Contexts in which learning occurs: Taking account of authentic, professional, unpredictable contexts in setting level of support, tasks and criteria. These contexts really do enable students to hit learning outcomes as suggested above. </li>
<li>Social structures underpinning learning: EBL often works best when it takes advantage of social structures that underpin learning, as with roles, groups and pairs. Thus we will look for assessment and feedback that builds on the involvement of others in pairs and groups, pattern of meetings, or through specific roles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fairness </strong><br /><br />Given the genuine variation in tasks/contexts/level of support involved, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw up assessment criteria that take into account the varying demands faced by students, especially when contexts differ significantly (as with lab and desk-based research). </li>
<li>Ensure that the credit size reflects the actual amount of student work involved in the module, or scale down your expectations.</li>
<li>Use of coursework requirements can avoid penalising students in cases where learning is contingent on factors beyond their control. </li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>... and applying this to your own practice</strong><br /><br />Consider a given assessment task, along with the associated assessment criteria and feedback mechanisms. How could you adapt this to:</p>
<ul>
<li>draw from moments of contingency; </li>
<li>take greater account of the full range of learning outcomes, products arising, processes, social structures and contexts involved; </li>
<li>introduce efficiencies in staff time; </li>
<li>and ensure fairness to students? &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Concluding thoughts ...</strong><br /><br />The Carrick model (see references below)&nbsp; suggests that we should value renovating practice, and that embedding requires extensive personal engagement. So perhaps look for opportunities that will make it easier to implement some of these ideas, where change is already planned or where you can adapt existing practice. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Black, P. and William, D.

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The use of podcasts, Webcasts and streamed video is fast becoming commonplace in our courses, alongside the more traditional CD- or DVD- delivered elements. Some of us are actually producing our own objects using, often, demo versions of software or open source tools. Looking to the bigger picture beyond course production, I think it's safe to say that students would profit from being able to develop the types of skills we're now developing through this sort of work.</p>
<p>So: what about getting our students to use these media to communicate their ideas and understandings, that is, what about integrating multimedia work into assessment?</p>
<p>These are some questions that come to mind:</p>
<p>In what ways can we usefully teach students to create their own multimedia objects?</p>
<p>What is involved (conceptually and in practice) in assessing these objects?</p>
<p>How can this type of work be integrated with other work in a course?</p>
<p>Is it possible to create a basic framework that can be adapted to the requirements of different disciplines?</p>
<p>An attempt at addressing these questions is currently taking place in the development of the new Computing &amp; ICT course TU100 . At the moment, there's a forthcoming D2 of a course unit teaching students how to prepare multimedia, using a framework that could potentially be adapted to any discipline and 'format' (another area of questioning I might have included in the list above), and discussion is ongoing on the related assessment, but I thought it would be interesting to invite other people's views!</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[One way of assessing students’ knowledge and understanding of case studies is to have them write short essays. But if application in new contexts and new situations is an important part of the learning outcomes, then a better way to assess them is to have them discuss practical problems.

Here, in a psychology course on learning, the lecturer replaced short essay questions asking the students to repeat key features of an illustrative case study, with problems asking them to discuss the application of principles shown in the case study to a different practical situation.

For example, from their understanding of a case study of motivation being improved in a restaurant, students have to discuss ways of improving motivation in a manufacturing business or a volleyball team.

              <description><![CDATA[Most forms of assessment test EITHER theoretical OR practical knowledge.

But suppose we want students to develop BOTH, and to be able to combine the generality and flexibility of conceptual thinking with the action-orientation of practical working? How do we assess that?

Sonia Bartoluzzi and Peter Goodyear suggest having students create a tool to support practical working. This will require them to articulate their tacit knowledge of practice and review that against their conceptual knowledge. Students from comparable workplaces can collaborate in developing, critiquing, and refining such tools.

              <description><![CDATA[How specific should you be with an assessment task? On the one hand, students need to understand what you want them to do and how they will be marked. On the other, trying to specify everything is (1) laborious and (2) discouraging of students’ creativity and imagination.

Sonia Bartoluzzi and Peter Goodyear suggest that the solution is to have a discussion topic for each assessment task, where students can request further clarification if they need it (and everyone can see the tutor’s response) or negotiate their own adaptations or customisations.

By not pre-empting students’ concerns, you can encourage them to engage with the task at a deeper level.

              <description><![CDATA[If you want your assessment to reward deep learning (personal construction of meaning, flexible understanding, transformation of current conceptions etc) rather than surface learning, then you should be thinking of project-like assessment, according to Sonia Bartoluzzi and Peter Goodyear.

“Instead of the assessment being a test of how well the materials have been memorised, the materials become a resource for the assessment project.”
