              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>You learn by doing and collaborating, watching videos, accessing just-in-time information from your mobile device, mentoring, and more. Why, then, does the Human Resources department only give you slides to learn from?</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s workers and corporations are united in wanting more access to the formal, non-formal, and informal learning needed to support an increasingly skilled workforce (The Education Commission, 2016; Pew Research Center, 2016a and 2016b). However, today&rsquo;s corporations largely store their learning resources in virtual learning environments (VLEs) that have adopted a uniform way of storing content. This uniform way, called SCORM, was incredibly helpful when it was designed nineteen years ago, and it still has an important role to play today. When SCORM was created, computer-based training was relatively new and organisations needed a single way to store and track training. For a time, innovation in elearning stopped at the known, established boundaries of the VLE (Weller, 2014, p. 194).</p>
<p>Now, a new need has developed: a way to store and track learning when it occurs on mobile devices, or through social and collaborative activities, or offline by reading a book or engaging in stretch assignments, or when participating in simulations or augmented and virtual reality programmes.</p>
<p>An innovation that meets that need was first released in 2013, and had its last planned update in 2016. It is the Experience API (xAPI). xAPI provides a common format for capturing data from today&rsquo;s distributed learning landscape (Rustici Software, n.d.). With xAPI in place, you can free staff development from the confines of SCORM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rely less on elearning courses designed from slides and more on learning experiences;</li>
<li>Recognise learning from formal and informal or non-formal activities (Downes, 2015);</li>
<li>And track not only clicks and views but also correlate learning with performance (Torrance, 2016).</li>
</ul>
<p>Managers and other decision-makers within learning departments and organisations are at a critical point. They need a source from which to gain a high-level, jargon-free understanding of the benefits of xAPI, common applications and uses of xAPI to support learners as they access modern and innovative learning opportunities, best practices and lessons learned, and information they should provide to their learning development and learning technology teams to prepare for implementation of xAPI (HT2 Labs, n.d.).</p>
<p>In my conference presentation, I will discuss and share a workshop created to meet those needs. The workshop helps managers, even those without extensive technical backgrounds, to be prepared to move forward with discussions and decisions about xAPI within their organisation. My presentation will show some of the workshop features and provide attendees with tools they can take with them, for use in their future endeavours.</p>

<p>In this presentation a proposed measure for mixed emotions in text will be described. A brief outline of why mixed emotions are important to measure in the context of learning will precede the measure validation results. The data for this study will be from a pilot study with N=982 freshman students in the Netherlands in a statistics course. The study examines their activity working in a computer supported collaborative working environment during a 72-minute course lab where they were using a chat feature in order to create a group response to a case study. The standard for identification of mixed emotional expression used in this analysis are messages identified as mixed emotion expression by students when examining their own group work conversations in a post activity. The lab ran during the span of a school week with participants attending one lab session during the week. The post activity was completed by the following Sunday after the week of labs. A brief interpretation of what messages from group chat were categorized as mixed emotion will be provided to help gain insights into what people are identifying as mixed emotional expression. While the focus of the proposed measure is on detecting mixed emotional expression in written communication the categories of positive, negative, neutral, and mixed will be benchmarked against a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis technology. While valence is not precisely emotion detection a second benchmark will be a machine learning classifier of mixed emotion expression. When establishing the proposed measure, a machine learning bag-of-words approach towards classifying mixed emotion expression was created using the examples of mixed emotion messages provided by the students. By comparing the new measure to both a state of the art sentiment analysis method as well as a machine learning classifier, the results show how the proposed measure fits between valence measurement and bag-of-words classification of written expression for the purpose of mixed emotion detection.</p>]]></description>

<p>In this presentation, we will introduce the project Data-informed Learning Design for Future Schools, which LTI Academic is undertaking with the Advanced Innovation Center for Future Education, Beijing Normal University. The project draws on our expertise in Learning Analytics and Learning Design: we are investigating the applicability of Learning Design descriptors to the PR China context and using clustering and social network analysis techniques to investigate the efficacy of patterns of Learning Design activities in online courses. The aim of this work is to inform the pedagogy and learning design of future online courses in the UK, China and beyond.</p>

<p>In the past five years, the field of learning analytics has seen a growing body of literature in developing predictive models from students' log files data. While the accuracy of these models are constantly improved with advanced statistical techniques, the ability to derive interventions from the findings has been rather limited due to the lack of pedagogical contexts. Thus, there is an increasing interest to align Learning Analytics with Learning Design, as the former facilitates the transfer of tacit educational practice to an explicit rendition, while the latter provides educators with pedagogical context for interpreting and translating LA findings to direct interventions. Previous empirical evidence has confirmed a strong association between the way teachers design the course, pass rates, and student behaviors. However, little attention has been paid to the chain effect: learning design-student behavior-retention. Therefore, this paper investigates how student behaviours on Virtual Learning Environment mediate how learning design affect dropouts rate in 55 modules and their 45K students.</p>

              <title>Understanding distance learners’ academic and social adjustments: evidence of best practice from a South African context</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Firdevs Melis Cin, Ashley Gunter, Dianne Long, Clare Madge, <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/jm37279.html" target="_blank">Jenna Mittelmeier</a>, Paul Prinsloo, Parvati Raghuram, <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/kjr77.html" target="_blank">Katharine Reedy</a>, <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/bcr58.html" target="_blank">Bart Rienties</a> and <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/jr23979.html" target="_blank">Jekaterina Rogaten</a></p>
<p>The proportion of students studying in international distance education programmes has risen dramatically in the last decade, particularly in developing countries (UNESCO, 2012). One such example is South Africa, which has become a regional hub for international students with over one-third studying distantly. Previous research demonstrates that distance students show low degree attainment (Prinsloo et al, 2015) and learning design affects their retention and satisfaction (Rienties and Toetenel, 2016). However, relatively little is known about international distance learners&rsquo; educational transitions, including academic and social integrations. Although there is a wide body of literature on international student adjustment and integration, this research often makes the assumption that students are physically located at the host institution, and there is a scarcity of research on distance education experiences. <br /> <br />The International Distance Education with African Students (IDEAS) project aims to address these gaps in knowledge through a research collaboration between the Open University and the University of South Africa. The project explores international distance student experiences across Africa, including their educational transitions through higher education and the role of learning design in academic and social inclusion. At the CALRG 2017 conference, we will present the initial findings from a cross-cultural comparison of learning analytics data from domestic and international distance students at UNISA. We will also describe the academic and social adjustment patterns of 500 international distance students across Africa.</p>]]></description>

<p class="normal">The two main drivers for the ICT Centre are the use of ICT for improving the quality of education and improving learning outcomes and strategies for kindergarten, primary, secondary and teacher training.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The centre produces online guides for educators and offers a series of online tools and services. These services cover a wide range of topics that educate students about careers, practice math exams, safety decisions when using media, copyright, democracy, Sami languages, collaboration for projects across national borders, learner resources for personalisation, data regulation information, entrepreneurial teaching methods, and digital literacy,</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The centre has also produced services and products for the purposes of monitoring schools. For example, it has carried out a longitudinal study on the digital skills of 7<sup>th</sup> graders, 9<sup>th</sup> graders, and upper secondary students. The centre has self-assessment for school managers on digital competence, self-assessment for teachers connecting them with professional development modules, and a national assessment on digital skills for all 8<sup>th</sup> graders.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The project also has developed pedagogical scenarios that were run in over 1,000 schools coordinated by Schoolnet. The ICT Centre ran a blog so that schools could contribute stories about everyday use of ICT.</p>

<p>Metacog uses a content pool of interactive &lsquo;learning objects&rsquo; to personalise content and pace for individual learners. Students are asked to complete a real-world task using the platform, and data are collected on their usage behaviours, including click data, time stamps and correct/incorrect responses. The platform&rsquo;s API analyses student interactions with the task to assess their understanding of the content. It is possible to use Metacog in collaboration with pre-existing resources.</p>
<p>Students using Metacog have access to information about whether they have performed a task correctly. A leader board is also created so that students may compare their performance with peers. For teachers, the platform colour-codes performance as green, yellow or red to indicate their understanding of the material on individual tasks or over time. The platform also helps teachers to group students based on their current understanding, in order to provide individualised assignments or additional resources. Teachers can additionally review which part of the task is a trouble zone for each student or for the class as a whole. On an administrative or publisher level, the platform can be used on a macro-scale to help determine where to invest additional resources by highlighting gaps in understanding across classrooms.</p>

<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="443">
<p class="normal">The Australian government commissioned this in-depth look at the current (2015) state of learning analytics practices in the country. Study 1 identified two &lsquo;categories&rsquo; of implementation:</p>
<p class="normalCxSpMiddle">1.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Universities focused on performance measurement and retention interventions</p>
<p class="normalCxSpMiddle">2.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Universities focused more deeply on learning as a pursuit of understanding, who viewed retention as an important proxy for student engagement</p>
<p class="normal">This highlighted opposing views about the purpose of using learning analytics to support retention: as a tool for supporting university needs or as a tool for supporting the student academic and social experience. In this study, more universities belonged to Cluster 1 than Cluster 2. The report highlights that institutional learning analytics policies are more than technical readiness, as universities&rsquo; views on the benefits of learning analytics are also important drivers.</p>
<p class="normal">Study 2 highlighted important factors for success.</p>
<p class="normal">The report concludes that most Australian universities are in the early stages of adopting successful learning analytics practices. It stresses that learning analytics is a complex system, which requires the development of six key areas: academic content, conceptualisation of the purpose for learning analytics, leadership, university strategy, stakeholder feedback, technology and an understanding of the specific university context.</p>

<p class="normal">This report uses robust mixed methods to consider the current &lsquo;state of the art&rsquo; of learning analytics in Australia. It also incorporates viewpoints of international experts. The report includes an in-depth description and full transparency of its methods. Although the report focuses on an Australian context, it is of interest to an international audience. This report looks more broadly at trends in the adoption of learning analytics across universities, which provides useful insights and tips for moving the field forward. However, a more in-depth analysis of specific institutional practices will be useful in the future.</p>

<p class="normal">Rio Salado College is a community college located in Arizona in the USA, which has an online enrolment of over 40,000 students. The college introduced tits Progress and Course Engagement (RioPACE) system university-wide in 2010. The system uses data modelling and predictive analytics to target interventions to low performing students.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The system analyses virtual learning environment (VLE) behaviours and compares students to previously successful students. Weekly warning labels are provided individually on a colour-coded traffic light system &#40;similar to that employed by Purdue&rsquo;s Course Signals&#41;. Teachers receive weekly reports on student progress and predicted completion, enabling them to target students for interventions if needed.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">Students can also view their warning labels by accessing the RioPACE system within the VLE. Students with a yellow or red indicator are prompted to contact their module teacher for help with getting back on track.</p>

<p>Nottingham Trent University (NTU) in the UK has developed, trialled and deployed a Student Dashboard for all undergraduate students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system draws engagement data from a range of sources: library use, attendance, use of the online learning environment, ID card swipes in to university buildings, and academic grades. It uses these to generate a composite engagement score and displays this graphically compared to the average for everyone on the course, and gives a rating of high, good, average or low. Automatic alerts are sent to a student&rsquo;s tutor for triggers such as &lsquo;no engagement for a fortnight&rsquo;, or &lsquo;academic failure&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary users of a student&rsquo;s score are the student themselves and their tutors; the scores are also available to other tutors on the course, course administrators, and student support staff, but not to other students.</p>

<p class="normal">At Georgia State University (GSU), predictive analytics have been used to tackle the achievement gap for low income and first-generation students. The university found that students were dropped from courses due to non-payment even when they had high grade point averages (GPAs) and were close to graduation. GSU graduation rate went from 32% in 2003 to 54% in 2014. In the process, the university claimed it removed the achievement gap between students from minority backgrounds or lower socioeconomic status, and their peers who had higher graduation rates. GSU states that it achieved these results by systematically accumulating smaller victories. The university took a series of measures to assist students with costs that were preventing them from staying enrolled in the university. The university used as tutors existing students who were obliged to work for the university as part of their financial aid package. The university also helped students select courses based on predictions of likelihood that they would pass the course. &nbsp;</p>

The group has as its goal &lsquo;Create the conditions for the agile evolution of the FE system Support employers and drive economic growth&rsquo; and believes that &lsquo;Government cannot and should not provide all the answers. Ownership by the FE sector&rsquo;. The group emphasises putting people ahead of the technology and investing in teachers and administrators. One suggestion offered by the group is to build an innovation network to enable the staff to drive digital innovations.</p>

<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">Employers should participate in further education curricula development and scale up best practices, offer leading-edge apprenticeships, encourage providers to use collaborative MOOCs, and consider how small and medium enterprises can build the digital capability of staff.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">Skill providers should assess organisations&rsquo; use of technology, accredit learning technology, have regional support centres play a role in further education, and teach the teachers how to design their own learning materials.</p>

<p class="normal">In terms of investment, regulation, and funding, the group outlines efforts that need to be made in order to keep up with the pace of technology. It identifies that infrastructure concerns such as broadband need to be taken into account, and suggests that publicly funded programmes in 2015/16 should have mandated a 10% wholly-online component, increasing to 50% in the following year. Funding should encourage &lsquo;learning presence&rsquo; not &lsquo;physical attendance&rsquo;.</p>

<p class="normal">The envisaged use includes both:</p>
<ul>
<li>access by students to measures of their own levels of participation and indicators of disengagement or falling-behind, as an aid to self-regulation;</li>
<li>use by staff to trigger interventions as part of a student support process.</li>

<p class="normal">The approach taken has not been explicit with regard to pedagogy. The emphasis of the technical system and tools is on student support rather than on teaching and learning. In this respect, the implicit approach is mainstream in that the emphasis is on monitoring engagement and performance and using predictive analytics to prompt appropriate staff to the possible need for an intervention. Use by students for self-regulation is in scope but is of secondary importance. In essence: the envisaged use of learning analytics is as an enhancement of prevalent practice.</p>

<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="443">
<p class="normal">Course Signals is a predictive learning analytics system originally produced at Purdue University in the USA. The system uses student data to predict those who are at risk of not successfully completing the course. By using predictive modelling of student data and activity in the learning management system &#40;LMS&#41;, each student is assigned a &lsquo;risk group,&rsquo; the colours of which are those of a traffic signal &ndash; red, yellow, or green.</p>
<p class="normal">To use the system, the lecturer or tutor must manually run the model to receive students&rsquo; &lsquo;signals&rsquo;, which they can then use to provide targeted feedback or additional resources to those at risk of low performance. Course Signals incorporates the use of intervention emails, which can be written by the teacher and sent to those in each risk group. Notifications can also be given in a student&rsquo;s LMS course page.</p>
<p class="normal">Course Signals allows teachers and tutors to give real-time feedback starting as early as the second week of class, and it can be used by the lecturer at multiple points during the term. In research published at LAK12, it was suggested that there was a 21% retention rate improvement at Purdue between students who took at least one course that used Course Signals, over those who did not. However, this has since been disputed.</p>

<p class="normal">As of 2012, over 2,300 students in more than 100 courses had used the system. At that time, it was suggested a further 20,000 students would gain access within the next 18 months. However, more current data has not been made available.</p>
<p class="normal">At present, courses at Purdue are not required to use Course Signals, thus it has not been mobilised yet on an institution-wide scale.

<p class="normal">During the five-year project the country delivered 450,000 XO laptops to students. As well as putting devices into the hands of students and teachers the project implemented an intelligent tutor. The goal was to remove the digital gap between students who had access to technology and those who did not.</p>

<p class="normal">Some critics raised the point that this was a large investment to access technology and questioned whether more emphasis should have been placed on the pedagogy of effective use of technology.</p>

<p class="normal">Estimated cost of the project was put at &pound;159 per student with an estimated on-going annual maintenance cost of &pound;13 per student. During the five-year project the cost was estimated at under 5% of the national budget for education.</p>

<p class="normal">As of 2015, ASU has announced a partnership with Cengage Learning and Knewton Enterprises to create &lsquo;Active Adaptive&rsquo; modules. These modules will use analytics similar to the Knewton Math Readiness programme, which adapts students&rsquo; learning paths through the module according to their demonstrated proficiency. In combination, Cengage Learning will provide study tools to enhance resources such as note taking and collaboration with classmates. These co-created modules were planned for launch in autumn 2015 and were developed for entry-level general education modules.</p>

Thus, a more robust randomised control trial would be useful to clarify results. An informal account on Inside Higher Ed also highlights wide variation in retention rates between individual module sections.

<p class="normal">The World Bank Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) &lsquo;What Matters Most for Education Management Information Systems Framework Paper&rsquo; was published in 2014 as part of its Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) working paper series. SABER is an initiative to produce comparative data and knowledge on education policies and institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically strengthen their education systems.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The working paper focuses on data and their analysis as a tool for management, school-system oversight, and policy. The term &lsquo;learning analytics&rsquo; is never used. Nevertheless, the vision described in the paper includes feedback of student learning and other outcomes back to school level for action by teachers, students, so enablement of learning analytics practices is implicit.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal"><em>&lsquo;An effective EMIS is one that has a fully functioning information cycle. This cycle demonstrates that an </em></p>
<p class="normal"><em>EMIS is more than a simple annual school census, that the coverage of statistics goes beyond </em></p>
<p class="normal"><em>administrative census data. An EMIS is a dynamic system that has a defined architecture, the capacity to </em></p>
<p class="normal"><em>perform analytics, and the ability to serve its users. The functioning of this cyclical process results in more </em></p>
<p class="normal"><em>effective data sharing and coordination.&rsquo;</em></p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The paper concludes with a rubric for assessing progress toward the key policy goals identified, which gives indicative statements against four levels of maturity against a large number of indicators organised under policy lever headings including: legal framework, human resources, infrastructural capacity, data-driven culture, methodological soundness, openness, timeliness and data coverage.</p>

<p class="normal">This policy brief, written by Simon Buckingham Shum, was published in 2012 by the UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The aim of the report is to describe and define learning analytics and to provide real-world examples of their use. In doing so, it divides learning analytics into three levels -- micro (individual student), meso (institution), and macro (region/state/national/international) -- and highlights potential benefits of learning analytics for each. Examples of learning analytics forms are also given, including LMS/VLE dashboards, predictive analytics, adaptive learning analytics, social network analytics and discourse analytics.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The report also highlights debates in the learning analytics field. Topics include the perceived &lsquo;neutrality&rsquo; of data, conceptualising the definition of student &lsquo;success&rsquo;, and various ethical implications of using and sharing student data.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, the policy brief provides recommendations for higher education institutions in the light of the state of the art at the time of publication:</p>
<p class="normalCxSpMiddle">1.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using analytics as a tool to debate visions of teaching and education in the 21st century</p>
<p class="normalCxSpMiddle">2.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Training staff and researchers to use and develop analytics tools</p>
<p class="normalCxSpMiddle">3.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developing an analytics infrastructure for research at an institutional level</p>
<p class="normalCxSpMiddle">4.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collaborating with other institutions to develop trusted partnerships and robust learning analytics methods (for example, through an open analytics platform)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The manifesto first highlights the current state of the ar&rsquo; of European manufacturing, as well as potential industry changes in the future. In particular, 3D printing, Internet of Things, digital disruptions and Industry 4.0 are discussed. Next, the document highlights the 21<sup>st</sup>-century skills needed to address and embrace these changes, and proposes adoption of learning analytics to support increased workplace learning of these skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stakeholders for adopting learning analytics for workplace learning are described in detail in three primary areas: industry, education and society. Suggestions are offered at multiple levels, including tips for industry leaders, employers, workers, universities, teachers, social partners, teacher unions and trade unions. Finally, the future of learning analytics for workplace learning is addressed.</p>

<p class="normal">The Australian Government Office for Learning and Teaching (OLT) commissioned this report, subtitled &lsquo;Policy and Strategy for Systems-Level Deployment of Learning Analytics&rsquo;. It was produced in late 2013 by three leading figures in the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR).</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">It considered ten case studies from universities in Australia, the USA, and the UK and explored the strategic issues pertinent to effective use of learning analytics. The work was also informed by webinar contributions from several individuals offering their experiences and analysis of the problem space of systemic adoption of learning analytics.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The aim of the report was principally to guide the Australian Government in the ways in which it should intervene to enable its higher education establishments to exploit learning analytics to achieve increased levels of educational success, and to build a competitive advantage for Australia.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The key enabling factors identified in the report for a national agenda are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Australian higher education leaders coordinate a high -level learning analytics task force.</li>
<li>Leverage existing national data and analytics strategies and frameworks.</li>
<li>Establish guidelines for privacy and ethics.</li>
<li>Promote a coordinated leadership program to build institutional leadership capacity.</li>
<li>Develop an open and shared analytics curriculum.</li>

<p class="normal">This LAK '13 conference paper analyses policy frameworks from two large distance education universities, The Open University in the UK and the University of South Africa.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The paper reports that although a great deal of data was collected from and about students by the institutions, learning analytics were not explicitly addressed within the policies of either institution at the time of writing. Both institutions&rsquo; policy frameworks were focused on national and international legislative issues around intellectual property, data privacy, and data protection.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The review highlights the irregularity of learning analytics where the institution is the only stakeholder with decision-making power, determining the scope, definition and use of educational data without the input of other stakeholders &ndash; specifically students.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">It is clear from the existing policy frameworks of both institutions that the definition and scope, harvesting and analysis of data are imbalanced and non-transparent affairs.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">This research indicates that some higher education institutions&rsquo; policy frameworks may no longer be sufficient to address the ethical issues in realising the potential of learning analytics.</p>

<p>The Open University (UK) policy documents include both a formal policy and guidance documents. The aim of the policy documents is to set out how the University intends that student data should be used to inform the delivery of student support in ways which conform to the University&rsquo;s charter principle to &lsquo;treat each other with dignity and respect&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The policy, which covers use of data for both student-level interventions and institutional-level strategies and processes, but not use for academic research, is based around eight principles, which are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning analytics is an ethical practice that should align with core organisational principles, such as open entry to undergraduate level study.</li>
<li>The OU has a responsibility to all stakeholders to use and extract meaning from student data for the benefit of students where feasible.</li>
<li>Students should not be wholly defined by their visible data or our interpretation of that data.</li>
<li>The purpose and the boundaries regarding the use of learning analytics should be well defined and visible.</li>
<li>The University is transparent regarding data collection, and will provide students with the opportunity to update their own data and consent agreements at regular intervals.</li>
<li>Students should be engaged as active agents in the implementation of learning analytics (e.g. informed consent, personalised learning paths, interventions).</li>
<li>Modelling and interventions based on analysis of data should be sound and free from bias.</li>
<li>Adoption of learning analytics within the OU requires broad acceptance of the values and benefits (organisational culture) and the development of appropriate skills across the organisation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Guidance documents expand upon the policy, to summarise the principles for staff, and to provide answers to the &lsquo;frequently asked questions&rsquo; of students about how data about them is used in practice.</p>
<p>The policy is published under a Creative Commons Licence.</p>

<p class="normal">The document, written in 2012 by Randy Stiles for EDUCAUSE, provides practical information about the risks associated with adopting (or not adopting) learning analytics in higher education institutions. In its introduction, the document states that it &lsquo;provides frameworks, suggestions, and resources that may prove helpful in considering risk and performing analytics at both ends of a possible spectrum &ndash; not doing enough or doing too much, too soon&rsquo; (pg 9).</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The document highlights the risks for institutional leaders in adopting analytics, including their premature or inappropriate use and imposing an inappropriate data-oriented culture on the institution. On the other side of the argument, the risks of ignoring analytics altogether are explored.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">Data governance is considered next. The document highlights several areas of concern, including legal data protection requirements, data collection and storage methods, and access to student data.</p>

<p class="normal">This document is a summary of a conference hosted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Tallinn, Estonia on 12-13 February 2015. The conference theme was &lsquo;Education Governance: The Role of Data.&rsquo; The document outlines conference themes and provides a summary of keynote speakers, workshops and panels.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The conference included three keynotes speaker. The first, Marc Tucker from the National Centre on Education and the Economy in the USA, discussed factors necessary for good education governance.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The second keynote, by Kim Schildkamp from University of Twente in The Netherlands, highlighted the kinds of data that exist in education, challenges of using such data and potential solutions.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The final keynote, by Ms Birgit Lao-Peetersoo (Foundation Innove) and Ms Aune Valk (Estonian Ministry of Education and Research), looked particularly at data in education in an Estonian context.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">A panel is also described, which discussed the tension between data that are available versus data that should ultimately be used in education. Additionally, four workshops are described, which covered developing data systems, data and trust, learning analytics, and the Estonian data system. The learning analytics workshop highlighted a scepticism on behalf of workshop participants that learning analytics would be able to deliver measurable changes in education. Also described was a general fear of exploitation of student data.</p>

<p class="normal">This code of practice was developed to help universities and colleges to develop effective approaches to a variety of issues relating to the practice of learning analytics. It is a concise document that would be suitable for development of local strategies and policies. Rather than providing a prescriptive code of practice, the approach taken is to clarify a set of principles that can be operationalised according to the policies and practices already in place in universities and colleges.</p>
<p class="normal">The topics covered are, as described by the authors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Responsibility</strong> &ndash; allocating responsibility for the data and processes of learning analytics within an institution</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and Consent</strong> &ndash; being open about all aspects of the use of learning analytics, and ensuring students provide meaningful consent</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> &ndash; ensuring individual rights are protected and compliance with data protection legislation</li>
<li><strong>Validity</strong> &ndash; making sure algorithms, metrics and processes are valid</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong> &ndash; giving students access to their data and analytics</li>
<li><strong>Enabling positive interventions</strong> &ndash; handling interventions based on analytics appropriately</li>
<li><strong>Minimising adverse impacts</strong> &ndash; avoiding the various pitfalls that can arise</li>
<li><strong>Stewardship of data</strong> &ndash; handling data appropriately</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">The Code was developed for use in the United Kingdom, and refers to some national law, but most aspects are generally applicable, drawing particularly on thinking from North America, Europe, and Australia. It is published under a Creative Commons Licence.</p>

<p>Open Essayist, developed by The Open University, UK, seeks to provide automated reflective feedback to learners on draft essays. The underlying idea is to present a computer-based analysis of the most important parts and key words in the writing, so that learners can compare those to what they intended to convey, and adjust their writing in the light of that comparison. Importantly, no summative judgement is made of the essay.</p>
<p>Learners upload their draft essay, and the system then generates a series of different views based on analysis of the text, including: the most prominent words and a graphical view of their distribution through the text; the key sentences in the text, with hints to aid reflection; and a graphical view of the structure of the essay.</p>
<p>The tool is intended as a formative, developmental tool rather than for summative assessment.</p>

<p>Chairs: Maarten de Laat, Caroline Haythornthwaite, Shane Dawson &amp; Dan Suthers</p>
<p>Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS) 47,</p>
<p>January 6-9, 2014, Waikoloa, Big Island, HI</p>
<p><strong>PAPERS DUE: June 15, 2013</strong> via the HICSS conference system</p>

<p><strong>Social Media &amp; Learning</strong></p>
<p>This minitrack calls for papers that address leading edge use of technology, research methods and system design to analyze and support learning in social networks. The ability to generate and maintain rich networked connections through social media, social networking, crowdsourcing, cloud technology, and social computing has a profound impact on the way we solve problems, learn, innovate and develop our identities, and the value this creates for individuals and groups. This minitrack will bring together state of the art research that furthers social theories of networking and learning, such as networked learning, collaborative learning, viral learning, and social capital, in combination with for example social and learning analytics and social network analysis to help visualize, develop and facilitate formal, non-formal and informal networking and learning settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We call for papers that use, analyze and/or develop technology and online tools to examine social networking and learning phenomena through social media. We specifically welcome papers that address new and exciting areas of research in the networking and learning potential of social media or the potential value social media creates for connectivity, development, and growth. Some of this work might be driven by social media and networking research in relation to education, organizations, gaming, simulation and 3d worlds. We encourage papers that address learning and value creation through social media in any setting: education, work, daily life, home, and &lsquo;serious leisure&rsquo;. Appropriate social media and learning behavior ranges from same-time, same-place to anytime, anywhere that increases interactions among participants via social media in formal and informal learning settings and mixtures thereof, and may include collectives from learning crowds to communities, teams and networks of practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We envision that papers will:</p>
<ul>
<li>examine the foundations for social media and learning in online networks, crowds and communities;</li>
<li>analyze and/or support the role of social media and networks in learning;</li>
<li>address value creation in social media and online communities and networks;</li>
<li>develop methods for analyzing social media and learning;</li>
<li>implement social network analysis to reflect social media, networking and learning processes;</li>
<li>address awareness and visualization of social networks and communities;</li>
<li>develop metrics for characterizing and following social networking and learning trends;</li>
<li>implement and develop tools for automated data capture and data analytics on social networking and learning;</li>
<li>discuss empirical trends in social networking and learning on and through the Internet, including issues and opportunities relating to information literacy, literacy and new media, ubiquitous learning, viral learning and entrepreneurial learning;</li>
<li>examine economic models, trends and markets for social media and learning, including open source and open access and viral models;</li>
<li>examine the design and facilitation of social media and learning in online networks, crowds and communities;</li>
<li>show development and use of new social media tools, devices (laptops, mobiles, OLPC ), and spaces and their networking and value creation potential; or</li>
<li>discuss ethical issues relating to learning online, including issues relating to data capture, analysis and display, and learning about controversial subjects or anti-social activities.</li>

              <title>Learning design and learning analytics</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6573</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Exploring the synergy between learning design and learning analytics.</em></p>
<p>Learning design consists of a cycle of activities: &lsquo;challenge definition, conceptualisation, elaboration, enactment, evaluation and reflection, and back to remodelling&rsquo; (Craft &amp; Mor, 2012). The tools that support the first stages of this cycle are not necessarily aligned with the later stages &ndash; a design narrative of a carefully designed learning activity may reveal significant flaws but lack a clear way of re‐connecting with the original design tools (Learning Design Grid, 2012).</p>
<p>Learning analytics offer a way of connecting different stages of the cycle. These analytics involve &lsquo;the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimising learning and the environments in which it occurs&rsquo; (Siemens et al., 2011). They can be employed at each stage of the design cycle.</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate potential correspondences between learning design and learning analytics, I draw on work on EnquiryBlogger, a blogging tool based on Wordpress, which was developed to support the Authentic Enquiry design for enquiry‐based learning (Ferguson, Buckingham Shum, &amp; Deakin Crick, 2011). There is not a perfect match here between design and analytics &ndash; the project was developed in a different context &ndash; but the links between the two suggest what could be achieved in the future.</p>
<p><em>Authentic Enquiry</em> is a theoretically and empirically grounded design for personalised, authentic enquiry. It is an eight‐stage process that starts from a topic of interest to the learner and progresses through observation, question, uncovering narratives, mapping, connecting with existing knowledge, interfacing with curriculum requirements to final assessment. This design that has been used successfully in settings from primary to postgraduate level on four continents (Deakin Crick, 2009). It is used in conjunction with the <em>Learning Power</em> framework, which focuses on students&rsquo; current learning dispositions (Buckingham Shum &amp; Deakin Crick 2012).</p>
<p><em>EnquiryBlogger</em> adds three learner plugins to a Wordpress blog, giving visual feedback on progress against the eight core activities of the Authentic Enquiry design, how many times blog posts have been categorized by a learner using the seven dimensions of Learning Power, and a visual &lsquo;mood graph&rsquo; showing the peaks and troughs of how the learner feels about their work. The plugins are also used to navigate quickly to related posts, by clicking on coloured dots. For teachers and mentors, there are three dashboard widgets displaying all learners&rsquo; plugins in their group.</p>
<p><strong>The Learning Design Cycle</strong></p>
<p>The initial challenge here was to develop a design for personal enquiry that could be employed in a variety of educational settings. Drawing on previous research, the design was conceptualized as an eight‐step learning journey. These steps made up an iterative process, so they were represented within EnquiryBlogger as an Enquiry Spiral. Mouse-over text above each step elaborated for pupils what was involved at each stage, while more detailed teacher notes elaborated on the process for teachers.</p>
<p>Learners recorded each day in their EnquiryBlogs how they were enacting their Authentic Enquiry. By the use of tags, they recorded their progress on the eight‐step learning journey and how they felt this reflected their learning dispositions. They were also able to record their feelings on a Mood Graph. Their enactment of the learning design was thus closely tied to reflection on their progress, and these reflections were represented visually by widgets sited beside their EnquiryBlogs. The teacher&rsquo;s dashboard view provided opportunities to initiate reflective discussion with individual pupils and with the class as a whole, as well as supporting reflection by the teacher.</p>
<p>This example shows that learning analytics can be interwoven with learning design. In this case, dashboards and widgets provide a focused view of data within the students&rsquo; blogs, and this view supports implementation and refinement of the learning design. Future possibilities for the combination of learning design and learning analytics include use of data about student activity to generate recommendations to learners and teachers, to represent progress, to identify possible study partners, to flag which problems have not been addressed and which tools have not been used, and to support both reflection and evaluation.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Towards discourse-centric learning analytics</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5309</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Presentation by Simon Buckingham Shum (co-author Anna De Liddo) as part of the learning analytics sympsium at CAL 2011.</p>
<p>A key indicator of meaningful learning is the quality of contribution to discourse, which is often in the written modality in online environments. Nonetheless, research on online deliberation and argumentation suggests that a more visual and hypertextual way of representing online discourse can better support learners in reflecting and making sense of what they learn while engaged in dialogue.</p>
<p>Several online deliberation and argumentation tools have been proposed in the literature (van den Braak et al.), which target different audiences, such as planners and policymakers, enterprise knowledge workers, online users and citizens in general. Between these, we propose Cohere, a social Web tool designed to target lifelong online learners.</p>
<p>Cohere aims to engage learners in structured online discourse, and to support a move from unstructured textual dialogue to structured and visual ideas sharing and connections.</p>
<p>In this paper we discuss what it means to use Cohere to monitor online learning activities and develop useful learning analytics, by starting with analysis of the online discourse in which learners are involved.</p>
<p>In particular, we propose to develop what we define as discourse-centric analytics, which are semi-automated learning analytics based on the rhetorical role that a contribution is making to a document, or conversation (e.g. identifying a problem, responding to a query, challenging or supporting a viewpoint, contributing new data). We argue that discourse-centric learning analytics enable more in-depth reflections on learners&rsquo; activities, and can augment the quality of the inferences that can be made about where and how learning happens.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we first present Cohere as a tool to support learners to:</p>
<p>&bull; collaboratively annotate Web resources with their ideas,</p>
<p>&bull; classify these ideas according to their rhetorical role, and</p>
<p>&bull; connect them into a network of meaningful rhetorical moves (the social semantic network).</p>
<p>Moreover, we give concrete examples of how, by analysing this network, Cohere can provide learning analytics to identify:</p>
<p>&bull; learners&rsquo; attention: what did learners focus on? That is: what problems and questions they raised, what comments they made, what viewpoints they expressed etc</p>
<p>&bull; learners&rsquo; social interactions: direct and indirect interactions can be identified by measuring the semantic distance of learners&rsquo; contributions (ideas, comments, questions, answers etc). A social network can be drawn in which connections between learners are weighted based on the quality of the discourse in which they have been involved.</p>
<p>&bull; learners&rsquo; process of meaning making: how do learners map their thoughts? Learner by learner, we can visualize the semantic-connections network they have created and compare them. This can provide analytics on how different learners, who read the same data, map their thoughts.</p>
<p>Based on these examples, we finally argue that discourse-centric learning analytics enable in-depth reflections on learners&rsquo; activities that would be otherwise difficult to achieve with quantitative statistical analysis of lower-level learners&rsquo; actions (such as computation of large-scale learners&rsquo; logs on how many resources they have downloaded, how much time they have spent logged into a system, how many comments they have made, how long they have spent on a task etc).</p>
<p>The reason for this is that discourse-centric learning analytics are based on data that makes explicit learners&rsquo; cognitive context (e.g. what kind of rhetorical move individual learners wanted to make with a comment, what meaning they gave to a connection, what contrasting viewpoints they detected etc). By analyzing more richly expressed and structured data, discourse-centered analytics can augment the level of accuracy and the cognitive depth of the inferences that can be made as to where and how learning happens.</p>

<p>Once the preserve of system administrators, user activity statistics are no longer hidden away in server logs, but are increasingly easy to collect via third-party analytics services such as Google Analytics or by directly interrogating service APIs. Many commercial web operations use activity data to identify how their systems are being used, as well as apparent problems with them. Activity data collected over an extended period of time may also be used as part of recommendation systems that provide added value services to the users of the system.</p>
<p>We describe several informal attempts to gather and interpret user data in a variety of educational settings, from the formal to the informal, using Google Analytics and the Gephi open-source social-network analysis and visualisation tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, we will review:</p>
<p>&ndash; the use of Google Analytics to analyse the usage of online course material in two ten-week-long Open University online courses over several presentations, treating the course materials as if they were &lsquo;just&rsquo; web pages and reviewing the performance of the course materials as if they were &lsquo;just another website&rsquo;. We show how the reports identify progression of study through the course materials, as well as revealing important information about the length of time students appear to be spending in studying the online materials, an observation that can help inform the design of future course materials (Sheikh &amp; Hirst, 2008). The analysis also demonstrates the care that must be taken in reporting website statistics, especially in the treatment of &lsquo;average&rsquo; report statistics.</p>
<p>&ndash; the use of Gephi to analyse the structure of an online Twitter hashtag community that developed around the use of the PLENK2010 hashtag during the presentation of the PLENK2010 Massive Open Online Course, as well as the behaviour of a closed community of students engaged in an Open University design course. For PLENK2010, we will show how the network of friend relationships between regular users of the PLENK2010 hashtag on Twitter may be viewed as a set of connected clusters of users, and how each cluster represents a meaningful organisation of members. For the Open University design course, we analyse the behaviour of students who were commenting on and favouriting each others&rsquo; photos as part of an online design critique activity over an extended period of time, showing various ways in which a network representation can be used to capture different perspectives on the structure of the student community and its behaviour.</p>

              <title>Learning analytics to identify exploratory dialogue within synchronous text chat</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5307</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Presentation by Rebecca Ferguson as part of the learning analytics sympsium at CAL 2011.</p>
<p>Learning analytics are limited if they focus solely on quantitative data such as the number of times individuals contribute within seminars, without incorporating qualitative understanding of the context and meaning of these figures. This is important in the case of dialogue, which may be employed to share knowledge and jointly construct understandings of shared experience that support learning (Crook, 1994) but which also involves many superficial exchanges. Previous studies have shown that exploratory dialogue is important in learning environments because it involves sharing knowledge, challenging ideas, evaluating evidence and considering options (Ferguson, Whitelock, &amp; Littleton, 2010; Mercer &amp; Littleton, 2007). The study reported here investigates whether such dialogue is employed in synchronous online settings, and whether it is possible to automate the identification of such dialogue using learning analytics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data were collected from Elluminate&reg; &ndash; a web conferencing tool that supports synchronous chat alongside video, slides and presentations. The focus of this study was on synchronous discussion related to a teaching and learning conference run online by The Open University /http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2012/. The Elluminate text chat in four conference sessions, each between 150 and 180 minutes in length (24,530 words in total) was investigated using sociocultural discourse analysis (Mercer, 2004). Contributions were first categorized as relating to academic content, to social elements or to tools (such as Elluminate). Key words and phrases indicative of exploratory dialogue (such as &lsquo;does that mean&rsquo;, &lsquo;here is another&rsquo; and &lsquo;misunderstanding&rsquo;) were then identified in these exchanges, and an automated process was used to highlight these in each of the four conference sessions. In this way, clusters of exploratory dialogue were identified. The majority of these clusters were found in exchanges related to academic content, although some learning dialogue also took place around tool use and social connections. More than 80% of the contributions of some participants contained markers of exploratory dialogue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If analysis of other datasets confirms the validity of these markers as learning analytics, they could be used to support the work of both learners and teachers. Learners could be offered opportunities to view their contributions with the markers highlighted, together with explanations of why these markers are associated with exploratory dialogue and learning. Teachers could use these markers to identify sessions or sections of sessions that provoke learning dialogue, and those that do not. Recommendation engines could also employ these markers to recommend Elluminate sessions that provoked participants to engage in exploratory dialogue.</p>

              <title>Analysing Tutor Feedback for e-Assessment Systems</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5306</link>

<p>One of the challenges of today&rsquo;s education is that students expect better feedback more frequently and more quickly. Unfortunately, resource pressures are high and feedback is often produced late or under time pressure. This is an unsatisfactory situation for the students who complete the UK National Students Survey and clamour for more timely feedback. Lack of tutor response is affecting university ratings with respect to this survey and producing prompt feedback is on Vice-Chancellors&rsquo; agendas in order to improve universities&rsquo; rankings. However, does just-in-time feedback improve student learning? Will not the quality of feedback play a role here?</p>
<p>In order to answer these questions, the written feedback given to students at The Open University by their tutors in three different subject domains was analysed and then modelled in order to provide a tool that would support tutor reflection on feedback. The first part of the paper will discuss that analysis and how it influenced the development of &lsquo;Open Mentor&rsquo;, an open-source tool that guides tutors into giving appropriate feedback.</p>
<p>The second part of the paper will present findings from the analysis of tutor feedback in the History domain and illustrate how it shaped the production of an electronic formative assessment tool for History students, &lsquo;Open Comment&rsquo;, which provides an automated feedback response.</p>
<p>Open Mentor: The classification system used for Open Mentor was based on that of Bales (1950). Bales&rsquo; system was originally devised to study social interaction, especially in collaborating teams; its strength is that it brings out the socio-emotive aspects of dialogue as well as the domain level. Bales&rsquo; model provides four main categories of interaction: positive reactions, negative reactions, questions, and answers. These interactional categories illustrate the balance of socio-emotional comments that support the student. We found that tutors use different types of question in different ways, both to stimulate reflection, and to point out problem areas in a supportive way. These results showed that about half of Bales&rsquo; interaction categories strongly correlated with grade of assessment in different ways, while others were rarely used in feedback. This evidence of systematic connections between different types of tutor comment and level of attainment in assessment was the basis for the design of Open Mentor.</p>
<p>The classes of Bales model are domain-independent &ndash; it proved successful in classifying feedback in a range of different academic disciplines An automatic classification system, therefore, can be used in all fields, without needing a new set of example comments and training for each different discipline.</p>
<p>Open Comment: The second section of the paper reports on the feedback engine and pedagogical principles that drove the development of Open Mentor. The pedagogical rationale for this system was to engage students in a series of electronic formative assessment tasks that would provide more free-text entry but also provide automatic feedback. It built on earlier work on Open Mentor (Whitelock &amp; Watt, 2007).</p>
<p>The guidance text arose from the analysis of expert tutor feedback in several Arts disciplines. A range of techniques was employed to elicit the processes they used to provide appropriate feedback. These ranged from role-play (as a student) to analysing collections of real answers and constructing sample solutions.</p>
<p>A preliminary analysis of 68 History assignments together with 100+ assignments from different disciplines revealed a common pattern of tutor responses. These were clustered around the main categories of praise, advice on structure and presentation, particular misunderstandings, and developing and understanding particular issues.</p>
<p>Some Thoughts</p>
<p>With the continued pressure on staff resources, making individual learning work is always going to be a challenge. However it is achievable as long as we maintain our empathy with the learner. Tools can help us achieve this through providing frameworks that support reflection on our social interaction in order to provide emotional support as well as the conceptual guidance that learners need.</p>
