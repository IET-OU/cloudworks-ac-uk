              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Multimedia Poster</h2>
<p>For an introduction to the project presentation please see the >multimedia poster</a> . I have also created an >accessible version</a> of my poster for people with sight challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Social exclusion has continued to be an enormous issue despite the increase in technologically rich learning platforms on the internet. A lot of those who use mobile technology have access to the internet but are unaware of the existence or use of OER (Online Educational Resources) and so they are being left behind.</p>
<p>My project is focus on the adaptation of OER for English language teachers. The essence of the project is to provide help to ensure the provision of learning materials to the marginalised teachers in the developing world, especially those in sub-Saharan African countries such as Nigeria.</p>
<p>The project will sensitise the teachers and help them acquire information and knowledge on OER. The English language teachers on the project will discover alternative ways of demonstrating what they know, and this will lead to a change in their classrooms as they begin to challenge their learners in more productive ways using materials from the OER sites.</p>
<p>Most teachers in Nigeria use mobile technologies and are on social media app networks such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram. This project will empower the teachers and improve their access to professional development and education available via OER sites (See O&rsquo;Connor, 2000). OER offers a plethora of choices.</p>
<p>My presentation will consider how systems can be created for teachers to have access to OER repositories. In recent times, there has been an increase in internet-based network of freely available online resources for learning and teaching. These open educational resources include highly interactive and innovative curricula, visualizations, simulations and lesson plans. There are features that support the use of real-world resources (see McArthur &amp; Zia 2008; Zia, 2001; Borgman et al., 2008). These increasingly available online resources are infrastructure available for teachers to use, access, and share, connect, create and adapt resources in ways that can change their practice (Borgman et al. 2008).</p>
<p>In the presentation, I will demonstrate that the use of social media technologies has an essential place in teacher professional development because teachers learn voluntarily. Teachers use forums to reflect on own practices and exchange ideas with colleagues (see Marcia &amp; Garcia, 2016). So, instant messaging software have helped teachers to adapt information, to re-conceptualize and to make information much more functional for their contexts (Cranefield &amp; Yoong, 2009). In very recent years, mobile learning devices have offered a variety of learning opportunities (see Macia &amp; Garcia, 2016; Rambe &amp; Bere, 2013; Cakir &amp; Arslan, 2013; Hwang, Huang &amp; Wu, 2011).</p>
<p>Given that WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook stand out in many studies as effective tools and applications used by many people and available in mobile devices. It is easy to create online community of practice using WhatsApp, Telegram or Facebook (see Baran &amp; Cagiltay, 2010; Wesley, 2013) and many teachers all over the world use WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook for social and learning purposes.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Since 1974, disabled students in England have been able to apply for non-repayable grants, known as &lsquo;Disabled Students&rsquo; Allowances (DSAs)&rsquo;, to assist with the additional costs incurred whilst completing higher education study (Willetts, 2014). Such grants provided allowances for specialised equipment, non-medical assistance such as note takers and specialised tutors, books and consumables, as well as travel allowances (Disability Rights UK, 2015). In addition to the support provided by DSAs, the introduction of the Equality Act 2010 placed a legal duty on businesses and education providers to take positive steps, referred to as &lsquo;reasonable adjustments&rsquo;, to remove barriers faced by people, due to their disability (Citizens Advice, n.d.). This includes making changes to the ways things are done e.g. provision, criterion or practice; physical features of buildings such as entrances and exits; as well as the provision of extra aids or services such as: induction hearing loops, providing information in alternative formats etc. (Citizens Advice, n.d.).</p>
<p>Despite the reasonable adjustments implemented by higher education institutions (HEIs), the costs of the DSA provision have risen sharply from &pound;101.3m in 2009-10 to &pound;145.8m in 2012-13, an increase of 44% (Weale, 2015). In 2014, the Minister for Universities and Science announced a series of changes to modernise the existing system to &lsquo;rebalance&rsquo; responsibilities for student support. Thus, ensuring that the limited public funding is available to those most in need, and provides the support they require (Willetts, 2014). The changes are designed to move away from a system of individualised support funded by DSAs, to one where HEIs play a greater role in supporting all students, regardless of whether they have a disability or not.</p>
<p>With these changes coming into force from September 2016, HEIs within England have been required to review and, if required, revise their current student support arrangements to ensure they are prepared for these changes and can support learners effectively (McNaught, 2016). Whilst there are many small and simple changes academic staff can take to improve the accessibility of their teaching such as: providing information ahead of sessions, creating learning materials which meet accessibility guidelines and encouraging students to record teaching sessions etc. (Canterbury Christ Church University, n.d.), this does not resolve the underlying issues. As McNaught (2016) summarises &lsquo;[t]eaching and learning pedagogies, practices and technologies can inadvertently create barriers for students with disabilities&rsquo;, to overcome these a different approach is required.</p>
<p>To address some of the challenges raised by these recent changes and the need for HEIs to make anticipatory, rather than reactive changes, this conference presentation will provide an overview and demonstration of a short online course being developed by the author. Built using the Canvas open education platform, this short course aimed at academics working within UK HEIs, will provide a more in-depth overview of the changes to disabled student support, whilst also introducing delegates to two educational frameworks; Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Inclusive Curriculum. Building on research undertaken by Marquis et al. (2016), this course will utilise a flipped learning pedagogy; whereby the learning materials are placed online and classroom sessions are used to enable deeper exploration and discussion of the topics raised (The Higher Education Academy, n.d.).

              <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Title</p>
<p dir="ltr">Art and Athletics: From and Body</p>
<p dir="ltr">Narrator</p>
<p dir="ltr">I am an artist teaching a basic art course to fourth year primary school education students in a university pedagogical department.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Situation</p>
<p dir="ltr">My class is comprised of 140 fourth year students divided into four smaller groups. &nbsp;Each group is taught a three hour studio class covering the seven basic elements of art (line, shape, form, value, space, texture and color). &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As part of the student&rsquo;s teacher training program they are required to organize and teach for two weeks in a local school.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During the two weeks they are asked to teach a &lsquo;project&rsquo; oriented class which requires incorporating many artistic concepts and materials.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Keeping this in mind I designed a three week &lsquo;project&rsquo; incorporating &lsquo;form&rsquo; and the human body through the use of art and athletics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To try and make the &lsquo;project&rsquo; more meaningful I invited an athlete to talk to the students about his expeditions while trying to reach his goal of climbing all seven of the world&rsquo;s highest summits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Task</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Learn the meaning and different types of &lsquo;form&rsquo; in art.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Have students apply their understanding of &lsquo;form&rsquo; to a collaborative work of art</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Help students understand how to design and organize their own &lsquo;project&rsquo; through real life experiences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Help students discover the various tools and processes available to them in designing, organizing and implementing their own &lsquo;project&rsquo;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">5. Connect students with &lsquo;real world experts&rsquo;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Actions</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chronological order</p>
<p dir="ltr">Day 1</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Give an introductory presentation on &lsquo;form&rsquo; in art.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Watch a short video on the elements of art:<a href="http://ww2.kqed.org/artschool/2014/10/14/elements-of-art-form/"> KQED ART SCHOOL</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Presentation by<a href="http://www.andro.gr/drasi/ο-νίκος-μαγγίτσης-των-7-κορυφών/"> Nikos Maggitsis</a> (athlete and mountain climber)</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Fifteen minute break</p>
<p dir="ltr">5. Short Power Point presentation on the history of &lsquo;Art and Athletics&rsquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">6. Athletic poses: each student takes turns posing while the other members of the group draw the particular athletic pose (tennis, basketball, baseball, etc.) using a simple line and shape technique.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Day 2</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Three dimensional form: each student selects the one of their drawings to use in creating a form of their two dimensional drawing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Cutting out the form: each student draws and cuts their form from a cardboard box using and exacto knife.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Collage: using old newspapers or magazines each student cuts out appropriate clothing and equipment for their form.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. Drawing: each student draws facial characteristics using magic markers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Day 3</p>
<p dir="ltr">Collaborative synthesis of all the final &lsquo;athletic forms&rsquo; created by each student. &nbsp;All the students participate in creating a large canvas (2,5cm x 3 cm) made from cardboard boxes which will serve as the background for their individual forms. &nbsp;Once the background is complete each students glues their form on the large canvas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Effects</p>
<p dir="ltr">I had expected the students to be more engaged when meeting and listening to Niko Maggitsi talk about his mountaineering expeditions. &nbsp;Only two parts of the entire project seemed to excite them most. &nbsp;The first was activity 6 on Day 1: athletic poses. &nbsp;They were enthusiastic, engaged, joyful and extremely creative not only in their poses but also their drawing of each pose. &nbsp;The second part was the<a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.918935558224591.1073741835.816271648490983&type=3"> final result</a>; they were amazed at the beauty and simplicity of the final work of art and couldn&rsquo;t believe that they had created it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Results</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was well aware of the fact and expected that most of the students would not engage themselves in the project more than they had to in order to complete the task I had prepared for them. &nbsp;I think this is understandable for several reasons. &nbsp;First of all, they could not have a clear understanding of the whole project and how it might culminate into a collaborative work of art because they were not involved in the organizational process. &nbsp;Secondly, they were asked to immerse themselves in a subject matter, athletics, which perhaps held little meaning to them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I had hoped that by the end of the project the students would at least be able to appreciate and hold in higher esteem their own personal artistic abilities but I did not expect that the final result would have such a positive impact on them. &nbsp;The students were not only impressed at their own capabilities but that with such little effort and with the use of mostly recycled materials they could create a beautiful work of art. &nbsp;Several commented that they were anxious to use the project and tasks and materials in their own classroom students.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reflections</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was very pleased that the students were overjoyed with what they had created but next time, I would definitely involve them more in the overall organization and process of the project so that they might gain more insight not only at the end but also during the creative process. &nbsp;</p>

              <title>SAT: A case study in understanding the impact of openness on CPD: how does sharing lesson footage across an open platform enhance professional development?(Mulligan)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8885</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8885</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The need for effective Continuing Professional Development (CPD) in teaching is bigger now than ever before in Northern Ireland. This case study is born out of a desire to reflect and develop as a teacher in a contextual environment which is currently not facilitating that demand. Budget cuts and area-based planning mean that schools are shrinking, teachers are being cut and the duties that teachers are being asked to take on are becoming more diverse.</p>
<p>Current CPD in Northern Ireland (NI) involves a once a year lesson observation from a senior teacher and the filling in of paperwork to show the inspectors. This is uninspiring and unhelpful in a challenging and competitive profession which needs good quality training, with investment from leaders and realistic ideas for how to remain fresh and innovative. Bill Gates (2013) is a strong proponent of teachers receiving ‘real feedback’ in America and there is no doubt that this is very much required for professionals who want to retain their jobs in the current educational climate in NI.</p>
<p>So how can openness and a fifty pound video camera enhance professional development at this crucial time for a teacher in NI: by innovating conventional CPD and opening up a classroom to peers across the world. It is time to put CPD back in the hands of the people who are at the centre of the process; the teachers. The innovation is that of sharing short clips and asking specific questions about them. The hope is that it could offer more effective feedback than an annual lesson observation. The openness element involves sharing lesson footage openly with peers online who would never normally be privy to classroom practice.</p>
<p>The conference presentation will focus on presenting a case study of a trial version of this within the H818 community. The case study being the artefact, the presentation will be a multi-media tour of the key elements of the case study including clips from the classroom in Northern Ireland, screen shots of peer feedback from within H818 and an evaluation of the efficacy of the process in comparison to current CPD arrangements in Northern Ireland. There is a degree of de-formalising the process of CPD within this case study. And this, essentially, is the point. Holmes (2013, p. 97) calls this concept of sharing and learning with peers, ‘informal learning’. The hope is that this peer review process, which has been a significant design feature of the H818 module, can be applied to a teacher in Northern Ireland who is hoping to glean as much as possible to improve specific aspects of teaching and learning within the classroom.</p>
<p>Attendees will leave the presentation with an increased awareness of how making CPD more open might engender better quality feedback. They may also come away with ideas for how to refresh their own CPD in an informal, discreet yet effective way.</p>

<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Actors </strong>(who is involved?)</p>
<p>Teachers in primary and secondary school education</p>
<p>Team of facilitators - depending on the number of teachers/participants to enroll.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goals </strong>(why?)</p>
<p>Train teachers to create more attractive dynamic digital resources to use in the classroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Settings</strong> (where &amp; when?)</p>
<p>The training will take place in post-working hours for a period of 4 weeks. This project aims to be firstly a version in the b-learning system, to facilitate the integration of teachers who have more difficulty or are more adverse to novelty and innovation. . But during the weeks the regime will tend to direct into the e-learning system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Objects </strong>(what things are involved?)</p>
<p>Computer / Desktop / tablet PC/ notebook / iPhone / smartphone, Internet connection, course platform, email and free Web 2.0 tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong> (what happens to actors?)</p>
<p>The course is provided by the Teachers&rsquo; Training Centre, through the Ministry of Education and announced in every school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Events </strong>(what do actors do?)</p>
<p>After a registration on the platform that will serve as the basis of the course, students will be asked to perform various tasks to be published in digital e-portfolio. They are then called to reflect and share ideas on thematic forums on the tools in use. The facilitators will give feedback in a maximum period of 24 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> (what is achieved?)</p>
<p>Realization of digital resources using Web 2.0 tools to make an e-portfolio with all the digital resources used by participants, these separated by areas of interest.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your design:</strong> (what role does your design play?)</p>
<p>The project is to help teachers produce more attractive and creative digital resources with the use of web 2.0 tools in order to assist in their teaching roles.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Lauren</strong> is a disabled swimmer with cerebral palsy who has a national classification as competitive swimmer and would like to take some of the e-learning modules on such topics as nutrition and hydration and preparing for competition. The key issues for her are mobility, coordination and sight issues since childhood. In her case self-belief derives from supportive and encouraging parents and the specialist schools. An assessment got her a Macintosh computer and she uses a minidisk recorder and can sometimes claim a taxi to workshops when needed.<br /><br /><strong>George</strong> is a qualified ASA Level 2 teacher with some hearing impairment and wishes to take a Level 2 Coaching course to qualify to work with squad swimmers. &nbsp;He used a note taker for exams - all video clips would required a transcript. In an earlier risk appraisal between the club and pool operator a number of fire alarms required the addition of a flashing light and a policy of informing the duty manager when poolside was adopted so that staff - the lifeguard in particular, understood the aural signalling alone might not be adequate.<br /><br /><strong>Emma</strong> is a competitive squad athlete interested in working &lsquo;poolside&rsquo; as a teacher who is dyslexic - they know from a positive college experience that overlays, or her choices of font colours and backgrounds goes a long way to solve the problems. Her Line Manager, the Head Coach, is aware of the value of providing her with swimming schedules printed on coloured sheets of paper.</p>]]></description>

<p>Teachers nowadays are asked to update themselves on the materials they use to give lessons in a more attractive way to their students. But the reality is that students sometimes have greater ease and knowledge in the use of technology, so it is important to equip teachers to find the tools at their disposal in web 2.0 for free. This project aims to be firstly a version in the b-learning system, to facilitate the integration of teachers who have more difficulty or are more adverse to novelty and innovation.</p>

<p>The approach will be sought through a training regime in b-learning in order to motivate trainees and clarify any doubts that may occur at morecomplex moments in theclassroom.

In the beginning there will be more classroom sessions and toward the end of the training there will be the use of the e-learning system using videoconferencing one hour a week to clear doubts. The whole course will run from Moodle, Blog, GoogleDocs, Prezi, Youtube, Wikispaces, and videoconferencing amongst others &hellip;</p>

              <title>Inquiry of Design for Learning</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6477</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6477</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The overarching aim of the proposed research is to solidify the theoretical foundations of the field of Learning Design, construct a comprehensive methodological framework on these foundations, and develop a set of tools to support this framework.</p>
<p>Learning Design is the act of devising new practices, plans of activity, resources and tools aimed at achieving educational aims. Concepts central to the discussion are context, practice, and change. The context of learning design encompasses the material, social and intentional factors which define the space in which learners and educators operate. Practice includes both epistemic practice (&ldquo;How we learn&rdquo;) and pedagogical practice (&ldquo;how we teach&rdquo;). Finally, design always aims to change existing situations into desired ones. There is a need for formalisms and methodologies that allow a scientific and operational articulation of these elements.</p>
<p>The proposed research will integrate three existing constructs - design narratives, design principles and design patterns, and propose a fourth form &ndash; design scenarios. Design narratives describe a concrete practical challenge in a defined domain, the actions taken to resolve it and their unfolding effects. Design principles are imperative statements which synthesize the findings of scientific research in a manner accessible for practitioners and summarise insights from practical experience to inform scientific discourse. Patterns are generalised narratives, offering a canonical description of a common challenge, the characteristics of the context in which it occurs, and a possible method of solution. Scenarios complete the picture by projecting design claims into the future as hypothesized narratives.</p>
<p>The objectives of this research will include:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Articulating conceptual and operational formalisms for capturing context, epistemic and pedagogical practice, and models of change.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploring methodologies, situated in defined domains of practice, for eliciting such representations and utilising them effectively in supporting educational innovation.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhancing existing software tools to support these methodologies and facilitate the activity of a vibrant researcher and practitioner community committed to them.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establishing a culture of practitioner design inquiry in TEL, in which educators use the representations, methodologies and tools above to sustain scientifically informed creative practices in their professional context.</p>]]></description>

              <title>The ‘Gamification’ of GIS for teaching and learning</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6356</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6356</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Geographic information systems (GIS) are powerful tools that help us make sense of geographic data. These systems take different forms, ranging from functionally simple interfaces (e.g. Google Maps) to complex, comprehensive analytical toolkits (e.g. ESRI ArcGIS), but all of them let us integrate, manipulate, analyse and also visualise geographically referenced data from disparate sources.&nbsp; Hence, a GIS allows us to put geographic data into context.&nbsp; The result is accessible geographic information that helps us make decisions and solve a wide range of spatial problems.</p>
<p>In particular, a GIS can support &lsquo;sensemaking&rsquo; for teaching and learning purposes through contextualising information and scaffolding small group augmentations.&nbsp; Furthermore, mobile GIS can increase sensemaking by linking abstract concepts <em>in-situ</em> to fieldwork activities.&nbsp; The elements of GIS that appear to be particular beneficial for teaching and learning are those that relate to the whole learning experience and how a learner develops their conceptual understanding through that experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the efficiency and usability of these systems has been limited by a poor understanding of exactly how GIS relates to the learner&rsquo;s experience and their developing conceptual understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast to GIS, games systems have focused research on understanding the gamer&rsquo;s experience and, when used for learning purposes, their supported progression through understanding concepts.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gamification&rsquo; has been employed as a term to describe the process of bringing gaming elements into the design of non-gaming systems.&nbsp; These elements can vary from the simplistic use of reward and reputation systems (badges, points, levels, leaderboards) to abstract concepts of &lsquo;funology&rsquo;.&nbsp; More recent research has merged gaming with virtual world research to unpick cognitive issues relevant to the design of systems for learning and sensemaking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This paper presents work-in-progress with results from 118 participants in an online questionnaire detailing spatial concepts for GIS system.&nbsp; These are related to the design of GIS for learners&rsquo; experiences and their conceptual understanding.&nbsp; Finally, initial developments and walkthroughs will be presented on the gamification of GIS with GIS maps translated into 3D gaming and virtual worlds.&nbsp; Discussions around the roles of &lsquo;flow&rsquo;, &lsquo;immersion&rsquo; and &lsquo;1<sup>st</sup> person perspectives&rsquo; for GIS experiences will be explored.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Training pre-service teachers in the lifelong learning sector is challenging - inexperienced ones are overwhelmed and experienced ones are blas&eacute;.&nbsp; HE teachers see nothing wrong in delivering long lectures.&nbsp; FE teachers want to focus on classroom management - just get the students to behave, never mind the learning.&nbsp; ACL teachers feel very responsible for their learners - nurturing.</p>
<p>As their teacher educator I have to be constantly creative - my focus is 50% on knowledge and skills and 50% on attitude.</p>
<p>If you also train teachers in this sector - please share your experiences and good practices.</p>]]></description>

<p>Hi there everyone</p>
<p>I will start the discussion with a question</p>
<p>Is technology being used for technologies sake in the class room.?..</p>

<p>Or...are technological tools being<em> installed</em> in the classroom for 'technology''s sake but not really used?</p>

<p>thats an interesting observation and something I have seen supported in my own observations in schools.&nbsp; From what I have observed the technology is there and being used but a such a minimal level that it is basically an illuminated blackboard.</p>
<p>The problem that I can see for teaching staff is the vast array of functions that modern technology makes available. To take advantage of this new functionality you have to be a professional programmer or have access to the sort of IT support and development which frankly cannot be found at the average school.&nbsp; When observing I ahve thought of a number of wyas in which a presentation could be made more interactive with a little macro here or bit of code there...but how can you ask an already busy teacher to sit down and learn modern programming techniques.</p>
<p>I think the answer is much better IT support in schools with staff capable of taking on development jobs and building new intereactive solutions within the school. Too often I see technology installed and underused or as a recently mismanaged but inadequately trained IT staff.</p>
<p>My answer is thus better support for teachers from an IT view point and stronger encouragement to pass on development of new presentations to professional IT staff or hight experienced IT / Teaching staff.</p>

<p>I am lucky enough to have a dry wipe board as well as an interactive whiteboard and internet access. I tend to find the PhET website phet.colorado.edu gets used most lessons. Also Southampton Universities "Waves" resource is excellent for moving diagrams. The advantage over other interactive resources is there is nothing to program or install. Students can also use the applets to try things out. The applets and moving diagrams show extra information that you cannot see in real life but help in the learning process. It is also nice to be able to record information from class/group work in text documents or spreadsheets to make it available for later analysis or review. With so the variety of students to accomodate the technology has to be easy to use and reliable. Some technology is amazing if you can afford to give it your full attention but that is not what we want to do. Having someone show you how easy something is helps to overcome the initial reluctance. I would be lost without my technology toys.</p>

<p>Hi Chris - good to see you in this discussion! And thanks for sharing a few subject specific tools (any chance of the links...:-) ) I agree that having someone showing us that creative use of technology doesn't have to be an all or nothing element in our learning designs is really important, and also hearing about the experiences of experienced teachers who can now not think about teaching in any other way.</p>
<p>Prof, I come (like Chris) from FE and my experience of schools education is limited but I'd say that FE does have techie people about the place but that in itself is not enough. My experience is that few IT support folk have the pedagogical understanding to support the <em>teaching</em> part of teaching with technology. I think there is a real need for a defined learning technologist role in schools, as there is is most HE institutions and some FE. Someone who's job it is to keep on top of new ideas and uses of technology for learning and teaching and share best practice.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[If you want teachers to learn about different strategies for assessing pupils and you start by presenting the strategies one after the other, they may end up with little idea of when to apply each one. 

This team instead gave groups students a realistic problem: for example, parents at their school are complaining about the stress caused by repeated maths tests, and the Head of Maths has asked the students to come up with a new plan for maths assessment in the school. 

Each group then investigated a range of 22 assessment strategies through multimedia resources, including for each strategy video of real classroom use, sample pupil work, and comments from teachers and experts.

They then presented their findings, in role as a new teacher in the school, with the rest of the class taking the role of other members of staff, parents, or others as appropriate.

The collaborative element was important to encourage students to articulate and defend their growing understanding of assessment issues.

              <title>Adding multimedia value to specialist teacher training</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/76</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/76</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I helped design and write multimedia resources for Oxford Brookes University’s delivery of the National Training Programme for Gifted and Talented Coordinators during 2000.
<p>
The teachers being trained for this specialist role studied independently through distance learning materials, using a conferencing website to work and share ideas with others in their tutor group.
<p>
The multimedia resources which were part of the materials contained two main components: (1) audio extracts from interviews with experienced G&T Coordinators, and (2) video clips of dramatised scenes showing the problems faced by two fictional G&T Coordinators in their schools. These were edited or scripted to match the curriculum, which was organised around management issues. Each of them was embedded within a learning activity to encourage students to identify the management issues involved in the specific case and relate the example to their own circumstances.
<p>
Assessment of the course was through submission of a reflective portfolio and a report of a small-scale action research project.
