              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>You learn by doing and collaborating, watching videos, accessing just-in-time information from your mobile device, mentoring, and more. Why, then, does the Human Resources department only give you slides to learn from?</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s workers and corporations are united in wanting more access to the formal, non-formal, and informal learning needed to support an increasingly skilled workforce (The Education Commission, 2016; Pew Research Center, 2016a and 2016b). However, today&rsquo;s corporations largely store their learning resources in virtual learning environments (VLEs) that have adopted a uniform way of storing content. This uniform way, called SCORM, was incredibly helpful when it was designed nineteen years ago, and it still has an important role to play today. When SCORM was created, computer-based training was relatively new and organisations needed a single way to store and track training. For a time, innovation in elearning stopped at the known, established boundaries of the VLE (Weller, 2014, p. 194).</p>
<p>Now, a new need has developed: a way to store and track learning when it occurs on mobile devices, or through social and collaborative activities, or offline by reading a book or engaging in stretch assignments, or when participating in simulations or augmented and virtual reality programmes.</p>
<p>An innovation that meets that need was first released in 2013, and had its last planned update in 2016. It is the Experience API (xAPI). xAPI provides a common format for capturing data from today&rsquo;s distributed learning landscape (Rustici Software, n.d.). With xAPI in place, you can free staff development from the confines of SCORM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rely less on elearning courses designed from slides and more on learning experiences;</li>
<li>Recognise learning from formal and informal or non-formal activities (Downes, 2015);</li>
<li>And track not only clicks and views but also correlate learning with performance (Torrance, 2016).</li>
</ul>
<p>Managers and other decision-makers within learning departments and organisations are at a critical point. They need a source from which to gain a high-level, jargon-free understanding of the benefits of xAPI, common applications and uses of xAPI to support learners as they access modern and innovative learning opportunities, best practices and lessons learned, and information they should provide to their learning development and learning technology teams to prepare for implementation of xAPI (HT2 Labs, n.d.).</p>
<p>In my conference presentation, I will discuss and share a workshop created to meet those needs. The workshop helps managers, even those without extensive technical backgrounds, to be prepared to move forward with discussions and decisions about xAPI within their organisation. My presentation will show some of the workshop features and provide attendees with tools they can take with them, for use in their future endeavours.</p>

              <title>&quot;Everything I need to know I learnt from World of Warcraft&quot;: why we might need to start asking better questions about games, simulations and virtual worlds</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Keynote abstract:</p>
<p>Like                    many areas of educational technology research, a lot  of the                    work that focuses on games, simulations and virtual  worlds consists                    of case studies that demonstrate proof of concept,  enthusiastic                    position pieces or success stories. All of this is  important:                    we need to know what sort of things we can use these  technologies                    to do, so as to build a broader repertoire of teaching  practices.                    However, this kind of focus neglects a range of other  questions                    and issues that may prove more important in the longer  term.</p>
<p>For                    example, educational research about games typically  emphasises                    the way that playing motivates players; it ignores how  successful                    games (such as massively multiplayer online games)  often feel                    like work, and it also glosses over the way that  bringing a                    game inside the curriculum changes the way that  'players' relate                    to it. There are also inconsistencies in the way games  are thought                    about: the idea that they cause violence is often  criticised                    as over-simplistic, yet the idea that they cause  learning isn't.                    In virtual worlds, opportunities to create new  identities is                    widespread, but questions about how this relates to  our embodied                    relationships are rarely asked. In simulations,  'realism' is                    celebrated - but this means that simulations will  always be                    second best to actual experiences, and it ignores how  groups                    can disagree about whether something is realistic or  not. Across                    this work, the complexity of learning and teaching  seems hidden                    by the desire to promote the value of these  technologies.</p>
<p>This                    talk will offer some examples of work that, in small  ways, try                    to engage with these kinds of issue. Different  priorities will                    be suggested, which invite a new kind of engagement  with research                    and practice in this area.</p>]]></description>
