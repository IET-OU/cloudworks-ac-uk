              <title>Creating a visual Learning Aid for Ebsco&#39;s Discovery Service</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11620</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11620</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title:&nbsp;</strong>Using Discovery - Visual Learning Aid</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:&nbsp;</strong>Marie Smith</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>When they arrive, many of our first year students have a &ldquo;Google mentality&rdquo; and are used to typing their essay titles into Google to find information. Ebsco's Discovery emulates Google in that it finds articles, books and other academic material through a single search. However, it is so much <strong>more</strong> than this. I wanted to help our <strong>first year</strong> students make the transition from further education to higher education, and showing them how to search electronic resources with confidence would be a step towards achieving this.</p>
<p>Ebsco's Discovery is a search engine that finds articles, books and other academic material through a single search. I was looking at how students were&nbsp; using the Discovery service, how successful their searches were, and how satisfied they were with the Discovery search tool in general. The qualitative data from snap focus groups, along with quantitative data gleaned from a simple questionnaire I designed, and first-hand experience &ndash; talking to students and showing them how to use the Discovery tool while working on the Enquiries Desk - suggested that they weren't using filters to refine their searches and were getting too many results.</p>
<p><strong>Task&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>To provide a simple, visual learning aid that breaks down the steps of a Discovery search. To improve the student experience, enabling students to search Discovery with confidence to find meaningful results.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>I hoped to produce a simple flowchart &ndash; a visual learning tool that would guide students through the process of searching Discovery and refining their results. Success criteria = Students becoming more confident in their abilities, and ready to embrace more in-depth search techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>I discovered that I was rubbish at producing flowcharts - and just to reiterate, the aim of my project was to produce a SIMPLE, visual learning aid. My flowchart was anything BUT simple! It also didn&rsquo;t break down the steps in the way that I hoped it would, and didn&rsquo;t convey a lot of the information that I wanted to share with our students. It was time to go back to the drawing board<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>In the end I decided to use a tree diagram as a visual learning aid. While I was reading about visual literacy, I discovered that the most memorable visualizations are the ones that feature natural images. This being the case, I decided to make an actual tree a key feature of my visual learning aid. Completing this project was a valuable lesson. I found the courage to admit when my design wasn't working, and began thinging about other courses of action. In the end I was much happier with my visual learning aid, which is now available of the University Library website as both an animation, and as a poster. It is also used by the Faculty Librarians in their teaching, and I use it during my one-to-ones with students.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Creating a video for distance learners sitting exams</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9854</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9854</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>I was tasked with producing a video for our students all of whom are studying as distance learners. The video was to show dos and donts for sitting exams.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>Some of our students study independently, some at a college (using our syllabus and materials). Most of the students are overseas. It is very important that examination procedure is clearly and succinctly communicated to all of our students. The video was to be short (around 3 minutes) and accessible to all. I had 2 months to produce the video so that it was ready before the exam session.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>I wanted to produce a video with the following:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Concise yet informative</em></li>
<li><em>Text graphics so that the sound does not need to be on to be watched<br /></em></li>
<li><em>Clear narration so it can be accessed by visually impaired students </em></li>
<li><em>Institutional branding throughout (logos, colour schemes)</em></li>
<li><em>Footage of &ldquo;students&rdquo; sitting an exam to be included, shots of important elements such as ID, water bottles, calculators etc</em></li>
<li><em>Footage to include a diverse group of students to reflect our student body</em></li>
<li><em>Footage to contain no reference to the year so video does not quickly date</em></li>
<li><em>Graphic list of dos and donts for clarity</em></li>
<li><em>A link to be in the video to the Exams page on our website</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Measure of success:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>High quality video that met the points above</em></li>
<li><em>Successfully viewed by 1000s of students<br /></em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Met with the colleague who requested the video to make a list of requirements</li>
<li>After the meeting check my list of requirements matched colleague's</li>
<li>Wrote the script</li>
<li>Asked the colleague to check the script against his checklist</li>
<li>Amended script accordingly</li>
<li>Got a quote from video producer (outside agency), gave her timeline for finished work</li>
<li>Storyboarded script so that video producer could write a shot list/timings for filming</li>
<li>Booked rooms to film mock "exams"</li>
<li>Recruited colleagues to act as students</li>
<li>Recruited a colleague with a clear voice to act as narrator</li>
<li>Shot the footage and recorded narration</li>
<li>Reviewed producer&rsquo;s finished work- noted several things were unclear (dos and don&rsquo;ts were written with same colour background, narration did not make it clear which were dos and which were donts).</li>
<li>Producer put background of donts in red and dos in green and added a big &ldquo;do&rdquo; or &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo; graphic at the beginning of each section. Producer cut the narration so that &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo; was said at the beginning of each &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo;</li>
<li>Passed draft 2 of video to colleagues for review, including by audio/visually impaired staff and received comments</li>
<li>Tweaked video to add University tag line at the end</li>
<li>Distributed video via You Tube and the University Portal</li>
<li>Posted video on webpage</li>
<li>Emailed students about the video as well as updating Twitter/Facebook</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>Despite providing a clear and detailed script, there were still hiccups where the producer did not entirely understand what she was supposed to be doing. All of my correspondence was done via email, next time I will schedule a face to face meeting as talking is quicker and she would have had space to ask questions.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Distribution was important, no point in producing an amazing video and have no-one watch it. Slow hit rate at first as the video was hidden on the website and posted on Facebook and Twitter (but not &ldquo;boosted&rdquo;). Putting a link on the home page carousel and emailing the students directly resulted in much higher viewing figures.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I met my objectives overall, time was an issue and last year viewing figures could have been much higher but we launched it very close to exam time. This year figures were very high indeed.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>The video was well received and helped the students feel like part of the University. There were fewer queries regarding examination procedure because the video overview provided knowledge and a sense of understanding for the students.<br /></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

              <title>SAT: What gives a tutor the X Factor: Examining the criteria for successful online learning facilitation (Sarah Quinnell)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8556</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8556</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Establishing connection with students has long been acknowledged as an important factor in facilitating learning. Anyone involved in distance education will be familiar with the feelings of anxiety and isolation expressed by students studying away from campus. A close and successful face-to-face relationship with students is considered by many academics to be a powerful aspect of their professional identity, essential for creating meaningful learning experiences and in some cases, a contributing factor in their resistance to e-learning. This paper looks at how we create these personal relationships in an online environment. What does it mean to communicate vitality, conviction and feeling? What does &lsquo;being there&rsquo; with students mean in an online learning environment? What do learners want from their tutors? <br /><br />I identify and examine the factors and criteria that students use to rate the performance of their tutors and look at what it tells us, as e-learning practitioners, about what students value in their relationships with their tutors. Data was collected from four groups of students undertaking two vocational marketing certificates offered by UK organisations. Each group of students was asked to rate their Class Tutor on a scale of 1 &ndash; 5, where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent, after each class for a period of three months. At the end of this period the students were presented with a questionnaire that asked them to reflect upon the reasons for their ratings. A further set of focus groups, undertaken either in person or using synchrous messaging technology, were arranged to discuss the issues further. As both courses have face-to-face and online versions, which delivered the same materials, by the same tutors over the same period of time, I was able to compare criteria to begin to understand how technology impacts upon the relationships tutors have / can build with their students. <br /><br />The research found that online learners place greater importance on what I classify as &lsquo;performance&rsquo; criteria and how much they have been &lsquo;entertained&rsquo; rather than the subject matter being presented. With reference to the impact of technology the data illustrated that in face-to-face teaching technological malfunctions had a negligible impact on tutor ratings, whereas for online students technical malfunctions cause significant negative impacts on tutor ratings. I go on to discuss the impact of these criteria on the implementation and further development of online learning environments, specifically in relation to setting and managing students experiences of online learning. The paper concludes by considering what this means for both learning technologists and tutors in the design and delivery of online learning content. While this paper begins to understand what learners value in terms of the tutors role in delivering online learning, in doing so, it raises a number of questions relating to how we look to meet these concerns and ensure that students expectations are managed and met prior to enrolment, during and after they have finished their qualifications.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8303</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I am an Associate Lecturer with the Open University, teaching on Psychology modules at first and second level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past 2 years I have been offering Elluminate tutorials to supplement and replace the face to face tutorials that students are offered.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have found that there are some topics that Elluminate can&nbsp;handle reasonably well - the more practical sessions such as acquiring skills using SPSS or conducting a thematic analysis.&nbsp;and some that don't.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would&nbsp;love&nbsp;to hear from others on the subject.</p>
<p>I would like to find ways of making the experience less about the technology and more about the subject matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have a particular pedagogical&nbsp;approach in mind,&nbsp; although student activity is an important element.</p>
<p>I would also like to see whether I can develop some basic study skills sessions - eg.&nbsp;essay writing, critical thinking, &nbsp;and would welcome collaboration with anyone else with similar interests.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[I have been so immersed in e-learning these last few weeks that I am dreaming about it - and not to waste the opportunity I am blogging about the dream as I was in a digital ocean of my own making. Indeed for the last three years I have described Web 1.0 as a digital ocean and Web 2.0 as a universal water-cyle that includes clouds, river systems and oceans.

Context and personality is all in relation to my activity in the OLDs MOOC. 

I have just completed the OU's Masters in Open & Distance Education. End of Module Assignment went off on Jan 17. I wanted to do H817 to bring H807, also on innivations in e-learning as it was somewat rusty in content - too long on the ocean and more obvious to someone who was working in a web agency producing web-based learning for the Department of Health and FT knowledge in 2001. In all of this I would have been the senior producer or web editor - words and content rather than learning design or programming. OLDs MOOC would help bring things into focus and contrast the fast turn around of one or two hour e-learning for corporates such as Virgin, Lloyds Bank and KPMG. The pattern of activity is largelly the same with some nodes of activity reduced, some increased, while evaluation, quality assurance, proof reading and testing happened at several stages from beginning to end - I would proof read proposal documents at one end then pick up what we called the wireframe, that take spots of interest in the build in a wiki like platform as a group of six or so colleagues built the thing. I'd test inhouse, then test again once the content is on the client server. More of the same in Brighton, something of a cluster of e-learning compsnies, was on the cards until conversations with friends and indications of how I might continue had me thinking about doctoral research.

I pressed on each week with the activities just as I do with the OU - have a fair stab at it all, team up, comment and collaborate. I grab screens, take photos and blog at every opportunity. My ideas for design were too off the edge to attract interest but I found a home and four or more of us got on with this.

A few things happened or kept hapenning. I don't know how to describe it but I am always lost in Cloudworks. It isn't even cloudlike in the sense of a fluid, vibrsnt system, rather, I'm affraid it has been more like a visit to Macro at Killingworth New Town outside Newcastle upon Tyne. An urban environment but little sense of anyone being there. I've been blogging since 1999 and even then tended to get a reciprocal response to comments I left on my stuff.  Between three of us, and then two, we wrote and exchanged in Google Docs and then by email. More often thsn not others would cut and paste my content in as I was broken down in a cul de sac somewhere.

Still, the last MOOC I did felt like standing in Liverpool station during a six month ling rush hour wearing an invisibility cloak.

The other reason I needed to put my efforts elsewhere is that I started OU Module H808 Practice-based research in educational technology. Forking out £1250 tends to focus the mind especially as meat, alcohol, and most travel has been ditched to cover this.

So, detailed blogs for weeks 1-4 or to 5 while following closely since saving emails, reading bosts, and saving links all for a return later this year. Several times 'the penny dropped' so from a Design point of view I have much to build on even though I suspect I will continue to be employed as a consultsnt, project manager and writer however much I would like to play with the Lego myself.]]></description>

              <title>The 3 Letters of Learning Design - GBU (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7923</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7923</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/S-iRSsnQJsxy5BnfKqOCc9MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-nmMN-qWw0dk/UQtXxCe5RCI/AAAAAAAAi1Q/9wfCtderi5A/s800/JENGA.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I love the simplicity of <a class="zem_slink" title="Jenga" href="http://www.hasbro.com/games/en_US/jenga/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Jenga</a>. </strong></p>
<p>Simplicity has a purity about it. Don't knock it. Behind its functionality and its look and feel there will be some hard thinking. Keep it simple, stupid (<a class="zem_slink" title="KISS principle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">K.I.S.S</a>) may be a training cliche but there is considerable truth in it. I've now had three years here at <a class="zem_slink" title="Open University" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.025,-0.705555555556&spn=0.01,0.01&q=52.025,-0.705555555556 (Open University)&t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">the OU</a> and here on this Student Blog platform (short of five days). I've been working on my ideas regarding learning and e-learning design in particular. Courtesy of THE OU hosted <a title="OLDS Mooc 2013" href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course">OLDs MOOC 2013</a> (Online Learning Design - <a class="zem_slink" title="Massive open online course" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Massive Open Online Course</a>) I'm experiencing what feels like undertaking an 8 week written examination - the contents of my brain are being pushed through the cookie cutter. And out comes this: <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Il Buono, il Brutto, il Cattivo.)" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/good_the_bad_and_the_ugly" rel="rottentomatoes" target="_blank">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a>.</strong> <em>(Of course I had shut down for the gadgets for the day and was brushing my teeth when this came to me).</em></p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/D2bXDdrcCSYGhwT0f3LEiNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0Ce0f0Wpyi8/UQtY6oKjJ5I/AAAAAAAAi2c/-b5CsHcMBoQ/s288/The%20good.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<p>Learning events or activities, moments that make the participant smile, think, reflect, nod in agreement, understand, be informed and generally feel good about the world and this particular learning experience. Hit them with some of this, as the say so succinctly across the Atlantic - at the 'get go'.</p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xUqWmeLuB0QOqucJi6k559MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zR7R8ogXYIc/UQtZAD_QDfI/AAAAAAAAi3Y/aeF3UVn7Dfk/s288/The%20bad.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<p>The effort required and built into the learning. OK, we want them to love this too, and you can if you're 'in the flow', have done your work, have wrestled with what you didn't understand, asked for help, listen to fellow students, gone out of your way to do extra reading and research until you have it, one way or another.</p>
<p><strong>There needs to be assessment.</strong></p>
<p>An assignment is a soft assessment to me - though like everyone I have terrible days when the thing just slips through my fingers like a snowball on the beach. A dissertation or end of module assignment is tougher, but tough and 'bad' in a certain way - like commitment to a triathlon. And a good analogy as working on and developing three issues at 2,000 words a pop is about right. And you won't get far if you leave training to the week before. It's a slow burn.</p>
<p><strong>The 'bad' has to be the written examination.</strong></p>
<p>They have to be hated and feared, and like learning lines for that school play, you have to get it right on the night (or day). And what do you do if you act? You have good lines to learn, you learn and rehearse your lines and you practice, and do a test run or two. The curtains going up is the equivalent of your turning the examination paper over. I feel the fear from a year ago - April 2012. I hadn't sat a written exam in 30 years. All my undergraduate and school-boy fears came back. I used rusty techniques that had last seen service during my first degree. Bad is good. You want to do everything not to feel like you are naked on stage - a dream we all have when faced with such an 'exposing' test? <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/wWqqYfaV0PTh72j4OhD1ldMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IvhCwe5Layc/UQtZGBhaShI/AAAAAAAAi3g/Q-hkvFUPdk8/s288/The%20ugly.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Ugly</strong></p>
<p>Shock 'em. Not scare the witless. Have up your sleeve some smart stuff. Whether an idea or the technology offer a creepy and certainly memorable surprise. Boring a student into making a fact or issue stick is like throwing mud at a brick wall - it'll stick, it'll coagulate and build up, but is easily washed away in a shower and destroyed in a storm. Use storytelling techniques perhaps, better still, follow the pattern of a ghost story. Scare them? I'm back on fear I guess. We humans are fearful of many things and will go out of our way to avoid, run away or confront our fears. As I said, the idea here isn't to lose your students, but to empathise with them, understand the ugly side of their learning experience then help them confront their worst fears. It is ugly having to tackle the parts of a subject that stink, but inevitably these are the blocks at the base of JENGA.</p>
<p>My primary colours for learning design, not red, blue and yellow, but good, bad and ugly. We'll have to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So can I apply it? And can I go back to bed now?</strong></p>
<p>Which leads me to another theme - we no longer simply bring work home with us, we take it to bed and sleep with it. If this pisses you off then let me introduce you to 'working with dreams'. If you are prepared to get up for an hour in the dead of night, or can flick on a light without invoking divorce then scribble stuff down to catalyse the thought in the morning. Can work wonders, can produce nonsense, can just be some things you need to put on the supermarket shopping list ... or another dream of being naked on the stage, not knowing your lines and needing the lo but all the exits are locked and the orchestra has stopped and you have to say something. <em>Which, courtesy of the wonders of the mind, has me in the front row of a performance of The Tempest at the University Theatre, Newcastle when I was 13 or 14. Caliban was naked, covered in mud and wearing a prosthetic erect penis.</em></p>
<p><strong>HORROR!</strong></p>
<p><em>P.S. And give me 20 minutes searching the Internet and I will be able to name the actor, date the show and possibly even find a picture. Perhaps you'd like to have a go. But before you do so, be very fearful of what the search terms you use might throw up. </em> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>P.P.S. I've given up (for now). It may have been David Suchet or Jim Carter. The production was in 1974 at the University Theatre.&nbsp;</em></p>]]></description>

<p>I reckon myself as an experienced practitioner of learning design; indeed, I consider that I was practising it before the term was invented or at least in common currency - as an "educational editor" at Learning Materials Design from 1994, working on an OU model under the guidance of Jane Wolfson (ex-OU), Richard Freeman (ex- National Extension College and Open College) and, through his textbooks, Derek Rowntree (then of the OU's IET.</p>
<p>So what's my interest in this MOOC?</p>
<p>I hope, first, to find out what other people thing learning design is. Second, to get some experience of participating in a MOOC. Third to refresh my own design practice and generally relate what we're doing in my part of my university to what's going on elsewhere.</p>]]></description>

              <title>The iTunes U at the OU learner</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>iTunes U was launched in 2007 as a repository of digital educational material provided by Universities in the US.&nbsp; In 2008 the OU joined the service and now hosts more than 350 collections of materials (audio, video, eBooks).&nbsp; Since its launch, iTunes U has delivered over 300 million downloads.&nbsp; Of these, 34 million are from iTunes U at the OU.&nbsp; Despite its popularity, little is known about the type of user who downloads iTunes U resources, or their use of the resources.&nbsp; This paper will present the results of a major survey of users of iTunes U at the OU.&nbsp; The survey ran for 20 months and collected more than 2000 responses.&nbsp; The paper will provide data on the kind of user who downloads iTunes U at the OU resources, what they do with the materials they download, and what they think of them as a learning resource.</p>
<p>The popularity of portable media players and podcasting has increased enormously in the last few years. Some researchers were quick to identify the potential uses and benefits of podcasting for learning. Among these is the fact that the materials are delivered in a format that is portable, convenient and easy to use as well as easy to access. To a large extent, the quick take-up of podcasting as a new technology was due to the success of the iTunes software for the delivery and management of audiovisual resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; iTunes U was launched in 2007 as a repository of digital educational material provided by Universities in the US.&nbsp; In 2008 the OU joined the service and now hosts around 400 collections of materials.&nbsp; Since its launch, iTunes U at the OU has delivered over 52 million downloads.</p>
<p>The fact that a large number of resources are regularly added to iTunes U by top universities worldwide has been heralded as a new way of providing unprecedented access to lectures and materials created by top experts in their fields.&nbsp; In most cases, the materials have been designed with the universities' own students in mind, but when they are uploaded to iTunes U, they find new and different audiences.&nbsp; Effectively, the providers are teaching strangers.&nbsp; Whereas previous literature on podcasting has focused on users who utilise resources provided by their own lecturers, little is known about the end-users of iTunes U resources and what they do with them.</p>
<p>This paper reveals some characteristics of the iTunes U user through a large survey which was carried out over 2 months and collected over 2000 responses.&nbsp; It provides a profile of the end user, their practices and opinions about materials. The data shows that the type of user who downloads iTunes U resources in this context is very different from the users and practices described in the literature so far.&nbsp; This profile of the iTunes U user provides a clearer picture of the target listener and can help inform and improve the materials design and delivery strategies for iTunes U.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5107</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5107</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>For at least two centuries the origins of citizenship appeared European. It is essentially considered a Judeo-Christian development and it is juxtaposed against its &lsquo;lack&rsquo; in Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam, and Hinduism (if one thinks along religious terms) or Asia, America and Africa (if one thinks along geographic terms). If we critique this assumption how do we begin to investigate &lsquo;citizenship&rsquo; in other worlds? How do we investigate political subjectivity in Indian, Chinese, Islamic and Indigenous cultures? This question raises a number of theoretical and methodological issues about doing research &lsquo;in&rsquo;, &lsquo;on&rsquo; or &lsquo;about&rsquo; other worlds that, I shall argue, are inherent in social sciences and humanities but doing research on &lsquo;citizenship&rsquo; in other worlds makes us confront them more acutely and urgently.<br /><br />Presentation by Engin Isin, Professor of Citizenship in Politics and Internationals Studies (POLIS) and the Centre for Citizenship, Identities and Governance (CCIG) in the faculty of Social Sciences at The Open University.</p>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5106</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>In this talk I will introduce the work of the Hypermedia Discourse Group at the Knowledge Media Institute, which is focusing on how software tools may shape the future of scholarship. Our particular interest is in how new forms of narrative can emerge through the use of hypertext tools that treat ideas, problems and arguments as coherent networks of nodes. This enables us to reframe qualitative data analysis, and scientific publishing, as the construction of narrative networks, grounded in primary sources. I will illustrate this with examples from projects including the NASA Mobile Agents project, the Hewlett Foundation OLnet project, and the AHRC+EPRSC+JISC e-Dance project.<br /><br />Presentation by Simon Buckingham Shum, Senior lecturer at The Open University's Knowledge Media Institute, where he is also Associate Director (Technology), and leads the Hypermedia Discourse Group.</p>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5105</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the story of the development of a new climate proxy that can be used to document past climate change and evaluate the climate models used to predict our future. It tells how the architecture of leaves can be numerically described and correlated with climate to allow us to quantify ancient temperature and moisture regimes. The technique has proved particularly valuable for exposing inadequacies in climate models when they are applied to the past; a past when the Earth was much warmer than now and forests grew near the North Pole. The models are shown to be &lsquo;anchored in the present&rsquo;, which implies that future climate change might well be more marked than is currently widely recognized. This is also the story of working in the forests of China and India for understanding changes in the Asian Monsoon, and thus the future prospects for over half the world's population.<br /><br />Presentation by Bob Spicer, Professor of Earth Sciences, The Open University, and Visiting Professor, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing.</p>]]></description>

<p>Where:&nbsp;<strong>Walton Hall (Library Seminar Rooms 1 &amp; 2)</strong></p>
<p>Time: <strong>10.00 - 10.30, 15 March 2011</strong></p>
<p>This event was recorded and made available to OU staff via <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/webcast-ou/">Stadium</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This event featured four presentations on the use of educational technology in Level 1 modules in FELS:</p>
<p><strong>Lessons from the development of an online English for Academic Purposes module</strong> &ndash; David Donnarumma (OpenELT)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This session will explore the development of an entirely online English for Academic Purposes (EAP) module. Traditionally, EAP is taught face-to-face and in small groups of 15-20 students. Faced with the challenge of producing an entirely online module (the first in FELS at undergraduate level) a module team with a wide and varied expertise was created. So, what was achieved? What was learnt? The session will focus on some of the successes and challenges the module team faced in the development, as well as provide some feedback from tutors, students and consultants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Moderating whole-module forums</strong> &ndash; H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Pulker, Uschi Stickler (Languages)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whole-module forums often present challenges to a moderator, with inappropriate, disruptive or potentially damaging postings. When should one intervene, and if so how?</p>
<p>This session will be conducted in workshop format, based on actual cases of problems in forum moderation, repeating a small-group exercise at a recent Teaching Forum in the Department of Languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Use of Elluminate in Sport and Fitness Modules</strong> &ndash; Martin Rhys, Caroline Heaney, Simon Rae (Sport and Fitness)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this session members of the sport and fitness team will outline their experiences of moving from face-to-face tutorials to online tutorials as part of the student support review pilot. The impact of this change will be discussed in terms of student and tutor feedback, attendance data, tutor-student allocations and innovative teaching methods that have emerged from the use of Elluminate, such as team teaching practices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I want to learn Spanish, not computers&rdquo;: addressing student problems with Elluminate EMAs</strong> &ndash; Perry Williams (FELS Curriculum Management Office)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last autumn (2010), Elluminate was for the first time used on all languages modules for the compulsory speaking-test element of the EMA, and a significant number of students experienced serious and extremely distressing technical problems. Analysis of the Computing Helpdesk records revealed that many of these problems could have been resolved by the students, but they lacked the basic skills and knowledge to do this themselves.</p>
<p>This presentation will explore the kinds of problems students faced, and how the Department is addressing the need. It will also raise the general question of how well we support students with little or non-transferrable ICT familiarity to cope with the online tools we increasingly compel them to use.</p>

<p>This event featured:</p>
<p><strong>Use of iCMAs and practise quizes: Discovering Mathematics&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;Tim Lowe (Mathematices, Computing and Technology)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MU123 is the new entry level mathematics course replacing MU120. The course makes extensive use of formative and summative iCMAs amongst other online activities. I shall describe how the iCMAs are embedded within the course, how they were created and discuss preliminary statistics on their use by students on the first (2010B) presentation of this course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Formative assessment in Level 3 Physics and Astronomy courses</strong> -&nbsp;John Bolton (Science)&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the first time in 2010, we presented four Level 3 Physics and Astronomy courses using only formative continuous assessment (a mixture of iCMAs and eTMAs) with required thresholds of satisfactory engagement. This talk presents and analyses statistical data exploring how students used the formative assessment, whether they engaged with it as fully as with summative assessment, and whether the final course results were significantly different to those obtained in previous years. <a href="http://kn.open.ac.uk/sitewide/getfile.cfm?documentfileid=17384">Presentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Practising and assessing listening and speak with Learnosity's Talkback: the Interactive Oral Assessment project </strong>- Val&eacute;rie Demouy (Faculty of Education and anguage Studies)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This presentation reports on the&nbsp;five week pilot that took place&nbsp;between mid-October and mid-December 2010 with&nbsp;two groups of students (one studying French the other English for Academic purposes)&nbsp;interested in perfecting their listening and speaking skills via a voice response system. Students taking part were&nbsp;provided with interactive speaking activities available through Learnosity&rsquo;s Talkback and completed two speaking TMAs using the same system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The challenges of Assessment and Feedback: findings from an HEA project</strong>&nbsp;- Denise Whitelock (IET)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This project was undertaken by&nbsp;IET and colleagues from the University of Southampton and is just completing its final report. The project's aim was to produce a synthesis of evidence based research which throws light on the progress made in the practice of Assessment and Feedback in H.E. This presentation will highlight findings with respect to authentic assessment, e-portfolios, peer assessment, feedback for language learning and Advice for Action.</p>

<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
<p>In business and management studies, our approach to face to face tutorials has always been about participative discussions rather than &lsquo;lectures&rsquo;.

<p><strong>Talk by Doug Clow</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://ispot.org.uk/">iSpot  - Your place to share nature</a></strong></p>
<p>Doug starts by saying that (iSpot. org.uk)&nbsp; helps people to identify their  observations of nature. One can take a photo and upload it to the iSpot website,  saying what they think it is (where they saw it etc). If someone thinks it's  something else, they can identify it too. Once&nbsp;the user&nbsp;gets the confirmation of  the identification, then&nbsp;they can learn more about it - in depth information of  other observations people made about the same thing . There is a web page for  every species in iSpto, aggregating all the available content&nbsp; (including  Wikipedia) about the species of the whole world.</p>
<p>At iSpot, after making an identification, the user can see who else agrees  with it. And the individual identifiers are 'ranked' in a reputation system at  the website. Once the user makes an observation and gets feedback,&nbsp;they can  build a portfolio of pictures (as more people agree with your observation) , it  increases&nbsp; their reputation in the website. Observatiosn can be of birds, plants  etc.</p>
<p>Many people who use iSpot also take a short OU course if they wish  (Neighbourhood Nature 5159). This leads to accreditation - it's a 10-point  course. iSpot has a partnership with BBC Radio 4, helping broadcasting the  project and enabling access to 'nature experts' . iSpot is Lottery funded, and  targets under-represented groups.</p>
<p>Users give lots of &nbsp;positive feedback&nbsp;about iSpot - they like the community  of people with knowledge and enthusiasm. People say "I can't go outside now  without 'seeing' things!". 130,000 visits to the site.</p>
<p>A good user story is that a 6-year old girl spotted a moth - Euonymus Leaf  Notcher ( a rare moth in Europe). It was its first observation in the UK. That  discovery was highly publicised in newspapers etc. iSpot counts on  collaborations with a number of specialist societies.</p>
<p>Participatory Learning: research driven by the work on iSpot (Clow,  Makryannis and De Liddo). Participatory Learning is a rich way of using new  online media, Doug argues, as it is in line with&nbsp;the OU mission of inclusive  education.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/fundraising/current-priorities/heat.php">HEAT:  Health Education and Training in Africa </a></p>
<p><strong>Talk by Alison Robinson (programme coordinator)</strong></p>
<p>Challenges in Africa:&nbsp; high incidence of maternal and child mortality,</p>
<p>Live blogging, 2pm - Conference Day 2</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS&nbsp;, TB and malaria increasing, critical shortage of health workers,  inadequate facilities and equipment. In Africa there's 900 maternal deaths per  1000,000 births. Africa has 11% of the world's population.</p>
<p>HEAT helps to address critical health workers shortage. The strengths of the  HEAT program are that it delivers significant impact for relatively small  investment, and it has the potential to train hundreds of thousands of health  workers. HEAT materials can be delivered in print, online or disk.</p>
<p>The pilot country of HEAT is Ethiopia. One of the reasons is that all  post-secondary education and training in Ethiopia is taught in English. Total  population is around 81 million, of which 84% live in rural communities. Every  year around 21000 Ethiopian women die due to complication of pregancy or  childbirth. It is a country of contrasts.</p>
<p>The health extension workers in Ethiopia are paid a small salary by the  Ministry of Health.&nbsp; They need to be female, speak local language and basic  English, amongst other things. Health Extension Workers' initial training need  to be upgraded to overcome the deficiencies in their initial training, and also  because the workers are keen to have a career path. The HEAT training is  provided by distance education. Restrictions on classroom capacity and  availability of teachers would take more than 10 years to upgrade 31,000 health  education workers.&nbsp; Distance learning can be completed between 18-24 months.</p>
<p>HEAT will be an online knowledge bank of training materials, both in text and  in multimedia form, delivered as OER . It will also include self-assessment  questions, resources and toolkits with case-studies etc.</p>
<p>HEAT has the support of the Ministries of Health and Education in Ethiopia,  funded by the Allan and Nesta Ferguson Trust. There will be 16 distance  e-learning modules, each one assessed by means of a tutor-marked assignment. The  first 4 out of 16 modules are being prepared and are&nbsp;due for completion be end  of July.</p>
<p>Challenges: some authors are experiencing difficulties in writing in a second  language. They are also leanring the methodology of distance learning.</p>
<p>Alison says that the work in Ethiopia has been enourmously rewarding.</p>
<p>HEAT beyond Ethiopia: all modules will be free to download. Conversations are  taking place to localise the content to Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana and Zambia.&nbsp;  Modules are adaptable also outside Africa.</p>
<p>HEAT vision: to create a consortium of countries and organisatiosn working  together aiming to tackle social inequalities in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Wikipedia @&nbsp; the OU Conference 2010 </strong></p>
<p>Live blogging, 3:30 pm</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://aisantos.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/600px-wikipedia-logo-svg.png"></a><a href="http://aisantos.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/wikipedia-logo.jpg"><img title="wikipedia-logo" src="http://aisantos.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/wikipedia-logo.jpg?w=249" alt="" width="249" height="300" /></a>Openness  in Education: Talk by Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy starts by &nbsp;explaining that&nbsp;at Wikipedia it is not necessarily the case  that anyone can edit everything - there's a specific group of contributors that  edit, monitor and make the content available to the world. He also explains that  there is no relationship between Wikipedia and Wikiversity.</p>
<p>Jimmy discusses a little bit about the history and scale of Wikipedia. It was  ' the great experiment', he says, being the core idea to create a global  encyclopedia supported by volunteers. The vision statement is that every single  person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge .  Wikipedia is&nbsp;defined by Jimmy as &nbsp;"a free and high quality encyclopedia written  by thousands of volunteers in many languages". Neutrality&nbsp;and quality are  extremely important at Wikipedia. He argues that a minimum level of reliability  is necessary for the encyclopedia to be respected and popular. It is managed by  a series of community processes and control. At Wikipedia the idea of neutrality  has been the core : the firm rule is that there's a neutral point of view.  Wikipedia does not take a stand on any controversial issue - the reader is free  to make their own judgement .</p>
<p>What is free access? At Wikipedia it's first freedom of speech. The texts and  the software of Wikipedia are all free. He argues that Wikipedia is not  necessarily the most helpful format of information for the students to learn  with- but everything there can be repurposed in many different ways. Wikipedia  is an encyclopedia, which means that not everything belongs to Wikipedia. IT  offers a summary of the human knowledge with the depth of the material depending  on the subject.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a charity supported by donations, the average size for donation  is about $30 (dollars), but there is obviously big funding coming from the big  players, as Google etc, says Jimmy. The core of the donations however is made by  small donours. Over 275 million people visit Wikipedia every month. Funding at  Wikipedia happens organically, he says, not necessarily 'top-down'.</p>
<p>There's about 100,00 active contributors to Wikipedia,a ll volunteers. The  site is global. There are more than 3 million entries in English, but more than  500 million entries in other languages. There are 308,000+ articles in Chinese  alone, but it's small relative to the number of Chinese speakers that are  online. Wikipedia was banned in China for over 3 years. The Chinese government  has losen up in many ways, and now Wikipedia is generally available in China,  but certain pages are banned (e.g. some things about Tibet, the independence of  Taiwan etc). It's the 53rd most popular website in China. Jimmy says that they  would like to be more popular in China, and that it's fast growing over  there.&nbsp;Wikipedia has caused a cultural impact in China, he argues.</p>
<p>Wikipedia allows for Global content comparisons. In different parts of the  world, certain content can be more or less popular. Ex. 'Sex' is popular in  every language except French and Spanish. There are certain topics that are  equally popular, such as Star Trek and&nbsp;Star Wars...</p>
<p>Question: what's next for Wikipedia? In the short term, Jimmy explains that  the three priorities for them are: 1. quality (in the large languages, e.g.  English, instead of adding more, improving quality), 2. Growth in the developing  world (by running pilot projects ), 3. Usability (the software is not as  user-friendly as they would like it to be).</p>
<p>Question: Many educators are asking students to create Wikipedia pages, what  are your views on that? Answer: sometimes excited, sometimes not as much. It  depends on how the project is structured - quality is needed, and this usually  happens when the students are given appropriate background.</p>
<p>Question: How has been quality control over the years, and how have you dealt  with that? Answer: Several phases related to quality control, the most famous  quality problem beying vandalism.However, this is the problem we have&nbsp;lots  of&nbsp;hands on. Issues of bias for example, related to less popular and  controversial topics (e.g. Palestine, scientology etc). These articles are  closely monitored and are of high quality. More obscure topics (that people do  not care about much), are also problematic, because there are not &nbsp;many people  monitoring them. We are trying to get a system in which we can go through the  less popular topics, and that's a challenge for the future, I think - says  Jimmy.</p>
<p>Question: how is consensus generated? Answer: there's a pretty informal  mechanism to reach consensus, but it's mostly based on the issue of neutrality,  as I mention before. We developed some techniques over the years, as for  example, mentioning many different sides of the same story.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a very innovative way of sharing content, and it was an  insightful talk by Jimmy Wales.</p>]]></description>

              <title>E-learning Africa 2010: Using, Sharing and Repurposing OER</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3994</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3994</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>E-learning Africa &nbsp;2010 was held in Lusaka, Zambia, from 25th-28th May. There were over 1700 participants, and delegates had a varied professional background: local school teachers, lecturers, researchers, politicians and staff of various Ministries in Africa (education, health, international relations etc). The conference had therefore a number of different strands and dozens of parallel sessions to choose from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here I include a link to a blog post that I wrote about the conference at <a href="http://aisantos.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/e-learning-africa-using-sharing-and-repurposing-oer/">Open Content Online</a>, which contains an account of the conference, some photos and the power point slides that I used in my presentation (presentation also embedded below). I focused on the subject of copyright and licensing of educational materials, and showcased some experiences &nbsp;of the OU UK with sharing resources internationally through <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn">OpenLearn</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of my visit to Zambia, however, was the visit I paid to Aisha Project School. It is a community School (not supported by the government) in which there is a huge effort to include ICT use in the regular teaching practices of the school. Part of this effort is supported by the <a href="http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/centres/cce/projects/ictzambia/">OER4Schools </a>Project, funded by Cambridge University UK. The aim of the project is to help adopting and enhancing ICT use in the school by using enquiry-based learning. In summary and very simplistically, enquiry-based learning usually starts with a scenario, facilitated by a tutor, and the students are encouraged to come up with their own issues and questions. It is interesting to see how this type of pedagogy has been used with open education resources at Aisha Project School. To know more about their experience, please watch the interview with Mr Brighton Lubasi, Aisha ICT Manager and volunteer teacher.</p>
<p>I considered E-learning Africa to be a very interesting event, as it brought examples of practices in many fields in e-learning, to include mobile learning and a number of projects which &nbsp;explore the use of sports (e.g. football, World cup event etc) to capture the students' attention to learn new concepts (e.g. physics) and develop &nbsp;number of skills (e.g. confidence, team building, vision etc).</p>
<p>The info gathered at E-learning Africa about the use of OER contributes to the pool of information that we at <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/edit/olnet.org">OLnet</a> are putting together in an attempt to create an international landscape of OER practices ( examples, barriers and enablers) - coming soon here in Cloudworks.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Cloudquest activity</h2>
<p>The purpose of this activity is to provide a structure for exploring the Cloudworks site and considering how useful a tool it is for you. We will have a quick look at the answers at the end but the review will focus on what you thought about the site and it's potential for the team.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://www.cloudworks.ac.uk">www.cloudworks.ac.uk</a> (the Cloudworks homepage)</p>
<p>Spend a couple of minutes orientating yourselves (What is the site for? Who is it for? Where can I get help should I need it? etc)</p>
<p>Q1: What is the difference between a Cloud and a Cloudscape? (write down a URL for where you find the information)</p>
<p>Q2: How many people from the Open University are registered on the site?</p>
<p>Q3: Find the Cloud entitled &lsquo;Google wave&rsquo;. List all the different ways someone can add to a Cloud.</p>
<p>Q4: Type the phrases &lsquo;Information literacy&rsquo; and/or &lsquo;Digital literacy&rsquo; into the search box. How far are the information, ideas and debates around these topics useful and up-to-date? Who is the content aimed at? Course teams, Associate lecturers, Librarians? What are the gaps?</p>
<p>Q5 In groups discuss the ways in which Cloudworks could support the work you do and write these on the post-it notes</p>
<p>Q6 In groups discuss the barriers to using a tool like Cloudworks. And again write these on the post-it notes</p>]]></description>

              <title>Keynote: Martin Bean at the AL Conference</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2684</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2684</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Early thinking</strong></p>
<p>This cloud has been set up as a space to live blog Martin Bean's keynote.</p>
<p><strong>Early thinking &ndash; the power of the personal</strong></p>
<p>8 weeks into the post &ndash; talk will provide some reflections and ideas for the future</p>
<ul>
<li>The power of personal for the students is what makes the difference</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What is the appropriate role of technology?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>People, places, methods and ideas &ndash; the importance of the OU&rsquo;s founding mission, still true today</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Still an external view of the Ou as being grounded in a broadcast paradigm but we have moved on from this. Our research and scholarship is critical not only in its own right but for the benefits for learning and teaching. Martin hears many stories about how the OU has changed their lives or the lives of people they know, the AL role is critical in this respect, the student experience is very much linked to the AL.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Aspirations to expand OU reach to other areas in the UK, work-based and internationally.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Amazing innovations &ndash; itunes hit 10 million downloads last week</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s about experimenting and trying out new things</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Quality assurance is critical and we must maintain that. We rank at the top in terms of various quality measures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Graduates of the OU are amongst the most employable in the UK&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The regions and the nations &ndash; an inspiration. Martin visited all the regions over the summer and learnt a great deal. We need to make stronger connections between the regions and central Milton Keynes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Widening participation is also key and is embedded in what we do &ndash; working in prisons, employer engagement and other outreach activities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The importance of the Associate Lecturers and their role, supported open learning (SOL) ALs are the main personal contact point for our students. The way that ALs feed forward for students, empowering students &ndash; &lsquo;I can do this&rsquo;. The critical role of ALs in the student experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A question of who we are? Are we too open? Do we do them any favours in terms of letting them start anyway.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The relationship between Milton Keynes and the regions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We need to move to all of us considering ourselves as part of the OU &ndash; ca. 12, 500 staff &ndash; Als are equally part of this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Our systems and processes need updating &ndash; need to ensure our technologies are fit for purpose.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Does the university realise the critical role that the regions play in terms of the OU? Local will continue to be important.</li>
<li>Consider the challenges facing HE &ndash; globalisation, privatisation, massification</li>
<li>Transforming information into knowlledge</li>
<li>Need to educate citizens for new types of work</li>
<li>We cannot depend on young graduates alone</li>
<li>Learning in the workplace needs to becme integral</li>
<li>HE must remove artifical barries - link school, FE and HE together</li>
</ul>
<p>Making change possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Three key considerations: people, processes and technology</li>
<li>People spend too much time on the technology and not on the people aspects and how it will be used. </li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I would be very keen to here views from Associate Lecturer's on cloudworks and how it might be used as a space for ALs to discuss learning and teaching issues and to share practice and experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your views of the site?</li>
<li>What ideas have you got for how it might be used?</li>
<li>The site is open and can be viewed by anyone - this has advantages (we have people looking at the site from 140 countries) but are there any issues with this, would it deter you from using the site? </li>
<li>Can you see this as a complementary 'open' space alongside existing closed OU-tutor forums?</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This cloud has been set up to support the assessment session at the Open University associate lecturers' national conference on the 21st November 2009.</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1. Do we over assess? From a student perspective, from a tutor perspective?
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2. How do we build in variability? Alternatives to 3000-word essay
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3. Right ratio of TMAs to ECAs to exams?</li>
<li>4. What is the role of self-assessment, formative &amp; summative assessment?&nbsp;</li>
<li>5. How do we assess beyond the individual?</li>
<li> 6. Can we move to move standard guidelines for marking criteria/what are appropriate marking criteria</li>
<li>7. Should we move to awards-based assessment? If so, how?

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Live blog Martn Bean's talk today here, feel free to add to! The hashtag is #globalou. Twitterkeeper of tweets <a href="http://twapperkeeper.com/globalou/">here</a>. Stadium recording of session is <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/stadia/preview.php?whichevent=1394&s=1&ran=1709086570&state=1">here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OU is about social justice and openness</li>
<li>How do we move towards a more international perspective, what will this mean? How do we balance profit with a social justice &amp; open agenda</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>David Vincent</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Education is a basic human right and should be available over the lifetime of a person; this know no boundaries</li>
<li>New drivers: i) explosion of need for education in other parts of the world &ndash; HE has a crucial role in terms of enhancing capacity and society, ii) technological innovation, from our origins using TV through today&rsquo;s rich use of the Internet, iii) flattening of the curve of UK funding and expansion.</li>
<li>Vincent also praised the out going VC Brenda Gourley for her outstanding&nbsp; contribution to the field and to the OU. Including reference to the work in Africa and contribution to the Open Educational Resource movement.</li>
<li>In looking for a replacement to Brenda, the OU recognised that we need a leader with a truly global vision, hence the appointment of Martin Bean.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Martin Bean</strong></p>
<p>Welcomes those present and available virtually.</p>
<p>Starts officially one week today, humbling to be part of the next generation taking the OU forward.</p>
<p>Has spent eight weeks ge tting to know the OU as a designate VC.</p>
<p>The OU is often referred to as a national treasure, very special institution, we mustn&rsquo;t forget this; the OU makes a difference in people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>Learnt a lot in the last 8 weeks, visit all 13 regions, did a summer school and an experiment. Reaffirms my belief in the value of the OU. Understand the level of dedication, enthusiasm etc, its truly inspiring. Have a theory of reflective energy &ndash; the reflection and energy back from staff about what the OU is doing. Also touched, gratified and awed by how everyone engages with the mission and philosophy of the organisation.</p>
<p>When you talk to our students and ask them to unpack the experience &ndash; it&rsquo;s the personal experience that is what is most important &ndash; the support via the associate lecturers, more than the content. The phone call they get at the critical moment, for some it&rsquo;s the tutorials and meeting with other students, others it&rsquo;s the online engagement. The personal connection is key. Tension between quality and innovation. We are the envy of the world in terms of quality. But there is a tension &ndash; quality can be thought of as static or dynamic. We also need to appropriate the innovation as well. Also our research and scholarship informs everything we do. This helps create the quality, ensures the programme will be successful.</p>
<p>Also experienced how we have stayed true to our core principles</p>
<ul>
<li>People &ndash; open to everyone</li>
<li>Places &ndash; wherever they are</li>
<li>Methods &ndash; latest technologies</li>
<li>Ideas &ndash; at our core we are about innovating</li>
</ul>
<p>We remain committed to notion that our offerings are available for all. Pioneering work via TESSA and HEAT in Africa, work-based learning in Health and Social Studies &ndash; new technologies: iTunes, Openlearn, Sociallearn etc.</p>
<p>Our research has an impact on the world stage.</p>
<p>The university is in a healthy position today, but there are significant challenges ahead, continued economic slow down, and also uncertainty. We have to focus our efforts whilst staying true to our mission. How do we expand internationally in these uncertain times?</p>
<p>HE worldwide is changing and continues to change &ndash; globalisation, massification and privitisation.</p>
<p>Globalisation: Increasingly interconnected world: UNESCO report on global networks and academia. More than 1 in 3 students are studying in the private sector.</p>
<p>UK BBP holdings has been acquired by APOLLO from the states, so are planning to move into the European context. Their interest is return on stakeholder value. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/5479148/Education-group-BPP-accepts-300m-Apollo-takeover-bid.html</p>
<p>Massification is a respond to the rapid demand to high quality workforce. Tertiary education has expanded in the last 30/40 years as a result. If this continues the impact with be phenomenal &ndash; particularly in china and India. Implications for the OU &ndash; need to tackle global inequalities. We have the best model in the world to meet the demand. High quality, opened and supported learning delivered at scale &ndash; that is our focus. Fits with our academic and social agenda</p>
<p>But we need to confront some key challenges. We need to reflect on the experiences from the past. It&rsquo;s not a revolution, it&rsquo;s an evolution. We already work internationally, now need to expand it.Five key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>OU Supported Open Learning </li>
<li>OU Online</li>
<li>OU Plus</li>
<li>OU Freemium</li>
<li>OU Services. </li>
</ul>
<p>Have done important capability building in developing countries and major partnerships. OpenLearn launched in 2006, 5.9 million people have accessed it, 50% outside UK, youtube 1.6 million views, 80% outside UK, itune June 08 6.6 million downloads, 87% outside the UK.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&ldquo;Profit and morality are a hard combination to beat&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pricing content, pedagogy and support are the key variables we need to assess for international as well as home markets.</p>
<p>We need local expertise to work in new markets. We need to understand local regulatory constraints. We need to understand local cultural and linguistic differences. We need to reflect on the experiences of OU in North America.</p>
<p>Curriculum: very challenging in an international context.</p>
<p>The OU brand is not universally recognised and known. There are a range of imitators some of which have underpinned our provision because of their low quality.</p>
<p>Open and Distance are negative connotations in China.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>Deliver new pedagogical and business models through OU freedom, building structured learning pathways &ndash; where formal and informal learning meet</p>
<p>Can establish high quality offerings in partnership with business</p>
<p>Can develop research excellence, develop our world-class research and link that into our platforms and provision.</p>
<p>We can grow our validation opportunities</p>
<p>We can target philanthropic organisations</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion &ndash; strategic imperatives</strong></p>
<p>Expanding internationally is totally within our agenda, but there are some imperatives. The only reason to consider expansion is if we can do it at scale and with quality.</p>
<p>Finally</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to be proactive not reactive</li>
<li>Selective</li>
<li>Evidence based</li>
<li>Deliberate </li>
<li>A consious decision to succeed.</li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The short course design challenge&hellip; are you up to it???</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br /> Curriculum design has never being more challenging or potentially exciting:<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;New technologies offer a seemingly endless range of possibilities in terms of use of engaging digital media to support core course material to exciting and authentic communicative and collaborative opportunities<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Modern students are more and more diverse with higher expectations of courses and more diverse needs from formal, work-related possibilities through to learning for informal, personal reasons<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Employers are increasingly demanding evidence of students having developed a diverse range of social skills and competences to meet the challenges of the modern workplace<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is now a range of educational models that can be applied to help foster different pedagogical approaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one-day workshop has been developed to introduce course teams to  using a learning design approach. The example below (originally used at  Brunel University in 2009) uses the OULDI learning tools and activities  but we have successfully tried slotting in tools and activities from  other projects (especially the Viewpoints project) and the format holds  well. For a list of other activities and tools you could use try the  learning design toolbox. These and other examples of the template in use:</p>

<h2>The Challenge...</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Design  Challenge&rsquo; is intended to be an intense  but fun means of illustrating a  range of resources, tools and ways of  thinking about course design.  Participants are introduced to a range of  tools and techniques by means  of access to advisors who will help them  along the process. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the afternoon each team  presents their ideas. A  panel evaluates their work and select the  strongest designs. The  session concludes with a reflection on the  usefulness of the event and  on which of the ideas, resources and tools  participants might wish to  pursue further. <br /> <br /> Although designed  as a fun activity, the event gives an awareness of  the latest in  thinking innovatively about curriculum design and is  designed to be  proactive rather than being composed around an  uncontextualised set of  one-to-many presentations. The time-limited  challenge enables  participants to make a preliminary assessment of  which of the ideas,  tools and resources are useful and gives them some  feel for what might  be possible in a longer, term real course  production process. Hopefully  the challenge will open avenues for  participants to pursue this further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>Paper  and pens (hard copies of tools if appropriate - A3 best)</p>
<p>'Stalls'  facilitators</p>
<p>Two laptops per team (can also bring their own  but should be networked)</p>
<p>So that your teams can export the CompendiumLD maps and save any    other work done on workshop laptops, please ensure that they bring at    least one USB memory key with them per team.</p>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Each team will use these tools to evaluate  their   designs and inform  their design decision making.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>12.00 &ndash; 12.40</strong>&nbsp; <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/view/2600">Activity: Stalls activity</a></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Teams will split in to focus groups.  Individuals,   with the support  of expert facilitators, will explore  one of the following   themes (examples from Brunel University  workshop):</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;   
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/view/2557">Library, media services  and accessibility</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/view/2556">Open Educational  Resources</a></li>

<li><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/view/2555">Visualisation and  representations</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Individuals will then rejoin their work  teams,   share findings and  consider what the impact of these findings  might be the   emerging  designs. The expert facilitators will be  available to offer support    for the remainder of the workshop and will  upload links and resources to    Cloudworks as appropriate.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>12.40 &ndash; 1.30</strong> Lunch</p>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Using all the online and physical  resources   available, teams will  draw up a more detailed  representation of their module.   These  representations are likely to  include i.e. sequence, learning outcomes,    outlines of activities,  technologies used, assessment strategies etc.  Using   Compendium it is  also possible to create links to specific OERs,  tools and   resources.  Designs and discussions around design problems  and decisions will   be  added to the Cloudworks site &ndash; allowing for  collaborative discussion    between teams and opening up discussion  beyond the workshop.</p>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;This activity will provide an opportunity  to view   and review the  designs of other teams and give and receive  feedback. It is   recognised  that designs at this stage will contain  detail but will not    necessarily be &lsquo;finished&rsquo;.</p>
