              <title>Using Google classroom to supplement learning in the traditional classroom. </title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title:</strong> Using Google classroom to supplement learning in the traditional classroom</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>Tutor</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>I teach adult students who are on a resit one-year GCSE maths course. Most learners have been absent from education for some time. &nbsp;All learners attend a three-hour classroom session each week. These learners have chosen to study maths to support their career aspirations and are determined and focused on achieving the qualification. It is a challenging objective with limited teaching and learning time in the traditional classroom. It is my belief that learning can be supported by giving access to resources used in the classroom for reflection and to give access to other suggested resources and to create an environment where students can discuss their queries.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>To supplement their learning, I wanted to begin using Google classroom to extend their &lsquo;library&rsquo; for resources and as a means of communication between the group and with me, their tutor. The students were to access Google classroom via the internet either using the college hardware, their own home computers of their smartphones. All learners had access to at least one form of technology. I had to create an environment they could have access to and where they could easily locate the materials they were looking for. It had to be easy to navigate as some students had limited IT experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li>I started by creating the classroom &lsquo;offline&rsquo;</li>
<li>I had to create and organise spaces within the classroom that was easily navigated and clearly signposted.</li>
<li>I uploaded material I had used in the classroom and other resources that were relevant.</li>
<li>I created a space for &lsquo;announcements&rsquo; so students would know how to see important notices.</li>
<li>I had to invite students using the MI system or give them a &lsquo;code&rsquo; to login.</li>
<li>I had a traditional classroom session to coach students in the use of the online classroom and to iron out any problems they encountered.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was my first experience of using Google classroom and I encountered a few technical problems trying to get started. I overcame my problems by getting in touch with our IT support department. I created the environment I wanted but it was slow to form as I had to learn how to use it myself first.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The outcome was a success and is working very well. After a few weeks of using it I have been able to further improve the overall look and accessibility of the classroom as I have become more familiar with it. It has proven to be as useful as I expected with students using it as a message area as well as a means of accessing additional resources. I have more ideas to implement so it is still very much an ongoing project.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait around for something to be given to you. If you have an idea that something will work or improve the learning environment then plan it, prepare it and run with it. My learners have been very grateful for the extra support this environment has given them.</p>]]></description>

              <title>19 February 2018 - &quot;Old School meets Web 2.0: Mixing established teaching methodology with innovative learning tools.&quot;  (Holger Goertz)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11523</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This presentation overviews and analyses a project in which 121 students from six different year groups, and 28 different nationalities collaborate on a common moral project, creating a website on which they will publish their research findings on the topic of <em>climate change</em> and <em>species extinction</em>.</p>
<p>The presentation will focus on how the use of Web 2.0 and OER have the potential to improve student engagement, hence optimising &ldquo;the student experience and enhance the learning outcomes and development of students&rdquo; (Trowler 2010, 3). It seeks to show that the use of Web 2.0 and OER in different languages can facilitate communication with a linguistically heterogenous group of students and subsequently enhance understanding and learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Established <em>old school&nbsp;</em>teaching strategies-I.e.<em>collaborative</em> and <em>constructivist</em> <em>learning</em> are being mixed with<em> innovative digital learning tools</em>,&nbsp;<em>open educational resources</em> (OER) and<em> blended teaching strategies</em>, to foster the linguistic and academic inclusion of all students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The presentation intends to highlight why it is essential for teachers of all ages to not miss out on the educational opportunities Web 2.0 and OER bear, stimulating the digital literacy of both, students and teachers and offering the opportunity for students to become teachers, suggesting that it is the teacher&rsquo;s rather than the student&rsquo;s digital literacy that is challenged by this process.</p>

              <title>SAT: Break Out of the Box! How you can use xAPI to free in-house staff development (Katherine Hinchey)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11472</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>You learn by doing and collaborating, watching videos, accessing just-in-time information from your mobile device, mentoring, and more. Why, then, does the Human Resources department only give you slides to learn from?</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s workers and corporations are united in wanting more access to the formal, non-formal, and informal learning needed to support an increasingly skilled workforce (The Education Commission, 2016; Pew Research Center, 2016a and 2016b). However, today&rsquo;s corporations largely store their learning resources in virtual learning environments (VLEs) that have adopted a uniform way of storing content. This uniform way, called SCORM, was incredibly helpful when it was designed nineteen years ago, and it still has an important role to play today. When SCORM was created, computer-based training was relatively new and organisations needed a single way to store and track training. For a time, innovation in elearning stopped at the known, established boundaries of the VLE (Weller, 2014, p. 194).</p>
<p>Now, a new need has developed: a way to store and track learning when it occurs on mobile devices, or through social and collaborative activities, or offline by reading a book or engaging in stretch assignments, or when participating in simulations or augmented and virtual reality programmes.</p>
<p>An innovation that meets that need was first released in 2013, and had its last planned update in 2016. It is the Experience API (xAPI). xAPI provides a common format for capturing data from today&rsquo;s distributed learning landscape (Rustici Software, n.d.). With xAPI in place, you can free staff development from the confines of SCORM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rely less on elearning courses designed from slides and more on learning experiences;</li>
<li>Recognise learning from formal and informal or non-formal activities (Downes, 2015);</li>
<li>And track not only clicks and views but also correlate learning with performance (Torrance, 2016).</li>
</ul>
<p>Managers and other decision-makers within learning departments and organisations are at a critical point. They need a source from which to gain a high-level, jargon-free understanding of the benefits of xAPI, common applications and uses of xAPI to support learners as they access modern and innovative learning opportunities, best practices and lessons learned, and information they should provide to their learning development and learning technology teams to prepare for implementation of xAPI (HT2 Labs, n.d.).</p>
<p>In my conference presentation, I will discuss and share a workshop created to meet those needs. The workshop helps managers, even those without extensive technical backgrounds, to be prepared to move forward with discussions and decisions about xAPI within their organisation. My presentation will show some of the workshop features and provide attendees with tools they can take with them, for use in their future endeavours.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I am an Access to HE Coordinator and tutor, working for a large FE College within Yorkshire and Humber region. The aim of Access to HE is to prepare 19+ adult learners University level study I coordinate two pathways at one of the smaller campuses - Humanities and Social Sciences and Health Science Professions. I also teach Psychology, Sociology, Social Policy and Study Skills. My role as a coordinator involves curriculum design and setting up and moderating VLEs such as Moodle and Google Classrooms. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>The College has recently adopted a new VLE platform - Google Classrooms. The College has also loaned out Chromebooks to students, so&nbsp; I set up Google Classrooms in order to support students in and outside of the classroom.&nbsp; The Chromebooks have been useful in that I have been able to set up online interactive tasks, such as quizzes, that students can do in the classroom or at home. Students are also able to open up shared documents within the Google Classroom and collaborate on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Technology Enhanced Learning Team (TEL) were the key actors in setting up and facilitating training on the Google platform, as where the teachers who used Google Classrooms. The TEL team adopted Google Classrooms in the belief that...</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>It is easier to use than Moodle (which it is. However, it is worth noting that there are some things that Moodle can do that Google Classrooms can't do - see 'Actions below').</li>
<li>It is easier to communicate with students.</li>
<li>It is easy to upload and use&nbsp; a variety of learning materials including Word Docs, presentations, YouTube videos etc.</li>
<li>It is easier for students and tutor's to collaborate online -&nbsp; tutors can post shared docs and presentations for the students to collaborate on.</li>
<li>It will cut down on the cost of printed materials.</li>
<li>It will promote independent learning.</li>
<li>It is available across different platforms (google and android apps), so students and tutors can access Google classrooms on their mobile devices as well as desktop computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Task</strong></p>
<p>I set up Google classrooms in order to achieve the points highlighted above, in the 'Situation' section. However, I was particular interested in developing&nbsp; real world I.T. Skills, which will stand students in good stead in both the work place and at University.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also wanted to ensure that all learners have access to the learning materials used in each lesson at all times. This is particularly important for adult learners, many of whom have&nbsp; work and family commitments outside of college. If a student can't make it to lesson for childcare or work reasons, then they can catch up on lessons missed on Google Classrooms. I also wanted to encourage more collaboration and discussion in and outside of the classroom, particularly among the quieter groups. The measure of success for this was how many students contributed to a discussion in and outside of class (see actions and results for more details on this.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition to this, I also hoped that the use of Google Classrooms would improve retention, attendance and achievement. Compared to last year, retention is better for both of the pathways I teach on. Though attendance is low for one group.&nbsp; It is difficult to comment on achievement rates at this time whilst students are still on the course, though I have noticed that more low attenders&nbsp; are still passing their assignments at merit level compared to previous years. Could this be a sign that these students are making full use of Google Classrooms. Whilst this is anecdotal evidence, research by L&oacute;pez-P&eacute;rez et al (2011) suggests that blended and online learning can improve retention and achievement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Action and results&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li value="1">Last year, using the credentials provided to me by the College, I set up Google Classroom account for teachers.</li>
<li>Once I had set up classrooms for each Access to HE unit, I invited students to join each classroom using a unique code. However, not all students joined the classroom. At the start of this academic year, I made sure that students had joined all classes during the induction week. Tutors can give students access to Google classrooms themselves, though this may be time consuming for large Cohorts.</li>
</ol><ol type="1">
<li value="3">I then used Google Classrooms to share documents with the students and upload lesson materials. I tend to make announcements in the stream, but upload lesson material to the &lsquo;About&rsquo; section as I can organise the materials week by week. As mentioned above, this seems to have been beneficial for low attenders as they are still achieving despite their low attendance. This may indicate that they are engaging with Google Classrooms outside of the classrooms.</li>
<li>I have also created quizzes using Socrates, Google forms and Moodle Cloud and posted links to these on Google Classrooms. For quizzes, I settled on Moodle Cloud. Whilst Socrates is good, students have to input a separate password to access the quiz. Whereas with the quizzes on Moodle Cloud, students just log in using the same credentials to log into Google Classrooms. This has help to engage all students in the classroom as they tell me they enjoy taking part in the quizzes. It is also useful for me, as I can check their understanding of the topic.</li>
<li>In addition to this, I have posted links to Padlet on google classrooms, so that students can share ideas from discussion activities. For example, when discussing the strengths and limitations of a particular theory. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Within the classroom environment, all students contribute well to the Padlet activities. However, they do not seem to engage as well with this activity outside of the classroom. To overcome this problem, I plan to set an activity linked to one of the unit criteria. So, in order to pass the unit, they will have to complete the activity online.</li>
<li>This year, I started&nbsp; sharing documents such as google slides or docs on Google Classrooms, which students can work on together. This has also helped to engage all students. For example, each student within a group can work on a particular slide. Furthermore, once the students have completed their presentation, it will always be available on Google Classrooms. This is particularly useful for students who have missed lessons. However, some students might complain that these students have not contributed to the presentation. To overcome this problem, students who have missed a lesson, could create a presentation and post it to the classroom. To encourage this, I could mark the student as attending a lesson (e.g. A virtual attendance mark, which contributes to their overall attendance rate).</li>
<li>One of the limitations of Google Classrooms, is that I can&rsquo;t create a Turnitin assignment, unlike moodle. So I post links on Google classrooms to Turnitin assignments on the Moodle Cloud. Students can sign into Moodle Cloud using their student account for Google, so they don&rsquo;t have to use a separate password. Turnitin is a plagiarism checker, which students will also have to use a university. I also do all of my marking on Turnitin, so students always have access to feedback online.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;R<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->eflections</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy using Google Classrooms, and students have told me they find it useful, particularly when they have missed lessons. However, Google Classrooms is a cloud based platform which assumes that all students will have access to a computer and the internet at home. However, I do have some students who do not have access to the internet. So, even though the have been loaned a Chromebook, they may not be able to use it at home without internet access (as Chromebooks are a cloud based device). To overcome this problem, perhaps the College could loan out dongles to those who need it, though I appreciate that this will cost money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have already mentioned, students are engaging well with the Chromebooks and Google Classrooms within the Classroom environment. Low attenders seem to be engaging with this platform outside of the classroom as the are still passing their assignments. Furthermore, one of my groups is quiet and can be difficult to engage in group discussions, but I have used Google Classrooms to overcome this problem. I now get students to discuss their ideas in small groups and then post something to the Padlet or Google Docs. Once they have done this activity, I will then get each group to share their ideas with the rest of the class. The act of getting them to write down their ideas first seems to have helped the students engage more with discussion activities. However, this is only one cohort, so it is not possible to generalise the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst Google Classrooms seems to work well within a classroom context, I need to use it more effectively to encourage collaboration outside of the classroom. Even when I have set up tasks outside of the classroom, not all students have engaged with these tasks. In order to overcome this problem, for the next academic year, I plan to link one or more of the unit criteria to the online tasks, which they will have to complete in order to pass the unit. For example, contributing to a online discussion, just as Open University students do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Google Classrooms was met with some resistance when it was first set up. As I a result of this, I found that I was the only tutor using it.&nbsp; Students ended up having to look for lessons materials on both Google Classrooms and Moodle, which caused some confusion. &nbsp;Perhaps this was the result of the&nbsp; work that needed to be done to either transfer existing materials from Moodle to Google Classrooms or to develop new materials.&nbsp; There are also some things that Moodle can do that&nbsp; Google Classrooms cannot do. For example, you cannot upload Turnitin assignments to Google classrooms. In order to overcome this problem, I have started using Moodle Cloud. This enables me to&nbsp; post links to Moodle Cloud from Google Classrooms; for example, a link to a Turntin assignment and students will not need a separate password or username to access this. In addition to this, materials for 'old' Moodle, can be transferred to the new online Moodle Cloud if necessary. As a result of this, and more training offered by the College, more tutors are engaging with the Google Platform.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Narrator</h2>
<p dir="ltr">My role was to support a teacher in conceptualising, designing, development and implementation of an online learning activity.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Situation</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">University of Applied Sciences, Department for Social Work</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Compulsory elective subject in a bachelor curriculum for Social Work.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students (approx. 40) attending the course into their 3rd or 4th term, having completed several courses covering theoretical and methodical basics of the field.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students have to deliver a report on a project they have worked on during the course. This is a group work of 3-4 students and delivered at the end of the term.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Previously, a significant proportion of the face-to-face course time has been used for organizing group work, providing instruction and facilitating communication. Peer feedback in the face-to-face environment has proven to be very time-consuming and has often not been leading to satisfactory results</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">LMS: Moodle (Students have worked with Moodle before, but are not necessarily experienced with collaborative elements and practices; teacher is fairly familiar with Moodle)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Task</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I have focused on opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness of group collaboration in this course. I decided to use blended learning elements which would allow to guide students towards group work and communication in a virtual environment. I selected administrative, organizational and methodological elements of writing a term paper which could be supported by with online components. The measure of success was a reduction of administrative and organisational efforts by the teacher and administrative staff.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I also included elements of reflection and evaluation for the students to &nbsp;take an active, participative, and critical role (providing peer-feedback at several stages of the paper writing process). The success factor was a consistent quality in the term papers delivered, not below the quality of previous papers delivered in the standard course format.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Together with the teacher in charge I drafted a concept for the course, including goals, key stakeholders, format and sequence of elements included, implementation of a pilot, implementation of the final course, and evaluation by students, teacher, and supportive staff. The result was a common understanding of the goals as well as the actions to be taken and related responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I then developed the main elements and run a pilot with a few selected testers not yet involved in the course design. It turned out that several elements were not sufficiently described or did not work exactly the way they were intended.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">On the basis of the pilot we adapted the course design were necessary and then run the course for an entire term. At the end of the turn we evaluated the results, questioned students, staff and teacher and analysed the overall outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Results</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The papers delivered were of a consistent quality at about the same level as in the previous version of the course (without blended learning elements). The effort for preparing and developing the course was significant, during the course support and occasional adjustments were necessary which also meant some additional effort for both teacher and supportive staff. However, most of the issues could be resolved for the next term and without the one-time preparational efforts qualitative as well as quantitative objectives could be met.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A survey conducted among the students showed that most of them appreciated the design of the course, but would have liked to use the space for further collaboration more extensively.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Reflections</h2>
<p dir="ltr">It is important to create a detailed design of the course - including goals, key stakeholders, elements and sequencing, evaluation, etc. - in order to make sure that all involved parties have the same understanding of the project. However, even with a detailed design there are issues which cannot be anticipated and therefore running a pilot with people who have not been involved previously is crucial to discover any gaps and flaws. At the end, an evaluation can reveal further gaps and issues, but also provide input for further development.</p>

              <title>Darren Gash: My Dream: Learning Design Project Proposal: Redesign of a level 6 mentorship module for blended and online delivery</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7307</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7307</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h1>Darren Gash: Redesign of a level 6 mentorship module for blended and online delivery&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>Your situation</h2>
<p>The Mentorship module is a 15 credit level 6 module accredited by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), and run by Surrey University&rsquo;s Health and Social Care faculty. The module focuses on mentoring and the enhancement of coaching, assessment and facilitation skills, through a &ldquo;reflective and supportive approach&rdquo;. Out of the 150 notional learning, there are 30 taught hours over 5 days, 30 hours practice learning activities and 90 self-directed study/learning. The module runs over a period of 16 weeks, with approximately 60 students per intake and 10 cohorts per year</p>
<p>The VLE has previously been used to distribute course materials. Since Surrey moved over to a new VLE in 2012 (from WebCT to Desire2Learn) materials have not been transferred across and are currently distributed by email.</p>
<p>The programme leaders for the module are keen to transfer the module content across to the new VLE and to develop the module for SurreyLearn to make better use of the technology on offer. This would be initially as a blended offering to be offered from June 2013 onwards, however they would also like to offer a fully online option for students in the future.</p>
<h2>The Change you would like to see (challenge)</h2>
<p>For me the primary challenge is to redesign the module so that it is blended in the truest sense of the word, i.e. a combination of seamlessly integrated face to face and online activities aligned with the module outcomes. The programme leaders&rsquo; initial aim was to simply transfer the course materials across to the new VLE, i.e. use it as a repository for storing materials to support face to face activities only. Adopting a more blended approach is vital as I believe this will be easier to then offer a fully online option that is comparable in terms of experience and outcomes to the blended option, as well as the NMC who will need to validate the online version.</p>
<h2>How you might go about bringing that change</h2>
<p>What I first need to do is get a more detailed picture of the current offering, e.g. the type of students doing the course (I will ask the programme leaders to provide a couple of user case scenarios), the pedagogical approaches used to deliver course, what works, what doesn&rsquo;t work, areas they would like to change or improve in particular.&nbsp; In terms of technology, Desire2Learn has the usual VLE type tools that can be used to support learning, including forums, blogs and an e-portfolio.&nbsp;</p>

Much of my communication at work is by email with colleagues. We also connect by telephone and face-to-face meetings. With students, and associate lecturers, I rely heavily on online forums. I work in several different teams, sometime across different faculties. <br />I would most like to explore how we can better integrate forums, Elluminate (or equivalent) and our text-based materials. Our students seem to be increasingly time-poor and averse to engaging in any activity that isn&rsquo;t related to assessment. Introducing technology can create a drain on students&rsquo; time, which is echoed by my own experience of making technologies work.</td>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Context:&nbsp; </strong>Converting existing traditional F2F school A level teaching with blended learning units (16-19). Geography and biology.&nbsp; Collaborating with staff in EDB research project. &nbsp;Some resistance to changing practice. &nbsp;Diverse range of students, classes of 15 - 25. &nbsp;High stakes exam, teachers &amp; students wary of change that might divert attention from outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Change:</strong>&nbsp; Active use of the school VLE (Moodle 2.3) students engaged with independent work, including collaborative and individual work. &nbsp;Students given opportunities for guided further study. &nbsp;Transition to HE eased by less &lsquo;spoon feeding&rsquo;, more independent work and student self confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Approach:</strong>&nbsp; Moodle 2.3 is the school VLE, technical support, though ICT heavily filtered. &nbsp;Aim is to create scaffolded constructivist opportunities using Moodle tools. &nbsp;Creation of learning sequences (ped. patterns) represented by Compendium/LSDE for sharing with other teachers. &nbsp;Blended learning model using best of F2F and online opportunities. &nbsp;Consideration of Community of Inquiry, cognitive load and examples of relevant good practice from HE.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I would be interested in continuing my research on instructor experiences with technology in blended learning courses. Does blending the face-to-face and online work appeal to students? If not, why not? &nbsp;Do students prefer either face-to-face or fully online without having a mix of the two? Do instructors need to motivate students to accept blended learning? I would like to learn whether&nbsp;blended learning is challenging for instructors because of students' distaste for blended learning or not? &nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Reporting findings of the student experience from a two year longitudinal study on the introduction of a blended learning model for teaching undergraduate skills.</p>
<p>This study is about the development and implementation of a blended learning model for a large cohort of undergraduate students, and the associated challenges.</p>
<p>Within mainstream higher education, innovating blended learning pedagogy and exploring the diverse functionality available in virtual learning environments (VLE) presents challenges from both technical and pedagogic perspectives. Traditionally, and in our former experience, the use of VLE&rsquo;s by academics has often been limited to &ldquo;functional dissemination&rdquo; of information (lecture notes etc.).</p>
<p>Our work and research has monitored the implementation of a blended learning model, to inform future developments. The model was delivered to two cohorts comprising 800 undergraduate students. The traditional lecture was replaced by asynchronous learning media, supplemented with a &ldquo;blend&rdquo; of face to face workshops, crossing boundaries within our own institutional setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our research reviews student and academic perspectives using data from the following sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Student      responses to two on line questionnaires between 2010 and 2011. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Staff      perspectives </li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>The challenges exposed during the development and implementation this blended learning model related to students and their experience with on line learning as an integrated and accepted feature of their educational experience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We found that online learning not only challenges students, but also presents a range of challenges for academics whose responsibility it is to &ldquo;build on the blend&rdquo; in face to face workshops.</p>
<p>We have also learned that making the most of VLE&rsquo;s in conjunction with face to face interaction requires an understanding of the ways in which the &ldquo;blend&rdquo; between technical and pedagogic rationales may be developed and utilized to best effect for our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contributing to the informed and continued development of a blended model, our presentation will be an &lsquo;honest&rsquo; review of good and bad exploring the implications of our findings, and the ways in which these may inform our future developments and teaching practice.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Change Academy for Blended Learning Enhancement (CABLE)&nbsp; at The University of Hertfordshire -  one of thepilot HEA Pathfinder initiative projects.</p>
<p>The Pathfinder  Programme is intended to be a transformation initiative and our CABLE  project, managed by the Blended Learning Unit, aims to develop and apply  the change management process needed to embed blended learning into  academic schools.</p>
<p>The project team  was shortlisted for <strong>The Times Higher Contribution to  Leadership  Development Award 2007</strong>.</p>
<p>The CABLE project (<em>The <strong>C</strong>hange <strong>A</strong>cademy for <strong>B</strong>lended  <strong>L</strong>earning <strong>E</strong>nhancement</em>) draws on the change models and  resources of the HEA Change Academy to construct a local model of change  within Schools. The project has been a great success, resulting in more  widespread development of blended learning within, and between, Schools  and Faculties.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sure, it&rsquo;s blended&hellip; But is it the BeST we can do?<em> </em><br /> </strong><br /> &lsquo;Blended learning&rsquo; seems the latest term claimed by e-learning advocates. While it is clear that complementing face-to-face education with e-learning (which is how many understand the term &lsquo;blended&rsquo;) can result in benefits to learners, there are also significant challenges &ndash; and there is a danger that becoming &lsquo;blended&rsquo; might be perceived as some sort of ultimate objective. This presentation considers the role &lsquo;blended learning&rsquo; has had at Laidlaw College (formerly the Bible College of New Zealand), and suggests that becoming &lsquo;blended&rsquo; was an institutionally useful yet pedagogically incomplete objective. Making real improvements to learning in formal education relies not on blending communication media or adding online discussion to on-campus meetings, but on adopting specific pedagogical approaches that do not necessarily require &lsquo;blended&rsquo; media. Two specific frameworks for formal education are highlighted, both of which provide a context for &lsquo;blending&rsquo;.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Myths and promises of blended learning<br /></strong> <br /> While lots of people write about blended learning, it isn&rsquo;t always clear what is meant, or whether people are writing about the same thing. The purpose of this talk is to identify some assumptions and common assertions made about blended learning, so that these &ldquo;myths&rdquo; &ndash; claims that seem natural, because their historical and constructed status has been hidden rhetorically &ndash; can be explored and challenged. Such myths include the existence of purely online and purely face-to-face learning that can then be blended, ignoring the complex ways in which students learn; the idea that we should incorporate new technology because it is demanded by a new generation of students, ignoring the diversity of students&rsquo; experiences and evidence that technology use is not &lsquo;generational&rsquo;; and the claim that we can turn courses into learning communities through blended learning. Based on this critique, a more complicated picture emerges, highlighting the importance of learners&rsquo; purposes, choices and contexts. Throughout, I will argue that a body of work has developed that takes account of this messier, less controllable situation, and that we need to turn to this to as a basis for developing our thinking about blended learning.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sociology of Education Intercultural</strong></p>
<p>International blended learning class<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>Course concept</em><br />Our teaching project &ldquo;Sociology of Education Intercultural&rdquo; is a blended<br />learning class that leads undergraduate students to intercultural learning experience and<br />encourages them to study abroad.<br />The blended learning class is embedded in moodle, an international accepted virtual learning environment with learning modules and multiple-choice tests. To communicate with international partners we use a virtual classroom and Skype.</p>
<p>This summer term our students will do their own qualitative research project. They will interview foreign students via Skype about conditions of study and living. The interview outcomes results will be analysed and presented on their own ePortfolios (Mahara).</p>
<p><em>Opportunity to join us</em><br />We&rsquo;re looking for students who would like to be interviewed via Skype. Our students will ask them how they feel as a student in their country. What do they challenge, what do they like and what they would like to change. The interviews will take place as soon as possible until your term ends. It will be in English and last max. one hour. The installation of Skype is for free and very easy (www.skype.org) and allows the students to use a webcam and a headset. You and your students are very welcome to join us and will be informed about our outcomes.</p>

              <title>The Ethics of Mobile Learning</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3142</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3142</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the striking things to come out of the MOTILL Project was the apparent lack of any coherent ethical guidance with respect to the use of mobile devices for teaching and learning.&nbsp; The practicioners I interviewed all brought this up as an area where guidance is crucially needed.</p>
<p>Much of the existing work that has been done in this area concerns research ethics and the ways in which one might research mobile learning in an ethical way.&nbsp; This is certainly something that I'm interested in, but it seems more innovative to me to expand the boundaries of the investigation beyond teaching and learning to look at the impact of communications technologies on social interaction more generally construed, on (inter-)subjectivity, and on processes of norm-formation and social mores.</p>
<p>I apreciate that this might take the project somewhat outside of the IET purview.&nbsp; The challenge of understanding the wider ethical ramifications of modern technologies is undoubtedly one which educational technologists should address.</p>
<p>I have two lines of inquiry in mind at the moment.&nbsp; Firstly, and drawing on my PhD research, would be a more general account of the relationship between technology and autonomy arising from the Frankfurt School tradition in critical theory.&nbsp; This will provide an initial framework for showing where some of the ethical considerations specific to mobile technologes might arise, and also has the virtue of allowing me to draw parallels and other links with pedagogies which emphasize the autonomy of the learner.&nbsp; I am also interested in drawing on Heidegger's later philosophy of technology to flesh out the kind of philosophical worries associated with the advance of technologies.</p>
<p>Obvioulsy, this might seem a little philosophy heavy for TEL, and I am keen to be quite explicit about the link to teaching and learning.</p>
<p>One realistic output might be a 'tool-kit' for practitioners with a bit of ethical guidance and ten principles to think about.&nbsp; It might even be worth looking up the relevant legislation and sticking that in there too!</p>
<p>I welcome any thoughts or reflections you may have to offer.</p>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2605</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Outline of the day</h2>
<p>9.30 &ndash; 9.45&nbsp; Arrival activity Setting personal and team objectives</p>
<p>9.45 &ndash; 9.55 Welcome and introductions</p>
<p>9.55 &ndash; 10.15 Derek K Milligan - Blended Learning at Brunel</p>
<p>10.15 &ndash; 10.35<strong> Activity: How to ruin a course</strong></p>
<p>This activity will focus on the key issues and   strategies that impact on the success (or otherwise) of learning and teaching   within your context. The output of this activity will be a team checklist   which will be used as one of the design evaluation tools in the design review   and at the end of the workshop.</p>
<p>10.35 &ndash; 11.15 <strong>Activity: &lsquo;At a glance&rsquo; course map</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;We will propose 5 key components of a course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidance and support</li>
<li>Information and experience</li>
<li>Communication and experience</li>
<li>Thinking and reflection</li>
<li>Evidence and demonstration</li>
</ul>
<p>and introduce a framework/ tool to begin mapping   out the key elements and &lsquo;flavour&rsquo; of the module/ short course designs. We   will discuss the nature of the resultant representations and explore possible   uses of these.</p>
<p>11.15 &ndash; 11.30 Tea and coffee</p>
<p>11.30 &ndash; 12.00<strong> Activity: Design review</strong></p>
<p>We will introduce 3 tools which can be used at   various points in the design process to represent, inform and reflect on   designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogical profiler</li>
<li>Design decision assistant</li>
<li>Ruin a course checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>Each team will use these tools to evaluate their   designs and inform their design decision making.</p>
<p>12.00 &ndash; 12.40&nbsp; <strong>Activity: Stalls activity</strong></p>
<p>Teams will split in to focus groups. Individuals,   with the support of expert facilitators, will explore one of the following   themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Library, media services and accessibility</li>
<li>Open Educational Resources</li>
<li>Pedagogy (including assessment)</li>
<li>Visualisation and representations</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals will then rejoin their work teams,   share findings and consider what the impact of these findings might be the   emerging designs. The expert facilitators will be available to offer support   for the remainder of the workshop and will upload links and resources to   Cloudworks as appropriate.</p>
<p>12.40 &ndash; 1.30 Lunch</p>
<p>1.30 &ndash; 3.00 <strong>Activity: Visualising designs</strong></p>
<p>Using all the online and physical resources   available, teams will draw up a more detailed representation of their module.   These representations are likely to include i.e. sequence, learning outcomes,   outlines of activities, technologies used, assessment strategies etc. Using   Compendium it is also possible to create links to specific OERs, tools and   resources. Designs and discussions around design problems and decisions will   be added to the Cloudworks site &ndash; allowing for collaborative discussion   between teams and opening up discussion beyond the workshop.</p>
<p>3.00 &ndash; 3.15 Tea and coffee</p>
<p>3.15 &ndash; 3.45<strong> Activity: Design Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;This activity will provide an opportunity to view   and review the designs of other teams and give and receive feedback. It is   recognised that designs at this stage will contain detail but will not   necessarily be &lsquo;finished&rsquo;.</p>
<p>3.45 &ndash; 4.15<strong> Activity: Next steps and action   planning</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is hoped that this practical session will lead   to the design or redesign of modules/short courses and that these will be &lsquo;launched&rsquo;   over the next few months. This activity will give teams an opportunity to   identify the next steps in the design process and what further support they   may need from the University or the OULDI project team.</p>
<p>4.15 &ndash; 4.30 Close of session and evaluation of workshop</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Two laptops per team will be provided but please also feel free to bring your own if you would like to.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;So that your teams can export the Compendium maps and save any other work done on workshop laptops, please ensure that you bring at least one USB memory key with you per team.</em></p>]]></description>

<p>1. Review one other design and compare with your own. What did the other team do differently and what aspects are the same?</p>
<p>2. Identify 2 things you like about the design and one development point (add these to that teams Cloud)</p>
<p>3. Identify 2 things you like about your own design and one development point (add to your team Cloud)</p>
<p><em>Please ask your critical friend to identify 2 things they liked about your design and one development point and add this to your Cloud</em></p>]]></description>

The morning activities have been designed to give you&nbsp; the skills and knowledge you need.&nbsp; By this time you will have considered design questions such as staff to student ratio, balance of physical to online learning, the technologies you will use, assessment strategies, pedegogical approach and accessability issues. You, or someone in your team, will have learnt about approaches to visualisation and representataion too.</p>
<p>We recognise that this is just a one day workshop - and course designing often takes far longer than 6 hours - but we anticipate that by the end of this activity you will have a sound&nbsp; design outline on which to build. Please make proactive use all of the resources that you have to hand.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>In this activity you will move temporarily out of your curriculum teams and into special interest groups (stalls). The groups available for this session are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogy (including assessment</li>
<li>Library, Media services and Accessibility</li>
<li>Visualisations and representations</li>
<li>Open Educational resources</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure a good skills spead in your team, make sure at least 1 person goes along to each of the stalls.&nbsp; An expert will be facilitating each special interest group and the activity you will do in these groups is likely to be discussion based and focusing on some of the practicalities and also some of the issues. You will spend about 20 mins in your special interest group and then have an opportunity to feedback your findings to your team.</p>
<p>Learning outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develops Learning Design networks</li>
<li>Develops individual knowledge in an aspect of learning design/ e-pedagogy</li>
<li>Broadens teams' knowledge base in aspects of learning design/e-pedagogy</li>
</ul>

<p>In this activity evaluation/ reflection tools will be used to review teams' designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogy profile</li>
<li>Course dimensions</li>
<li>How to ruin a course checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>Each tool looks at a different aspect of your design, and each has strengths and limitations. It is intended that they should work effectively together.</p>
<p>1. Use the 3 tools to review your design (no more than 10 mins per tool)</p>
<p>2. Make a list of the changes you will make as a consequence of the review</p>
<p>3. Amend the design, save it to your pen drive and add to Slideshare</p>
<p>4. Update your&nbsp; Cloud with progress update and images as appropriate</p>]]></description>

The tool is text based and built around the premise that key learning design decisions will fall into one of&nbsp; 4 catagories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidance and support</li>
<li>Communication and collaboration</li>
<li>Reflection and demonstration</li>
<li>Content and experience</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'at a glance' representation gives a one-page overview of a module or course and can effectively communicate the 'flavour' or 'vision' of the course.</p>
<p>1. In your team, and using the Word proforma on the pen drive, outline your 'vision' of your module or short course.</p>
<p>2. Save a copy&nbsp; to the pen drive.</p>
<p>3. Upload to the workshop Slideshare account</p>
<p>4. Have a look at the other groups 'at a glance' representations and discuss the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well do the representations communicate the 'flavour of the course'?</li>
<li>Who might find this representation useful and when?</li>
<li>What would it be useful to add?</li>
</ul>]]></description>

The output of this activity will be a design checklist which you can use as one of the design evaluation tools in a mid-way design review and at the end of the workshop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. List the 10 best ways to ensure your module or short course will fail!</p>
<p>2. Share these with the others by uploading your lists to this Cloud (<em>'add extra content'</em>).</p>
<p>3. What are the key themes?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim of this arrival activity is to provide teams with an opportunity to review personal objectives within the team and decide on team objectives for the day. The list will be used at the end of the session to frame reflection and evaluation.</p>
<p>This activity will take place while everyone is settling in, setting up lap tops etc and before the session starts properly.</p>
<p>1. Write down 3 personal objectives</p>
<p>2. Briefly share these with the team</p>
<p>3. Agree team objectives by identifying common themes within the team (no more than 6!)</p>
<p>4. Write these on the flip chart paper provided</p>
<p>5. <em>If you have time</em> add team objectives to this Cloud (by clicking on '<em>add extra content'</em>)</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This Cloud has been set up to aggregate tools, resources and discussion around Visualisation and representation of the Curriculum at three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum</li>
<li>Module or unit</li>
<li>Activity</li>
</ul>
<p>The Brunel Blended Design workshop will focus on representing at module or short course level but it should be noted that less work has been done around representing at this level. It is likely that you will take tools and strategies from both the Curriculum and Activity level 'toolboxes'.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[Students often progress at different speeds, for example where theoretical concepts are concerned, but contact time with teachers is limited – especially when students are attending college on a day-release basis, as on this course.

Here, the leader of a course on gas services installation and maintenance assembled VLE resources – such as notes and handouts, diagrams, photographs, and videos – to allow students to reinforce difficult concepts at their own pace and then follow them up in class. The VLE also delivers practice assessments and mock exams.
