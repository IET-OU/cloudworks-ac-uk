<p>Abstract:MOOCs have been hyped, written about and produced extensively since 2012, which was &lsquo;the year of the MOOC&rsquo; (Pappano 2012). Yet in 2017 they have not yet gone away. Whilst &lsquo;online&rsquo; and &lsquo;digital&rsquo; learning are the new buzzwords what has changed, been enabled and developed through producing MOOCs? An extensive 3-year Masters research journey to understand the rationale, implementation and impacts of MOOCs upon Higher Education Institutions now presents key findings. <br /> <br />The international MOOC survey www.moocsurvey.org features responses from 28 countries and 96 unique institutions that is coupled with 10 in-depth interviews with leading academic and business individuals. Collaboration and building upon existing research from the EU HOME Survey (Jansen, 2016) and USA Grade Level repot (Allen &amp; Seaman 2015) make this holistic and detailed research. Over 78% of the responses are from UK higher education institutions using the FutureLearn platform. The research data is open to all. Excellent collaboration and further analysis opportunities exist. <br /> <br />MOOCS have acted as catalysts of change &ndash; accelerating innovation occurring across institutions and campuses whilst also providing a focus for changing policy and practical approaches to blended, digital and distance learning - enabling these approaches to become the norm. <br /> <br />Find out how impacts from MOOCs changed expectations about online learning spaces, of on-campus teaching provision through blended learning, staff development and consistent approaches to pedagogical-driven use of technology in education. <br /> <br /> <br />References <br />Allen, E., &amp; Seaman, J.

              <title>Learning to Act in the Telepresence Classroom: the case of King Lear Online </title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Tom Gorman, Daniel Villar-Onrubia, <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/kc4683.html" target="_blank">Koula Charitonos</a>, Mikko Kanninen and Tiina Syrj&auml;</p>
<p>Telepresence is commonly referred to as a sense of &lsquo;being there&rsquo; in a virtual environment (International Society for Presence Research, 2000) and may be defined as&nbsp;&ldquo;live video that allows for human-sized interactions, while offering clear sound and visual fidelity to individuals in remote rooms&rdquo; (Miller et al., 2015). The project Immersive Telepresence in Theatre explores the potential of telepresence for teaching and learning in the field of performing arts, with a particular focus on learning to act. The project seeks to facilitate international virtual mobility collaboration between theatre students at the University of Tampere (Finland) and Coventry University (UK). <br /> <br />The paper reports an evaluation of King Lear Online study, which took place over a week in February 2017. The study was designed for two groups of undergraduate students (N=29), geographically separated, to&nbsp;meet synchronously via webcam links and perform acts based on the text of &lsquo;King Lear&rsquo; by Shakespeare. The study largely draws on ethnographic approaches to investigate how real and virtual environments intersect to support teaching and learning for educators/learners/performers and analyse any opportunities and challenges that may emerge in this setting. It also sought to examine the pedagogic practices that the telepresence technology enables for synchronous teaching and learning across two different sites and&nbsp;time zones, and finally to look at individual&rsquo;s experience as being mediated by technology. <br /> <br />The paper will focus on two whole group warm-up sessions, one led by a theatre practitioner at the University of Tampere and another one by vocal practitioner at Coventry University. Qualitative data will be presented: video data from the sessions in the telepresence classroom, interviews with the educators, along with reflective interview data from the students and fieldnotes from the researchers. <br /> <br />Essentially the paper contributes to the growing field of online teaching and learning and makes a substantial contribution to the field of virtual mobility for international collaboration on subject-specific learning activities. <br /> <br />References <br />International Society for Presence Research (2000).&nbsp;The Concept of Presence: Explication Statement.&nbsp;At: https://ispr.info/&nbsp; (Retrieved 31.3.17) <br /> Carrie&nbsp;Miller, C.

<p>Learner retention is a critical issue in distance education. A number of strategic initiatives are taking place at the Open University (OU) UK, both internal and external, focusing activity on the development of approaches to enhance student outcomes. This presentation will detail one institutional intervention, the OU Analyse (OUA), which draws on predictive modelling and student probabilities, to identify and predict students at risk of failing their studies. OUA (https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/) uses machine learning methods to improve student retention. It provides weekly early warning indicators of students who may be at risk of not submitting their next assignment. It is intended to be used by tutors and student support services to enhance student retention across the OU. It was originally piloted with 10 courses. A follow-up evaluation has been planned with 25 courses across all faculties to conclude on its impact on student performance. Findings from the piloting of OUA with 10 modules will be presented. Data were collected from students' completion, pass and withdrawal rates and semi-structured interviews with tutors who used OUA. This presentation aims to provide illuminating insights about the use of predictive modelling in Higher Education (HE) and spark discussions about how institutions can design and implement effective interventions for minimising early exit from HE and enhancing the learning experience.</p>

              <title>Using Web 2.0 Technologies To Foster Collaborative Learning in Higher Education</title>

<p>Previous research has indicated that technology can support teams to share knowledge, expertise, and to build effective shared mental models. At the same time, several studies have indicated that technology might influence team dynamics negatively, as there might be miscommunications due to time delays or technological affordances. However, to what extent does the use of open technology changes teams&rsquo; perceptions of their own performance? This is the central aim of this study, whereby we aim to unpack students&rsquo; perceptions about their team learning as measured by Team Learning Beliefs (TLB) by the use of Moxtra. This is a WEB 2.0 tool able to integrate real-time conversation capabilities with file sharing and editing facilities, improving other popular discussion board, including students&rsquo; favourite WhatsApp, as supportive technology for collaborative learning. The study compared the perceptions about their team performance and effectiveness of two courses, whereby 36 students worked in 11 teams with Moxtra, while in the comparison cohort 57 students worked in teams without Moxtra. The results indicated limited effects of using technology in the students&rsquo; team performance perceptions, as there were not significant differences between both group&rsquo;s median answers to the different variables. Our findings could suggest that students&rsquo; inexperience in collaborative learning prevent teams to grasp all potentials technology could offer.</p>]]></description>

              <title>WED: Designing accessible courses - a reflection on the use of UDL and OERs to create an open education course (Danny Ball)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10192</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Since 1974, disabled students in England have been able to apply for non-repayable grants, known as &lsquo;Disabled Students&rsquo; Allowances (DSAs)&rsquo;, to assist with the additional costs incurred whilst completing higher education study (Willetts, 2014). Such grants provided allowances for specialised equipment, non-medical assistance such as note takers and specialised tutors, books and consumables, as well as travel allowances (Disability Rights UK, 2015). In addition to the support provided by DSAs, the introduction of the Equality Act 2010 placed a legal duty on businesses and education providers to take positive steps, referred to as &lsquo;reasonable adjustments&rsquo;, to remove barriers faced by people, due to their disability (Citizens Advice, n.d.). This includes making changes to the ways things are done e.g. provision, criterion or practice; physical features of buildings such as entrances and exits; as well as the provision of extra aids or services such as: induction hearing loops, providing information in alternative formats etc. (Citizens Advice, n.d.).</p>
<p>Despite the reasonable adjustments implemented by higher education institutions (HEIs), the costs of the DSA provision have risen sharply from &pound;101.3m in 2009-10 to &pound;145.8m in 2012-13, an increase of 44% (Weale, 2015). In 2014, the Minister for Universities and Science announced a series of changes to modernise the existing system to &lsquo;rebalance&rsquo; responsibilities for student support. Thus, ensuring that the limited public funding is available to those most in need, and provides the support they require (Willetts, 2014). The changes are designed to move away from a system of individualised support funded by DSAs, to one where HEIs play a greater role in supporting all students, regardless of whether they have a disability or not.</p>
<p>With these changes coming into force from September 2016, HEIs within England have been required to review and, if required, revise their current student support arrangements to ensure they are prepared for these changes and can support learners effectively (McNaught, 2016). Whilst there are many small and simple changes academic staff can take to improve the accessibility of their teaching such as: providing information ahead of sessions, creating learning materials which meet accessibility guidelines and encouraging students to record teaching sessions etc. (Canterbury Christ Church University, n.d.), this does not resolve the underlying issues. As McNaught (2016) summarises &lsquo;[t]eaching and learning pedagogies, practices and technologies can inadvertently create barriers for students with disabilities&rsquo;, to overcome these a different approach is required.</p>
<p>To address some of the challenges raised by these recent changes and the need for HEIs to make anticipatory, rather than reactive changes, this conference presentation will provide an overview and demonstration of a short online course being developed by the author. Built using the Canvas open education platform, this short course aimed at academics working within UK HEIs, will provide a more in-depth overview of the changes to disabled student support, whilst also introducing delegates to two educational frameworks; Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Inclusive Curriculum. Building on research undertaken by Marquis et al. (2016), this course will utilise a flipped learning pedagogy; whereby the learning materials are placed online and classroom sessions are used to enable deeper exploration and discussion of the topics raised (The Higher Education Academy, n.d.).

              <title>WED: How open is the digital environment for disabled students in higher education? (Jennie Augustyniak)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9546</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9546</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>One perspective: Increasingly students in higher education (HE) study in a digital environment, using a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). In open education, most learning materials, teaching, and library services are delivered online. Both are enabling. Additionally, many students use assistive technologies to support their access and engagement with study. &lsquo;Digital&rsquo; and &lsquo;open&rsquo; are used interchangeably and considered widely as inherently enabling. Similarly, &lsquo;access&rsquo; and &lsquo;accessibility&rsquo; are substituted often and there is general expectation they lead to effective outcomes.</p>
<p>Another perspective: The situation for disabled students is not that simple &ndash; the pathway to &lsquo;open&rsquo; (inclusion) is not necessarily digital, and a digital environment can be a barrier. Similarly, there is not a causal link between &lsquo;access&rsquo; and &lsquo;use&rsquo; for disabled students and assistive technologies. The interaction of disabled students with digital learning and teaching raises unexpected complexities.</p>
<p>The presentation: looks at an increase in reported difficulties for disabled students following the implementation of a VLE. The large UK university provided offline digital alternatives, but received requests for an &lsquo;individual reasonable adjustment&rsquo; to address the increase in screen time required. Two problems had arisen &ndash; a digital barrier following the implementation of a VLE and an apparent lack of take up by disabled students of the alternative technologies that the university anticipated would remove that barrier. And a third &ndash; the adjustment most requested was for the student to move offline and revert to paper-based learning. Whilst this may be acceptable, in that the university responded as requested, there was concern it was not the most effective or sustainable solution.</p>
<p>The issues were complex and had many stakeholders so were explored through a workshop, supported by a learning activity, which was informed by student consultation. Seven issues were addressed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are the adjustment requests well informed?</li>
<li>Does the adjustment enable access to online learning?</li>
<li>Does the adjustment enable disabled students make the most effective use of online learning?</li>
<li>Do disabled students miss out on the rich experience of the VLE?</li>
<li>Are disabled students hindered in the opportunity to become &lsquo;digital scholars&rsquo;?</li>
<li>Do disabled students value the adjustment made (does it meet their expectations)?</li>
<li>Are disabled students empowered in their use and adoption of technologies?</li>
</ol>
<p>The presentation will share more of this story and illustrate it with case studies. Participants will discover more about the learning activity, which was used to bring stakeholders to a level of understanding prior to the workshop. It will conclude with the outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student consultation on individual reasonable adjustments</li>
<li>Improved view of disabled students&rsquo; needs for access to and effective use of online learning.</li>
<li>Improved view of disabled students&rsquo; use and adoption of technology and the support required.</li>
<li>Updated process for making and handling responsive adjustments.</li>
<li>Better informed operational practice in supporting disabled students.</li>
<li>Assistive technologies and adjustments as exemplars and normalised to support learning styles, preferences, and students who are not permitted to study online.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conference participants can try the pre-workshop learning activity and the student consultation questions before the presentation.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I didn't really get this but spent a lot of time trying to understand. I found some of the instructions/ advice contradictory and couldn't figure out what a concern was and how it differed from a force until I had spent really 2 or 3 hours reconfiguring things. The thinking through was useful in that it helped me think about additional personas or actors in this project and therefore additonal challenges. But as with "rich pictures" in soft systems I just don't find this useful or natural to do. Anyway, I have uploaded a Force Map to google docs. Don't know how to embed here so see link.</p>
<p>Hoping for more success with this week's challenge and lots of help from my team mate.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>OK, week 2 of the mooc is nearly over, but I've been thinking a lot off-line about my dream project and how to bring it about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have set up two complementary working groups to help bring the online course into being - the first is a team of experienced practitioners, with specialist expertise in areas of content relevant to academic advising in higher education. This group exists off-line, with a first meeting in early February, and I will be adapting the content we already have in google, so that all members of the group can see/comment and build on what we have.</p>
<p>The second group is a group of close colleagues. I will follow - where possible - &nbsp;the pattern of engagement of the mooc to support how we develop the design and activities of the project. During this week (calendar week rather than course week) it is my intention to start to share outline designs with this group.</p>
<p>So we can see that, within the mooc, I haven't yet found a suitable study group. I will keep an eye on one that is around DIY audio/video since I may be setting this up for the specialists to add snippets of multimedia to the largely textual resource that we have.</p>
<p>I've listened to the weekly introduction and browsed the ecology of resources. Whilst I agree that context is highly important, and I also agree that significant are the relations between the learner and their context (people, places, things) - I am not sure how thinking about this specifically at this stage will help me to design a better course.&nbsp;However, I wholeheartedly embrace the idea of a learning scenario and will be writing one or two to start bringing some reality into the learning design.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This cloud represents a narrowed down version of my previous project: what I want to focus on thinking about here is ways that collaborative writing can be used to generate a variety of responses to a text: essays, sequels, etc. These are activities that could be used in a MOOC or a more traditional class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More specifically, my focus will be on higher education and adults since that is where my work is, and I want to begin by thinking about digital role playing as a form of collaborative writing.&nbsp;</p>

              <title>Frances Deepwell: My &#39;dream&#39; for a short course on academic advising/tutoring</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Professional Development for Academic Advisers</h2>
<p>One of the educational development projects I&rsquo;m working on right now is to develop a short online induction for all academic advisers (personal tutors) at our University. Just for clarity, this is not for specialist professionals in advising, this is for mainstream Faculty who support a certain number of advisees through the duration of their HE studies - the advice can be about a range of things such as making sense of their own learning across courses, keeping on track, developing critical self-awareness, gaining practical experiences outside the taught curriculum, making sense of professional options etc. <br /><br />This online course is a team development within the institution, and is based on our recent institutional research into students&rsquo; and staff experiences of academic advising and student support. <br /><br />I want to take advantage of the mooc community through sharing ideas on what works well, getting feedback on our developing design, and gaining insight into existing resources, which I am sure are plentiful. One of the major constraints we are facing is time and the timeline. The course needs to be up and ready for roll-out by the end of May. <br /><br />The other constraint is that the course will be part of the mandatory training for Faculty - the participants of the course will be across the spectrum of academic colleagues, and therefore the course needs to be inclusive of all HE levels, disciplinary and pedagogical variations, mode and location of students.<br /><br /></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">The Challenge</h3>
<p>I hope to achieve an online course which assists academic colleagues/faculty in becoming more confident and consistent in fulfilling their responsibility to provide academic advice to their advisees. There are information pages on the academic adviser role, which are being updated at the same time <a href="http://www.brookes.ac.uk/student/services/handbook/yourrole.html">http://www.brookes.ac.uk/student/services/handbook/yourrole.html</a> but the intention is to make this a learning experience rather than an information exchange.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Pedagogical approach</h3>
<p>The pedagogical approach is determined by team agreement and pragmatics. <br />The pedagogical intentions of this course pose some internal conflicts, which I&rsquo;ll need to resolve - here are three of them:</p>
<ul style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<li style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline;" dir="ltr">the course should be largely self-directed and stand-alone, but I want to offer something other than a page-turning tutorial</li>
<li style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline;" dir="ltr">the learning is both informational and reflective (for some, the learning is intended to bring about a transformational shift in professional behaviours)</li>
<li style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline;" dir="ltr">progress, or at least engagement in its elements, needs to be monitored</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Technologies:</h3>
<ul style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<li style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline;" dir="ltr">Moodle will be the base platform - other technologies will be determined later. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

              <title>Learning Design as Key for eLearning Quality</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6624</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6624</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p align="right"><strong>Teacher-led Inquiry and Learning Design: The Virtuous Circle</strong></p>
<p align="right"><em>A hands-on research workshop at the</em>, <em>January, 28 &ndash; February, 1st 2013</em>,&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Villard‐de‐Lans, Vercors</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning<em> design</em> is <em>the</em> keyword for an effective (e)Learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I maturated this position after mostly 25 years in research and practical work with technology enhanced learning (videotape, videodiscs, CDs, CBT, distance learning, eLearning, etc...) and 10 years (the last 10) of researches on eLearning quality.</p>
<p>In Italy most of university teachers implementing eLearning as part of their courses have in mind a very traditional model of eLearning, based on the transmission of knowledge and on the download of (textual) documents, with a very limited use of other resources, particularly environments that allow a dialogic approach (. Therefore, it is not surprising that eLearning courses are seen by the students as second choice courses (with some appreciation, anyway, by the students that work, and that do not have time to participate to the faculty life)</p>
<p>Only with the support of instructional designers and/or with the exposition to some examples &nbsp;of "good" teaching online the teachers are able to switch to a more constructivistic teaching framework, based on student collaboration, co-construction of multimedia materials, intensive forum use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;In my 25 years of educational technology work I was instructional designer and coordinator of a group of designers in two different universities in Italy (Milano and Trento), setting up in both cases an university level eLearning project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In both the Universities my main concern was:</p>
<ol>
<li>to prepare a group of instructional designers that could help the faculty in designing (mainly) constructivistic&nbsp; eLearning courses;</li>
<li>to promote the new possibilities offered by the educational technologies (i.e. showing&nbsp; to the different faculty professors examples of "non old-style" eLearning courses)</li>
</ol>
<p>My focus in the last 10 years has been quality of eLearning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;During 4 national level research projects (PRIN) I tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>to better understand what quality eLearning is at the different level (University, faculty, single course) and for the different stakeholders (university managers, dean, teachers, students) (P. Ghislandi, P. Calidoni, F. Falcinelli, C. Scurati, 2008). We adopted the 5 points Sloan-C model, especially concentrating in the "learning effectiveness" point </li>
<li>to build/validate/promote specific tools to help the teachers in designing &nbsp;more effective eLearning (P. Ghislandi, 2012) as key dimension of quality.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;I am now in this second phase, and I am managing (for Trento) a research that see the collaboration of Catholic University of Milan, State University of Milan Bicocca, University of Pavia, University of Verona,&nbsp; with the title: <em>Evaluation for the improvement of educational contexts. A research involving University and local communities in the participatory development of innovative assessment models.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My research group about quality in eLearning include a Chinese PhD student (Nan Yang) and an Argentinian post-doc researcher (Juliana Raffaghelli). We work a lot in an eResearch basis (N. Yang, P. Ghislandi, F. Cumer, 2011)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are now reflecting on which qualitative research methodology&nbsp; (Partecipative Action Research?, DBR-Design Based Research?, Grounded theory?, Mixed Methods?) will be the best to reach our goals that are:</p>
<ol>
<li>promote , in a case study in our own faculty, university professors&rsquo; reflection on (e)Learning design as key dimension for preparing &nbsp;effective (students learn) courses . In order to support this reflection, we provide university teachers with tools that <em>mediate </em>the process of reflection (Ghislandi &amp; Raffaghelli, 2012) </li>
<li>involve the university professors in participatory action research (the concept id very near to what you call Teacher-led Inquiry into Student Learning (TISL) about quality Technology Enhanced Learning), as a mean to promote the expression of their <em>agency </em>as professionals of education, understanding eLearning as part of &nbsp;a context of educational shift where they are engaged (Ghislandi, Raffaghelli &amp; Yang, in press)</li>
</ol>
<p>But perhaps the most important thing is that I have always implemented what I suggested: a socio-constructivist approach to my academic courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was very well impressed when I read the call for expression of interest about the <em>Workshop on Teacher-led Inquiry and Learning Design</em>, because I immediatly thought that this will be a marvelous opportunity to:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>share our ideas and gain new perspectives with people that are working/researching in similar fields and <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>learn on other approaches to support the introduction of eLearning at University Level, in general, and Learning Design as strategy to promote university teachers&rsquo; reflection on&nbsp; technological and pedagogical issues concerning the implementation of eLearning courses. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The aims of the workshop are really significant to me!</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish a new area of research in Education, synergizing LD and TISL, and focusing on context, practice and change</li>
<li>Network to build a new community around this research theme</li>
<li>Produce 5-6 draft papers for a special journal issue</li>
<li>Potential for new significant research grant proposals</li>
<li>Archive the work outputs from the workshop activities as a useful resource to other practitioners</li>
</ol>

              <title>University students as co-designers of inquiry-based learning scenarios: shortening distances between teaching and learning</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6597</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6597</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of this paper is to present a research proposal as a response to the need for inquiry on new participatory approaches of learning design in the field of higher education. Learning scenarios are required that better connect with the skills and interests of specific groups of students, both in regard to the methodological strategies and the uses of supporting technological tools proposed. In the next pages we expose the arguments of our research approach, drawing on existing literature and proposing cross-overs among the fields of learning design, participatory design, inquiry-based learning and student participation. Our assumption is that it is necessary to rethink the learning design processes at the university on the basis of the collaboration between teachers and students in the creation of new learning scenarios. These scenarios should empower the student in the learning process, through a personal, deep and transversal use of technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results obtained in various recent studies (Lorenzo, Oblinger y Dziuban, 2006, UCL-Cyber Group, 2008; Duart, Gil, Pujol and Brown, 2008;) show that university students, also called digital natives, do not generally incorporate in their academic practices a mature use of ICT, which improves their learning quality and depth. In general, the uses of technology are rather basic and directed by teachers through knowledge transfer activities. It has also been observed that the preferences and skills for ICT academic and "intellectual" use vary depending on the students characteristics, under the influence of factors such as the area of study, gender, age, etc. The research of Kennedy et al. (2006) for instance showed the lack of homogeneity with respect to ICT use among first year university students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been involved in a R+D national project on the uses of ICT by Spanish university students. Our results confirm those obtained in previous studies conducted in different countries, showing that although university students may have sufficient digital skills to use ICT in their everyday life, they use them to a much lesser extent for academic purposes, and this use is often relegated and restricted to teacher instructions. This fact contradicts the evolution that ICT use is experiencing in other areas, the increasingly complex digital skills that it represents as well as different cognitive and social skills that it puts into play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several authors have referred to the gap between the technology potential and its actual exploitation in educational contexts (Conole, Dyke Oliver, Seale, 2004; Strijbos, Kirschner, and Martens, 2004), as well as to the need to provide guidance in the design of learning, the selection of the right tools and how to use them from certain pedagogical approaches (Conole, Oliver, Falconer, Littlejohn and Harvey, 2007; Conole, 2008).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the role of university as an enabler agent of future professionals as lifelong learners is socially put into question. In Europe, the changes proposed by the EHEA do not seem to have the desired effect in terms of methodological change, intensive use of ICT and students involvement. Trinder et al. (2008) argue that while formal education persists in the use of pedagogical models based on the transmission of knowledge, the boundaries between formal and informal will persist. Only changes in the pedagogical orientation will be able to bridge both worlds allowing the exploitation of ICT uses and learning processes in everyday situations in academic contexts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From our perspective, inquiry-based learning can contribute to improving learning through the use of technology enhanced environments, providing a stronger link between the use of technology in informal situations and with learning purposes, either in academic or other contexts. The approach of learning through inquiry is a broad label that covers various pedagogical approaches but all of them have in common the student in the role of the researcher, providing him a greater control and responsibility in the learning process. This way of understanding the academic activity blurs the traditional division between teaching and research. In fact, recent studies have suggested that one of the most powerful ways to promote deep learning is to involve students in research activities as contexts of inquiry-based learning (Brew, 2006).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning through inquiry represents a significant contribution to the experience of university students as it provides situations that stimulate their ability to solve problems, require their active role in authentic contexts, involves knowledge construction processes and triggers reflection and deep learning. However, teaching from this approach is not easy. Research on this topic (Ellis. et al, 2005; Ellis and Goodyear, 2010) indicates that teachers need support in the design and implementation of this kind of learning activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several authors (Reigeluth, 1999; Ellis and Goodyear, 2010) have argued that although education has always involved planning and design, the need to invest efforts in the systematic design that clearly and constantly establishes and guides student activity, may be especially high in networked learning situations. On the other hand, Trigwell et al. (2000) state that in order to achieve the implementation of academic knowledge in real practice, teachers need to be informed of the theoretical perspectives of learning and teaching, reflect on their practice through systematic research, present their results to their peers, etc. This will create a breakthrough in understanding how to achieve deep learning (Kreber, 2003; Trigwell and Shale, 2004).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the initial focus of &ldquo;learning design&rdquo; was on learning objects, in recent years, its attention has shifted to learning activities, their description, parameterization and representation (Conole, 2008). In this sense, the design of the scenarios (including socio-cultural, pedagogical approach and learning objects) in which these activities will be developed allows to elicit learning processes intended to be facilitated and promoted among students. The field of learning design or &ldquo;design for learning&rdquo; has developed in recent years and now offers as a good set of tools, systems, patterns and models (McAndrew and Goodyear, 2007; Masterman and Vogel, 2007; Craft, Brock and Mor, 2012) that can empower teachers to design scenarios that provide richer learning experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participatory design or, also named, co-design methods have been used in the last years in the educational domain learning design purposes. Those experiences have typically involved teachers, researchers and developers as partners in educational innovation processes. Co-design has often implied participation in design and deployment of technological tools aimed at supporting learning processes (Mor and Winters, 2006; Roschelle, Penuel, Schechtman, 2007). In the co-design method the active and joint participation of different actors enables the traceability and the interpretation of the phenomena associated with the use of certain methodologies and technological tools. It is usually based on teachers&rsquo; active participation in the process of the innovation design, as well as in its implementation and ongoing evaluation in daily practice. This procedure ensures the connection and orchestration of theory, models of practice, tools and participants perceptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking as its fundamental point of reference the needs of the stakeholders, the co-design method retains many similarities with the approach of student-centered learning. This approach recognizes the "student voice" to their circumstances, abilities, interests, learning style, etc. as a focus and starting point for the design of learning situations. It proposes further responsibility and active engagement of the student for their own learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, different authors have proposed methodologies in which students and teachers participate in "co-generative" talks, aimed at sharing their perspectives and jointly reflect on how to improve the practice of teaching and learning (Roth, Lawless and Tobin, 2000). More recently, direct involvement of students as learning "co-designers" has started to be explored in different educational contexts (Scanlon et al., 2009; K&ouml;nings, Brand-Gruwel and van Merri&euml;nboer, 2011; Cameron and Gotlieb, 2009; Cameron and Tanti, 2011). Some results show that this approach can promote deeper learning among students and also provide key elements and opportunities to guide teacher intervention. However, there are still few studies addressing the effects of this approach in higher education. Moreover, some of these studies have found different points of tension that may hinder the co-design process (Penuel, Roschelle and Schechtman, 2007; Scanlon et. al, 2009; Brand-Gruwel and van Merri&euml;nboer, 2011). On the other hand, students&rsquo; involvement is often limited to specific workshops and not allowed along the whole design process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that co-design processes participated by teachers, students and researchers may have a positive impact both in enhancing student engagement in learning and in improving teachers understanding about learning and teaching processes. The results obtained in research-based teaching and learning activities and projects have been promising (Neary and Winn, 2011; Wieman, 2004 and Brew, 2006). However, although the literature comprises a range of rationales for students&rsquo; participation in curriculum design, there is still little systematic evaluation on its real impact and specific dynamics (Bovill, Morss and Bulley, 2009).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project aims to make progress in the research about methodologies based on inquiry learning processes with technological support in higher education. The purpose of the project is to study the application of a model based on inquiry pedagogy to generate learning scenarios in universities that can be adapted to different training contexts and student profiles. To do this, the elements that configure those contexts and profiles will be identified, such as the area of knowledge, the academic level, and students&rsquo; competence in ICT use for learning purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These scenarios, generated from a co-design process involving teachers, students and experts in instructional design, will be based on a more mature, self-managed, and transversal use of technology, in order to allow the intersection among different contexts and activities in which students develop learning processes beyond the university Virtual Campus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project intends to contrast the proposed learning scenarios with students&rsquo; actual interests and learning perception. It is also the purpose of the research to develop tools and patterns that support the representation and the explanation of the designs. Acting as mediating artifacts among participants those patterns and tools could scaffold the co-design process (Scanlon et al., 2009) and at the same time facilitate the sharing of the design scenarios and its transference to other areas (Mor and Winters, 2006). The specific objectives of the project are formulated as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To study and propose the inquiry based model to inform the design of new learning scenarios in the university, identifying the elements that allow its adaptation to different contexts of practice and student profiles.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To develop and analyze a co-design strategy of learning scenarios involving, as key players, teachers, students and techno-pedagogical design experts.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To design and analyze learning scenarios based on deep, transversal and autonomous ICT use by students from the inquiry model.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To propose and use tools and patterns to represent and explain the co-design process and the resulting scenarios, so that they can be shared, repurposed and reused by other teachers.</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To validate and systematize the used inquiry model as well as the instruments and the proposed design strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study will apply the methodology of design-based research as the most appropriate and consistent with the project theoretical framework and the set research goals. The design of the investigation is iterative, situated, and led to the intervention but underpinned by theory. Research is not defined by the methodology (quantitative or qualitative) but by its object, which is essentially to explain and to support a process of change. The object of study is therefore the very process of designing the learning scenarios, taking as key agents both the teachers and the students to whom those practices are addressed to. A mixed approach (quantitative and qualitative) will be used for data collection, analysis and interpretation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that this research proposal can contribute in different ways to the field of learning design by providing a new insight on participatory design processes based on teacher and student led inquiry.</p>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4629</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Would like to share with the group an innovative approach to enhancing employability through an online &lsquo;serious game&rsquo;.&nbsp; Aimed at Psychology undergraduates, the game helps students to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the skills and attributes employers want from graduates</li>
<li>Identify the skills gained in their degree</li>
<li>Articulate these skills in mock interviews</li>
<li>Practice communicating these skills to employers</li>
</ul>
<p>The game features a skills section where users must think about their relevant skills, a tests section where they can attempt aptitude tests, and a job application section complete with a mock interview. <br /><br />Enhancing Employability is still in its early phases and we are seeking funding to &nbsp;develop it further in the future, expanding to include Law students and refining the personalised element of feedback. It is currently available to play for free and is accompanied by an online feedback form to help us improve the game.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This cloud is set up to collect opinions and resources related to IPad as a tool for teaching and learning. Any ideas for a first pilot? Any concerns? Actually it is not easy to imagine the spread and utilization of a device that to date we only know thanks to a demo show. However, its impact on discourses is already apparent and some traces of new scenarios are emerging even in these early days. I think it is worth reflecting on issues such as: what can an IPad add to the experience of a mobile learner? what kind of (e)learning the IPad will privilege = i.e. + multimedia - conversations? what is its sustainability in an era of funding cuts also in academia? Will the "Everest syndrome" (Maddux) affect educators again, with the advent of IPad? I mean: will we all are willing to use the new device merely because "it's there" available? And so on...Certainly you have better questions on this theme.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This cloud has been set up as a space for our evolving review of the literature of the use of web 2.0 in HE. We will add more on the structure and links etc are they emerge. Our tentative structure for the report is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction and methodology of study </li>
<li>Key findings&nbsp; &ndash; themes from empirically grounded literature / studies <br /> 
<ul>
<li>Types of Web 2.0 (peer-collaboration, networking, grid technologies for eScience, eSocialScience, public and private)</li>
<li>Higher education and infromal learning: re-assessing boundaries?</li>
<li>E-research/e-scholarship, teaching and learning, blended models [c.f. the positionality of educational technologists in HE instituions]</li>
<li>Crowdsourcing in HE and OER platforms OERs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discussion -  opportunities, risks and policies: beyond the hype and sustainablity and media (information and skills) literacies 
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recommendations and suggestions for future work</li>
</ul>
<p>As our work develops we will provide a link to the evolving report itself. Contact details: p.alevizou@open.ac.uk g.c.conole@open.ac.uk</p>]]></description>

Over the past year CILASS (Centre for Inquiry-based Learning in the Arts and Social Sciences), a Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning at the University of Sheffield, has been developing learning design case studies of the inquiry-based learning curriculum development projects it has been funding across the University. We now have over 30 learning designs across a number of disciplines and ranging in scope from relatively small activities to entire inquiry-based modules, which can be viewed at our <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/cilass/cases" title="case studies website" target="_blank">case studies website</a>. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In addition, we have been working with a learning design tools known as LAMS (Learning Activity Management System) to investigate its effectiveness indesigning for inquiry-based learning. The results of this project, known as DESILA (Designing and Sharing Inquiry-based Learning Activities) can be seen at the <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/desila/" title="project website" target="_blank">project website</a>, while individual case studies are accessed via the CILASS <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/cilass/cases/projectlist.html" title="case studies website" target="_blank">case studies website</a>.
