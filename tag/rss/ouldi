              <title>Activity: 40 mins: Pen portraits</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>In this activity you will write 4-6 pen portraits which describe a series of student personas. You can use these to help inform and guide your design decisions.</p>
<p>1. Begin by finding some pictures of people who could be your students. Remember that if you expect to share these pictures with others you need to ask permission of the individual involved or use a Creatice Commons licenced picture (free to use and share). Having a picture will help you keep you pen-portrait as real as possible.</p>
<p>2. Next,&nbsp;complete in the sections below (add any you think are missing). Be descriptive but keep each section relatively short so that each of your pen portraits fits on one side of paper.&nbsp;Make sure that your personas represent the full extents of your student group (i.e. in terms of motivations, skills, expectations and needs) so that they properly test your design thinking. While these pen portraits are imaginary, it is likley that you will be using your memories of some real students; make sure that no real students can be identified!</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I used the Course Features cards on a Design workshop with 11 university librarians this morning.I split the class into 3 groups and gave each a set of cards. We used the sample task on study skills. I asked each group to select about 16 cards that they would use and then rank them in a diamond shape. Each group summarised its diamond on a flip chart. Interestingly, two of the groups chose very similar cards while the third was completely different. We then went on to complete a course map. This all took about 45 minutes. I could have spent longer on the course map.</p>
<p>I got a very positive response form the class. One minor negative - some participants found it difficult to distinguish the purple from the blue coloured cards.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Can learning design = mind control? How to avoid?</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>@JeffWaistell sent me a tweet suggesting that learning design was even more messy, iterative, dynamic and political than the models and frameworks we are introducing in week 3 of the OLDSMOOC might suggest - and I didn't disagree. My view is that at the heart of our learning design practice is our view on what learning is for - and that is highly political.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff response was to ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"So learning design can = mind control? How to avoid? How to balance learning agenda by involving key stakeholders and views?"</strong></p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.&rdquo; - Albert Einstein <br /><br />As we wrote in our <a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/blog/week3weekendround-up">weekend summary</a> (OLDS-MOOC week 3), we have been struck by the creative response to the tools we have offered up this week and levels of enjoyment some of you have expressed in using them. One of the messages that has come out loud and clear from our own research is that staff involved in the curriculum design process in institutional settings do not generally find the process very creative, and they feel that their ideas get tied down too early. We'd argue that from a learning design perspective, the balance and tension between creativity and precision is an important one. Where do you sit on this? Is creativity actually more important than precision? What is the relationship between precision and creativity?</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Getting off the computer and into an activity, ideally a collaborative one, is always productive.</p>
<p>A carefully moderated workshop can reveal the unexpected, more importantly it is an informed way to prioritise issues and to use a the combined expertise of a variety of people. From the OU Course B822 Creative Innovation and Change I learnt the value of constructing a team of people to address a problem - from different backgrounds, with different responsibilities and outlooks, even someone to rock the boat. No one person&rsquo;s voice is allowed to override the views of others. Such a group would achieve a lot with this OULDI pack. Though game-like it is a valid and valuable tool.<br /><br /><strong>Working alone there were a number of hurdles to overcome:</strong><br /><br />A black and white printer.<br />The sheets were printed off then painted. Not liking the look of the purple these cards all become yellow.<br />Ideally they would all be spray-glued to backing card to make them more robust - at least so that they don&rsquo;t curl up at the edges.<br />On the first sweep I got the 38 number of cards down to 26. This was gradually reduced in 2s and 3s until there were the requisite 16.</p>
<p><strong>The 16x16 spreadsheet is a Google Doc that I can share. This is the outcome:</strong></p>
<p><em>(I took the orange to be red, and didn't like the purple I mixed with the box of old watercolour paints I dug out to make my set of cards).</em></p>

Used a pairs table the 16 cards were ranked</strong></em><br /><br />Using a paired-sets in a table I was able to rank these 16 - clearly the exercise of discussing these with colleagues would have been extremely useful and the process of deliberation brought up issues of budget, resources and time-scale, and even refined the project as it is conceived and visualised as a certain number of activities.</p>

<p>In terms of the module DIY Mutlimedia I become very aware of the value of learning alongside an expert, of being with skilled practioners even - and very much the need to have a project brief to work to. So very much a hands on learning experience with authentic tools to create a real object or digital asset, or activity. This would also take the learners away from the computer screen, even out of the classroom into a design studio or agency. In fact the 'Online' card didn't make it into the 16. Even though this is to develop skills in use of digital multimedia tools I felt I was organising a workshop for potters, painters and tapestry weavers i.e. there is a highly practical element to it and there's nothing better than having a live guide at your shoulder ... and if there has to be a compromise then it would be live or 'as live' instruction over the Internet.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>We are  pleased to report there has been lots of interest in the OLDS MOOC (Open  Learning Design Studio Massive Open Online Course) over the last few months with  over 800 people having registered their interest.</p>
<p>After  consultation with many of those planning to participate or present, we have also  confirmed the start and end dates for the OLDS MOOC.&nbsp; The MOOC will run from  <strong>10<sup>th</sup> January &ndash; 13<sup>th</sup> March 2013</strong>.&nbsp; This is slightly later  than originally advertised, but takes into account that October and November are  often busy times for Further and Higher Education professionals and allows those  commencing post-graduate courses to settle into those  first</p>
<p>The course  website is currently being built and you will be able to see the course taking  shape over the next few months at <a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/">www.olds.ac.uk</a>.&nbsp; There will be monthly updates on  the website blog and the course has a Twitter account at  OLDS-MOOC.</p>
<p>We are  grateful for your continuing interest in this free, open online course on  curriculum and learning design.</p>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL PRESS RELEASE: </strong>The Open University&rsquo;s Institute of Educational Technology  is leading the first Open Learning Design Studio MOOC (Massive Open Online  Course) focusing on the theme of curriculum design with OERs, to be held in  Autumn 2012.</p>
<p>This course will be valuable for anyone seeking to develop their  professional skills and experience in curriculum design, learning design and use  of OERs in education. In particular the course will appeal to new and  established HE and FE lecturers, to those completing professional certificates  in teaching, and to researchers and managers of teaching and learning  innovation.</p>
<p>The course aims to (1) provide a rich open learning  experience for teaching and learning professionals (2) build greater skills and  understandings of Curriculum and Learning Design theories and frameworks, with  an emphasis on the reuse of OERs (3) help participants appreciate the need for  careful educational crafting of learning experience and associated curriculum  structures and (4) empower participants to become more effective educators and  change agents in their own context.</p>
<p>Eight core themes will provide the focus for weekly  activities, speaker presentations, discussions and postings of useful resources  and tools. It will give access to, and the opportunity to learn from, successful  UK JISC and HEA projects in addition to some of the best of European  initiatives. The resulting aggregate resource will remain online for future  use.</p>
<p>The term MOOC stands for &lsquo;Massive&rsquo; Open Online Course and  we expect to achieve an educational equivalent of this by offering truly open  opportunities to introduce new themes, debate topics and self-select material.  In addition, a basic underlying core pathway will offer an entry route for those  new to open courses or who have limited time.</p>
<p>Further details regarding how to get involved, start  dates, and core themes will be announced during the summer. In the meantime,  please register your interest here: <a title="blocked::http://goo.gl/j5jIe" href="http://goo.gl/j5jIe">http://goo.gl/j5jIe</a> (or use the embedded form below) so we can keep you informed.

<div id="wikipage-inner">
<p>Embedding Information Literacy: Information literacy is a key component in the development of the student as an independent learner.  Where students are guided from the outset in developing IL skills they  will be better able to find, evaluate and use material to support their  learning, and to carry on learning throughout their employment and life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Using the cards: </strong>These  cards have been developed by the Open University's Library Services  Unit in collaboration with OULDI-JISC project (2011) and are designed to  help you consider how to effectively integrate information literacy  into individual modules and/ or whole programmes. They are grouped according to the 4 skills areas covered by the IL Levels Framework:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Understand the information landscape</li>
<li>Plan and carry out a search</li>
<li>Critically evaluate information</li>
<li>Manage and communicate your results</li>
</ol>&nbsp;Each skill area has 4 cards, one each for 1st, 2nd, 3rd and Masters level. On the front of each card you will find the broad skill area, and on the back the outcomes for the relevant level.  Use these cards in module team meetings, workshops and staff  development sessions, or to help explain IL to employers, tutors and  students.
<p><br />The cards will help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>decide on learning outcomes, teaching and assessment of IL skills at a particular level</li>
<li>think about IL skills across an entire programme and about how progression can be built-in</li>
<li>ensure that IL skills are explicit within learning and teaching,  thus enabling you to better articulate, teach and assess these skills</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/OULDI/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Library_Faciltation_Cards_v6.pdf" target="_blank">Printable pdf version of the cards</a></p>
<p>or access the Open University IL Levels Framework online: <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/ILLFramework">http://www.open.ac.uk/libraryservices/ILLFramework</a></p>
<p><strong>Please note: </strong>The PDF contains 15 pages.  Print all 15 out back to back on a duplex print and then simply cut out  each card - the card will have been printed with the appropriate back. Guidelines to cut the cards are given. One printing of this document will give you:</p>
<ul>
<li>One each of 4 Level 1 cards</li>
<li>One each of 4 Level 2 cards</li>
<li>One each of 4 Level 3 cards</li>
<li>One each of 4 Masters Level cards</li>
<li>An overview card</li>
<li>A title card (slightly larger than the other cards)</li>
<li>An A4 (larger text) handout version of the overview card</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8331/8147736741_3bd9cbaf16.jpg" alt="Learning Design: create, share, import, test, export" width="320" height="215" align="right" hspace="25" />The aim of the activity is to help you begin to think about, discuss&nbsp; and share the key features of your course or module.&nbsp; This activity is best used near the beginning of the design/ redesign process but can also be used to review an existing course or module prior to redesign.</p>
<p>There is an introductory video about the activity a bit further down this page and the card pack is available to print off <a href="https://files.pbworks.com/download/PLB2bUEfxY/jiscdesignstudio/60619333/OULDI_Pedagogic_Aspects_v8_Release.pdf">here</a> (pdf)</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Cut up the cards and choose a maximum of 12 which define the key features of your course/ module (either existing or planned). Just stick the ones you don't want into a pile at the side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are just having a look at the tool and are not currently designing a learning event, you may wish to use the scenario outlined below:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;<em>As part of your institution's widening participantion strand, you have been asked to design an optional 'Study skills/ preparing to learn' module. This module will be offered to all students approaching level 1 HE/ level 4 FE and 'strongly recommended' to those who feel themselves to be less confident about study at a higher level. </em></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;<em>The module will be worth 10 credits (100 hours of study) and will be delivered over the summer break using a 'Blended Learning' approach. </em></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;<em>Design problems include: potentially high student numbers, minimal IT support, students at risk of not completing, mixed experience of learning and technology, low learning confidence/ resilience...etc etc </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Once you have decided on 12, have a look at your cards. Are any colour of cards missing? If so, what might be the impact on student experience? Orange=Guidance and Support, Blue=Content and Experience, Green=Communication and Collaboration, Purple=Reflection and Demonstration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3. If you would like to, you can continue with your design by adding your key features to a Course Map template (<a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/OULDI/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Course-Map-Spreadsheet.xls">Excel version</a>), and begin the process of identifying the tools and resources that would best meet your design requirements.<img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/3.0/88x31.png" alt="" width="75" height="26" align="right" hspace="25" /></p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This pathway through the OULDI toolbox has been developed to provide a theoretical overview of the methodology for learning design developed by the Open University's Institute of Educational   Technology. The module was developed for teh EU funded 'Design-Practice' project in 2010, and&nbsp; is aimed at&nbsp;participants with an interest in using technology in their teaching practice and/or are involved in any part of the design of learning activities. The module is self-paced and takes approximately 5 hours. Activity is entirely online on Cloudworks.</p>
<p>Completing the training module will improve your knowledge and understanding of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The design process&nbsp;for learning activities</li>
<li>Choices that practitioners make about the ways of applying technologies for a variety of learners</li>
</ul>
<p>...and your ability to :</p>
<ul>
<li>Use and evaluate particular technologies and tools for individual and collaborative learning</li>
<li>Share and collaborate learning designs</li>
</ul>
<p>The training module starts with an overview of 'What is learning  design?' in the Cloud in this Cloudscape - Design-Practice Activity 1 -  'What is learning design?'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The online self-paced <em>introduction to learning design</em> is covered by Activities 1-4 in this Cloudscape - please see below.</p>
<p>We would also value your feedback on each of the four activities in  the appropriate Evaluation Clouds - Activity 1a, 2a, 3a and 4a.</p>
<p>There are three levels of participation in the module:</p>
<ol>
<li>At a minimum you can read the Activity Clouds and the document resources they point to on Slideshare.</li>
<li>You can do 1 above and then actively participate in Activity questions and the posting of comments to the Activity Clouds.</li>
<li>You can do 1 and 2 above and then visit the Evaluation Clouds to  give us feedback about your experience of the Activities.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;To participate in 2 and 3 you will need to set-up a Cloudworks login  and password to be able to add or change your content - 'Sign up' on  the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk">Cloudworks home page</a>. <strong>Please  be aware that Cloudworks is an open &lsquo;social&rsquo; environment and anyone can  view the content of your Cloudscapes and Clouds on Cloudworks</strong>.</p>
<p>Over the timeframe of the training&nbsp;we would also like you to  participate in other evaluation activities, including a questionnaire  about your experience of the training, to capture feedback for the development of the next version.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The JISC-funded OULDI project sees 'learning design' as an all encompassing term to cover the process, representation, sharing and evaluation of designs from single activities, right up to whole curriculum level designs. We are interested in providing support for the entire design process; from gathering and sketching out initial ideas, through consolidating, producing and using designs, to sharing, reuse and community engagement. We see learning design as a conscious, creative and social activity, where tools, representations and resources of learning design frame, guide and mediate discourse between individuals within and across programme teams.</p>
<p>Central to our method has been the use of tools and activities to prompt shifts in the thinking and working practices of programme teams from an isolated belief-based implicit approach, to more collaborative, systematic, explicit and empirically informed curriculum design.</p>
<p>In this presentation we review a number of evaluation strategies we have used across five UK universities for capturing these shifts in thinking and practice, evaluating the impacts of this approach on individuals, academic programme teams and the institutions as a whole as well as discussing critical success factors for adoption in other settings.</p>
<p>Keywords: <em>learning design, evaluation, impact,</em></p>]]></description>

<h2>The role of collaboration and dialogue in the design process</h2>
<div style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<div>The Open University Learning Design Initiative applies a <em>design</em> approach to teaching and learning processes with the aim of enabling  practitioners to make more informed choices about their creation of  learning interventions and better use of good pedagogy and new  technologies. An approach which:</div>
<ul>
<li>Utilises a shared <em><strong>design language</strong></em> to both generate designs and as a mechanism for interpreting and discussing</li>
<li>Uses a <em><strong>notational system</strong></em> which helps us  remember and navigate designs, enables designs to take form and be  shared, and helps us sharpen and multiply abstract design categories</li>
<li>And recognises that different <em><strong>representations</strong></em> of a design are needed to articulate certain elements of the design, while ignoring others.</li>
</ul>
<p>It sees design as a conscious process which involves a dialogue both  with and about the materials. It is seen as a creative and communicative  process and an essentially social activity.</p>
</div>
<h2>Cloudworks</h2>
<p>One of the overarching findings from analysis of the empirical  evidence we have gathered to date into how practitioners currently  design their teaching interventions, and what would help improve their  practice, is the desire to have examples from others and to have access  to a network of practitioners to share and discuss ideas. The <a href="http://www.cloudworks.ac.uk/">Cloudworks</a> site was developed with the intention of addressing this need. We  wanted to harness the best of social media practice for use in a  learning and teaching context.&nbsp; The site is attempting to address three  inter-related issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lack of uptake of technologies for learning and teaching  (despite the fact as outline above that they have immense potential)</li>
<li>The new skills needed for engaging in a participatory digital landscape</li>
<li>When asked the question &lsquo;what do you need in order to make better  use of new technologies in your teaching?&rsquo; teachers invariably say they  want examples and they want to be able to share and discuss their ideas  with others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CloudEngine</h2>
<p>CloudEngine is the software that powers Cloudworks and has been released on an OpenSource licence.</p>

<p><em>This practical session will give  an overview of the work of the JISC-funded Open University Learning Design  Initiative (OULDI) at the Open University and with our four partner  universities: Brunel, London South Bank, Reading  and Cambridge.  The project sees 'learning design' as an all encompassing term to cover the  process, representation, sharing and evaluation of designs from individual  learning activities, right up to whole curriculum level designs. We see learning  design as a conscious, creative and social activity, where tools,  representations and resources of learning design can be used to frame, guide and  mediate discourse between academic programme teams, support units, students and  employers. There will be opportunity both to consider how the approach might be  used in an HS&amp;P setting, and to participate in a short collaborative  learning design activity.</em></p>]]></description>

<p>Hi there everyone</p>
<p>I will start the discussion with a question</p>
<p>Is technology being used for technologies sake in the class room.?..</p>

<p>Or...are technological tools being<em> installed</em> in the classroom for 'technology''s sake but not really used?</p>

<p>thats an interesting observation and something I have seen supported in my own observations in schools.&nbsp; From what I have observed the technology is there and being used but a such a minimal level that it is basically an illuminated blackboard.</p>
<p>The problem that I can see for teaching staff is the vast array of functions that modern technology makes available. To take advantage of this new functionality you have to be a professional programmer or have access to the sort of IT support and development which frankly cannot be found at the average school.&nbsp; When observing I ahve thought of a number of wyas in which a presentation could be made more interactive with a little macro here or bit of code there...but how can you ask an already busy teacher to sit down and learn modern programming techniques.</p>
<p>I think the answer is much better IT support in schools with staff capable of taking on development jobs and building new intereactive solutions within the school. Too often I see technology installed and underused or as a recently mismanaged but inadequately trained IT staff.</p>
<p>My answer is thus better support for teachers from an IT view point and stronger encouragement to pass on development of new presentations to professional IT staff or hight experienced IT / Teaching staff.</p>

<p>I am lucky enough to have a dry wipe board as well as an interactive whiteboard and internet access. I tend to find the PhET website phet.colorado.edu gets used most lessons. Also Southampton Universities "Waves" resource is excellent for moving diagrams. The advantage over other interactive resources is there is nothing to program or install. Students can also use the applets to try things out. The applets and moving diagrams show extra information that you cannot see in real life but help in the learning process. It is also nice to be able to record information from class/group work in text documents or spreadsheets to make it available for later analysis or review. With so the variety of students to accomodate the technology has to be easy to use and reliable. Some technology is amazing if you can afford to give it your full attention but that is not what we want to do. Having someone show you how easy something is helps to overcome the initial reluctance. I would be lost without my technology toys.</p>

<p>Hi Chris - good to see you in this discussion! And thanks for sharing a few subject specific tools (any chance of the links...:-) ) I agree that having someone showing us that creative use of technology doesn't have to be an all or nothing element in our learning designs is really important, and also hearing about the experiences of experienced teachers who can now not think about teaching in any other way.</p>
<p>Prof, I come (like Chris) from FE and my experience of schools education is limited but I'd say that FE does have techie people about the place but that in itself is not enough. My experience is that few IT support folk have the pedagogical understanding to support the <em>teaching</em> part of teaching with technology. I think there is a real need for a defined learning technologist role in schools, as there is is most HE institutions and some FE. Someone who's job it is to keep on top of new ideas and uses of technology for learning and teaching and share best practice.</p>

              <title>Activity: 20mins: Affordances: Tools in use</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4042</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4042</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>In this activity you will explore the 'affordances' (Gibson, 1977) of one or more technological tools. You will make judgements about the use of the tools based on their positive and negative affordances, and use this as a means of choosing an appropriate tool for your purpose. This activity can be completed on paper (as suggested here) or using CompendiumLD (go to tools - open stencil - approaches to LD. Drag the tool and activity affordances nodes into your workspace. Click on them to enter into the activity)</p>
<p><strong>What you need</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A piece A3 paper </li>
<li>At least one page of      CompendiumLD affordances stickers. You may need more if you decide to      expore several tools. (See embedded .pdf doc below. This can be downloaded      from SlideShare) </li>
<li>A course or module to map      out (real or scenario)</li>
<li>Pens</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>From the affordances sticker sheet, choose a task, and then up to three tools you think might fit with the task. Cut these out first and stick the activity in the centre of your paper and the tools around the outside &ndash; leaving plenty of room around them. Then cut out all the affordances. Cluster around each tool the +ve affordances you think it has. Then label with potential &ndash;ve aspects or constraints. Use the list given or add your own (10 mins per tool)</p>
<p><strong>Respond</strong></p>
<p>Consider the following questions and add to the discussion below:</p>
<ol>
<li>How useful do you find this activity in supporting thinking and discussion around your choice of technological tools?</li>
<li>Do others judge the affordances of tools in the same way as you do? If not what might account for these differences?</li>
<li>Are there any other +ve or &ndash;ve affordances you think should be added to the list? (10 mins)</li>
</ol>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This representation maps a learning design at the meso- (middle or intermediate) level. It provides a view which shows how the learning activities and assessment tasks are aligned with the learning outcomes that are intended in the course or module. This view is informed by John Biggs&rsquo; work on Constructive Alignment (Biggs, 1999). The premise behind constructive alignment is twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students construct meaning      from what they do to learn.</li>
<li>The teacher aligns the      planned learning activities with the learning outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>This activity will provide a very quick introduction to the CompendiumLD learning design tool and the Learning Outcomes view. We strongly recommend that after this taster activity you try out the real thing - watch the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/index.php/cloud/view/1874">Getting Started with CompendiumLD</a> SlideShow!</p>
<p><strong>What you need</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A piece A3 paper </li>
<li>A page of CompendiumLD node      stickers. (See embedded .pdf doc below. This can be downloaded from      SlideShare) </li>
<li>A course or module to map      out (real or scenario)</li>
<li>Pens</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>Using the CompendiumLD Learning Outcomes icon stickers, identify and map out the higher level learning outcome(s) for the module, establish how the achievement of this/these outcome(s) can be monitored and measured (assessed), define the learner activities that will enable learners to achieve these outcomes, and the outputs you expect the activities to generate. Use the node stickers to map out your activity on the A3 paper. Decide yourself the best way to structure your map and use pens to make and explain links between nodes.</p>
<p>As you are working, ask yourself design questions for example:&nbsp; Is there an alignment between the&nbsp;outcomes, learner activity, learner output and assessment? Who or what is at the centre of the design? What is your design intent, and what are the challenges or barriers to achieving this? (20 mins)</p>
<p><strong>Respond</strong></p>
<p>Consider the following questions and add to the discussion below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who might be interested in      seeing this view of your module or course? </li>
<li>How easy do you think it      would be for someone else to understand your map? What could you add to      your map, or how could you restructure it, to help them understand?</li>
<li>(For support teams) How      might a CompendiumLD map of a course help you talk to course teams about      the resources, advice, tools and activities you department offers?</li>
<li>Where in the course design      process do you think course teams could usefully complete this activity?      (10 mins)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Comparing 4 web 2.0 tools</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Visit the tool websites and read their introductions to the tools</li>
<li>Watch the 3 slideshows and 1 read the 1 blog post giving ideas about how these tools can be used in the classroom</li>
<li>Map each of the 4 tools onto the ICT 2D framework template and share your map (either text or make a jpeg and put onto Flickr)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>How might this exercise help you make decisions about which tools to use in your classroom?</li>
<li>Do people perceive the tools in the same way? If not, what factors might change the way we perceive technological tools?</li>

              <title>A framework for evaluating Cloudworks</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3391</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3391</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently we have been developing a framework to help us to more systematically and&nbsp; reliably evaluate transactions and activity on Cloudworks in relation to our project aims of a) a developing community, b) the development of professional knowledge and c) sustained participation.</p>
<p>As discussed in my blog post <a href="/news/view/1474">Community Indicators</a> on the 13th August 09, we have been focusing on pinning down what we might mean by 'community' and therefore what indicators of community we might expect to see as Cloudworks develops over time. I have identified four broad indicators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participation</li>
<li>Cohesion</li>
<li>Identity</li>
<li>Creative capability</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of communities we see on Cloudworks are likely to be relational and transient, our evaluation focus is therefore on the <em>process</em> <em>or lifecycle</em> of community formation and growth rather than community as an absolute state. Our interest is in the process of evolution from loosely tied webs or networks to the more cohesive productive groups that can be seen to emerge from repeated and iterative collaborative activity that happens <em>within, across and between</em> groups from more established Communities of Practice. The indicators identified are those we believe promote this evolution i.e. the factors which support the development of emerging Communities of Practice.</p>
<p>I would be really interested to hear your thoughts on where I've got so far.</p>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2605</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Outline of the day</h2>
<p>9.30 &ndash; 9.45&nbsp; Arrival activity Setting personal and team objectives</p>
<p>9.45 &ndash; 9.55 Welcome and introductions</p>
<p>9.55 &ndash; 10.15 Derek K Milligan - Blended Learning at Brunel</p>
<p>10.15 &ndash; 10.35<strong> Activity: How to ruin a course</strong></p>
<p>This activity will focus on the key issues and   strategies that impact on the success (or otherwise) of learning and teaching   within your context. The output of this activity will be a team checklist   which will be used as one of the design evaluation tools in the design review   and at the end of the workshop.</p>
<p>10.35 &ndash; 11.15 <strong>Activity: &lsquo;At a glance&rsquo; course map</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;We will propose 5 key components of a course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidance and support</li>
<li>Information and experience</li>
<li>Communication and experience</li>
<li>Thinking and reflection</li>
<li>Evidence and demonstration</li>
</ul>
<p>and introduce a framework/ tool to begin mapping   out the key elements and &lsquo;flavour&rsquo; of the module/ short course designs. We   will discuss the nature of the resultant representations and explore possible   uses of these.</p>
<p>11.15 &ndash; 11.30 Tea and coffee</p>
<p>11.30 &ndash; 12.00<strong> Activity: Design review</strong></p>
<p>We will introduce 3 tools which can be used at   various points in the design process to represent, inform and reflect on   designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogical profiler</li>
<li>Design decision assistant</li>
<li>Ruin a course checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>Each team will use these tools to evaluate their   designs and inform their design decision making.</p>
<p>12.00 &ndash; 12.40&nbsp; <strong>Activity: Stalls activity</strong></p>
<p>Teams will split in to focus groups. Individuals,   with the support of expert facilitators, will explore one of the following   themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Library, media services and accessibility</li>
<li>Open Educational Resources</li>
<li>Pedagogy (including assessment)</li>
<li>Visualisation and representations</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals will then rejoin their work teams,   share findings and consider what the impact of these findings might be the   emerging designs. The expert facilitators will be available to offer support   for the remainder of the workshop and will upload links and resources to   Cloudworks as appropriate.</p>
<p>12.40 &ndash; 1.30 Lunch</p>
<p>1.30 &ndash; 3.00 <strong>Activity: Visualising designs</strong></p>
<p>Using all the online and physical resources   available, teams will draw up a more detailed representation of their module.   These representations are likely to include i.e. sequence, learning outcomes,   outlines of activities, technologies used, assessment strategies etc. Using   Compendium it is also possible to create links to specific OERs, tools and   resources. Designs and discussions around design problems and decisions will   be added to the Cloudworks site &ndash; allowing for collaborative discussion   between teams and opening up discussion beyond the workshop.</p>
<p>3.00 &ndash; 3.15 Tea and coffee</p>
<p>3.15 &ndash; 3.45<strong> Activity: Design Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;This activity will provide an opportunity to view   and review the designs of other teams and give and receive feedback. It is   recognised that designs at this stage will contain detail but will not   necessarily be &lsquo;finished&rsquo;.</p>
<p>3.45 &ndash; 4.15<strong> Activity: Next steps and action   planning</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is hoped that this practical session will lead   to the design or redesign of modules/short courses and that these will be &lsquo;launched&rsquo;   over the next few months. This activity will give teams an opportunity to   identify the next steps in the design process and what further support they   may need from the University or the OULDI project team.</p>
<p>4.15 &ndash; 4.30 Close of session and evaluation of workshop</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Two laptops per team will be provided but please also feel free to bring your own if you would like to.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;So that your teams can export the Compendium maps and save any other work done on workshop laptops, please ensure that you bring at least one USB memory key with you per team.</em></p>]]></description>

The morning activities have been designed to give you&nbsp; the skills and knowledge you need.&nbsp; By this time you will have considered design questions such as staff to student ratio, balance of physical to online learning, the technologies you will use, assessment strategies, pedegogical approach and accessability issues. You, or someone in your team, will have learnt about approaches to visualisation and representataion too.</p>
<p>We recognise that this is just a one day workshop - and course designing often takes far longer than 6 hours - but we anticipate that by the end of this activity you will have a sound&nbsp; design outline on which to build. Please make proactive use all of the resources that you have to hand.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>In this activity you will move temporarily out of your curriculum teams and into special interest groups (stalls). The groups available for this session are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogy (including assessment</li>
<li>Library, Media services and Accessibility</li>
<li>Visualisations and representations</li>
<li>Open Educational resources</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure a good skills spead in your team, make sure at least 1 person goes along to each of the stalls.&nbsp; An expert will be facilitating each special interest group and the activity you will do in these groups is likely to be discussion based and focusing on some of the practicalities and also some of the issues. You will spend about 20 mins in your special interest group and then have an opportunity to feedback your findings to your team.</p>
<p>Learning outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develops Learning Design networks</li>
<li>Develops individual knowledge in an aspect of learning design/ e-pedagogy</li>
<li>Broadens teams' knowledge base in aspects of learning design/e-pedagogy</li>
</ul>

<p>In this activity evaluation/ reflection tools will be used to review teams' designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogy profile</li>
<li>Course dimensions</li>
<li>How to ruin a course checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>Each tool looks at a different aspect of your design, and each has strengths and limitations. It is intended that they should work effectively together.</p>
<p>1. Use the 3 tools to review your design (no more than 10 mins per tool)</p>
<p>2. Make a list of the changes you will make as a consequence of the review</p>
<p>3. Amend the design, save it to your pen drive and add to Slideshare</p>
<p>4. Update your&nbsp; Cloud with progress update and images as appropriate</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2527/4074184471_b2bfdc7bdb_o.jpg" alt="At a glance course maps" hspace="25" width="380" height="600" align="right" />This activity introduces one of the representation tools being developed by the Open University. The tool is text based and built around the premise that key learning design decisions will fall into one of&nbsp; 4 catagories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidance and support</li>
<li>Communication and collaboration</li>
<li>Reflection and demonstration</li>
<li>Content and experience</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'at a glance' representation gives a one-page overview of a module or course and can effectively communicate the 'flavour' or 'vision' of the course.</p>
<p>1. In your team, and using the Word proforma on the pen drive, outline your 'vision' of your module or short course.</p>
<p>2. Save a copy&nbsp; to the pen drive.</p>
<p>3. Upload to the workshop Slideshare account</p>
<p>4. Have a look at the other groups 'at a glance' representations and discuss the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well do the representations communicate the 'flavour of the course'?</li>
<li>Who might find this representation useful and when?</li>
<li>What would it be useful to add?</li>
</ul>]]></description>

The output of this activity will be a design checklist which you can use as one of the design evaluation tools in a mid-way design review and at the end of the workshop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. List the 10 best ways to ensure your module or short course will fail!</p>
<p>2. Share these with the others by uploading your lists to this Cloud (<em>'add extra content'</em>).</p>
<p>3. What are the key themes?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim of this arrival activity is to provide teams with an opportunity to review personal objectives within the team and decide on team objectives for the day. The list will be used at the end of the session to frame reflection and evaluation.</p>
<p>This activity will take place while everyone is settling in, setting up lap tops etc and before the session starts properly.</p>
<p>1. Write down 3 personal objectives</p>
<p>2. Briefly share these with the team</p>
<p>3. Agree team objectives by identifying common themes within the team (no more than 6!)</p>
<p>4. Write these on the flip chart paper provided</p>
<p>5. <em>If you have time</em> add team objectives to this Cloud (by clicking on '<em>add extra content'</em>)</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This Cloud has been set up to aggregate tools, resources and discussion around Visualisation and representation of the Curriculum at three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum</li>
<li>Module or unit</li>
<li>Activity</li>
</ul>
<p>The Brunel Blended Design workshop will focus on representing at module or short course level but it should be noted that less work has been done around representing at this level. It is likely that you will take tools and strategies from both the Curriculum and Activity level 'toolboxes'.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Definitions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"the open provision of educational resources, enabled by information and communicatiion technologies, for consultation, use and adaptation by a community of users for non-commercial purposes" </em>UNESCO 2002</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A broader definition of OER:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Learning resources</em></p>
<p><em>Courseware, content modules, learning objects, learner support &amp; assessment tools, online learning communities</em></p>
<p><em>Resources to support teachers</em></p>
<p><em>Tools for teachers and support materials to enable them to create, adapt and use OER; training materials for teachers</em></p>
<p><em>Resources to assure quality of education and educational practices </em>(UNESCO 2004)<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>Despite&nbsp; improvements in the range and quality of OER resourses, there is still a lack of take-up. This discussion will focus on the issues about why this might be the case.</p>
<p>This discussion can happen in face to face groups or here on Cloudworks...or both!</p>
<p>1. What do you think is needed to encourage uptake and reuse of OERs?</p>
<p>2. What types of resources would be useful from <em>your</em> point of view?</p>
<p>3. What are your views on this approach to developing learning and teaching resources and designs?</p>

<p>The talk focuses on work we are undertaking as part of the<a href="http://ouldi.open.ac.uk"> OU Learning Design Initiative </a>and the Hewlett-funded <a href="http://olnet.org">Olnet initiative</a>. A key focus of our work is the development of tools, methods and approached to support the desing of innovative learning activities and Open Educational Resources (OER). The website provide further details on both initiatives and links to assocaited tools, resources and publications. For this keynote I want to focus in on one strand of our work; namely how to leverage technologies to promote bettter sharing and discussing of learning and teaching ideas and designs.</p>
<p>When asked what they would find most helpful to enable them to use technologies more in their teaching, most teachers say "give me examples, in my subject area" and "point me to relevant people I can discuss these issues with". Web 2.0 technologies - with their emphasis on sharing, networking, user production, seem to offer the solution. However uptake and use of web 2.0 sites such as Facebook, Ning, Flckr, and Twitter for educational purposes has to date being marginal.</p>
<p>Some of the key questions in relation to this work are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why have web 2.0 technologies not been taken up more extensively in learning and teaching?</li>
<li>What are the barriers to teachers sharing and discussing their learning and teaching ideas and designs?</li>
<li>How can social networking practices be harness and used in an educational context? </li>
</ul>
<p>Also see related clouds and ongoing discussions on these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/cloud/view/1919">How do we get people to share designs and ideas - is social media the answer?</a></li>
<li><a href="/cloud/view/1921">How do you foster the motivation for learning?</a></li>
<li><a href="/cloud/view/1935">What are the barriers for sharing ideas and designs of OER?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The talk will then outline the development of a social networking site for learning and teaching, <a href="//">cloudworks</a>; which is attempting to apply web 2.0 practices to support dialogue and sharing around learning and teaching ideas and designs.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Yael Kali talking about the Design Principle Database tool. From the website:</p>
<p><em>"Whether you are an educational technology researcher, a learning scientist, a designer of web-based learning materials, or a teacher using technology, the DPD is a place for you to learn from the wisdom gained by dozens of researchers who have designed, enacted with students, and studied the use of technology for learning. This wisdom is translated in the DPD into pedagogical </em><em>Design Principles at three grain-size levels, exemplified with </em><em>Design Features."</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.edu-design-principles.org/dp/designHome.php?PHPSESSID=e61fbb4fa0a8a12ac3e1edf4e1782e8e">Design Principles Database</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li> Not an authoring environment, it&rsquo;s a database of ideas, the idea is to collect good design knowledge, we are still trying to find ways to connect the different authoring environments</li>
<li>It's heirachical in structure, at the bottom have specific examples &ndash; CrystalLab, Geo3D, BlockStacking, WISE, Legacy Cycel, Symphony inquiry wheel &ndash; have about 30 design principles associated with 4 meta-principles For example: meta-principle &ldquo;Make thinking visible&rdquo; <br /> Three modes 1. Browse, 2. Participate, 3. Design</li>
<li> Can search and will return examples of features and principles, for example &ldquo;complexity&rdquo; &ndash; one example &lsquo;engage learners in complex projects&rsquo; shows the meta principles &ndash; and &lsquo;make contents accessible&rsquo; and &lsquo;promote autonomous life long learning&rsquo;. Provides a description and some pointers to further references and can see examples of how others have been using it.&nbsp; </li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The short course design challenge&hellip; are you up to it???</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br /> Curriculum design has never being more challenging or potentially exciting:<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;New technologies offer a seemingly endless range of possibilities in terms of use of engaging digital media to support core course material to exciting and authentic communicative and collaborative opportunities<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Modern students are more and more diverse with higher expectations of courses and more diverse needs from formal, work-related possibilities through to learning for informal, personal reasons<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Employers are increasingly demanding evidence of students having developed a diverse range of social skills and competences to meet the challenges of the modern workplace<br /> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is now a range of educational models that can be applied to help foster different pedagogical approaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one-day workshop has been developed to introduce course teams to  using a learning design approach. The example below (originally used at  Brunel University in 2009) uses the OULDI learning tools and activities  but we have successfully tried slotting in tools and activities from  other projects (especially the Viewpoints project) and the format holds  well. For a list of other activities and tools you could use try the  learning design toolbox. These and other examples of the template in use:</p>

<h2>The Challenge...</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Design  Challenge&rsquo; is intended to be an intense  but fun means of illustrating a  range of resources, tools and ways of  thinking about course design.  Participants are introduced to a range of  tools and techniques by means  of access to advisors who will help them  along the process. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the afternoon each team  presents their ideas. A  panel evaluates their work and select the  strongest designs. The  session concludes with a reflection on the  usefulness of the event and  on which of the ideas, resources and tools  participants might wish to  pursue further. <br /> <br /> Although designed  as a fun activity, the event gives an awareness of  the latest in  thinking innovatively about curriculum design and is  designed to be  proactive rather than being composed around an  uncontextualised set of  one-to-many presentations. The time-limited  challenge enables  participants to make a preliminary assessment of  which of the ideas,  tools and resources are useful and gives them some  feel for what might  be possible in a longer, term real course  production process. Hopefully  the challenge will open avenues for  participants to pursue this further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>Paper  and pens (hard copies of tools if appropriate - A3 best)</p>

              <title>Method: A schema for mapping tools and activities to dimensions of learning</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/423</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/423</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Conole et al. (2004) have developed a pedagogical framework that abstracts out three main dimensions of learning. The 3 dimensions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual &ndash; social: i.e. any learning activity can be located somewhere along a spectrum from being an individual, isolated experience to being essentially social in nature</li>
<li>Active &ndash; passive: i.e. some learning activities involve active engagement, whereas other aspects of learning may occur through some degree of passive immersion</li>
<li>Information &ndash; experience: learning activities vary in the degree to which they are information or experience based.</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework can be used as a basis for mapping out the use of different tools. The dimensional basis of the framework means that you can consider the three dimensions as spectral and hence look at tool use along each of these spectral &ndash; i.e. not as a binary decision &ndash; so use of a tool to support an activity does not have to be labeled as simple an individual or a social activity it can lie somewhere along the spectrum of individual-social.</p>
<p>Try to indicate the location of the following &lsquo;tools in use &lsquo;on the three dimensions (or continua) of the framework:</p>
<ul>
<li> A blog as a reflective diary </li>
<li> A blog as a collective resource for collating references within a student group </li>
<li> A web search: i.e. students search the web and collate resources against a given set of criteria </li>
<li> A drill and practice exercise: i.e. students work through a set of resource and then complete a formative self-assessment </li>
<li>A structured online debate: i.e. students choose a side for or against an issue, post their views and read other postings </li>
<li>Use of an e-portfolio: i.e. students gather evidence against learning outcomes in a portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p>A diagram of the framework can be found in Conole (2008), ariadne article, link below.</p>]]></description>
