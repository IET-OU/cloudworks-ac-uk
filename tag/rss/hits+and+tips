              <description><![CDATA[<h3>What are Clouds and Cloudscapes?</h3>
<p>A Cloud could be an idea, tool, question, advice or learning design. For example a brief introduction and a link to a new mindmapping tool, or a question about how you might use Twitter in the classroom successfully. It could also be a session at a conference or workshop activity and contain your slideshow, a discussion stream and links to relevant research and academic references.</p>
<p>You might set up a Cloudscape when you want to bundle together several ideas, tools, activities (Clouds) together. For example for your own use you may want to pull together all Clouds relating to e-assessment, or several activities that relate to one workshop. Clouds can belong to any number of Cloudscapes. If you are still not sure of the difference between a Cloud and a Cloudscape you may find it useful to watch this short <a href="/cloud/view/2413">video</a></p>

<h3>Setting up a Cloud</h3>
<p>This is really quick and easy to do. To set up a Cloud either go to a Cloudscape you want to add to and click on "<em>Create Cloud in this Cloudscape</em>" or if you want your Cloud to stand alone, click on the Cloud tab at the top of the page and then click on "<em>+Create a Cloud</em>"</p>
<h3>Setting up a Cloudscape</h3>
<p>To set up a Cloudscape click on the Cloudscape tab and then "<em>+Create a Cloudscape</em>"</p>
<h3>To add Clouds to your Cloudscape</h3>
<p>Go to those Clouds and click on "<em>Add to a Cloudscape</em>". Chose the Cloudscape you wish to add it to the Click "<em>Add to Cloudscape</em>".</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Cloudworks is an excellent way of engaging event participants in key themes <em>prior</em> to the start of the programme, providing a space for discussion, resources, links and references <em>during</em> a conference and persists as a space for ongoing reflection and engagement <em>after</em> the conference has finished. This Cloudscape has been set up to guide you through the process of setting up your own Conference or event Cloudscape.</p>

<h3><a title="Why use Cloudworks rather than a different tool to support your event?" name="Why use Cloudworks rather than a different tool to support your event?"></a>Why use Cloudworks rather than a different tool to support your event?</h3>
<p>The functionality of Cloudworks compares very well with other tools that are commonly used at conferences (see below) &nbsp;but the site has the added benefit of having an existing and thriving community of people passionate about education. We believe that Cloudworks does three things better than other sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitates open,      cross-group discussion, collaboration and knowledge creation.</li>
<li>Aggregates discussion,      slideshows, videos, related links, papers and academic references all in      one place.</li>
<li>Creates an archive of the      event that people can use to reflect, and continue to develop emerging      themes and ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key terms: Cloudscape:</strong> <em>a home page for the event or conference</em></p>
<p>(see <a title="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1963/all/5#clouds-in-cloudscape" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1963/all/5#clouds-in-cloudscape">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1963/all/5#clouds-in-cloudscape</a> for an example)<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<h3><a title="Step 1 Register and set up profile" name="Step 1 Register and set up profile"></a>Step 1 Register and set up profile</h3>
<p>Consider setting up a conference or event organiser profile instead of using your personal profile. This will help you differentiate between your role in organising the event or conference and your role as participant. If you do decide to do this please note that you will have to use a different email address to the one used for your personal profile.</p>
<p>When you set up your new profile you will be asked for the name of the institution or organisation, a Twitter name, an email address and your &lsquo;interests&rsquo; (in the case of the conference this will be focus and themes). Try to fill as much of this in as possible as it will help people find you and hear about the event.</p>
<p>Use a picture that is recognisable to conference or event goers - perhaps a logo or a picture of the building where the event will be held.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Step 2 Set up a Cloudscape" name="Step 2 Set up a Cloudscape"></a>Step 2 Set up a Cloudscape</h3>
<p>Setting up your Cloudscape well in advance of the event ensures that the URL can be used on publicity materials. An event Cloudscape is just like any other Cloudscape but used in a different way. From the home page click on the Events tab at the top of the page and you will see a list of upcoming events, and on the right a beige support box. In this box you will see a link which says <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/add">create a cloudscape</a>. Click on this.</p>
<p>Title: Enter the title of the Conference and in the summary box add the venue and dates.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The description section of your Cloudscape will probably include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A short description of the      conference - title, focus, venue etc</li>
<li>A hyperlink to the      conference website </li>
<li>Hyperlinks to other      relevant webpages (i.e. multimap)</li>
<li>An outline of the      conference timetable</li>
<li>Contact information</li>
<li>A link to a <a href="http://twapperkeeper.com/">TwapperKeeper</a> archive (where Twitter is being used)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using html</strong></p>
<p>If you are confident in using html (or know someone who is) you can edit the text by clicking on the html button at the top of the Description text box. This way you can add anchors so that visitors can navigate more easily around a longer description, and use different heading colours and fonts etc to structure the page.</p>
<p><strong>Adding tags</strong></p>
<p>Tags will help people find your Cloudscape, so choose 3 or 4 which you think represent the event well (these may match your profile &lsquo;interest&rsquo; tags)</p>
<p>If you add a <a href="http://help.twitter.com/forums/10711/entries/49309" target="_self">#tag</a> in the Twitter tag box, any Twitter activity which includes your tag will be streamed down the right hand side of your Cloudscape.</p>
<p><strong>Dates: </strong>Add the start and end date of your event, and the location. Your event will now automatically appear in the Event listings.</p>
<p>Click on &lsquo;Create Cloudscape&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Step 3 Adding Clouds" name="Step 3 Adding Clouds"></a>Step 3 Adding Clouds</h3>
<p>Before you start adding Clouds to your Cloudscape take time to consider how you would like to structure them - this will depend on your event and there is no right or wrong way of doing it. Please note that Clouds will appear in alphabetical/ numerical order so take case to title them so that they appear in the order you want them to!</p>
<p>We recommend that, where possible, conference organisers set up &lsquo;placeholder&rsquo; Clouds for each item and then encourage presenters to take responsibility for organising, maintaining and promoting their Cloud. &nbsp;This ensures that presenters only add what they are happy sharing, and we have noticed that where more ownership is given to contributors, Clouds are better used and richer in content and discussion. To do this you will need to ask presenters to register on Cloudworks and then give them administration rights to the Cloud (click on &lsquo;Permissions&rsquo; on the right of your Cloudscape and then use the &lsquo;search users&rsquo; box; once your presenter&rsquo;s profile is found, click on &lsquo;<em>add as admin&rsquo;</em>. See the link to a word document with support information for presenters &ndash; please download and amend as appropriate.</p>
<p>You will also need to decide whether you want to allow others to add additional Clouds to your Cloudscape. If you decide against this click on &lsquo;Permissions&rsquo; on the right of your Cloudscape and then on &lsquo;<em>make Cloudscape closed&rsquo;</em>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p><strong>1 day workshop:</strong> consider setting up Clouds around topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction (including      aims, outcomes and plan)</li>
<li>Activities </li>
<li>Groups</li>
<li>Themes or discussions (one      for each)</li>
<li>Evaluation </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1912">Example</a></p>
<p><strong>1 day conference:</strong> consider setting up Clouds around topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agenda or programme</li>
<li>Keynotes (one for each)</li>
<li>Presentations (one for      each)</li>
<li>Workshops</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1913">Example</a></p>
<p><strong>Multi-day or large conferences: </strong>set up Clouds as for smaller conferences, but use the &lsquo;Sections&rsquo; tab function to further categorise these for easier navigation. For example you may create tabs for day 1, day 2 etc or individual tabs for Keynotes, presentations, workshops, papers, posters etc.</p>
<p>To use the &lsquo;sections&rsquo; function, set up all the Clouds you want to then click on &lsquo;<em>Manage sections&rsquo;</em> on the right of your Cloudscape page. Click on &lsquo;<em>add a section&rsquo;</em> to add new sections and then click on &lsquo;<em>Add Clouds to a section&rsquo;. </em>This is very easy to do and prevents the problem of an endless and overwhelming list of Clouds on your Cloudscape!</p>
<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1963/all/5#clouds-in-cloudscape">Example</a> (see the tabs at the top of this hyperlink view) &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Step 4 Promoting and moderating your Cloudscape" name="Step 4 Promoting and moderating your Cloudscape"></a>Step 4 Promoting and moderating your Cloudscape</h3>
<p>If your Cloudscape is to be successful then you will need to allow time for someone to promote it (i.e. using email, Twitter etc) and then encourage people to contribute (by asking and answering questions, thanking contributors and adding links, references and comments yourself). Once the Cloudscape has taken off you will need to do less of this but it is very important at the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Becoming a featured Cloudscape</strong></p>
<p>If you would like your Cloudscape to become featured on the front page, please make your request by email to <a href="mailto:cloudworks@open.ac.uk">cloudworks@open.ac.uk</a> and please make your image as close to 256 &times; 192 pixels as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Emails and publicity materials</strong></p>
<p>Ideally include the URL for your Cloudscape in all publicity material. This gives people a chance to find out about the space and explore. If this is not possible then it will be very important to inform people at the event. Delegates will need to know how to use it and a link to a delegate information document can be found on the right of this page. Please download and amend it as required. <em>It is especially important to ensure as far as possible that delegates are aware that the site is open to all before they begin to contribute.</em></p>
<p><strong>Using Cloudworks for delegate registration</strong></p>
<p>You can use Cloudworks to register delegates. Ask them to register, log in, and then click on the 'attending'' tab at the top of the Cloudscape. As the conference organiser you can then contact all registered delegates via email through the site with conference updates, information and activities.<em><br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Using Twitter to promote the event more widely</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 15% of traffic on Cloudworks comes through referrals from Twitter, for events and conferences the percentage is likely to be significantly more. &nbsp;Once you have set up your Cloudscape, tweet the URL out to your followers from time to time before, during and after your event. Ask others to retweet it.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Using Twitter in Cloudworks</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2524</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2524</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Using <a href="http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ELI7027.pdf">Twitter</a> with Cloudworks allows for discussion which can be faster and more dynamic, and which pulls in people from a wider community. You may decide to incorporate Twitter into your Cloudscape when you want to include a wider discussion about a key question or issue. For example, Twitter can be used during workshops or conferences and be added to your Conference or workshop Cloudscape. The resulting discussion can be academically or creatively interesting in itself, and provide an excellent snapshot or record of the event or learning. Please note that although you can add a Twitter stream to a Cloudscape, you can not add one to a Cloud and you can only add to a Cloudscape you have created or been given editing permission for.</p>
<p>You will need to create a <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter account</a> if you don&rsquo;t already have one.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>(#) Hash tags</strong>. Hash tags are designed to create groupings on Twitter. Anyone joining a discussion about your Cloudscape will add your #tag to the message and it will be picked up and added to your Cloudscape Twitter stream. You create a hash tag by prefixing a short word with a # symbol like this - #cloudworks. Choose a #tag word which is short and relevant to the theme of your Cloudscape i.e. for the LAMS 2009 European Conference we chose #LAMS. Then add you #tag to your Cloudscape (in the Cloudscape edit window).</p>
<p><strong>Promoting your #tag</strong>. You then need to tell people in the Twitter community that they can join the discussion at use your tag. If you are an established Twitterer and already have people following you that would be interested in commenting on your Cloudscape then update your Twitter status with a link to the Cloudscape and your hash tag. If you want to promote your Cloudscape more widely then search for communities in Twitter who may also be interested in your Cloudscape i.e. by searching themes such as learning, assessment etc. and invite their group (using their hash tag at the start of your update and yours at the end). It is likely that you will need to continue to promote your #tag over time and as your discussion develops.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>When people start using your hash tag in their tweets they will appear in the stream on the right of your Cloudscape page.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Twitter archives</strong>. Your Twitter stream will only last a couple of months and then disappear so we recommend that you use a Twitter archive such as <a href="/cloud/add/twapperkeeper.com/" target="_self">TwapperKeeper</a> . You will then need to add your TwapperKeeper archive URL as a hyperlink in your Cloudscape description.</p>]]></description>

<p>Cloudworks is a place to share, find and discuss learning and teaching ideas and experiences and by default all comments and content added are currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved" target="_self">All Rights Reserved</a>&nbsp; (although you will soon be able to choose to be covered by a&nbsp; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/" target="_self">Creative Commons</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">Attribution</a> or <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/uk/" target="_blank">Attribution-Non-commercial</a> licence instead). Creative Commons licences are designed to make sharing and collaboration easier.</p>
<h3>Embeds and links</h3>
<p>It is worth noting though that Cloudworks is not a repository, this means that it is not possible to upload files to the site. All documents, slideshows, videos etc must be hosted on another site (such as Flickr or Slideshare) and linked to, or embedded into a Cloud (<a href="/cloud/view/2511" target="_self">example</a> - scroll down). All work linked or hyperlinked to, or embedded will be covered by the permissions set on the&nbsp; 'host' site i.e. Flickr, YouTube etc. It is important<em> </em>that you adhere to the permissions given on the host site.&nbsp; For example, if you embed a photograph from Flickr it must be your own photo, or one that you have permission to upload, or published under a Creative Commons licence and properly attributed. When you refer to someone else&rsquo;s ideas or theories then they must be referenced, or attributed as appropriate to the work. Where appropriate and available create a &lsquo;link-back&rsquo; to the original online source.</p>

<p>Cloudworks is not a repository and you cannot upload your files to Cloudworks but you can easily link to files and content stored elsewhere on websites such as Flickr, Slideshare, YouTube &nbsp;etc. These files can be shared by linking, embedding or added in the text as a hyperlink.</p>
<p><strong>Text</strong>. To add text to a Cloud, either click on <em>'Add content'</em> (if your text is informational) or add text to the '<em>Contribute</em>' box further down (if your text is conversational).</p>
<p><strong>Links.</strong> To link to another web page, just click on '<em>Add link' </em>which can be found towards the top of the page. The links you have added will appear in the middle column beside the discussion.When you add a link you will be asked to give the link a title (so other people will know what it is) and the URL (webpage address i.e. http://www. cloudworks...).</p>
<p><strong>Embeds.</strong> If you want the document, video or slideshow to viewed from the Cloud, rather than just linked to, you can add it by clicking '<em>Add embedded content'</em>'. Again, you will be asked for a descriptive title and the URL. The following sites are supported by this embed function:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://5min.com/">5min</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_self">Amazon Product Images</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_self">Flickr</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hyperlinks.</strong> Most links will be created by '<em>add link</em>' as above, but occassionally it will be more appropriate to create a hyperlink in the text, for example if you want to create a link to help explain something you're discussing. To do this highlight a word or phrase while editing, and then click on the chain icon. You will be asked for the URL and whether you want the hyperlink to open in a new or the same window.&nbsp; If you create a hyperlink the link will not appear with other links, only in the text.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a user account.</strong> You can view everything available on the site, but if you want to create Clouds or Cloudscapes or if you want to add comments, links, content or references, then you need to <a href="http://cloudworks.open.ac.uk/index.php/user/register.html">create an account</a>. Once you have created an account you can &lsquo;follow&rsquo; both people and Cloudscapes.</p>
<p>'<strong>Following'.</strong> In order to get the best out of the site it is a great idea to begin to follow a few Cloudscapes, clouds and people that interest you as soon as you register. Use the 'tags' link at the top of the page, the Cloudscapes tab or the site search engine to find topics that interest you. Open the Cloudscape/ cloud and click on follow - you can always unfollow if you change your mind. . Find people using the 'people' tab at the top on the page and follow in the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Email alerts. </strong>You will be sent email alerts when someone adds something to a Cloud you have contributed to or a Cloudscape you are following, or if someone starts to follow you. These alerts are an excellent way of keeping in touch with what is happening. If you want to change your email preferences, do so <a href="/user/email/" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Setting up a profile.</strong> Once you have registered, you can set up a profile and include some information about yourself. Your profile page automatically includes your personal Cloudstream, the Clouds you have added, the Cloudscapes and people you are following, and who is following you. All the Clouds created by the people and Cloudscapes you are following are also collected under your Cloudstream.</p>

The front page shows a rolling list of particularly active Clouds on the right hand side, featured Cloudscapes are presented in the middle panel and below this, Cloudstreams for Clouds, Cloudscapes, Comments, Links, References and Extra content can be seen. Click on the ones that interest you.&nbsp; RSS feeds can be set up for each of these at the bottom of the front page.</p>
<p><strong>Search engine</strong>. If you are looking for something specific then it is usually quickest to use the site search engine. Enter a word or phrase, and Clouds and Cloudscapes which include that word or phrase in the title or summarytwill be listed. Click on one of these to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Using the tabs at the top of the page.</strong></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><a href="/cloud/cloud_list" target="_blank"><strong>Clouds.</strong></a> You can get a list of all the Clouds in the site by clicking on the' Clouds' tab at the top of the page.

Clicking on a particular Cloudscape will take you into it and will show all the Clouds associated with that Cloudscape.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong><a href="/tag/" target="_blank">Tags.</a> </strong>If you are browsing (rather than looking for something specific in which case use the search engine) click on the 'tags' link. This will take you to a tag 'cloud' which is ordered according to the popularity of the tag. Click on the tag that interests you for a list of Clouds and Cloudscapes asscociated with that word. You can set up an RSS feed to be updated with any new content added associated with that tag eg new Clouds and Cloudscapes associated with assessment.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><a href="/user/people/" target="_blank"><strong>People</strong></a>. If you are looking for people from a certain institution, or are looking for a specific person, click on the 'people' tab. You will be asked whether you want to search by name or institution. Once you have found the name you are looking for click on the person to see their profile. Click on 'Follow' to follow them. You can also search for content by looking at people's profiles and seeing what Clouds they have set up or are following and keep up to date with their activity by setting up an RSS feed.</p>
