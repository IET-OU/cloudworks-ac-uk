              <title>MON: Evaluation of game-based SRS (Student Response Systems) as OER and examples of open practices in secondary education (Ognjen Vukas)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I intend to explore the theme of innovation in the world of edtech start-ups such as the popular quizzing applications Kahoot, Quizlet Live, Socrative and Quizizz (Rose, 2017), and assess their suitability to support open practices in secondary education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education is the third most popular category in the Apple iOS App Store (Statista, 2018). This illustrates the growth of the market in edtech apps and services, which is also evident from the billions in venture capital funding that thousands of edtech start-ups have attracted (Berger, 2017). Many of these start-ups have adopted strategies which rely on freemium business models and user generated content. Game-based SRS have used gamification and the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) trend to achieve widespread adoption, especially in secondary education. These apps build on the tradition of Electronic Voting Systems (EVS) or clickers which first appeared in the 1960s and since then have been used in both HE and in compulsory education (Deal, 2007).&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the open education perspective, these are interesting developments as edtech companies are creating platforms for the free sharing of resources amongst teachers and other training practitioners. The vast majority of 51 million public Kahoot quizzes (Harrell, 2018) or 300 million Quizlet study sets (Quizlet, n.d.) are created and shared freely by their users, teachers and learners, although they have both started to offer resources from educational publishers (Kolodny, 2017).</p>
<p>I intend to evaluate these services against the five Rs of OER (Weller, 2014). I also intend to explore the impact commercial interests and market forces can have on openness, including the following issues: ownership of user-generated content; ability of users to retain their data in cases of acquisitions, ownership changes or services shutting down; interoperability and reusability of content between different apps and services; and whether these apps contribute to wider adoption of open practices.</p>
<p>As an exploratory part of the project I intend to create an outline of a website which will present the results of my investigations into the openness of game-based SRS applications; advice and information on interoperability and reusability of content between different apps and services; and advice for practitioners on how to protect their data and ensure they can retain it.</p>
<p>I will present the results of a literature review of SRS in relation to openness, the results of an online survey of practitioners using game-based SRS and the outline of the advice and information website.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Language learning in mainstream schools focuses on developing four different skills, reading, writing, listening and speaking. These four skills that students develop during their lessons are the same skills that languages teachers use to assess their students&rsquo; progress; the same skills that GCSE examining boards use to set their exams.</p>
<p>In England, teaching a modern language in primary schools became compulsory in 2014. Meantime, most schools in the UK teach at least one foreign language at secondary level. &nbsp;A document named <em>Language teaching in schools </em>(Long and Danechi, 2018) states that by September 2022 75% of Year 10 pupils would have taken a GCSE in a modern foreign language, following Government plans released in December 2018.</p>
<p>Meanwhile figures show that the number of students taking GCSE Spanish exams has increased over the past few years, becoming Spanish students&rsquo; favourite language (British Council, 2018), the number of students wanting to study modern foreign languages has declined (Adams, 2015; Kershaw, 2017). Two of the main reasons for this decline are the low confidence levels of speaking a different language and the difficulty in understanding what is being said by native speakers of the target language (Young, 2014).</p>
<p>Exam results confirm that the most challenging part of the GCSE languages exam is the listening component, where many students fail despite of achieving high marks in their reading and writing tests. Listening exams create high levels of anxiety amongst students who desperately ask for advice in online forums. At the same time, teachers advise to their students that the best way to practice listening skills is by listening to the target language as much as possible. But<em>, </em>what should I listen to? students ask (The Student Room, 2017). As Fuertes (2019) said &lsquo;Lo que m&aacute;s falta hace es, desde mi punto de vista, recursos auditivos y orales que sigan la estructura del examen&rsquo; (<em>What we need the most, from my point of view, are audio and verbal resources which follow the same structure as the exams</em>).</p>
<p>Therefore, this project titled &iexcl;Esc&uacute;chame! (<em>Listen to me!) </em>will focus on developing Spanish listening skills. The project is a response to teachers&rsquo; demands, based on their experiences and my own, as Spanish educational writer. Using a multimedia format, I have designed a website where Spanish audios, recorded by myself previously, will be stored and freely accessible to Spanish GCSE teachers and students.</p>
<p>&iexcl;Esc&uacute;chame! is aiming to &lsquo;cover&rsquo; the gap that exists online for free listening resources. The audios are based on topics that students are already studying in the classroom. And as these audios compile everyday life topics, they will also be useful to anyone wanting to practise their Spanish.</p>
<p>Finally, the audios will allow students to learn-on-the-go. Something that is becoming increasingly popular amongst students, being able to learn from their smartphone or tablet whilst they are commuting or doing different tasks (StudyBlue, 2011 ; Foti, 2014).</p>
<p align="center">The audio resources will be demonstrated during the conference presentation, along with the story behind its creation.</p>]]></description>

              <title>MON Adapting OER for the Professional Development of English Language Teachers (Gospel Ikpeme)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11948</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11948</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Multimedia Poster</h2>
<p>For an introduction to the project presentation please see the >multimedia poster</a> . I have also created an >accessible version</a> of my poster for people with sight challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Social exclusion has continued to be an enormous issue despite the increase in technologically rich learning platforms on the internet. A lot of those who use mobile technology have access to the internet but are unaware of the existence or use of OER (Online Educational Resources) and so they are being left behind.</p>
<p>My project is focus on the adaptation of OER for English language teachers. The essence of the project is to provide help to ensure the provision of learning materials to the marginalised teachers in the developing world, especially those in sub-Saharan African countries such as Nigeria.</p>
<p>The project will sensitise the teachers and help them acquire information and knowledge on OER. The English language teachers on the project will discover alternative ways of demonstrating what they know, and this will lead to a change in their classrooms as they begin to challenge their learners in more productive ways using materials from the OER sites.</p>
<p>Most teachers in Nigeria use mobile technologies and are on social media app networks such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram. This project will empower the teachers and improve their access to professional development and education available via OER sites (See O&rsquo;Connor, 2000). OER offers a plethora of choices.</p>
<p>My presentation will consider how systems can be created for teachers to have access to OER repositories. In recent times, there has been an increase in internet-based network of freely available online resources for learning and teaching. These open educational resources include highly interactive and innovative curricula, visualizations, simulations and lesson plans. There are features that support the use of real-world resources (see McArthur &amp; Zia 2008; Zia, 2001; Borgman et al., 2008). These increasingly available online resources are infrastructure available for teachers to use, access, and share, connect, create and adapt resources in ways that can change their practice (Borgman et al. 2008).</p>
<p>In the presentation, I will demonstrate that the use of social media technologies has an essential place in teacher professional development because teachers learn voluntarily. Teachers use forums to reflect on own practices and exchange ideas with colleagues (see Marcia &amp; Garcia, 2016). So, instant messaging software have helped teachers to adapt information, to re-conceptualize and to make information much more functional for their contexts (Cranefield &amp; Yoong, 2009). In very recent years, mobile learning devices have offered a variety of learning opportunities (see Macia &amp; Garcia, 2016; Rambe &amp; Bere, 2013; Cakir &amp; Arslan, 2013; Hwang, Huang &amp; Wu, 2011).</p>
<p>Given that WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook stand out in many studies as effective tools and applications used by many people and available in mobile devices. It is easy to create online community of practice using WhatsApp, Telegram or Facebook (see Baran &amp; Cagiltay, 2010; Wesley, 2013) and many teachers all over the world use WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook for social and learning purposes.</p>

<p>Mental health is significant to an individual's well-being. Young people with positive mental health contribute constructively in daily life and are less likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors (Knopf, Park and Mulye, 2008; Reynolds et al., 2013).&nbsp;</p>
<p>During recent years, the prevalence of mental health issues has mounted among young Pakistani women (Yusufzai, 2018). In a survey carried out in 2017, 44% of the entire population reported a high frequency of depression of which 57.5% were women (Sarfraz, 2017).</p>
<p>Female higher education students, in particular, are affected by depression and its associated risk factors due to socio-economic and cultural barriers (Ahmed et al., 2016; Saleem, Mahmood and Naz, 2013). In a survey conducted in Karachi, Pakistan 38.07 % of males and 61.00 % of female students indicated severe depression (Ghayas et al., 2014).</p>
<p>According to Sohail, Syed, and Rahman, &ldquo;In the Pakistani context, traditionally, the oppressive family/community environment is identified by Western-trained psychiatrists as an important cause of mental health problems in Muslim societies&rdquo; (2017, p.32). Despite women&rsquo;s participation in education and employment, their role in decision making and personal choices are sparse because of patriarchal culture (Gull Tarar and Pulla, 2014; Malik and Aamir, 2017).</p>
<p>There is a lack of awareness among female learners towards mental health due to the stigma associated with mental illness and unavailability of policy intervention (Damani, 2018; Kazmi, 2018; Waqas et al., 2014). To meet this need, &ldquo;a culturally appropriate mental health awareness intervention&rdquo; (Ali, et al., 2016, p.1) is believed to have a positive impact on their well-being.</p>
<p>My project takes an innovative approach to open learning. A multimedia object, i.e., a website is designed using a Google site. It intends to empower Pakistani female university students towards mental health without reliant on physical interaction due to widespread prejudice and gender stereotype. Culturally appropriate Open Educational Resources (OERs), Creative Commons licensed videos and podcasts, and other reliable contents are reviewed, filtered and compiled on &lsquo;Depression&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As a part of the &lsquo;innovative theme&rsquo; of the H818 online conference, my presentation will highlight the project rationale and will demonstrate the key features of the website. I will first shed light on the reasons, why I feel this website is the appropriate platform for the target population, and why I consider it as innovative. Moving further, I will brief a website content such as awareness, empowerment, and speak out! Inspirational stories. It will be followed by a few examples of collaborative activities and chat rooms appended within a website. Finally, I will share a testimonial video as a motivational tool. The presentation will be followed by a five minutes question and answer session.&nbsp;</p>

              <title>19 February 2018 - &quot;Old School meets Web 2.0: Mixing established teaching methodology with innovative learning tools.&quot;  (Holger Goertz)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This presentation overviews and analyses a project in which 121 students from six different year groups, and 28 different nationalities collaborate on a common moral project, creating a website on which they will publish their research findings on the topic of <em>climate change</em> and <em>species extinction</em>.</p>
<p>The presentation will focus on how the use of Web 2.0 and OER have the potential to improve student engagement, hence optimising &ldquo;the student experience and enhance the learning outcomes and development of students&rdquo; (Trowler 2010, 3). It seeks to show that the use of Web 2.0 and OER in different languages can facilitate communication with a linguistically heterogenous group of students and subsequently enhance understanding and learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Established <em>old school&nbsp;</em>teaching strategies-I.e.<em>collaborative</em> and <em>constructivist</em> <em>learning</em> are being mixed with<em> innovative digital learning tools</em>,&nbsp;<em>open educational resources</em> (OER) and<em> blended teaching strategies</em>, to foster the linguistic and academic inclusion of all students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The presentation intends to highlight why it is essential for teachers of all ages to not miss out on the educational opportunities Web 2.0 and OER bear, stimulating the digital literacy of both, students and teachers and offering the opportunity for students to become teachers, suggesting that it is the teacher&rsquo;s rather than the student&rsquo;s digital literacy that is challenged by this process.</p>

<p>Opening Educational Practices in Scotland Project (OEPS) is a three-year cross sector project supported by the Scottish Funding Council and hosted by the Open University in Scotland. The aim of the project is to understand why open education has had a limited impact on widening participation and to work with partners to develop effective practice designed to overcome barriers to participation. <br /> <br />During the course of the project the OEPS team has worked with more than 60 organisations, including universities, colleges, third-sector organisations, unions and employers. Using methods from participatory design, and insights from the discourse and practice of widening participation, the team has extended its understanding of Open Educational Practice. In particular, joint working with unions and third-sector partners, with shared values of social justice and collective activity, have enabled us to develop a deeper understanding of barriers to participation. <br /> <br />In this paper we will share some of our findings and present a small number of case study examples of how we have incorporated them into a number of free open courses, co-created with partners and hosted on OpenLearn Create. In the course of this we will comment briefly on the value that co-design of open courses designed for widening participation has for the partner and the university.</p>

<p>The concept of self_OER has only recently been proposed (Bali and Koseoglu, 2016; Koseoglu and Bali, 2016). Conceptualising openness as a &lsquo;worldview&rsquo;, or as a &lsquo;way of being&rsquo;, it involves widening understanding of open educational resources (OER) from one of physical content to include individuals in the learning community. The processes and products of open scholarship (texts) are proposed as resources themselves. <br />Further to this, Koseoglu and Bali (2016) ask &ldquo;how might the processes and products of open scholarship align/intersect with the goals of open education?&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

              <title>MON: Can MOOCs propel the OER agenda for educators in South Africa? (John Kerr)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9508</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9508</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can MOOCs propel the OER agenda for educators in South Africa?</strong></p>
<p>This project focuses on the amalgamation of the two entities &ndash; MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses) and OERs (Open Educational Resources) &ndash; to ascertain if a symbiotic relationship could organically occur between the two. The aim is the impact that the globalised distribution of free, high quality educational technology resources - blended into MOOC pedagogy - can have a direct impact on teachers of technology in South Africa to locate suitable OERs and understand how to adapt them to their cultural sensitivities; a common issue with global north materials (Waliji, 2014).</p>
<p>Wright (2014) identifies the top five barriers to education across the World as: Power, Internet connectivity, Training, Value teachers and Sustainability. Education in South Africa suffers these barriers which directly impact on learning and teaching; more specifically, how to locate and use OERs (de los Arcos <em>et al, </em>2014). However, as Waliji (2014) identifies OER initiatives in the south are increasing as hardware, access to digital tool and connectivity grows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the distribution of open material as MOOCs &ndash; adopting cMOOC pedagogy of connectivism &ndash; this project aims to break down some of these barriers and increase access to South African educationalists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;MOOCs have proven to be a truly disruptive innovation for Higher Education. They continue to increase exponentially in numbers year on year, with more than 400 institutions globally delivering free courses to a registered cohort of 18million students across all major MOOC providers (Class-Central, 2014). In contrast, OERs have been on institutional agendas for the last decade but haven&rsquo;t yet made a comparable impact. However, things are changing. Weller (2013) notes the blurring of MOOCs and OERs and Abeywardena (2014) emphasises that OERs are not as of yet a significant part of the movement of open education. De los Arcos <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->et al</em> (2014) OER Research Hub Evidence Report on OER adoption highlights that 79.5% of educators use OERs to gain new ideas and that 27.5% agree that OER use results in better test scores. However, only 12.4% educators publish OERs under a Creative Commons license and that sourcing OERs is the biggest barriers to their use. This project aims to provide a solution to this problem with the outlined context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly to the OER movement in Scotland being guided by the Open Scotland Declaration, Africa has OER Africa; a movement which supports institutions locate and find OERs (OER Africa, 2013). Recently, the United States the Federal Government released support for OERs to provide equitable access to quality education, OER creation, adoption and sharing (openscot.net). All three movements follow on from the 2012 Paris OER Declaration which designated that &ndash;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&ldquo;Teaching, learning and research materials in any medium&hellip;that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open licence that permits no-cost access, use, adoption and redistribution by others&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>This project will also consider key benefits and potential risks to institutions and their staff while outlining potential enhancements to the wider community, and the socioeconomical benefits this approach could bring.</p>]]></description>

              <title>SAT: How forums and collaborative learning impact on oral proficiency in a foreign language class. (Tommy Ruiz)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9504</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9504</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Using a class activity and its inclusive online collaborative component (open educational resources (OER), Moodle and its forums) the teacher recorded students who would not regularly speak during class time. This presentation discusses the importance of collaborative learning, digital methods and how students perceive their educational learning through an online community. Focusing primarily on the theme of inclusion, the interpretivist lens allows the teacher to focus on ethnographic data collected to extract key concepts. The presentation concludes by outlining the importance of collaborative learning and its impact on inclusive learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This presentation explores:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How collaborative learning is implemented in a foreign language class.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How and why it helps oral proficiency.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To what extent forums compliment collaborative learning in a foreign language class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While interest in the voice of students and teenagers has grown, concerns for their oral participation in a foreign language class can still be a daunting experience for some (Hewitt and Stephenson, 2012).&nbsp; For those excluded, the teacher needs to implement a safe, positive learning environment where students can feel at ease. Personal growth is mostly achieved whilst connecting, comparing and challenging your peers&rsquo; work. As a result, carefully structured group work or collaborative learning has been promoted at the international school of Kuala-Lumpur (ISKL) for a number of years. When applied to a foreign language class, collaborative learning creates random conversations. It focuses on shared knowledge and clear communication skills between students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When learning a foreign language, not all students learn at the same pace. Therefore pupils do not have the same learning outcomes. Consequently, a class activity that promotes collaborative learning needs to be tailored for the students&rsquo; individual needs. As a result, critical theory (Curseu and Pluut, 2013) suggests that students should work collaboratively in small groups to fulfil their potential whilst avoiding some of the peer pressure issues. Effective communicators listen, reflect and respect each other&rsquo;s ideas. Students need to take part in conversations to be accepted and thus included in the learning process. Each student should be a creative thinker who can reason critically. They need to defend viewpoints, argue and share experiences. In that context, oral participation is a crucial component towards inclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Placing a similar emphasis on the role of forums, Norvig (2012) views the latter as a platform where communication helps students clarify problems, negotiate meanings, exchange knowledge and share perspectives. Whilst language acquisition is usually linked to input-driven, listening and thus passive learning is as important (Lefkowitz and Hedgcock, 2002). In this context, forums are an extension of the collaborative learning and a reflection tool. Forums allow students to listen to their peers, learn from good examples, engage in critical reasoning and promote a monitored inclusive learning environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This presentation will appeal to teachers who are looking for an inclusive approach to enhance an open scholarly practice, as well as those individuals who would like to learn about the forums in a collaborative online learning environment. The presentation will explore an analysis of participant contributions, survey data, and questionnaires to propose a model for collaborative learning in a foreign language class.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>[DRAFT abstract - comments please]</h2>
<p>The uptake of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) within the HE sector has increased exponentially in the last 2 years with a belief that it will be of benefit to the provision of education in an ever expanding population (Trucano, 2013). With the majority of MOOCs coming from and being aimed at the global north (ICDE, 2013), how are MOOCs contextualised by providers for local context, what impact does this have on their applicability to the global context, and how does OER and openness support this contextualisation? &nbsp;One commonly heard line of rhetoric in respect to MOOCs is that they largely benefit those already engaged in their own education, rather than those excluded from other forms of education. Some studies (Christensen et al, 2013) finding over 80% of participants having post-secondary qualifications and almost 50% reporting post graduate qualifications. Understanding the mechanisms by which a MOOC is delivered can support the engagement of participants, or act as an additional barrier, particularly in development contexts, is essential to the ability of MOOC providers in ensuring equitable access and support for students&rsquo; learning.</p>
<p>Set within the context of Nobel economist Amartya Sen&rsquo;s (1999) ideas of development in &lsquo;expand[ing] people&rsquo;s substantive freedoms through the removal of &ldquo;unfreedoms&rdquo;: poverty, limited economic opportunity, inadequate education and access to knowledge, deficient health care, and oppression&rsquo; (p. 1).&nbsp; This presentation seeks to identify the ways in which MOOCs and by association other forms of openness either add or remove barriers to engagement in education in relation to the removal of unfreedoms, providing an understanding of the openness of MOOCs and the extent to which MOOCs as tool contribute to a narrative of development as freedom.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title </strong>When is a map not a map?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator </strong>Myself, an education researcher at The Institute of Educational Technology at The Open University</p>
<p>Situation Working as a researcher on the OER Research Hub project, I'm part of a team that collects and reviews evidence about the impact of open educational resources (OER). Evidence about OER impact can be hard to come by: suitable metrics often involve institutionally sensitive information; interventions may not be evaluated consistently; and it can be hard to isolate the particular influence of openness. &nbsp;This can make it hard to draw any conclusions about an overall picture.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task&nbsp;</strong>I worked with a team of researchers and a programmer with expertise in data visualisation to design a data model that would be flexible enough to accommodate diverse evidence types (papers, survey data, infographics, video &nbsp;clips, etc) and help make sense of the bigger picture for a range of different audiences. OER Research Hub is structured around 11 research hypotheses which also must be communicated to non-specialists. This task can therefore be construed as an exercise in learning design.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Actions </strong></strong>I designed a data model which would include the polarity (+/-) of evidence relative to hypotheses as well as the geographical location. This meant that evidence could be recorded on a map and colour-coded to provide more of the metadata. Working with our developer we adapted a Sankey diagram to visualise the evidence base as a whole. Similar visualizations help users to understand the status of each hypothesis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Results </strong>OER Impact Map is part of an ongoing project and still under development, but is already proving to be a useful tool for the research team and the wider OER community. &nbsp;Consciously construing the resource as a pedagogical design enables it to act as such both for the researchers and the community they serve while the map acts as a shared artifact with many different pathways through the data.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong> This example is not taken from the classroom since I am not teaching at the moment, but I do feel it illustrates the importance of learning design for the creation of educational digitial artifacts.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Making it Happen&rsquo;, Supporting or Engendering Open Academic Practice using Jorum Open Educational Resources (OERs) within a manufacturing environment (using a manufacturing environment as a case study). <br /><br />Abstract<br />The content within this presentation is aimed at anyone interested in engendering open academic practice outside of academia . The title of this presentation is &lsquo;Making it Happen&rsquo;, Supporting or Engendering Open Academic Practice using Jorum Open Educational Resources (OERs) within a manufacturing environment (using a manufacturing environment as a case study). The theme of the presentation is implementation. What the theme of implementation means in terms of the conference theme is that audience members will receive a pilot. The intention of the pilot is to demonstrate to audience members a combination of practical and theoretical ways by which to Support or Engender Open Academic Practice. Paraphrasing Mackness (2013), Open Academic Practice Is achieved by sharing, being social, connecting, networking , working in communities of practice, communicating, building relationships , using technology , publishing, and having a belief in social learning theories. <br />What audience members can expect to learn is the following.<br />&bull; Some key definitions for example, Open Educational Resource (OER), Open Academic Practice and Jorum. <br />&bull; Ways in which Jorum has engendered my open academic practice. <br />&bull; The impact on practice of using Jorum (from practical User Stories within Jorum). <br />&bull; Theoretical definitions of socio-technical theory, including principles, concepts and factors . <br />&bull; How to engender open academic practice outside of academia (a model or a framework) for engendering open academic practice. <br />&bull; A casestudy of organisational change as a result of open knowledge management approaches to engendering open academic practice outside of academia.<br />&bull; A Framework/Model for organisational change &ndash;socio-technical model.<br />&bull; That there is a gap in research around engendering open academic practice outside of academia.<br />One of the reasons that the presenter chose the topic was that she observed in some of the tutor group forums within Module H818 that some students (including the presenter herself) were not familiar with Jorum. This situation set the seed in the presenters mind to proceed to find out the features and affordances of Jorum and how it could engender open academic practice and in what context . Why the presenter chose to research Jorum was for the reason that the presenter works in a manufacturing environment. The presenter was interested to find out for herself if Jorum could engender open academic in a manufacturing environment.<br />To start with, the research approach that the presenter took to the topic was to begin with finding out how to log on to Jorum to get an understanding of how it could engender open academic practice. The next practical step in the research process that the presenter took was to go through the tabs within Jorum to search for positive User stories related to Engendering Open Academic practice http://www.jorum.ac.uk/about-us/user-stories. <br />After that, the presenter took a practical approach, developing and depositing an open educational resource within Jorum. The next step that the presenter took was to share the links to her Open Educational Resource http://find.jorum.ac.uk/find/?utf8=✓&amp;q=avril. The presenter deposited her open educational resource Following on from this the presenter shared statistics downloaded from Jorum, based on the OER deposit. Then the presenter shared the statistics in the H818 tutor group forums. In this presentation the presenter has shared evidence of her own primary data collection using Jorum . <br />While literature review was undertaken to source primary and secondary sources of information (data, research , surveys, case studies) of how Jorum supports or engenders open academic practice in manufacturing organisations, surprisingly , the presenter was unable to locate existing literature /evidence specifically related to how Jorum could engender open academic practice in manufacturing organisations. For this reason the presenter reverted to presenting her own evidence using herself as a case study. The presenter used Jorum discovering that personally for her Jorum had engendered a change in her in terms of open academic practice . This presentation provides evidence from personal perspective on how to engender open academic practice using jorum, and from a User stories perspective http://www.jorum.ac.uk/about-us/user-stories. <br />This presentation looks at what theoretical perspectives and what a case study examples tell us about the topic of engendering open academic practice. This presentation takes into consideration different perspectives on engendering open academic practice.<br />The types of findings that are presented in this presentation are a combination of personal findings (using Jorum and doing personal research around the topic title) along with theoretical findings based on literature review. The key message within the presentation is that engendering open academic practice outside of academia requires a belief in socio-technical systems theory. <br />Within my presentation I have inserted my contact details. The aim of this approach is to continue to network on line with anyone interested in engendering open academic practice outside of academia (in particular in manufacturing organisations). Audience members can connect with me during and after the conference on face book, twitter, slide share, YouTube and linked in. <br />The potential value of my research for anyone interested in engendering open academic practice might be that it could be used as trigger for anyone interested in engendering open academic practice using Jorum to connect with or partner with academia in order to gain expert insights into theoretical ways/partnerships that can be built upon to engender open academic practice. <br />Keywords essential to this topic: OER, Open Educational Resources, Jorum, Supporting, Engendering, Open Academic Practice.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Potential resources for the presentation (not all inclusive full references list to be confirmed in the presentation).<br />Atkins, D., Brown, J. and Hammond, A.

              <title>MON: Open Educational Practice and Public Engagement: a case study from a less commonly taught language (Ulrich Tiedau)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Abstract<br /><br />The project presented here investigates &ldquo;the potential of new forms of public engagement enabled by new technology&rdquo; (Scanlon, 2013: 3), using an example from a UK less-widely-taught language community (&lsquo;VirtualDutch&rsquo;) that has been engaged in Open Educational Practices for quite some time (Verbaan, 2008; Tiedau, 2013). It does so with the objective of developing, in close interaction with the historically interested public, a set of Dutch (and Flemish) Walks through London, highlighting the manifold connections between the Capital and the Low Countries. The Walks will be released as Open Educational Resources in the form of leaflets, podcasts and an interactive iOS/Android app. Their development takes place in close dialogue with historically interested communities who will not only be able to follow the walks but also to contribute user-generated content which, it is expected, will unearth even more of the hidden Dutch and Flemish histories of London. This in turn, we hope, will allow staff at UCL and other institutions to include these sites as resources in their research and teaching (&lsquo;London as part of our campus&rsquo;). The presentation will conclude with some preliminary findings on how Open Educational Practices can be integrated with Public Engagement.<br /><br />References<br /><br />Scanlon, E.

              <title>THU: Taming the wild or wilding the tame?  Supporting the implementation of open textbooks. (Jo Jacob)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8554</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8554</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This paper is based on the presenter&rsquo;s current action research into the preliminary stages of the adoption and implementation of open textbooks &ndash; a type of open educational resource &ndash; by a team of trainers delivering formal classroom-based learning programmes to apprentices. The presentation will briefly explain what open textbooks are and how they may be used.<br /><br />The context for this is organisations which provide training for apprentices in England. In 2012/13 nearly 860,000 people participated in apprenticeships, which combine paid work with learning. This means apprentices, as well as the colleges and training providers which work with them, are potentially significant users of suitable open educational resources.<br /><br />People as well as existing and new practices and technologies may be seen as &lsquo;wild&rsquo; or &lsquo;tame&rsquo;, and change may mean &lsquo;taming&rsquo; or &lsquo;wilding&rsquo; them. The paper will consider how open textbooks, practices and people may be considered wild and tame. <br /><br />There is a body of research literature on open textbooks which suggests that the use of open textbooks improves outcomes for learners and sheds light on how they are used in practice. Highlights from a review of the research literature will be presented and a discussion of their implications for their use by work-based learning practitioners and apprentices. <br /><br />Adopting and using OER may mean a change for practitioners and leaders which engenders new understanding, skills and practices. Change from the existing state to a new desired state does not &lsquo;just happen&rsquo; as individuals and teams often have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. The action research aims to investigate leadership approaches which will support the team to implement new technology and practices. Some early findings will be provided, which include a tentative model for considering the support needs of teams implementing open textbooks.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Anna&#39;s design narrative - Presenting at an online webinar</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8304</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8304</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>I undertake research in the area of Open Educational Resources (OER) and need to be able to share project findings in an engaging way, both face-to-face and online.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>This activity was part of the <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/">Open Education Week</a> which took place from 11-15 March 2013 online and in locally hosted events around the world which were freely available to anyone with Internet access. The purpose of Open Education Week is to raise awareness of the open education movement and opportunities it creates in teaching and learning worldwide. I was invited to contribute to one of the webinars because of my work on the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/actoer.referata.com">ACTOER </a>(Accessibility Challenges and Techniques for Open Educational Resources) project.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>I was asked to contribute to a webinar "Designing OERs with Diversity in Mind" with two other co-presenters. Our success would be measured by whether we managed to attract any participants on the day and engage them in dialogue about OERs and accessibility; further measure would also be the number of downloads of the webinar slides from Slideshare where they would be posted.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>1. I was first contacted three months prior to the event by the organiser who wanted to find out about my interest and availability.</p>
<p>2. Once myself and two co-presenters were onboard, we had to agree on a time and date for the webinar as well as for a rehearsal- this proved to be somewhat challenging as we had to choose a time that would accommodate three different time zones: UK (GMT), Canada (Toronto GMT-4) and USA (California GMT-7). In the end, we picked 4 p.m. UK time which was 12:00 p.m. in Toronto and 9:00 a.m. in California</p>
<p>3. Three weeks prior to the event we developed and shared our slides via email.</p>
<p>4. One week before the event we had a "dry run" of the webinar so that on the day we would be familiar with the Blackboard Collaborate platform. This gave us a chance to talk about the running order, any changes to the slides and sort out technical glitches. The meeting was useful because it allowed us to coordinate the content of the three presentations and make sure that they are connected and flow quite well.</p>
<p>5. The actual webinar took one hour and seven participants&nbsp; took part in the online session.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The session was recorded and the recording is now available from the Open Education website. The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/UnaDaly/designing-oer-with-diversity-in-mind">slides </a>were posted on Slideshare and attracted over 2000 views.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>Personally, the key challenge was the lack of immediate feedback from the participants - when delivering my presentation, it felt as if I was talking into a void as I missed out on verbal/non-verbal cues from other people in the session. The lack of feedback was quite unnerving as I could only guess whether people were engaging or not, for all I knew, they could be asleep at their computers or mindlessly surfing the Internet; however judging by the questions typed in the chat box they seemed to be listening. I enjoyed participating in the back channel and the chance to share my expertise by posting links to projects with resources that the participants were interested in.</p>
<p>I was initially disappointed that only seven participants "showed up" as the session took up so much of my time and effort to prepare but was consoled by the fact that the outreach was much wider thanks to Slideshare. At the same time, the low turnout at the online session doesn&rsquo;t come as a surprise, I was planning myself to participate in other Open Education Week events but ended up not being able to attend anything; while the online events were easily accessible they still required carving out "real time" which was a challenge.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3>Passionate Participatory Making</h3>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->My dream is <strong>to help create</strong> a MOOC that will <strong>enable world wide</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Digital Literacy.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I envision a&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->map of learning activities</strong>&nbsp;for raising ones&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->digital literacy</strong>&nbsp;<strong>competencies</strong>.</li>
<li>Learners could jump in at any time, anywhere on the map,&nbsp;and find guidance to master that particular skill set.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The map would be dynamic, continually being improved and expanded, much like in wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I was proposing was a &nbsp;"<strong>project based</strong>" "<strong>connectivist</strong>" creation of a <strong>learning space</strong> "<strong>that&nbsp;that if properly designed could scale to&nbsp;world changing proportions</strong>".</p>
<h3>Teacher Presence</h3>
<p>The <strong>daily summaries</strong> by&nbsp;Yishay, Peter and Simon were very important to me. By <strong>pointing</strong> and <strong>naming</strong> participants contributions we were validated and motivated and inspired. Some MOOCs even enlist "<strong>skilled others</strong>" to demonstrate disired levels of performance. <strong>We learn by watching and mimicking.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Making with Peers</strong></h3>
<p>I agree with OLDSMOOC's learning design,&nbsp;<strong>creating personally meaningful projects, together with like minded peers. </strong>Too bad I have yet to enlist any collaborative peers ("I am not a quitter" though, lol). I will try to design my learning space so as to insure everyone has a supportive partner and that every creative work gets acknowlegment/feedback.</p>
<h3>Navigation and Site Map</h3>
<p>Although the OLDSMOOC website had detailed descriptions of what to do during the nine weeks many participants seemed disoriented (or even lost, especially in the clouds). I addressed this by offering a <strong><a title="navigation" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7655">navigation tool/discussion cloud</a>. </strong>The daily summaries were helpful here, too, by pointing to what might otherwise have been missed.</p>
<p>I think in my learning design, I will have <strong>a place where frustrated participants can yell "Help</strong>, throw me a lifeline".</p>
<h3>Wikis, Forums, Blogging, Badges, and Portfolios</h3>
<p>I, too, will design in the creation of these forms of digital artifacts (and identity).</p>
<h3>Networking</h3>
<p>By reading reflections and following links pointed to by like minded participants I have learned first hand how <strong>networking</strong> continually provides me with <strong>new, relevant resouces</strong>, &nbsp;many of which are <strong>still evolving</strong>. I will be using <strong>Mozilla's Open Badges</strong> and still have to go back and mine the <strong>OER repositories</strong>. I will continue to do my part by <strong><a title="digital literacies resources" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8079">sharing resources</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>Partipatory Learning</h3>
<p>I want to especially thank those participants who took time to communicate with me. I realise how this has impacted me. I intend to similarly reach out and participate within the many newly discovered networks that have opened up to me during this course.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Our converge on this (yes, I am doing this out of sequence!) raised an important issue for me - again.&nbsp; This has also led to a slow dawning realisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In truth teaching practitioners have probably been practising the priciple of open resources in an informal paper-based way since teaching began.&nbsp; Sharing of resources is not as odd for practitioners as it is for researchers for several good reasons (the primary one being that competition and the need to publish original or novel materials is not part of the teaching role so we don't have a need to protect our work).&nbsp; However that wasn't the aspect that I was still left with when our very useful chat was finished.&nbsp; My difficulty is that when you are preparing a single learning session (tutorial or dayschool) rather than an entire course, finding open resources that do the job you need often takes longer than creating them and sometimes you don't find appropriate material at all.&nbsp; A 'grab what you can and adapt the lesson accordingly' approach undoes all the careful consideration that has gone into the early design stages, disregards the personas lovingly identified and may slide a little off the learning arc defined.&nbsp; Teaching across several faculties, I need great certainty about the quality <em>and </em> aptness of resources and that I will find them quickly when I sit down to design a session.&nbsp; In the days when the world turned more slowly, we would collect and hoard good resources as we came across them, gifted by colleagues, and re-use for years.&nbsp; With the need now to maintain a more current and cutting-edge collection, how do you sift through in the three hours you have to design a session?&nbsp; [Yes, I am now having fun with the SCORE site, will work on refining&nbsp; a list of good sources for the future from what is discovered here]</p>
<p>So it was good to spot the example of systems arising to deal with this reality:</p>
<p>http://www.edcanvas.com/lessons/nTm4WQdU_qZyOA/plate-tectonics</p>
<p>Quicker than a google and then checking through, wider reach than going to a few known sites, this is a starting point for future curating approaches.&nbsp; Not really aimed at the level I teach, but a good sign of things to come.</p>
<p>Then it struck me - this is the point that is being shared with us this week, why this is 'Week 6 - Curate', not 'Week 6 - Find OER'.&nbsp; (I think a D'oh would be appropriate here...).&nbsp; We curate to make a current shareable hoard of resources, not to strut our current reading list and finds.&nbsp; Who'd a thought it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS this does not directly contribute to my original design, but throwing it down to get into the habit of doing this in the open...</p>]]></description>

<strong><strong>I have come to the OLDSMOOC to understand how 21st Century learning designers are expressing and measuring learning outcomes in open educational environments.  My hope is to immerse myself in the OLDSMOOC activities and learn from participant experts/explorers by observing/questioning decisions about activities and the indicators/measures/assessment of learning gains.<br /><br />It is my dream to find ways to better express, collect, measure, report the learning gains of self-directed language learners registered with my publicly funded organization.  <br /><br />My situation (context)</strong></strong>

We have examples of writing improvement, but each learner is different in their gain, collection is time consuming. Sometimes a testimonial comes; or feedback on survey (10% returns).<br /><br />Learner: focus on listening, uses links from Twitter, wiki, etc. doesn’t login to LMS for 3 months.  Gets a reminder call, and they have been completing activities on recommended resources.  We have no data on language gains.</td>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Funders, understandably, want ‘proof’ of learning gains, reliable/valid measures of project impact on clients.</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dream N&deg;1 : online course on social media for learning</strong></p>
<p>I currently teach a 12-week totally online module on social media for teaching and learning, on the<a title="Description of AIGEME Master" href="http://www.univ-paris3.fr/master-2-aigeme-ifd-br-applications-informatiques-gestion-education-aux-medias-e-formation-br-i-parcours-ingenierie-de-la-formation-a-distance-i--26468.kjsp" target="_blank"> AIGEME Masters course</a> for Universit&eacute; Paris 3 Sorbonne-Nouvelle, with an international French-speaking intake of students. I co-teach this module with a great colleague based in Morocco. Until recently, the course was split in two parts, web 2.0 and analysis of educational media.</p>
<p>This year we have revamped the course to improve the integration of the two parts and to get the students using a specific Twitter hashtag for the course combined with content curation via <a title="Scoop.it topic for AIGEME module on social media for learning" href="http://www.scoop.it/t/master-aigeme-web-2-0-et-usages-dynamiques" target="_blank">scoop.it</a>. This revamp was the result of a joint reflection between my colleague and myself, but I would now like to apply what we will be learning in the OLDSMOOC to validate and improve these design choices. I suppose what I'm really looking for is a solid framework and for exchanges with others involved in a similar process.</p>
<p><strong>Dream N&deg;2: improve our staff development programme in teaching and learning innovation through the use of learning technology.</strong></p>
<p>When I arrived at the University of Burgundy a year ago, there was a sound staff development programme already in place, but for the areas dealt with by my department, the focus was mainly on tools (Moodle, podcasts, webconferencing..). We are gradually shifting the focus to 'pedagogical use' and have developed a course we co-run with the pedagogical innovation department, in which the starting point is the pedagogical scenario (project-based learning, collaborative learning...), bringing in the technology as a way of supporting these approaches. The first session is to take place on January 31st, so we still have a bit of time to refine the design, and this is where I hope the OLDSMOOC will come in handy! It will also help us in the evaluation stage. So again, if anyone else is working on staff development programmes in the field of learning technology, then let's team up!</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Although philosophy is taught more widely in schools than when I was in Sixth Form/attending school (I&nbsp;did not formally study/read philosophy until I reached University), it would be great to have an accessible, free, complete&nbsp;course which develops critical thinking skills and introduces people to philosophical ideas. The aim would be to widen participation in philosophy...</p>
<p>I'd like to see the use of social media and am particularly interested in developing the course so that it makes use of (or develops) open educational resources (OER)...</p>

<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p><a href="http://track.olnet.org/">Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr></a> is a <abbr title="Joint Information Systems Committee">JISC</abbr>-funded project to demonstrate technical solutions to the problem of tracking <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> (Open Educational Resources). As part of the Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> project we have developed a service to add license-tracker snippets to resources available through the <a href="http://oercommons.org/"><abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> Commons</a> portal.</p>
<p>And, here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>First visit the link track dot olnet dot org and put at the end a question mark, edge equals one, <a href="http://track.olnet.org/?edge=1">http://track.olnet.org/?edge=1</a> (this just means use experimental features)</li>
<li>Then make sure your browser's bookmarklets/ bookmarks bar is available</li>
<li>Then drag the bookmarklet that's in the bottom-left of the site to your bookmarks or favourites bar,</li>
<li>Now visit <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> Commons, <a href="http://oercommons.org">http://oercommons.org</a></li>
<li>Browse using the menus on the left, among the materials. I'll choose something from the Arts section. Here's a resource available through <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> Commons, the Aaron Copland Collection,</li>
<li>Then simply click on the bookmarklet you saved previously..</li>
<li>Wait a few [moments]&hellip;</li>
<li>And view the resulting license-snippet. You get a preview here, and some copy and paste here.</li>
</ol>
<p>By default the snippet uses <a title="Piwik open source web analytics" href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a> no-Javascript tracking and a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>. You can switch to Google Analytics, here, like so&hellip; Here's the Google Analytics [Java]script&hellip;</p>
<p>Additionally, you can change the license, for example using&hellip; the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike [License] like so.</p>
<p>Currently the Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> bookmarklet service is mostly a demonstration. It can be used by a publisher on small batches of OERs. Download the <a title="Track OER project code, on GitHub" href="https://github.com/IET-OU/trackoer-core">Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> code</a> and consider integrating it into your publishing workflow for full scale integration of tracking. We are considering extending the current functionality into an &ldquo;<em>Embed Me</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Embed 'n' Track</em>&rdquo; service for OpenLearn and <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> Commons.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The math department at SCC is making a concerted effort to adapt, create, and adopt open source materials for our students. To that end, groups of faculty have focused on replacing traditional textbooks and supplementary materials for specific courses with open source materials. Beginning in the Fall 2012 semester, and each semester thereafter, students in our standard, face-to-face Introductory Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, and College Algebra classes will be able to obtain text-based and computer-based materials at no charge (or a very small charge for a bound, hard copy of the materials). These students will no longer need to purchase textbooks or ancillary online materials. Spring 2012 will see other courses coming on-board with OER materials including our Beginning Arithmetic 082 course and our Math142 College Math course.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />The faculty teams have actively reviewed available materials and have made connections to our district curriculum and they have maintained our departmental philosophy of teaching mathematics for understanding. In many cases faculty have included their own contributions to the world of open educational resources and in turn freely shared those resources through sites such as youtube, livescribe, our department-developed website http://score.scottsdalecc.edu, or our department-driven, open-source, online homework system: http://mathas.scottsdalecc.edu.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />In this session, our faculty team will:<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Share samples of OER books and workbook materials<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Share samples of created resources including Livescribe videos, Softchalk lessons, Screencasts<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Share samples of a new OER book created for the ipad using the ibooks Author software<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrate WAMAP (open source math homework deliver system)<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss co-development and sharing of libraries and course templates in WAMAP with other Maricopa District schools (Phoenix College, Paradise Valley)<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrate Score website (our in-house repository for activities)<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss tips and tricks to get and keep faculty interested and evolved in such projects<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss the class delivery systems in which the OER materials are utilized including hybrid and online classes and modified &ldquo;flipped&rdquo; in-person classes<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss how our department has been transformed by our OER projects<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />The impact of these projects is real for our students. On average, the courses listed above enroll 1800+ students each semester. If we consider the cost of savings to our students (at a very roughly estimated average cost of somewhere between $75-$125 per student) we should see an overall savings of somewhere between $135,000-$225,000 for fall 2012 alone, or $270,000-$450,000 per year for our students. This is not the only impact, however. All materials we develop will be our own to use, reuse, revise and redistribute. We will never have another forced textbook upgrade from the publishers. We will not have to worry about digital licenses, registrations, and bundles. We will be able to edit materials instantly. We will share these materials as prototypical courses that we will willingly share with anyone, in the district or beyond. In short, we are taking OER to the max!</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The University of British Columbia supports an institutional wiki that serves as collaborative authoring space. The UBC Wiki is used as an open knowledge repository, a collection of university training materials and documentation, and a rapidly growing set of course materials and open educational resources. One such resource is the Math Exam Resources (MER) wiki, a community project started in March 2012 by graduate students at the UBC Math Department to provide an open and free educational resources to undergraduate students. The MER wiki was developed using an innovative approach that allowed for mass collaboration, rapid development, student engagement, and robust reuse. What makes a healthy environment that supports user inovation in the&nbsp; development of such open educational content?

              <description><![CDATA[<p>At first glance, the meaning of the term "content" could not be more obvious. It is the stuff we share, study, watch, create and mashup on the Web. However, a closer look at content as substance, as educational, as opposed to form, and even --deposed or enthroned on the Web-- as king, raises many more questions. What is the &sup3;educational&sup2; nature of content and how does it relate to its (re)usability?&nbsp; How does form (e.g. learning designs, management systems) relate to content? And what makes it valuable or valueless? This presentation<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />will both raise and explore these questions, in the form of a dialogue between the two presenters -one that will gradually expand to include the audience as well. This dialogue will tap in to ideas of curriculum as an overall structure that both enables and limits the coherence of educational &sup3;contents,&sup2; contexts and purposes. It will also look at the issue of specificity and irreplaceability that is implied in the notion of content as substance and<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />materiality -as something that is actually specific to a place and time, rather than ubiquitous&nbsp; and (theoretically) endlessly adaptable. Our point, in short, will be to show that content is something to understand more fully before we leave it behind.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6558</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Significant efforts are underway to transition learning from today&rsquo;s &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo; approach to one that personalizes the learning experience according to the needs and skills of particular students. Several systems have achieved some success by writing out a massive set of rules dictating how to teach a student a topic given that student&rsquo;s prior learning performance. These rule-based systems are painstakingly constructed by a team of domain experts, computer scientists, and cognitive scientists for one specific course. This approach has two major disadvantages. The resources required to build the system for one course makes scaling up to many courses prohibitively expensive. And even assuming scalability, rule-based approaches are fragile: what happens when a student deviates from the course&rsquo;s predetermined rules and how can these global rules be truly personalized for different kinds of learners?<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />OpenStax Tutor, a collaboration between engineers and cognitive scientists at Rice University and Duke University, addresses these challenges by fusing cognitive science learning strategies and modern machine learning algorithms; the result is an automated, personalized, and optimized learning experience for today&rsquo;s courses and students.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />OpenStax Tutor can marshal many different open educational resource (OER) sources in its quest to improve student learning, but two repositories stand out: Connexions (cnx.org) for rich e-texts and Quadbase (quadbase.org) for assessments. Connexions is one of the world&rsquo;s first and largest OER projects. Connexions&rsquo; repository of free, open-source educational content is accessible to students, instructors, and authors worldwide. Quadbase is an open access question bank, focused on serving instructors and educational platforms with support for multiple question types and embedding options. Both platforms thrive on community-submitted and -curated content, and access remains free to all under a Creative Commons attribution license.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />OpenStax Tutor runs on a unique pairing of two suites of advanced machine learning algorithms. The first takes a large corpus of OER materials, including texts, questions, videos, and simulations, automatically determines how these materials interrelate, and stores them in Linkify (linkify.org), a new system for understanding semantic links between web resources. The second takes the relationships from Linkify along with student learning records, and chooses each student&rsquo;s next learning step to optimize their progress. These decisions are based on each student&rsquo;s individual learning record, in addition to knowledge of other student&rsquo;s prior successes and failures. OpenStax Tutor also builds on proven learning strategies from cognitive science. Questions for a topic are asked when the topic is introduced and at several later times to lock the knowledge in. Students also receive immediate feedback when working through assessments. Outcomes from the machine learning algorithms also provide fine-grained learning diagnostics on instructor and student dashboards.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />Building off our initial success at Rice University, OpenStax Tutor is currently in its second round of pilot testing at several universities.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />In this 45 minute session, OpenStax Tutor architect, JP Slavinsky, and algorithms expert, Richard Baraniuk, will overview the primary components of the system. Project Manager, Daniel Williamson, will overview the community approach to developing content in both Connexions and Quadbase.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The goal of this research is two-fold. First and foremost, an examination of the digital infrastructure that enables the effective linking of both open and proprietary content for the development of open tools and resources for English language education will be presented for discussion. This will include an extensive exploration of the re-use and re-purposing of different types of English language content for the development of open English language teaching and learning resources, as seen with the Flexible Language Acquisition (FLAX) project based at the University of Waikato in New Zealand. For example, re-purposed peer-reviewed research content for the development of English language open educational resources (OER) derived from language collections such as the British National Corpus and Open Access journal publications. Further collections include the British Academic Written English corpus of university student-generated texts as well as crowd-sourced linguistic content from Wikipedia.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />Second, an opening landscape in English language education will be presented for further discussion, concerning the projects, practices and people engaged in promoting openness in this field. This open landscape in English language education resources will be defined against the backdrop of an international English language teaching resources industry, which has long been dominated by big-brand proprietary publications. New pathways for engaging with Open Access publishers along with an exploration of new publishing models that are afforded by digital technologies and open licensing standards will also be presented. Insights from collaborations between OER developers and proprietary publishers for the release of copyrighted third party content in the development of OER will also be provided as a benchmark for relevant changes in educational publishing. Furthermore, a lens into the widening stakeholder vision for uses of open English language resources across a range of teaching and learning contexts in higher education, including formal and informal, online and face-to-face learning, will also be charted.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Three South Puget Sound Community College faculty collaborated to produce the Spanish and French first-year series for Phase 2 of Washington State&rsquo;s Open Course Library (OCL) project. This presentation focuses on two parts: first, the impact that having access to high-quality open resources had on the success of the development process; second, the cultural immersion projects that they put together as part of the course series. Both of these highlight the importance of high-quality OERs in moving toward an open education model.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />The French series had access to a high-quality, open-source textbook (Fran&ccedil;ais Interactif), while Spanish did not. Having a textbook had a significant impact on the course development process: the work of the French team largely consisted in indexing the textbook, while the Spanish team was tasked with scouring a multitude of OERs in search of material and ultimately creating content (Learning Activities, Assessments, etc). This presentation uses both teams&rsquo; experiences as a case study highlighting the central role that high-quality OERs play in the development of open educational resources.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />As part of this project, the French and Spanish teams collaborated to develop a series of cultural immersion projects using a variety of tools. The goals of the immersion projects are to encourage students to explore the contexts in which their target language is spoken; how language affects culture, and vice-versa; the impact colonialism has had on colonized and colonizing cultures; and finally (and perhaps most importantly), the projects are designed to help students recognize their own cultural lenses as well as their place in a globalized society.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The OERPub team is making it easy to create and edit OER and expanding the options for publishing and sharing content. Last year we created an importer that takes content from Word, Google Docs, and blogs and makes it remixable by unifying the formats. We then used simple software hooks to publish the content to repositories like Connexions.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />This year are adding an easy-to-use, open source document editor so that authors can create content from scratch or edit the content they imported. We are incorporating research-driven principles so that authors used to Word and Google Docs can still create beautiful remixable content. Rather than asking authors to learn complicated markup, we are using authors&rsquo; natural actions to provide just-in-time semantic choices and convenient templates for editing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />We are expanding the options for sharing OER (while still keeping it remixable) by making it possible to publish to institutional repositories like DSpace as well as other projects that provide structured publishing like Connexions, Siyavula, Booktype and Open University. The underlying editor is built collaboratively and intended for use by many projects.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />In this presentation we will unveil our new collaboratively created open-source editor for OER and show how it can be used to create, edit, and publish content to OER libraries. We will highlight the research principles that were used to guide the editing experience and also show how other projects have participated with us and how new projects can get involved and incorporate the editor and adapt it for their content. The talk will be mostly non-technical focusing on the how and why, with pointers to the technical meat for reference.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The increasing cost of higher education threatens to limit access to education for many students. One significant higher education cost is textbooks. In the last 30 years,textbook prices have risen almost four times the rate of inflation. Students pay an average of $1,168 per year on textbooks, and seven out of ten students report that they hadn&rsquo;t bought a required text due to cost.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />Reducing textbook costs could improve college access and affordability, while not impacting the resources of institutions of higher education.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />Open textbooks are textbooks licensed with a Creative Commons or similar open license. Open textbooks provide more affordable textbook options for students, and allow faculty to create more customized textbooks for their courses.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />Yet the faculty adoption of open textbooks is not yet widespread. To increase adoption, two main barriers must be overcome:<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />(1) Open textbooks are hard to find.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />Open textbooks are located in various locations on the Internet. Many are located in large online libraries of open education resources (OER). These libraries are comprehensive, including open textbooks, but also many, many other OERs. This abundance of resources can make it challenging for faculty to find full textbooks.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />(2) It&rsquo;s difficult to know which open textbooks are quality.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />Determining the quality of any educational resource can be challenging, and open textbooks are no different. Commercial textbook companies often capture and advertise recommendations from faculty when marketing a textbook, giving it credibility. But open textbook authors are often not as skilled or motivated to brag about the quality of their textbook.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />These barriers can be significantly addressed through the creation of an online, peer-reviewed open textbook catalog. This searchable catalog will contain only complete open textbooks, and include textbook reviews from faculty.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />Working with the national Student PIRG, the University of Minnesota&rsquo;s College of Education and Human Development (CEHD) has developed such a catalog.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />The online catalog is a first of its kind and has become a resource for finding quality open textbooks. It includes pointers to textbooks that are openly licensed complete textbooks. Faculty looking for an open textbook can read peer-reviews of texts and be directed to the texts themselves for their own evaluation. When a faculty member adopts a textbook from the catalog, students will have options to choose a free electronic version of the textbook, or purchase a low-cost print version (the majority of students prefer printed textbooks to electronic).<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.399999618530273px;" />This catalog has uniquely addressed the barriers of faculty adoption of open textbooks by providing a single place for faculty to find and determine the quality of open textbooks. In this presentation, we will report on the number of University of Minnesota faculty and students who have benefited from this catalog and describe the potential cost savings seen by students. In addition, we will report on metrics of use of the catalog by those outside the University of Minnesota.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Through the advent of OER and open access, the education arena is witnessing the rise of new models for supporting and recognizing learning for students and lifelong learners alike. From Open High School Utah, to P2PU, to MITx, to the numerous open badge systems under development&mdash;these models are blurring the boundaries between formal and informal learning, and making inroads into traditional pathways for certifying learning. This session will present an analysis of the historical trajectory of these alternative certification models&mdash;in terms of where they have been, where they are headed, and their impact (current and future) on formal education as an institution. The session will close with a facilitated discussion of the potential of these new models for supporting learning in innovative ways.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6544</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6544</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Panel: Jamie Caras, David Harris, Marc T. Sher</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Limited access to higher education is one the greatest challenges faced by students today. The recent economic slowdown coupled with the increasing costs of education has forced educational institutions of all levels to reevaluate the way they use their resources. As educators begin to explore ways to cut costs, they are beginning to discover that Open Educational Resources (OER) have the potential to not only drive down cost of education but also to increase its flexibility.&nbsp;<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" />However, significant barriers remain: procuring and organizing OER resources can be time consuming, quality standards are inconsistent, few OER platforms inter-operate, and local awareness of OER remains low in the broader education space.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" />This panel will overview the current &ldquo;chasm&rdquo; that OER has to cross in order to reach mainstream acceptance. The panel provides the unique perspectives of an OER publisher (David Harris, Editor-in-Chief Connexions and OpenStax College), a faculty member (Prof. Marc T. Sher of the College of William and Mary), and a for-profit education service provider (Dr. Jamie Caras, President of Sapling Learning). The panel will discuss the following questions:</p>
<ol style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->What is the awareness of OER on college campuses today?</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->What are the content/development requirements to achieve wide-scale adoption of OER?</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->How do OER advocates effectively reach the decision makers?</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->How can social media enable broader adoption of OER?</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->What new cooperative ecosystem is required for financial sustainability?</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->How do we develop common standards for OER?</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Can OER only compete when it&rsquo;s available anywhere, at any time, on any device?</li>
</ol>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" />A diverse array current OER examples will be introduced to demonstrate current attempts to cross the chasm, including OpenStax College (an initiative of Connexions), Flatworld Knowlege, The Orange Grove, OCWC, stacked credential efforts, and emerging referatories. The session will conclude with a strategy discussion on ideas to propel OER into the mainstream.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Massive Open Online Courses now enroll millions of students. MOOCs and their implications nearly toppled a president at a major research university last spring, and disruptions like these are sure to continue. Yet these extraordinary developments do not by themselves constitute success for open education. As we seek to move &ldquo;beyond content,&rdquo; there are principles we have not yet discovered or fully articulated, conceptual frameworks we must revisit, and challenges we must acknowledge and address. By synthesizing, or at least mashing up, Seymour Papert&rsquo;s &ldquo;yearning for megachange&rdquo; and Gregory Bateson&rsquo;s &ldquo;ecologies of mind,&rdquo; I will suggest some ways the open education movements might avoid reinforcing the worst models of computer-aided instruction, and instead lead the way toward deep, meaningful, and enduring educational reform.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Status, 26 September, CaPReT-GA, testing, performance - Track OER</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6494</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6494</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm a bit behind with my blogging and I have lot's to talk about, so let's dive in...</p>
<p>Way back on the 12 September I had two very useful meetings, including one with the wider Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> team/group. The response to our progress on the technical activities was positive. Some significant outcomes from the meetings were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we take the <a title="Cut and Paste Reuse Tracking" href="http://capret.mitoeit.org/">CaPReT</a>-Piwik work and extend it to <a title="Google Analytics" href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>? After some discussion we decided that this was my next high priority task.</li>
<li>A suggestion from <a class="@" rel="interwiki" href="https://twitter.com/guybarrett">Guy Barrett</a> regarding the [CaPReT-<abbr title="Microsoft Internet Explorer browser">MSIE</abbr> problem][cloud:6474] - can we put a HTML comment into the pasted content, to offer the user some help? <code>&lt;!--...--&gt;</code></li>
<li>Can we ensure that CaPReT/-Piwik/-<abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr> works with Drupal 6 - jQuery 1.3.2 (ie. an old version of the jQuery Javascript library)?</li>
<li>Can we ensure that the CaPReT Javascripts do not degrade the page load-times for OpenLearn, LabSpace and so on? (<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2007/05/10/performant-isn-t-a-word.aspx">Performant isn't a word</a>.. <a class="Define" rel="interwiki" href="http://google.com/search?q=define:performant">it is now</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I got stuck into Guy's suggestion straight away, and extended it to include a link to <a class="Toer" rel="interwiki" href="http://track.olnet.org/help/capret/ie">further sources of help</a>. You can see an <a class="Gdoc" rel="interwiki" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aGNOPFACD5KUbSPHELy9CVlrj2AJUzY18YJIZgJjrqI/edit">example of the comment in this Google Doc</a>.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to say that we have at least a partial solution for CaPReT-<abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr>. I've used <a class="Gdev" rel="interwiki" href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/eventTrackerGuide">Google Analytics event tracking</a>, with actions of 'copy' and 'view', the copied text as the event label, and the length of the copied text as the event value (for copy only). The copy action is fully tracked (source host and <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator,">URL</abbr>), but we haven't been able to get the destination host/<abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator,">URL</abbr>. This seems to be a limitation of Google Analytics. A CaPReT copy uses Javascript, while the tracker that is added to the copied text and used to track views of the pasted content is a no-Javascript web beacon (web bug). You may like to view an <a class="Toer" rel="interwiki" href="http://track.olnet.org/test/capret/math/course-ga">example of CaPReT-GA</a> - and try copying.</p>
<p>We've done some work on performance too, using Google's <a href="http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home">online Closure Compiler</a> to [compress the CaPReT Javascripts][Toer:build/capret]. If you wish to add a version of jQuery and change "whitespace-only" to "simple optimizations", <a class="Toer" rel="interwiki" href="http://track.olnet.org/build/capret/simple/1.8.0">try this build script</a>. The <a class="Toer" rel="interwiki" href="http://track.olnet.org/capret/build/capret-ga.min.js">minified CaPReT-GA Javascript is here</a></p>
<p>The third round of technical testing was put back a week, but I'm happy to say that Roger Moore and Mick Deal have shown great flexibility. Testing is underway this week, <a class="Gdoc" rel="interwiki" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-NUFoxRB2U2xha1TvHC5D25ZYTUPwIv5EDFLf9dVN5M/edit">using this test script</a>. It concentrates on <abbr title="Bridge to Success project">B2S</abbr> testing with campaign tracking, CaPReT-<abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr> testing, and a new strand C, testing the <a class="Toer" rel="interwiki" href="http://track.olnet.org/oerform?edge=1">OER Form service and bookmarklet</a>. I haven't talked much about this last point, but I'll leave that for a future post.</p>
<p>Nick, signing off. Over and out..</p>]]></description>

              <title>CaPReT, Javascript clipboard and Internet Explorer</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6474</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6474</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The big headline from technical testing of CaPReT, was that <a title="Thanks to Mick Deal/LTS Tech. Testing" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ci8U920B6DgydrBZZvYZxtvOTw_OpH1AnCX61-OWjpA/edit">copy and paste doesn't work as expected in Internet Explorer (versions 6 - 9)</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, in other browsers you can copy from a CaPReT Javascript-enabled page, and simply paste into an online rich-editor (we tested on live Cloudworks, which uses Tiny MCE).  This pastes the text with formatting, with the Piwik web-beacon image and attribution/license meta-data from the source page's <a title="Resource Description Framework - in attributes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">license RDFa</a> appended.</p>
<p>My apologies in advance for the technical complexities I detail below. I thought it best to record what we've found before we forget!</p>
<p>In Internet Explorer, when you try to do a simple paste it pastes the source HTML markup, escaped - so you see "&lt;a href="..."&gt;..&lt;/a&gt;..</p>
<p>Obviously this workaround is not elegant, so I've been looking at a better solution.  The crux of the issue is the way that CaPReT hooks into the Javascript "copy" event using <a href="https://github.com/niklasvh/jquery.plugin.clipboard">Niklas von Hertzen's jquery.plugin.clipboard Javascript</a>.</p>
<p>The Internet Explorer branch of this plugin's logic uses clipboardData.setData, which supports copying as "Text" or "URL" (no "HTML" value available).  When the user pastes the destination rich-editor handles the clipboard data as text, escaping and revealinfg the markup.  The plugin's logic for the other browsers manipulates the <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/range_intro.html">W3C Range</a> that is to be copied,  then hands over to the browser to actually perform the copy (that is, it doesn't prevent the default action).  So, when the clipboard data is pasted it is recognized as rich-text/HTML and works accordingly.</p>
<p>I've been exploring solutions using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ierange/">Tim Cameron Ryan's 2009 ierange Javascript</a>, and re-working von Hertzen's clipboard plugin.  So far unfortunately, I've been unsuccessful. ierange.js provides a shim for Internet Explorer, implementing the  <a href="http://w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Traversal-Range/">W3C Range specification (Version 1.0/ 2000)</a> and DOM Selection.  Manipulating ranges is a complex business and I haven't yet determined if the bugs are in ierange.js or my re-worked clipboard2 plugin.</p>
<p>I need to check priorities with my colleagues, but I am tempted to abandon the ierange/jquery.clipboard2 based solution for the moment, as it could become a big time-sink.</p>
<p>The work has not been in vain however, as I have a much better understanding of how Javascript interacts with the clipboard, and I've  <a href="https://github.com/tatemae/capret/issues/9">fixed a number of bugs</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/trackoer-core/blob/master/application/assets/capret/js/jquery.plugin.clipboard.js">fork of von Hertzen's jQuery Clipboard plugin used by CaPReT</a>.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The 'map my programme' tool employs a set of free google apps to graphically display all the hand-in dates for each course /unit/module and display, in real time, the types of assessment used across a programme and the effect of that assessment has on the learning journey of the students at any one point as well as the marking load for the academic. It can also be used to see if there is duplication of effort, or synergy bewteen courses. Core to this process are the dates when formative and summative assessments are set and subsequently submitted – students do not want to have a bunching of coursework and staff need to manage their workload! You can download guidance materials and request a trial at: http://www.mapmyprogramme.com/</p>
<p>There is no charge for using this tool but you will need a google account. </p>]]></description>

              <title>Track OER - status, 29 August: looking back, looking forward..</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6449</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6449</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>We prepared for the first round of testing, with LTS Technical Testing team at The Open University. This involved writing <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hqqm1Rhmsi3SaWwMJ1mRE5gyyIdfFdxqM3D2LKxsYOc/edit">an initial test script</a>. And, significantly we relied on the <a href="http://capret.mitoeit.org">CaPReT evaluation server</a>, which does not have guaranteed up-time or support. So, we took a copy of the CaPReT Javascripts, and extended them to work with Piwik (capret-piwik.js).</p>
<p>Testing proceeded on schedule last week, and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ci8U920B6DgydrBZZvYZxtvOTw_OpH1AnCX61-OWjpA/edit">results are online</a>.</p>
<p>We also worked to separate the 'AlternateImage' Piwik plugin in to it's own project repository, and added two more Piwik plugins - 'ExternalLink' (a utility), and 'ContentReuse'. The growing <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6442">list of outputs is in the register</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I finished the command line batch processor. This is our initial solution to add license-tracker code into the HTML pages in the various Zip archives that can be downloaded from LabSpace. We are looking at XSLT solutions going forward, but this has enabled us to proceed with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIWRsGFQf4CmiPoHl3BMubz3w6TMiFN_oQbnuSKtQA0/edit">second round of testing this week</a>.</p>
<p>This week and next I'll be working on improving the Google Analytics Javascript to work on work on a local machine (the "file://" protocol). And looking at no-Javascript Google Analytics..</p>
<p>Last week:</p>
<ul>
<li> 20 August, trackoer-ga.js </li>
<li> 20,23,24,28 August, initial command line/CLI controller/ batch processor, </li>
<li> 21 August, setting up technical testing round 1, </li>
<li> 21 August, adding CaPReT test view(s) to trackoer-core based on LabSpace, </li>
<li> 21-22 August, capret-piwik.js </li>
<li> 23 August, Piwik 'ExternalLink' utility plugin </li>
<li> 24 August, separated Piwik plugins (now three) into separate Git repos. - set up .gitmodules/ sub-modules (git clone --recursive..) </li>
<li> 24-26 (Tuesday 28) August, Oercommons_serv </li>
<li> 28 August gajs.js </li>
</ul>
<p>Looking forward:</p>
<ul>
<li> Google Analytics solution for use on local machine ("file://" protocol) - looking at gajs.js - Remy Sharp, </li>
<li> Google Analytics no-Javascript solution, </li>
<li> Build script for CaPReT-Piwik Javascripts etc. </li>
<li> Bug fixes from weeks 1 and 2 of testing, </li>
<li> Prepare for 3rd round of testing, week of 17 September, </li>
<li> Complete OER Commons functionality. </li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <title>Privacy, EU cookie law and tracking OERs</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6436</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6436</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, and these are my personal views.</p>
<p>A week ago a colleague of mine highlighted a thorny issue related to tracking the re-use of OERs - balancing the privacy of end-users against the need for analytics by OER publishers. His concerns were specifically around the new <a href="http://ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies.aspx">EU cookie law (e-Privacy Directive)</a>.</p>
<p>To quote, "tracking images probably breach the new European law on cookies and other tracking devices". My response was, I think Track OER risks breaching the new law, <strong>unless</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We make it clear to &lsquo;content-producers&rsquo; that they are adopting a service with tracking/using license code snippets that incorporate tracking &ndash; probably we should try to indemnify ourselves in our T&amp;C (is that the correct term?) </li>
<li>The &lsquo;content-producers&rsquo; (including the OU) make it clear to end-users that they are viewing/consuming OERs containing a tracking code &ndash; many/most of the sites that may re-use OERs will already incorporate analytics for their own purposes, so I hope this will not be too big a deal, </li>
<li>Looking at the code bottom-right here - http://creativecommons.org/choose/ - we may need some wording like &ldquo;This work is licensed under a Creative Commons &hellip; License, with tracking.&rdquo; &ndash; where &ldquo;tracking&rdquo; is a link to a page explaining why and what we are tracking, </li>
<li>We/ content-producers may need to provide mechanism(s) so end users can opt out. </li>
</ul>
<p>I made a few further points:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve always considered this part of the &ldquo;Quid pro quo&rdquo; &ndash; we (HE institutions) provide OER content under permissive licenses for use and re-use. In return, we need to find out by some means how they are being used, so that we can provide results to our funders, continue to invest in OER production, make new business cases to funders, our institutions, etc. Yes, OER is good marketing for us, but it costs us. </li>
<li>If the above point is valid, we need to explain it, There probably needs to be a cultural/legal shift/ change of wording etc., </li>
<li>It adds to the complexity of what we&rsquo;re doing! </li>
<li>It may reduce the adoption of the technology/technique, </li>
<li>OU (OUICE) pages now have a &lsquo;Privacy and cookies&rsquo; link - <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">www.open.ac.uk</a> | <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/privacy">open.ac.uk/privacy</a> - we need this for starters, </li>
<li>We&rsquo;re collecting anonymous (or semi-anonymous) data, and probably going to <a href="http://track.olnet.org/piwik/">display it publicly</a> - what are the implications? </li>
</ul>
<p>Then, while exploring the administrative interface for Piwik I came across the "Do Not Track" feature (<a href="http://donottrack.us/">http://donottrack.us</a>). The end-user configures their browser to send a DNT header when it requests a Web page (a HTTP header is some meta-data about the request or response, normally invisible to the end-user). The Web-server reads the DNT header, and doesn't record or track the user's visit. Do Not Track is available in most recent browsers, including Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 12, Safari and Opera. And critically, Microsoft plan to <a href="http://cookielaw.org/blog/2012/8/9/do-not-track,-the-cookie-law-and-ie10.aspx">turn it on by default in IE 10</a>. A number of big players like Microsoft, Yahoo and some advertising networks are adding support to their servers.</p>
<p>And the great news is that <a href="http://piwik.org/privacy/#toc-step-4-respect-donottrack-preference">Piwik supports Do Not Track</a> out of the box.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Stipple and its potential usefulness for tracking OER</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6434</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6434</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Stipple is a&nbsp;a platform which facilitates the tagging of products and people in images. &nbsp;Both services use embedded javascript to track images as they are copied and distributed across the internet. &nbsp;The main technical difference between Stipple and TrackOER is to do with where the relevant javascript is located. &nbsp;Stiple is enabled by website publishers at the site level. &nbsp;If the code is installed then images can be tagged and these tags persist and are transferred over to other users.</p>
<p>Stipple conveys richer data than TrackOER as people are encouraged to add 'information and stories' to images. &nbsp;It does this through linking to 3rd party APIs: &nbsp;YouTube, Twitter, Soundcloud, Google Maps, etc. but you can also enter content directly or just add links. &nbsp;TrackOER simply registers when a resource has been re-used in some way (though we can get a lot of data from this alone).</p>
<p>Here's what Wikipedia has to say about their business model: "&nbsp;Stipple Pipeline allows brands to tag their products in photos uploaded to Stipple. Through Stipple Network,&nbsp;the photos are open to use by website publishers, who are paid by companies with products in the photos.&nbsp;Consumers can then click on the products tagged and buy them.&nbsp;As of May 2011, Stipple had contracts with nine photo agencies, 50 brands, and 1,300 publishers<sup id="cite_ref-Gannes_5-0" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->"</sup></p>
<p>Stipple could be seen as doing the inverse of TrackOER. &nbsp;Both are tracking the spread of resources across the web, but whereas TrackOER aims at improving OER, Stipple use the same analytics for targeted marketing and delivering advertising through images. &nbsp;Image tags are used like Adsense keywords to target advertising.</p>
<p>Stipple offers two kinds of analysis: &nbsp;how far (geographically) content has reached, and; the level of audience engagement (clickthrough, 'like', re-tweet).</p>
<p>They claim "Stipple makes sure your images are attributed to you and link back to you wherever they go. When you claim an image, your information and tags travel the web with it". &nbsp;It seems to me that using Stipple to track OER across the web in the same way as the TrackOER script is perfectly feasible. &nbsp;It might even be easy. &nbsp;You could get richer analytics as well as access to promotional tools. &nbsp;The links through to social media are also quite well done. &nbsp;However, you might not be able to get the analytics that you want.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Track OER - midweek status, 16 August</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6433</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6433</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h3>Subtitle: To script or not to script...</h3>
<p>At the end of last week and the start of this week I focussed on integrating a Piwik no-Javascript web beacon (web bug) with the  HTML-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa#Examples_of_RDFa"><abbr title="Resource Description Framework – in – attributes">RDFa</abbr></a> snippet produced by the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose">Creative Commons choose-license form</a>.</p>
<p>This resulted in an initial <a href="http://track.olnet.org/oerform">OER license-tracker</a>, which currently supports OpenLearn-LearningSpace and LabSpace URLs. It makes requests over the Web for <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk/Learning_to_Learn_1.0?format=rdf">RDF files from OpenLearn</a>, and queries the Piwik API.</p>
<p>There is also an <a href="http://oembed.com/">oEmbed-API</a> interface to the OER form - to help with automation and batch processing. It is linked to from the <a title="Alternative formats.. oEmbed" href="http://track.olnet.org/oerform?url=http://labspace.open.ac.uk/Learning_to_Learn_1.0#alt">OER form (#alt)</a>.</p>
<p>Note, there is the potential to extend the OER license-tracker form to, for example, support <a href="http://oercommons.org/courses/17-042-citizenship-and-pluralism-fall-2003">OER Commons URLs</a> as input, with the resulting license-tracker snippet referencing the source URL at <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT</a> for example.</p>
<p>However, by the middle of the week, we turned our attention to the other strand of the project - <a href="http://capret.mitoeit.org/">CaPReT: Cut and Paste Reuse Tracking</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/guydbarrett">Guy Barrett</a> and I worked yesterday to add the CaPReT Javascript to a Moodle side-block on the OpenLearn-Labspace test server (behind our firewall). Moodle didn't remove the scripts from the sticky block (yay!) and we're almost ready for our first round of technical testing next week.</p>
<p>Guy is proving to be a great resource to review ideas, and he pointed out very reasonably that many downloadable OER archives (plain Zip, SCORM etc.) <a title="Learning to Learn downloads, from OpenLearn-LabSpace/B2S" href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk/blocks/formats/download_unit.php?id=7442">provided by OpenLearn</a>, MIT (I checked!) and others contain Javascripts. (It should be noted that the RSS feeds provided by OpenLearn don't link to Javascripts.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the emphasis of the Track OER project on no-Javascript tracking may be mis-placed. Using custom Google Analytics Javascript contained in the downloadable packages would remove the probable reliance on <a href="http://track.olnet.org/">Track.olnet.org</a> - a long-term support concern in making the Track OER tools production-ready. (Remember, Track.olnet.org does dynamic server-side processing of the web-beacon request, specific to re-used/ re-hosted OERs, before redirecting to the Piwik web-beacon.)</p>
<p>So, I got busy yesterday and put together a <a href="http://track.olnet.org/test/b2s_learn_gajs">first prototype for a custom Google Analytics Javascript</a> solution. You will need to 'View source' (and/or use Firebug) in your browser to see what is happening...</p>
<p>Which leads to my question - "To script, or not to script...?"</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>We'll be documenting the various challenges we're experiencing, and the <a href="#lessons">lessons learnt</a>.</p>
<h2>Re-purposing analytics software (Google Analytics, Piwik)</h2>
<p>Problem type:  technical/ user-interface</p>
<p>Problem:  Analytics tools are conventionally used in scenarios where the person viewing the reports knows the <abbr title="Uniform resource locator,">URL</abbr> where the pages reside. In trying to track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> re-use, we present a different scenario where the destination <abbr title="Uniform resource locator,">URL</abbr> is unknown (and the server component is variable).</p>
<p>Solutions:  For Piwik, creative use of the '<code>url</code>' and '<code>urlref</code>' parameters in the <a title="Piwik tracking interface documentation" href="http://piwik.org/docs/tracking-api/reference/">tracking <abbr title="Application programming interface,">API</abbr></a>. For Google Analytics, creating and documenting custom reports, which reveal for example the destination 'hostname' (not reported by default).</p>
<h2>Acommodating the OpenLearn test and release cycle</h2>
<p>Problem type: technical/ management</p>
<p>Problem:  We are demonstrating the Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> technologies on OpenLearn-LabSpace, and this needs some technical changes to LabSpace, which need testing before deployment.</p>
<p>Solution:  Schedule testing early, plan, liase with OpenLearn colleagues.</p>
<h2>Lessons learnt &ndash; short intense projects can be productive</h2>
<p><em>"towards of the end of the project, a list of lessons that someone like you would find useful"</em></p>
<p>Like many development teams we are currently very busy, so we planned the development for Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> as a classic <em>"short intense"</em> project (aka, short fat project) (<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6KXOxHIQEwIC&pg=PA28&dq=short+intense+project+management">KENDRICK, Tom. (2011). 11. How should I manage short, complex, dynamic projects?. In: - <em>101 Project Management Problems and How to Solve Them: Practical Advice for &hellip;</em> -: Amacom. p28.</a>). Having a developer working at nearly 100% on the project in a relatively short burst (first commit 8 or 9 August &ndash; development tailing off in the third week of September 2012) (<a title="Project activity graph on Github" href="https://github.com/IET-OU/trackoer-core/graphs/commit-activity">Project activity graph on Github</a>) proved to be effective. So one of my big lessons learnt is that scheduling a short intense project, with planning and preparation beforehand, can be a good idea.</p>

              <title>Track OER - status report, 14 August</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6430</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I'll be discussing some topics in more detail, but I thought it would be usful to give a brief run down of what we've been up to and what we'll be doing in the next week...</p>
<p>At the start of last week I forked Piwik and worked on the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6426">AlternateImage plugin</a>. I've already had some  <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/piwik-trackoer/issues/4">feedback on that work</a>, which is great.</p>
<p>In the middle of last week I was experimenting with the no-Javascript image-tracker based around Piwik, and I started on  <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/trackoer-core/">Track OER core</a>, which is a CodeIgniter-based web application. It provides short/clean-URL redirection to  the Piwik (<a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/trackoer-core/blob/master/application/libraries/trackers/Piwik_Tracker.php">Piwik_Tracker class</a>)  and Google Analytics (to do) web-beacons, some test and demonstration pages, form-tools (more on that later), and links to Piwik, the project blog and so on.</p>
<p>We were also configuring Piwik and trackoer-core on our demonstration server, and by the end of the last week, with the help of our <a href="http://www8.open.ac.uk/iet/main/core-services">IET-SST colleagues</a> (thanks Phil and Dave) and central IT, we had <a href="http://track.olnet.org/">Track.olnet.org</a> publicly visible.</p>
<p>My plans for the next few days are to blog about the project in relation to external APIs, and privacy. I'll be improving the current Piwik-based license-tracker snippet, and pressing on with the Google Analytics-based one. Oh, and testing, testing...</p>
<p>I alluded to the short/clean-URL redirection provided by trackoer-core above. Although I believe this is useful, the other key role of the redirector can be summed up by the comment and code on <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/trackoer-core/blob/master/application/libraries/trackers/Piwik_Tracker.php#L45">lines 45-6 of Piwik_Tracker.php</a>,  <em>"For the no-Javascript web-bug image, the OER's destination URL is the referrer."</em>&nbsp; This highlights one of the key challenges of this project - re-purposing tools like Piwik and Google Analytics from a scenario where the person viewing the  reports knows the URL where the pages reside, to an OER-reuse scenario where the destination URL is unknown (and the server component is variable).</p>
<p>(Note, please excuse the indentation/white-space inconsistency in the trackoer-core source files - I'll fix this over time.)</p>]]></description>

              <title>Extending Piwik for Track OER</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6426</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6426</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>A software component that we had in mind for the Track OER project from early on is Piwik.  <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a> is an open-source Web analytics tool, that offers similar features to Google Analytics,  in terms of logging page views, and outputting reports.</p>
<p>It offers a number of advantages over competitors:</p>
<ul>
<li> You host Piwik yourself, so it can be easier to debug problems, particularly for our no-Javascript work, </li>
<li> You also have more control over access to the analytics reports on the site, </li>
<li> Piwik has an extensive plugin interface, widgets, and an API to access data over the Web, </li>
<li> There is good documentation, and a wide community, </li>
</ul>
<p>To date I've found it quite simple to install and customize.  There are a number of considerations,</p>
<ul>
<li> As Piwik is self-hosted it needs to be installed on a robust server, with similar uptime/support to your other production servers  (if it goes down, you risk users seeing a broken image), </li>
<li> There may be issues around the new EU cookie laws -  many sites use Google Analytics, so adding another system to the mix may cause confusion and concern, </li>
</ul>
<p>Against this last point, I would say that precisely because Google Analytics is so prevalent, with Google able track journeys between sites and sell advertising, adopting something like Piwik may be seen as an advantage by some end-users.</p>
<h3>Web bug</h3>
<p>At the heart of most analytics systems, including Google Analytics and Piwik, and with/without Javascript, is a one-pixel hidden GIF image. This so-called Web beacon (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug">Web bug</a>) is hosted by the analytics server, and is used to record a user's visits.  (The Javascript provided by most analytics tools are merely wrappers around this web-bug, to add extra parameters like screen-resolution and browser capabilities among other things.)</p>
<p>One aim of the Track OER project is to explore the use of a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/">Creative Commons License</a> image in place of the hidden GIF.</p>
<h3>AlternateImage plugin</h3>
<p>So, to that end, we have <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/piwik-trackoer">forked Piwik</a> (<a href="https://github.com/piwik/piwik/network">network</a>), and created a plugin named  <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/piwik-trackoer/tree/trackoer/plugins/AlternateImage">AlternateImage</a>. This adds an extra parameter named <code>img</code> to the <a href="http://piwik.org/docs/tracking-api/reference/">Piwik tracking API</a>, which is used to specify the image to display. The value takes the form <code>cc:{license}</code>, for example <code>cc:by-nc-sa</code>.</p>
<p>A standard Piwik no-Javascript tracking call takes the form,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Piwik Image Tracker --&gt;
&lt;img style="border:0" src="http://demo.piwik.org/piwik.php?idsite={$IDSITE}&amp;rec=1" alt="" /&gt;
&lt;!-- End Piwik --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extended tracking call looks like this,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Piwik Image Tracker --&gt;
&lt;img style="border: 0;" src="http://demo.piwik.org/piwik.php?idsite={$IDSITE}&amp;rec=1&amp;img=cc:by-nc-sa" alt="" /&gt;
&lt;!-- End Piwik --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AlternateImage plugin currently contains the larger 88 x 31 pixels PNG images. In time it will be extended with the compact Creative Commons License images,  with the parameter taking the form <code>?img=cc:by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/80x15</code> (URL encoded, naturally).  As an aside, the value for <code>img</code> is a form of <a href="http://w3.org/TR/curie">Compact URI</a>. So AlternateImage can be extended for other logos and icons.</p>
<p>You will be able to see Piwik and the AlternateImage plugin in use soon.</p>
<p>I've also found a very useful PHP library called <a href="https://github.com/wingdspur/codeigniter-piwik/">codeigniter-piwik</a>, and developed by Bryce Johnston (wingdspur).</p>]]></description>

              <title>Track OER in a nutshell</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6392</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6392</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The Track OER project is funded as part of the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/ukoer3/rapidinnovation.aspx">Rapid Innovation strand of the UKOER</a> programme by the Higher Education Academy (HEA) and the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC).</p>
<p>The aim of Track OER is to develop and demonstrate software and techniques that can give quantitative data for the use and reuse of open educational resources. Currently, little data of this type exists. When an OER is taken from its host or origin server, in order to be used and reused the origin institution and the community generally lose track of it.</p>
<p class="figure"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edtechie/4745363421/"><img title="Day #23 - Chatting with the Nessman by edtechie99, on Flickr" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4745363421_00c18f2ca3.jpg" border="0" alt="Day #23 - Chatting with the Nessman by edtechie99, on Flickr" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>The project contains two strands to address this problem. The first strand is the development of an easy to use no-Javascript web-bug. A web-bug is the 1 pixel transparent image that when included in a web page can be used to log its usage. While most analytics systems like <a href="http://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a> and the open-source <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a> wrap the web-bug in a Javascript library for ease of use and extended data-logging, a no-Javascript web-bug utilizes the image alone.</p>
<p>We will base our work on code developed in collaboration with Scott Leslie of BCcampus as part of the OLnet project (<a href="http://www.olnet.org/node/149">olnet.org/node/149</a> | <a href="http://snipplr.com/view/37647">snipplr.com/view/37647</a>). The existing code will be comprehensively re-worked to provide a working service linked to one or more analytics systems such as Piwik.</p>
<p class="figure"><a href="http://mashe.hawksey.info/2012/01/oer-visualisation-visualising-caprt-oer-tracking-data-day-32-ukoer/"><img title="CaPReT 'timemap' mashup by Martin Hawksey.

<p>The second strand is based on CaPReT - cut and paste reuse tracking. CaPReT has been developed by &nbsp;MIT and Tatemae (<a href="http://capret.mitoeit.org/">capret.mitoeit.org</a> &amp; <a href="http://github.com/tatemae/capret">github.com/tatemae/capret</a>) to track the informal use of OERs. It is an innovative and promising tool that is currently limited to text resources. Our work will seek to extend CaPReT to log the copying of image and multimedia resources.</p>
<p>Both these strands will be piloted on <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk/">OpenLearn-Labspace</a> and initially on the <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk/b2s">Bridge to Success OER modules</a>.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Mainstreaming grass roots innovation in open educational practice: benefits and challenges</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6348</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6348</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Process.arts, a grass roots web2.0 open educational environment for  sharing day-to-day arts practice and research of staff and students,  currently provides a new &lsquo;open learning&rsquo; space to the University of the  Arts London (UAL) that straddles the institution/educational (formal  learning) environment and the social (informal learning) environment.&nbsp;  It creates an &lsquo;experimental&rsquo; space for open educational practitioners to  develop and define a new language for open edu-social practice without  conforming or being influenced by pre-existing academic structures and  processes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The transition of process.arts into an official UAL service  will test this model and raise questions as to how institutions  successfully support and develop autonomous and independent grassroots  innovation without homogenising innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Chris Follows initially developed Process.arts in 2008 with the  support of UAL&rsquo;s Centre for Learning and Teaching in Art and Design  (CLTAD). Chris was awarded a secondment and fellowship to develop his  ideas for creating an open educational web environment for arts staff  and students to share and cluster rich media content and resources.  Process.arts has been maintained and developed by Chris as a sustainable  and independent system, through agile experimentation, small project  support, voluntary support, stewardship and an open university SCORE  fellowship project.</p>
<p>In 2012 UAL began the process of rebuilding its VLE framework, and  process.arts was identified as a valuable resource that could fit into  the University&rsquo;s new portfolio of tools; consequently, process.arts is  due to be officially introduced as a supported &lsquo;service&rsquo; in September  2012.</p>
<p>However, the structure of process.arts does not map onto courses;  meta data links user-generated pieces of openly licensed text, image,  video and audio content together through individual profiles and subject  specific interest groups. &nbsp;Like many web2.0 environments used for  education, process.arts can neither really be described as a repository  nor as a VLE. Because of this it provides a novel and alternative VLE  environment that encourages and supports rich media experimentation and  informal learning, a welcome alternative for many to commercial  alternatives. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Conversion to a full service will provide a firm foundation for long  term stability, integration wth other systems, support and growth. &nbsp;The  project team is in the process of integrating the current informal agile  development approach into a more formal in-house system.&nbsp; The team are  addressing outstanding bugs, monitoring user interface changes and  identifying outstanding functionality. There will inevitably be some  loss of &nbsp;agile spontaneity although we aim to retain the overall grass  roots participatory feel.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <title>The Changes and Challenges of Open Practice in the UK (panel discussion)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6231</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6231</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Panel: Craig Mahoney (Higher Education Academy); David Mossley (Higher Education Academy); Jonathan Darby (SCORE); Megan Quentin Baster (University of Newcastle Upon Tyne)</p>
<p>CM: This is a turbulent time for education, but also a creative time with enormous opportunity. &nbsp;We need to rethink and repurpose the didactic model of higher education which is prevalent in UK universities. &nbsp;OER is going to be a part of this. &nbsp;But we need policy leadership in universities, who are often unaware of how OER can be used and promoted. &nbsp;There are examples of good practice, but they tend to be isolated and sometimes unsupported. &nbsp;We need to rethink the way we make use of resources in constructive and critical ways if we are to encourage lifelong learners. &nbsp;The Open University is the leader in the UK: &nbsp;all the others are playing catch up.</p>
<p>DM: The HEA has produced a number of resources for senior mangers and policymakers, including a toolkit (http://bit.ly/H5NEf5). &nbsp;The approach of the programme has been diverse and student-focused (including an NUS survey). &nbsp;Iniital results suggest that students respect academic who share. &nbsp;The future is about enriching the student learning experience by going beyond the point of contact.</p>
<p>JD: The OU has changed the way it communicates and educates, sharing content in new ways (including 40 million downloads on iTunesU). &nbsp;The OU has been a 'giver' rather than a sharer, historically speaking. &nbsp;Now, when new courses are created in a structured way it makes it easier for OERs to be created: &nbsp;sharing is embedded into the process. &nbsp;The OU is also thinking seriously about incorporating OER into course delivery rather than creating everything from scratch, though progress could be made in this area. &nbsp;One area where OER has made a difference in OpenLearn, which uses OER to attrach potential students at a 75% saving on recruitment cost.</p>
<p>MQB: Academics and institutions are worried about legal implications of being open. &nbsp;Attribution is particularly tough with teaching materials. &nbsp;Publishers are interested in working with HE institutions to be open, but in practice little has been delivered. &nbsp;Negotiations can also be slow, meaning that academics often just act without securing legal permissions. &nbsp;We need risk management tools and effective policies for the ways we reuse and remix content. &nbsp;Furthermore, the publishing model is changing, with power shifting to resellers like Amazon.</p>
<p>Jackie Coulter (JORUM) asked about policy leadership and lessons learned. &nbsp;CM said that there is a lack of convergence between political and institutional drivers which threatens the future sustainability of the sector as a whole. &nbsp;JC responded by saying that we need to be better about collecting evidence about the successes and importance of using OER. &nbsp;JD said that policy should be about removing barriers to being open, not about directing others. &nbsp;(Tacitly, this suggests that openness is a default behaviour which takes over once barriers are removed.)</p>
<p>Antonio Mart&iacute;nez-Arboleda&nbsp;Leeds&nbsp;University and&nbsp;SCORE) asked about the Research Excellence Framework (REF) which does not seem to make provision for OER. &nbsp;MQB said that she had raised this with REF panels, who said that they already had their work cut out and wouldn't be considering teaching materials at this time. &nbsp;But activities surrounding enhancement might use open licensing in the future. &nbsp;More importantly, authors need to start expressing a strong preference for being open in order to bring about change in research-led organizations.</p>
<p>The discussion went on to cover the possible role of top-down leadership (e.g. the Bologna process). &nbsp;There was a suggestion that we need both top-down and bottom-up processes with policies that are not overly prescriptive, but can be endorsed by leaders.</p>
<p>MQB mentioned the way that institutions like the Wellcome Trust are moving to open access models, showing how change might come from open research rather than OER. &nbsp;Judith Murray (Thompson University) wondered whether there are policy tools that could enable other types of open activities. &nbsp;Cable Green (Creative Commons) noted that OER should be understood as having&nbsp;no cost at the point of &nbsp;access and affording thelegal rights to make modifications. &nbsp;He reiterated the basic policy principle that any publicly funded resources should be openly available resources, a principle which he hopes will be endorsed at the forthcoming UNESCO meeting in Paris.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6230</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6230</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Eko's keynote presentation ahs been brought forward from day 3 because the original speaker is unwell.<br /><br />Universities in Indonesia are distributed unequally, meaning that opportunities are also distributed unequally. &nbsp;This is at least partly down to it being an archipelago; in smaller islands, fewer people are educated. &nbsp;There are also not enough professors and experts available to teach. &nbsp;Only 0.5% of universities are in the top category (world-class). Almost a third fail to meet minimum standards.</p>
<p>A new paradigm is emerging in learning, one that makes good use of information technologies. &nbsp;The proposed solution, based on 5C (competition, collaboration, compliance, comprehensive, coordination) principles:</p>
<p>* increase access</p>
<p>* share resources</p>
<p>* promote and enforce collaboration</p>
<p>* utilise technology</p>
<p>* institutionalise open educatyion as a national initiative</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Indonesian government has been buying (K12) IP and making it available on a general basis. &nbsp;Open architectures are also being developed. &nbsp;Universities remain responsible for their own innovation and assessment. &nbsp;350 institutions are involved in research to uncover issues that are thrown up: people, process, content and tools.</p>
<p>Infrastructures in almost all universities are linked to a central IT service which avoids connectivity problems. &nbsp;However, investment, policies and incentives are lagging behind. &nbsp;Similarly, many professors lack IT skills, despite the fact that Web 2.0 is already integrated into Indonesian culture. &nbsp;SImilarly, many show a reluctance to share content, even though much of it is already digital. &nbsp;(Indonesia is moving towards measuring academic impact rhrough Google presence rather than other metrics.)</p>
<p>Indonesian culture relies on governmental decree as a driver for change, so there is a need for government to show leadership in this area. &nbsp;A roadshow travels the country to stimulate change in attitudes among faculty and students, encouraging them to be more open in teaching, learning and management.</p>
<p>Benefits include improving access and quality of education by making better use of resources. &nbsp;But Indonesia needs help in terms of developing open courses, collaborating in teaching and research, methods for transferring accreditation and earning study credits abroad, sharing learning resources and scholars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eko finished by sharing the way in which he learned English by listening to records (uncluding The Beatles) which his grandmother had given him... inventive use of a record as an OER?</p>
<p>In the Q&amp;A Eko said that 20% of Indonesian expenditure is ring-fenced for education, with 25% of that going to higher education and the remainder going to primary and secondary education.</p>]]></description>

<p>Chris Follows, University  of the arts London 2011</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction </strong></p>
<p>A significant and over arcing connection across all of my practice is  an interest in exploring the development and integration 'Open  Educational Practice' (OEP) and Open Educational Resources (OERs) in art  and design learning and teaching. The following action research  intervention took place at Wimbledon School of Foundation 25 February to  April 14 (2011). At the beginning of the final term I introduced a  'Wimbledon Foundation Video and Animation Final Projects' blog to a  specific cohort of video and animation students and staff at Wimbledon  school of Foundation: <a href="http://wimbledonfoundationvideoanimationfinalprojects.myblog.arts.ac.uk/">http://wimbledonfoundationvideoanimationfinalprojects.myblog.arts.ac.uk/</a>.</p>
<p>Although I have had lots of experience of using web environments for  supporting students (publishing resources) this has been primarily video  and image tutorials for demonstrating technical 'intro' or 'how to'  resources. I have never had experience of applying online technologies  to directly support the development of academic practice within a  specific cohort of students.</p>
<p>The learning and teaching problem I identified'. The intervention  involved art and design foundation students, specifically those who  specialise in fine art time-based media including animation, video,  performance, sound and interactive media.</p>
<p>Students who work with video and animation tend not to work in the  formal arts studio environment and over time can become 'less visible'  to staff and their peers. Video and animation students sometimes work at  home or out on location, when at college they mostly work in dark out  of the way animation spaces and in digital media editing suites. Video  and animation students tend to lose out on studio onsite peer support.</p>
<p>The primarily point of support in the media studios are technical  staff, only on occasion would a personal tutor visit the media suite. If  and when a student manages to secure a tutorial with their tutor, the  media suite can be full and their editing workstation busy, so tutorials  are often held in painting studios, with no or little time to review  digital footage, providing constructive feedback and productive support  in this environment difficult at best.</p>
<p>I've been reflecting on ways to provide better feedback and how my  feedback to students corresponds with that of the personal tutors  feedback and visa versa. Lack of communication between technicians,  academics and the students, regarding student progress and development  can result in staff having little clear understanding or overview of the  students learning journey. An extreme example of this happened last  year during the final assessment period. A tutor had not realised how  much preparatory work one particular student had completed, as it was  not clearly visible in her portfolio due to it being TBM work. I  subsequently tried to gather together this student's work on various  computers and the tutor sat and looked through the work. The tutor was  shocked that he could have marked this student without seeing this body  of work, as he thought it made a significant difference. Also see tutors  feedback regarding this (appendix 2).</p>
<p>The below quote provides a teachers perspective and was provided as  part of my call for academic feedback (appendix 2) regarding  difficulties in communication.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->"There  were the normal difficulties, students doing work away from the studio  and then turning up with a "finished piece" which has been  ill-considered, insufficiently developed, edited, story-boarded etc.  Specifically with film, in that there always seems to be a student who  thinks they can rush around with a camera, do a bit of editing and then  that's it! The main problem was making sure that students were well  prepared and had thought through their idea, the "feel" of their work  and how they were going to do this, the pace and narrative of their  work."</p>
<p>I had considered a number of different interventions to address the  learning and teaching problem, these would have involved attendance at  personal tutorials and critiques, logistically this was too difficult to  organise and would mean spending less time in the digital studio which  would make the situation worse. I tried to find a solution, which would  be suitable for all. I wanted to explore the potential of integrating  Web 2.0 technologies in learning and teaching and create a more visible,  open and collective environment for the Wimbledon time-based media  'students and staff.</p>
<p><strong>The research question I came up with: What are the challenges,  limitations and benefits of introducing blogs to better support ongoing  evaluation and timely feedback for students working in video and  animation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The intervention I made and how I evaluated it.</strong></p>
<p>The primary goal of this intervention was to evaluate the overall  challenges, limitations and benefits of implementing and encouraging  staff and student to participate in this learning and teaching  intervention. Its helpful for technicial and academic staff to have an  overall understanding of technical, contextual and conceptual approaches  the student is making. The challenge was first to integrate the blog  into the curriculum and then convince staff and students this was a  worthwhile venture. Limitations were one of participation, a 'team  effort' was required, and this was the high-risk part of the  intervention, as the notion of online academic practice was new to all.  The benefits of the intervention went well, the blog provided a perfect  means of bridging and integrating practice, the blog quickly became the  central open platform for communication, interaction, reflection and  support in which I had intended it to be. The perceived negative aspects  of time and effort spent setting up the blog were over come by the  clear benefits of helping deliver more meaningful and structured  learning and teaching experience for the students, staff and myself.</p>
<p>In total, seventeen time-based media (TBM) students openly published  digital journals displayed video, image and text showing development of  preparatory work in the run up to the final end of year exhibition. The  blog was actively used by students and myself and reflected the spirit  of intervention including active peer-to-peer open discussions there was  less visible interaction from other staff.</p>
<p>The research was evaluated primarily by using and monitoring the blog  myself daily along side the students and staff, this way I could  evaluate the project through daily observations onsite and online. The  blog became a useful visual recorded of the project, which we could  reflect on during and after the project. At the end of the intervention I  posted an online questionnaire to gather anonymous student feedback,  five students in total responded (appendix 1). I also emailed relevant  staff members with a short list of questions 5 out of 7 responded  (appendix 2).</p>
<p>As an intervention, the integration of blogs to support the learning  and teaching activities of students and staff was very effective. The  blog intervention enhanced communication, helped surface practice and  successfully introduced the new notion of open practice and encouraged  students to reflect and explore how they operate online; student  feedback (appendix 1) shows clear improvements in web 2.0 digital  literacy skills.</p>
<p>The intervention improved my practice; I managed student support and  feedback better by saving time and having clear understanding of student  progress. Tutorials were more meaningful and effective. I was more  critical of my online feedback as this was open to the world and it  could be referenced at any point, the intervention highlights this as  best practice and a possible way forward for encouraging low level  participation to support personal online digital literacy development.</p>
<p>The intervention provided sound evidence, which I can apply to best  practice in the future, advance planning, pre digital literacy  assessment to help inform design, clear guidelines, visible support, not  too embed (low risk at first), allow for flexibility of use and  non-participation. It's helpful to have nominated 'champion or steward'  in place to support, nurture and guide the project forwards.</p>
<p><strong>2. Background</strong></p>
<p>I teach students who specialise in TBM projects. As a technician in a  digital media studio you are also responsible for supporting students  in their overall digital media development. Digital media students on a  foundation course can come from four different subject areas including  3D design, visual communication, design for performance and fine art.  Students who specialise in digital media projects especially TBM tend to  work very closely with the digital media technical staff and less so  with the academics. Demand for support in this area is high, my post at  Wimbledon is shared between my colleague and myself, and therefore  communication and openness is crucial.</p>
<p>Unlike most art and design higher education courses the FE foundation  course is mainly project-based course for example students are set  termly tasks to complete based on particular learning activities and  outcomes. Students are encouraged to be independent learners and engage  collaboratively in the art school open studio environment.</p>
<p><strong>3. Literature Review</strong></p>
<p>As seen in this project and on previous projects I have worked on  there is a recurring problem of successfully integrating web 2.0  technologies into learning and teaching, I will explore why and how we  can begin to address it?</p>
<p>If we were to look at the notion of teachers as digital immigrants,  who are learning to live with technology and students as digital  natives, living with technology since birth. (Prensky, 2001) we begin to  see a huge gap that divides learners and teachers. In my experience of  teaching digital media over the past 7 years it is not true to say all  students are digital natives or all teachers are digital immigrants,  this is reflected in the feedback questionnaire (Appendix 1 &amp; 2) and  (Diagram 1) below, four out of five students positioned themselves in  the -'Very Poor' to 'Average' categories and four out of five staff  positioned themselves in the Good to Average categories, so quite the  reverse scenario to what Prensky (2007, forward to 18:10) suggests,  although he does acknowledge this, he explains there is an increasing  sway towards this being a problem in the future. As the pace of  technology development increases emphasis should be placed on  'progressive practice' and addressing the problems of digital literacy  and web 2.0 use in learning and teaching.</p>
<p><strong>Diagram 1 (attached)<br /></strong></p>
<p><img src="http://process.arts.ac.uk/sites/default/files/survey-stats.png" border="0" alt="" width="589" height="261" /></p>
<p><strong>Content and participation: striking the right balance.</strong></p>
<p>Wenger (1998) sees 'reification' (making it into a thing) and  'participation' as a duality of two constituent processes of the  'negotiation of meaning' fundamental to the human experience of meaning  and thus to the nature of practice. Both must exist in practice in order  to create meaning.</p>
<p>In this instance we could identify in our own practice content as  reification for example learning resources and blog posts and for  participation we could associate with commenting and interaction,  therefore as Wenger argues we need to practice both to achieve  'negotiation of meaning'. I will now explore the relevance of 'content'  and 'participation' in our practice and how the two concepts if seen as  'a duality of two constituent processes' can support OEP development.</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<p>For many of the students the introduction of the blog was a first  time experience so was uploading videos to YouTube. Its clear that  students found the process a rewarding experience. It can be very  difficult to manage digital content or digital practice, this is not  something taught on the course and there is an assumption that students  know how to operate in the digital environment. For most students  working in non-digital subjects work can be placed into an A1  presentation folder and training is provided in this but not for digital  portfolios. There is an increasing demand for students to present their  practice in digital form and I have seen universities starting to  request digital portfolio submissions over the A1 predecessor.</p>
<p>So there is a real need to surface practice and get content online  and we need to support the students in this process. There is a danger  of blogging for blogging sake as is quickly becoming the default  learning and teaching answer for addressing use of digital media in  practice. In truth many teachers who's own lack of awareness of what it  means to operate in a digital environment impacts on the implementation  and success of such learning activities, which in turn impact students  confidence and development.</p>
<p>Tutors need to be proactive in helping learners to develop learning and digital literacies. (LliDA, 2009)</p>
<p>It's easy to dismiss blog content as somehow having less relevance  than physical content in studios. 'David Gauntlett (2011) argues however  small and insignificant it may seem at first teachers need to readdress  the value of publishing content online and stop viewing web 2.0 content  as 'a sweet kind of sideshow'. (Gauntlett, 2011 pp.19)</p>
<p>"But as yet educational institutions struggle to define themselves  within this social media age, often rejecting the idea of social  networked learning because it is regarded as unstructured, undisciplined  and inferior to institutionalised learning" (Wikibooks, 2011)</p>
<p>How do we strike the right balance between open practice and  practice, for 'negotiation of meaning' to take place we need  participation, and to find the right balance of student and teacher  participation face-to-face and online. In the next section I will look  at the concept of participation and how we 'create meaning' from content  and what we may need to consider to make this work.</p>
<p><strong>Participation</strong></p>
<p>So far I have made the assumption that staff are not participating  because they are not commenting or actively visible on the blog, they  are of course busy on the ground, like myself engaged in full  participation teaching face-to-face onsite in studios, if so who is  looking at the student blogs, how do we know if there's a sign of  academic life on our blog? Staff feedback shows (appendix 2) they did  look and use the student blogs, although Lave &amp; wenger (1991) would  describe the teachers level of participation as 'Legitimate Peripheral  Participation' (LPP), sitting on the sidelines and learning how the  community works before entering the community fully or decide to back  off. Striking the right balance is difficult, students and staff are  wary of open practice as we can see in the feed back, especially staff  (appendix 2) and in this student response to question 4. To what extent  has the FMP blog improved the way you communicate with peers and staff?  Wrote:</p>
<p>"It has improved communication with peers and staff to an extent,  although I prefer communicating with staff face to face. I think the  more online teaching gets the less personal it becomes". (Appendix 1)</p>
<p>My experience of this intervention may have been different had there  have been an increased presence of tutor online activity, would this  also have changed the student's experience? If so, how do we encourage  teachers to move from the position of LPP to being a full participant? I  will use two of Brookfield's (1995 pp.4) 'critical reflection' examples  to explore this problem.</p>
<p><strong>The teacher as Fly on the Wall</strong></p>
<p>Where are the teachers? Are they observing our progress? The lack of  framework and understanding of how students and staff operate in this  space can cause confusion 'does the teacher's silence on my post mean  disappointment or satisfaction?' We can begin to manage these  expectations by addressing our level of participation. If teachers begin  to explore 'a way of understanding learning and teaching' as OEP, this  may provide an opportunity for teachers to reflect on their interactions  and decide on the level of participation in the community.</p>
<p>"She will learn when, and how much to disclose, and she will know  about the confidence-inducing effects of such disclosure. She will also  know when keeping her own counsel leads to students doing some  productive reflection, and when it paralyses them". Brookfield, S. (1995  pp.8)</p>
<p><strong>The Circle</strong></p>
<p>If our blog were a classroom, we may lay it out as a circle of  chairs, good practice you'd think, no rows of chairs for students to  fall asleep and get lost in the crowd. In the circle everyone is inward  facing, visible and in a position of dominance, part of the group. For  the confident students this is not a problem, although there is always  the problem of the dominant student taking over the group or students  feeling they should just say something for the sake of it. For the less  confident and shy students this configuration can be intimidating,  Brookfield (1995) quotes Kreisberg (1992) describe how 'painful and  humiliating experience' it is to be forced into a position of openness  and exposure in an unfamiliar environment. The students have no  opportunity to sit back and observe the tutor in practice, the student  needs space and time to check out their environment and teacher so they  are sure and secure enough to contribute to the community so they can  open up and thrive in this environment. The circle does not allow LLP  for students to find their place in the community.</p>
<p><strong>4. Method</strong></p>
<p>I found the 'research by doing' approach to action research a really  useful method of 'unpacking' the learning and teaching problem I've been  trying to understand and address for some time. The cycle of planning,  observation and reflection against a focused framework allowed me to  explore the issues I wanted to and provided the confidence to collect  'real world' focused data to help build my enquiry and argument for this  project and for future strands of research I'm sure will stem from  participating in this experience.</p>
<p>The notion of technology stewardship describe by Wenger, White and  Smith (2009 pp.24-27) as individuals who implement and support the  integration and development of communities clearly reflects my approach  to the action research intervention and the different 'streams of  activity' undertaken to achieve it.</p>
<p>I have used the following descriptive 'streams of activity' headers  'community understanding, technology awareness, election and  Installation, adoption and Transition and everyday use' from Wenger,  White and Smith (2009) Stewarding technology for communities to describe  the approach and method I took.</p>
<p>"These streams can become more or less salient at various times, but  they should not to be thought of as a sequence. They mostly run in  parallel and constantly inform each other." Wenger, White and Smith  (2009 pp.26)</p>
<p><strong>Community understanding</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the academic year students were introduced and encouraged  to use an existing site I had created for sharing and discussing  practiced based learning and teaching online <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/">http://process.arts.ac.uk/</a>,  resources from here were embedded into the blog. The process.arts  website was introduced to the students as a place to find support  materials and resources. Students became familiar with the resource and  used it to support their development. <a name="_ftnref1" href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/#_ftn1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>"Process.arts was also helpful, because you could always reflect  back, If I didn't know how to work Photoshop I could always go back and  just look up the videos that Chris had put up and work with it, it was  very simple, very simplified was made easier for students like us" <a name="_ftnref2" href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p><strong>Technology awareness</strong></p>
<p>Although at the beginning of the year I had not know what my action  research intervention would be, I knew it would involve an exploration  of digital literacies (JISC. Developing digital literacies) and be an  extension of my research and experience ALTO and 'stewarding'  process.arts I did not use this the process.arts website for the  intervention because I felt the concept and context of the website was  too big a jump for most starting out in open practice and could distract  from the main points of the research.</p>
<p><strong>Selection and Installation</strong></p>
<p>In order to embed my action research project with direct focus on  student and staff publication and participation rather than on  publishing tools and experimental contexts ,I decided on using a more  familiar blog group environment to frame this project, <a href="http://myblog.arts.ac.uk/">http://myblog.arts.ac.uk/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Adoption and Transition</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of the final term I introduced the blog <a href="http://wimbledonfoundationvideoanimationfinalprojects.myblog.arts.ac.uk/">http://wimbledonfoundationvideoanimationfinalprojects.myblog.arts.ac.uk/</a> and invited all students from all areas who were using video and  animation in their final major projects to be involved. The blog was  primarily targeted at Fine Art students as these were the main user  group but other areas were invited to participate as well. Prior to the  call I had agreed with academic staff that the blog would be viewed as a  digital journal for assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Everyday use</strong></p>
<p>The blog had a clear identity 'WCA Foundation Video &amp; Animation  FMP (final major projects)' which the students could associate with.  There was an 'about' section which gave detailed information about using  'Video or animation' with guidelines on how to get technical support  and access to facilities, book equipment and how to use the blog. I  posted support calendars<a name="_ftnref3" href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/#_ftn3">[3]</a> where students could book support time with either my colleague or  myself, this worked well at managing workloads and student expectations.  There were clear links to key final major project deadlines and dates.</p>
<p>Named links of all students who contributed posts to the blog were  given a prime position on a list to the right of the site page, it was  very important to surface the community of users to encourage  participation and communication. Anyone who wanted to view a student's  blog journal could simply click on the name at any point whilst  navigating the site. The blog became daily part of my practice; I  continually monitored activity, posts and comments throughout the  project.</p>
<p><strong>5. Results</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overall participation</strong></p>
<p>Twenty six users joined the blog group including four members of  staff, the blog was fully open which meant anyone could view the posts  from anywhere so I'm unsure exactly of the overall impact the blog had.  Of the twenty four students who joined the blog seventeen students  created blog posts ranging from 1 to 17 post per student, with a overall  117 student posts being created in total and 105 comments.</p>
<p>There are three perspectives in which to view how the intervention went, through the eyes of the students, academic and myself.</p>
<p><strong>My perspective</strong></p>
<p>The key success of the blog for me was the sense of being part of a  community, having everything and everyone in the one place, where in  previous years the community existed in silo's without a central domain  to share experience and practice. The key advantages of having one blog  for all meant I did not have to search around, navigate new interfaces  and software or log into multiple sites to comment or interact. If there  were problems with the site these could fix quickly for everyone, I  could also support the group as a whole with getting started and using  the blog. The blog also provide a place to embed video and animation  learning resources, I could now target these resources at specific  students if required.</p>
<p>Almost all the student's posts provided clear and informative  information, which greatly helped in my preparation for tutorials. I had  integrated a booking system for support tutorials into the blog to help  manage my workload. The booking system worked incredibly well, students  could book support in advance which meant we had time and a place to  prepare, I could suggest resources, we could continue to communicate and  share in their progress right up until the point of meeting  face-to-face which in turn became a more meaningful and productive  experience.</p>
<p>I'd had previous experience of posting resources and information but  never openly written feedback before, I found using the blog in my  practice to openly feedback made me more aware and critically reflective  about how I communicated with students.<a name="_ftnref4" href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The important missing factor in this process was the absence of  academic input (comments and presence online) the blog failed to fully  align student, technical and academic open practice. How would academic  online participation have changed the intervention?</p>
<p>There was only one example I can provide of a three way communication  in practice, this was where I had suggested to a student to look into  some particular artists, the student was away for the rest of the week, I  saw the tutor and mentioned what I'd discussed with the student, the  tutor followed this up via the blog.<a name="_ftnref5" href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p><strong>The students perspective</strong></p>
<p>At the time of the call for participation students were just  beginning to develop their projects and needed time and space to  formulate their ideas before making the step of publishing their  thoughts openly online. Two weeks passed before the first student blog  was posted, from this point onwards 5 to 10 posts were being published  daily. The students at first seemed to be motivated by the prospect of  using the blog to enhance their grade at assessment, although this felt  less the case as students began to see the direct benefits to their  practice. Student feedback shows vast improvements in digital literacy  online skills in YouTube and blogging etc.</p>
<p>Students encouraged each other to use the blog and required little  support using it, they continued to support each other throughout.  Participating students viewed, interacted and commented on each other's  posts, the group developed their own mutual and respectful peer support  network<a name="_ftnref6" href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/#_ftn6">[6]</a> see student responses to question 3 (appendix 1)</p>
<p>"It has improved my method of communicating because its made me  realise I prefer a more interactive way of communicating my ideas;  viewers being able to leave comments gives me direct feedback from which  I can work upon"</p>
<p>All feedback to this question was positive and suggests open practice  had an significant impact on learning. During tutorials students used  the blog effectively, referencing the blog before and during tutorial  time. I saw students sitting with their personal tutors in the media  suite looking and referencing content on the blogs together. Only one  student showed concern at having their work visible to the world,  although I would consider more privacy options in future. Students  included index printouts of their blogs in their final portfolios for  assesment.</p>
<p><strong>Staff perspective</strong></p>
<p>Although most staff did not fully participate in using the blogs they  did view the content during tutorials along side the students as well  as using for assessment. There are visible improvements in the digital  literacy skills of students see (Diagram 1) and staff feedback suggests  there are little problems in this area for them too (appendix 2). Staff  feedback to the question: What barriers if any prevent you from using  Web 0.2 websites and blogs in your teaching? Highlight lots of concerns  including time, exposure (open practice), loss or reduction of existing  onsite contact, quality concerns and general logistical problems (enough  PCs in studios).</p>
<p><strong>6. Discussion</strong></p>
<p>I approached this project knowing that staff participation was going  to be a problem, although I learned this assumption was not necessarily  correct. My intervention was supposed to benefit students, academics and  technical staff. Students and myself were the primary participants and  all benefited from the experience. It would have been interesting to  have seen more participation from academics and technicians and to see  how this helped overall communication and alignment. The teachers were  happy to remain on the periphery and observe and some students did the  same. I had initiated the project and the students were aware of that,  there was no reason for the students to expect academic participation,  beyond observation and assessment use.</p>
<p>If web 2.0 projects are to be implemented into learning and teaching  its good practice to target and identify your user group before hand.  Compulsory participation is not advised as Brookfield, S. (1995) points  out in the description of the circle of chairs, this situation does not  allow LPP. There is also the issue of quality, students and staff should  not be forced into a new educational spaces if they have not had the  time and space to practice in it first.</p>
<p>We should be giving students the same time and space to explore open  practice as staff. An example of this can be seen from the student  feedback question 6 (appendix 1) this students is considering their own  practice and how they operate in this arena, other users are also being  considered:</p>
<p>"Most of my posts were created at the last minute. I ran out of time  and would have love to have uploaded more reflections, clips and  research on other artists. It is easy to write loads of text but I  forget how hard it is for people to actually sit down and read something  long nowadays. So probably could have been more imaginative with the  ways i communicated to people."</p>
<p>Just asking students to use a blog in their practice is not  necessarily going to succeed by itself, although students are good  independent workers they still require guidance and support. Web 2.0  learning environments may require key staff members to be actively  involved in facilitating the community's development, Wenger (2009)  calls these members 'digital stewards' the community may struggle to  exist without them. If an open online educational community is formed  without any one individual teacher or steward to offer guidance and  support, there could be potential confusion and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The teacher who chooses to sit and observes as Brookfield, S. (1995)  quotes Kreisberg,(1992) who describes the 'fly on the wall teacher',  confusion can occur, the student sees no learning reference point in  this context, she's uncertain if or how the teacher is going to use the  blog,&nbsp; what the teacher thinks about her posts, is she doing the right  thing, are they even looking at all?</p>
<p>The flexible participation approach to open practice and blog  integration in learning and teaching seems to work, we can use this as a  good starting point in order to encourage the LLP participants into the  community and grow from their. Its may be good practice to have clear  guidelines of what to expect from the exercise, project aims and  objectives for example. Everyone should have a clear understanding of  each other's role in the project and know 'what is expected of them' in  this new domain.</p>
<p><strong>7. Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The intervention has provided a good base for me to consider how I  approach and use web 2.0 technologies in the future in practice based  learning and teaching. The blog was supplementary to other 'main' work,  therefore, low risk, it provided perfect environment for LPP and full  participation, as a first learning and teaching blogging experiment for  all students and staff I think this worked well. What became clear from  this intervention was with practice students do a great job of teaching  themselves if the right amount of peer and teacher visible support is  there.</p>
<p>It was pity the blog only ran for such a sort period of time as the  students wanted to continue, many did and continued to use the blog  after the course had finished, I had not planned for this and regret I  hadn't as I felt I had deserted the community.</p>
<p>There's an impression that using open practice, complicates teaching  and learning and is more time consuming, I hope this action research  project has helped to readdress some of these assumptions.</p>
<p>I would like to explore further the perceived power shifts explored  whilst reading Brookfield, S. (1995) between student and teacher and  relate this to the dynamics involved in open practice and how this  relates to each of Shreeve's (2008) five categories of practice. I would  also like to explore the potential of 'feed forward', use of audio and  video technologies for 'rapid generic feedback'.</p>
<p>For teachers 'approaches and conceptions of teaching' to change  regarding aligning open educational practice to match the existing  face-to-face practiced in studios, institutions would need to ensure  their teachers hold the same 'commensurate conception of teaching'  (Richardson, 2005) towards open practice as they do for current studio  practice. To achieve this the institutions at policy level would have to  adopt new 'approaches to teaching and conceptions of teaching'  themselves in the form of OEP.</p>
<p>I will conclude with a students response to question 9 (appendix 2)  Would you participate in the creation and use of online resources and  learning in future to develop your practice?</p>
<p>Yes definitely, I value this blog and process arts a lot. It is a  means to make my work more accessible within a community/group of other  artists and the world. It would be great to be able to reflect and see  my progress of becoming an artist through the years and recieve feedback  about my work via an online website.</p>
<p>We need to start looking to the future and addressing the pace and  diversity of technological developments across all aspect of our  learning and teaching now, if we don't start changing now then when?</p>

<p id="ta_text.259133865-0-1392021618">It  made it  much easier to talk/write about my work as I had to make it  legible for  other people to read so I automatically thought about what I  wanted to  say in much more depth. It was also good to be able to see my  videos  alongside each other.</p>

</div>
<p id="ta_text.259133865-0-1387815019">It  has been a  huge help! It means I can share it with my friends at school  but also  with all my friends around the world who are interested in  seeing what  I'm up to. It basically made it much easier to share with  people  whether they saw it independently in their own time and gave feed  back  or whether there was something I needed to show someone, it made  it  possible to just log on to any computer and then show then a small   clip. I also learnt how to upload video's onto youtube and use final cut   pro. Which I probably wouldn't have done if it wasn't there.</p>

I ran out of time and  would have  love to have uploaded more reflections, clips and research on  other  artists. It is easy to write loads of text but I forget how hard  it is  for people to actually sit down and read something long nowadays.  So  probably could have been more imaginative with the ways i  communicated  to people.</p>

Sometimes I think we have too many options, for  example when we are  making a post, we can decide to post something to  the main board, our  own blog or someone else's. Maybe we should only  have the possibility to  post to our own blog?  Maybe you could tag  people in posts or videos like you can do in  facebook?  It would be  nice to have a photo album design for a post. Or to have a  link to  photo albums and videos when you go on a certain person's blog.</p>

<h3>Appendix 2</h3>
<p><strong>Staff Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Last year, We ran a pilot blog as part of my action research project - Here's a link to one of the many posts - <a href="https://owa.arts.ac.uk/owa/redir.aspx?C=2ffcbbe4b3184f3198a46426dc360bdd&URL=http://wimbledonfoundationvideoanimationfinalprojects.myblog.arts.ac.uk/2011/03/16/peeling-off-latex-cast-from-found-wood/">http://wimbledonfoundationvideoanimationfinalprojects.myblog.arts.ac.uk/2011/03/16/peeling-off-latex-cast-from-found-wood/</a> :</p>
<p>If you used the blog, could you please feedback the positive and  negative aspects of using a blog like this for students to reflect  throughout the term, for staff to communicate and view their progress  and for supporting assessment.</p>
<h3>Tutor 1</h3>
<p>Have you ever found it difficult to communicate and keep track of  student's progress and development specifically those working in (time  based media) film, video and animation in your area?<br /> If YES how do you do this?<br /> If NO what can be done to improve this?<br /> (Shouldn't the questions be the other way round- if NO, how do you do this; if YES, what can be done to improve this?)</p>
<p>NO, I have not found it difficult- I have always encouraged students  to make showreels as this is also a good exercise for professional  practice. Now I also encourage students to put work on Vimeo as this is  easily accessible by others and a good platform for grouping an  individual's work. It can also serve as a good alternative to a website  and is more flexible and conducive for artists than You-tube. I prefer  the aesthetic.<br /> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> What barriers if any prevent you from using Web 0.2 websites and blogs in your teaching?<br /> None, other than time it would take for me to keep a blog going, and to  set up a website and maintain it although I encourage students to use  them to share information and for reflective practice. <br /> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> Please indicate how you use or would like to use Web 0.2 websites, blogs or Wiki's in your teaching.<br /> See above. Blogs are good if you want to start a discussion thread or  to encourage students to reflect on their practice. Wikis can be good  for information and students can add things themselves to it so it  encourages them to be proactive around their learning and also to share  information. Web 0.2 websites as well encourage a more immediate and  communicative platform for sharing information. All these things take up  time though to set up and keep going, although once set up their  development can be left more in students' hands.<br /> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> How would you describe your online digital literacy regarding  communicating and publishing teaching materials online for blended  learning?<br /> <br /> Excellent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ()<br /> Good&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (&radic;)<br /> Average&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ()<br /> Very Poor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ()<br /> None</p>
<h3>Tutor 2</h3>
<p>Some of my students used blogs, and they tended to be more exhaustive  than those who wrote - maybe they were more switched on students.&nbsp;  There was more integration with their visual research and their  thinking.&nbsp; However, these were few and far between.&nbsp; I think you will  only get round this problem if you made blogs mandatory, and then you  would have a problem with students who do not have their own macs/pcs,  are disorganised/dyslexic etc.&nbsp; You would have to run workshops about  how to set up blogs.&nbsp; It never failed to amaze me how many students  avoided using macs, even in vis com!&nbsp; There is always the question about  how to reach students who are not fully participating and you have to  make it work for them too, not just the switched on pro-active  students.&nbsp; You also have to ask where lecturers would have time to  scrutenise blogs.&nbsp; Some of my students who wrote blogs would send me  their links, I would have a quick look at it and think "Oh good, they're  doing this" and leave them to it.&nbsp; I would only pick up on the really  bad students who were writing diary-type, process-based blogs and not  making it sufficiently visual or self-questioning.</p>
<p>Have you ever found it difficult to communicate and keep track of  student's progress and development specifically those working in (time  based media) film, video and animation in your area?</p>
<p>If YES how do you do this?</p>
<p>There were the normal difficulties ..... students doing work away  from the studio and then turning up with a "finished piece" which has  been ill-considered, insufficiently developed, edited, story-boarded  etc.&nbsp; Specifically with film, in that there always seems to be a student  who thinks they can rush around with a camera, do a bit of editing and  then that's it! The main problem was making sure that students were well  prepared and had thought through their idea, the "feel" of their work  and how they were going to do this, the pace and narrative of their  work.&nbsp; We set up tutor groups every week where those involved in  time-based media had to bring their work, ideas, progress so far etc.&nbsp;  Student in-out was equally important in these grous.&nbsp; In the end, it  came down to the individual student, and how willing they were to listen  to advice.&nbsp; Often they realised afterwards how preparation could help  them.</p>
<p>If NO what can be done to improve this?</p>
<p>I think it comes down to the team you are working with.&nbsp; Maybe it's a  matter of discipline so that students who have not produced a  storyboard cannot borrow equipment until they've been given the go  ahead.&nbsp; Preparation is something that should be introduced from the  beginning (i.e. research, ideas, development) and there is no reason why  time based media students should be any different.&nbsp; They should go and  see the Stanley Kubrick archives at lcc and the boxes of research that  there are for one film!</p>

<p>Have you ever found it difficult to communicate and keep track of  student's progress and development specifically those working in (time  based media) film, video and animation in your area?</p>
<p>If YES how do you do this?</p>
<p>If NO what can be done to improve this?</p>
<p>On my experience, students that work with time based media tend to be  inclined to use blogging as a way of keeping a record of their  development and research.&nbsp; the blog wimbledon foundation video animation  fmp has been very effective in this respect as it has enabled not only  to maintain individual digital journal of students progress but also  facilitate communication between students and staff and enable to share  knowledge.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>What barriers if any prevent you from using Web 0.2 websites and blogs in your teaching?</p>
<p>Not always in my studio practice based teaching experience, we have  dedicated IT area easy to access for tutors during tutorials. so i  mainly had to rely on the use of college laptops which aren't always  available.&nbsp; this may at time prevent using blogs in my teaching.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Please indicate how you use or would like to use Web 0.2 websites, blogs or Wiki's in your teaching.</p>
<p>For me&nbsp; blogs and wikis as a space where students and tutors can  share knowledge and communicate in a interactive way. it is a valid and  effective tool for research, lectures and gathering development of ideas  and exchange processes of working.&nbsp; with regard to my teaching  experience with the wimbledon foundation video animation fmp it has also  being a practical tool that facilitate booking system of technical  equipment for show.</p>

<p>Have you ever found it difficult to communicate and keep track of  student's progress and development specifically those working in (time  based media) film, video and animation in your area?</p>
<p>If YES how do you do this?</p>
<p>If NO what can be done to improve this?</p>
<p>- the use of a student blog was useful to track development of  student work during self study days, but this only showed evidence of  digital/on line work. Whilst some feedback can be done via email,  one-to-one 'in the flesh' feedback is generally better for clarity - the  student can check out tutor feedback in person. The other disadvantage  is the absense of paper based sketchbooks, made objects in digital  format. Pictures may be uploaded, but these can be misleading.</p>
<p>-however for students interested in film/live performance a blog can  also compliment a paper based sketchbook. For example uploading  film/music/sound clips makes a digital sketchbook that charts the  student research journey, that works alongside the paper version.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>What barriers if any prevent you from using Web 0.2 websites and blogs in your teaching?</p>
<p>- my main barrier is the old and slow computers provided by the university.</p>
<p>-the new Foundation course is proposing the use of student blog as a  replacement to the paper based reflective journey. This may work for  some students (as mentioned above) but not others who prefer a  personalised approach rather than a standardised digital format. E.g.  the act of handwriting is important so some students. However blogs  provide an immediacy to students who often struggle with maintaining a  meaningful reflective journal.</p>
<p>- the main problem with the use of blogs will be during assessment  and tutorials where these need to be formally checked. Also during day  to day teaching a tutor will ask to see a reflective journal. With no in  studio computer provision it is difficult to check these in the context  of 'actual' teaching. Of course a tutor can check these away from the  studio, but live feedback with verbal emphasis (especially for difficult  students) still has more impact than an email.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Please indicate how you use or would like to use Web 0.2 websites, blogs or Wiki's in your teaching.</p>
<p>- I use blackboard, which is very useful to direct students towards,  placing emphasis on their responsibility to keep up to date. I think the  current policy of not printing briefs/handouts for students is a little  unfair, it also means students don't have hard copies for briefings.  The cited environmental reasoning behind this is flawed, as the paper is  still used, the only difference is the university transfers the cost of  paper and printing onto the student.</p>
<p>- Blogs for students as digital archives and places of reflection  will be useful for theatre and film students as clips of  productions/performances/films/music/moving images can form a digital  sketchbook to compliment the draw paper version. The two have to work  together as drawing is still a vital skill and means of communication of  a stage/production designer.</p>
<p>-I haven't used Wiki's as yet (unless I have without realising!)</p>
<p>- You still cannot beat live teaching, whilst on line demonstrations  have some role during self study days, for a subject area like theatre  and film, collaboration and working with others is key, and a skill I  actively teach. The 'danger' the transferring more learning on line is  the students work independently, away from college and - most basically  of all - don't learn from each other.</p>

<h3>Tutor 5</h3>
<p>Have you ever found it difficult to communicate and keep track of  student's progress and development specifically those working in (time  based media) film, video and animation in your area?</p>
<p>If YES how do you do this?</p>
<p>Students working in time based film, video and animation tend to work  more independently, and away from college. This may sometimes be due to  a lack of suitable working space in college, or, as the nature of their  practice is highly mobile, they begin to develop working patterns  involving home- working. Its crucial to break this cycle and reconnect  with a college environment as students can miss so much from peer  learning, crits, professional expertiese and feedback. Typically I would  insist on regular contact&nbsp; with my tutees in a studio envirronment so  that film/TBM/Video, can be discused/critiqued in a professional  context, and real-time reflection and development is able to take place  with advice given on documentation and contextualisation. Individual  Learning strategies are therefore crucial within this context.</p>
<p>Outside of this specific studio tutor role, there is a significant&nbsp;  and problamatic issue at assessment stage, when looking for evidence of  work, discourse and reflection&nbsp; particularly&nbsp; in time based media .The  personal/ studio tutor system is an essential&nbsp; link in deseminatiing the  range and quality of "hidden" work to the marking team. Where this  doesnt happen, the marks can be flawed, being unrepresentative of a  students abilities and progress.&nbsp; This issue was evidenced a few years  ago during assessment where the relevant studio tutor wasnt available to  make representation on behalf of their tutee as they werent in on the  day of&nbsp; team assessment. This was compounded by the student&nbsp; having had  littlr tutorial contact with others on the marking team. This particular  student had presented the bulk of their TBM work in computer file and  hadn't adequately communicated this to the marking team, appear]]></description>

But, for practice based subjects such as Art and Design where the full attendance, face-to-face teaching model is traditionally seen as the only, and the best, way to teach, extending the range of study modes and options presents a real challenge. It is clear that the traditional teaching model as well as a wide range of associated institutional support systems needs to change, the tricky questions for institutions is how to do so in such harsh times?1 <br /><br /><strong>Existing spaces </strong><br />The University of the Arts London is predominately a making university; students are encouraged to be self-directed, reflective and engage in regular peer-to-peer and group critiques. Very few arts courses at UAL provide project briefs, most learning and teaching takes place in peer/tutor led small group collaborative discussions or one-to-one in an &lsquo;open&rsquo; studio environment. This session will discuss how we create and share resources but will primarily focus on exploring the &lsquo;reuse&rsquo; of learning and teaching resources.2<br /><br /><strong>Creating resources and capturing process</strong><br /><br />Video, image and audio documentation is the preferred media for capturing and sharing practice based art and design tutorials and resources. Overcoming staff reluctance to create and share teaching resources can be a primary problem, time and production are the key issues for most academics and technical teachers but staff also have concerns regarding giving away their work or what they may see as defining their practice. 3 <br /><br /><strong>Examples of Student and staff resource </strong><br /><br />Staff resources produced with support: The examples below demonstrate the benefits of providing staff basic support to help them create and publish their own resources, low budget support can provide teachers vital time and space to produce quality resources for their students.<br /><br />Introduction to sand casting videos (4 parts): these videos have been received well, attracting quality comments and over 100,000 Views YouTube - http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/sand-casting-part-one-philip-white-and-jenny-dunseath<br /><br />Life Drawing - Laurence Noga - Wimbledon foundation 2010/11 - http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/life-drawing-laurence-noga-wimbledon-foundation-201011<br /><br />Disc Sander demonstration - http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/disc-sander-demonstration<br /><br />Press molded ceramic sphere (2 parts) - http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/press-moulded-ceramic-sphere-part-1<br /><br /><strong>Staff resources produced without support:</strong><br /><br />Small Band Saw demonstration (Model-making Wood Workshop) - http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/small-band-saw-demonstration-model-making-wood-workshop<br /><br />Stretcher making worksheets 4 parts - http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/1-preparing-and-cutting-your-wood-stretcher-making-worksheet-part-1<br />Sound and Story - http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/sound-and-story<br /><br />Contextual references English Plus Film - http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/animation-timeline-fine-art-0<br /><br />Tips for documenting your work 3 Parts - http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/tips-documenting-your-work-part-2-lighting<br /><br /><strong>Students producing resources for students:</strong><br /><br />Posts by student Anna McAndrew - http://process.arts.ac.uk/user/85/contents<br /><br />Submerged (please see the student comments on this posts) - http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/submerged<br /><br />Student documenting student - http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/eliot-jones<br /><br />Student interviewing student talking about their process - http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/daniel-hoskins-wimbledon-technical-arts-student-talking-about-his-work-2009<br /><strong><br />Sharing resources? </strong><br /><br />Why do resources need to be open and if so why a dedicated website and not on Flickr or Youtube? What do students gain from sharing and what do teachers gain, how does openness and OER add value to the process?<br />The primary online communication tool at UAL is the internal VLE blackboard, with this each subject area is locked into its own closed section, the VLE can be complex and difficult to navigate. Blackboard does not facilitate sharing or browsing across courses or colleges and is closed to external users. As a result over the past few years with the development of Web 2.0 technology content learning and teaching is being independently dispersed across the web in various wikis, bolgs, group websites, personal youtube accounts, Flickr groups etc. Although collective participation remains a problem, good quality learning material is being produced and shared either internally hidden away in Blackboard or lost in locally shared group blogs, these resources often become dormant and lost as the onus is often placed on one person &lsquo;the teacher&rsquo; to administer and develop this content alone, some content never leaves the classroom/studio. <br /><br />http://process.arts.ac.uk/ was developed in 2009 with the aim of creating a new user driven online studio community and collaborative resource that explores process in arts practice by showing the day-to-day studio/professional practice of staff and students of the six colleges of the University of the Arts London (UAL) whilst also sharing, informing and engaging with the wider community. Process.arts tries to address how we cluster all this activity together, encouraging users to collaborate, share and develop content in an space that bridges the internal and external e.g. the content published remains affiliated to the institution &lsquo;the hosts&rsquo;, but users are free to explore and develop this content as they wish with Web 2.0 CMS functionality which provides an open social layer within an accessible, familiar, and collaborative environment.<br /><br />Students: it is common practice for students, teachers and artists to document their practice through exploring and questioning the process, for example in sketchbooks or through samples and experimentation. Process.arts aims to capture and encourage student centred learning through cross-college collaboration by capturing and publishing these interactions on process.arts. <br /><br />Technical, academic and support staff at university of the arts London, its hoped a wide cross-section of staff will upload related academic and technical information to support their teaching practice, as well as viewing and commenting on the posts of others. Its also hoped staff will share information about their own arts practice showing images, video or audio documentation of their studio practice.<br /><br />The ALTO project (Arts Learning and Teaching Online) at the University of the Arts London received funding in 2010 to engage the University with the rapidly growing global Open Education Resource (OER) movement. The ALTO project is concerned with the creation and sharing of Open Education Resources (OERs). See more about the ALTO project here http://process.arts.ac.uk/category/tags/alto and http://www.arts.ac.uk/alto/index.html<br /><br />UAL blogs &amp; websites - There are many other UAL websites and blogs sharing and developing resources please visit this link - http://process.arts.ac.uk/category/discipline/research-practice/ual-blogs-websites<br /><br />OER arts resources - Please forward links to OER arts resources online and I will add them to the following cluster - http://process.arts.ac.uk/category/discipline/research-practice/oer-arts-resources<br /><br />OER reuse stories: Reuse of OER learning &amp; teaching resources<br /><br /><strong>Group discussion </strong><br />During the run up to this conference we aim to identify a core cluster of OER arts resource websites from around the world, process.arts and ALTO have produced a significant amount of new OER arts content for the sector to use, the question for this discussion and workshop is: &lsquo;How do we reuse OER content in art &amp; design practice based learning &amp; teaching?&rsquo; <br /><br />Authorship as selection: It&rsquo;s generally unknown how OER content is going to be repurposed and reused and there is very little evidence of this happening. Its thought sites such as process.arts and ALTO will attract a mixture resources, mostly granular in nature, although these standalone pieces of content are interesting it is difficult to assess how &lsquo;useful&rsquo; they are with regards to learning aims, objectives and outcomes. On there own, these &lsquo;informal&rsquo; learning resources could be dismissed as having little or no academic significance or use to the curriculum framework.<br /><br />In this session we would explore the most effective and efficient ways of utilising OER in arts HEIs by identifying best processes and practices individually and collaboratively for creating learning resources/objects to support the learning design process in support of greater flexible and blended learning opportunities for future students in order to extend the range of study modes and options for the sector.<br /><br />Below are some possible questions for debate, please feel free to suggest new questions and/or contribute, thank you. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>What are the main barriers to OER reuse?</strong><br /><br />How do we share and collaborate in this space and overcome the obstacles of use and re-use specifically when creating and designing complex rich media learning resources and objects?<br /><br />Develop an Arts-OER &lsquo;reuse&rsquo; community of practice, how would a discipline-based, cross-university online community of practice help to overcome staff reluctance to create and share teaching resources in an OER environment? <br /><br />Examine the effective use of source files and edit notes in relation to producing better &lsquo;editable&rsquo; learning resources/objects.<br /><br />Investigate better methods of linking recourses with learning design by improving and exploring resource derivative information.<br /><br /><strong>What are the main drivers to OER reuse?</strong><br /><br />Investigate and evaluate the most effective and efficient ways of utilising OER in arts HEIs by identifying best processes and practices for creating learning resources/objects to support the learning and teaching process.<br /><br />Examine the effectiveness of inter-college and HEI collaborations.<br /><br />The ALTO project team4 has concluded that there are many strong benefits for involvement with OER and its associated communities, because:<br />Support greater flexible and blended learning opportunities for future students in order to extend the range of study modes and options at the UAL and beyond. <br />It is an effective institutional and professional development tool in the context of externalizing practice, pedagogic conceptions and strategies in order to support reflection and development. <br />It provides a foundation to introduce and extend collaborative learning design skills amongst staff to support greater flexible and blended learning opportunities in order to extend the range of study modes and options<br />It brings external business and collaboration opportunities<br /><br /><strong>What evidence do we have for OER reuse?</strong><br /><br />Observe and contrast current practice in the OER community.<br /><br />Share stories, explore and exchange stories and examples of existing OER reuse practice which exploit the creation of new resources through the appropriation and reworking of existing content, ideas, materials and processes.<br /><br />The arts have a strong tradition of creating new meanings through the appropriation and reworking of existing content, ideas, materials and processes, how can this tradition inform and encourage the development and reuse of OER rich media content. <br /><br /><strong>References</strong><br /><br />Wenger, Etienne.

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a SCORE funded project which explores ways of enhancing practice in research methods teaching through the use of open educational resources. The project is multidisciplinary and involves perspectives from three different disciplines (Sociology, Education and Criminology) on how OER can be utilised more effectively in research teaching.</p>
<p>The content shared here is intended for the tutors participating in the project, who are invited to view and evaluate the resources from the point of view of whether and how they can embed these in teaching practice. Any comments are welcome however. The aim is&nbsp; to understand whether the OER content included here &nbsp;is flexible enough to adapt to the&nbsp;subject areas of&nbsp;education, sociology and criminology. Can the same content be adapted for use at different levels (undergraduate, postgraduate)? Can this content provide opportunities for multi-disciplinary collaboration and idea exchange?</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Tim Lowe talking about Maths course and resources and "Maths Help"</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for applying for course:</strong></p>
<p>a. Support module to do other courses (eg science, business etc)</p>
<p>b. Introduction to Maths in order to then progress to more advanced maths course; and...</p>
<p>c. To overcome fear of doing maths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aims of re-writing the materials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increase retention</li>
<li>Better prepare students for subsequent modules</li>
<li>Remove preparatory material</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Maths help?&nbsp;</strong><em>Mathshelp.open.ac.uk</em></p>
<p><em>"Maths Help" on the OU OER site OpenLearn&nbsp;</em>allows students to begin to prepare for maths course before they receive their course materials.&nbsp;Basic maths skills modules on OpenLearn, based on previous (printed) materials, enhanced with interactive activities and linked to the course website. Mathshelp is&nbsp;a door into everyday mathematics, points also within course materials, available for all to use (lined to from OU &ldquo;Skills for Study&rdquo;; STEM: North of Scotland; TechFest-SetPoint) and reuse (via Jorum). Materials from books into web friendly format. Plus very useful guide of how to&nbsp;use the maths calculator (used also by other organisations).</p>
<p><strong>The challenge:&nbsp;</strong>When students are reading materials and sending materials, the communication of maths should be enhanced, we should be able to teach more <em>How do we say maths?</em> <em>Who do we speak it? </em>&nbsp;Solution by using audio frames)</p>
<p><strong>Usage and feedback:&nbsp;</strong>Unique visitors: 1/1/2010 &ndash; 13/9/2010. users:&nbsp;500-1000 per module.&nbsp;Modules rated 4.5-5 stars (via OpenLearn &ndash; not many people do ratings).&nbsp;Students recommending to each other in forums.&nbsp;Tutors reporting better initial understanding.&nbsp;High take-up (95%) and achievement (mean:94%) in first early assignment</p>
<p><strong>Final thought from the room: </strong>Students doing other courses that need such support for other course &ndash; this could help so much.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5296</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5296</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Steve Midgley is the&nbsp;Deputy Director of the Office of Education Technology at the United States Department of Education. At Open Nottingham he introduced&nbsp;the "Learning Registry"&nbsp;to help educators to find the resources they need in the format they need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>What is the Learning Registry?</strong></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->1. Lightweight API</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->2. No centralised infrastructure: no &ldquo;off&rdquo; switch</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->3. Control and accountability is local</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->4. No default winners: level the playing field</p>
<p>Digital learning resources are widely available, but hard to apply for teaching and learning.&nbsp;Educators and students already know about how best to use resources.</p>
<p>Users are leaving data trails but their usage data is often thrown away or locked up.&nbsp;Expertise is highly distributed. users are leaving data trails, but usage data is often thrown away or locked up.&nbsp;The universe of diffreent forms of data orbiting around learning resources.&nbsp;Types of data: paradata (data about data), metadata, analytical data, linked data, context all around the learning resource.&nbsp;A big opportunity in the education space to be able to go after this metadata &amp; paradata and get value from it.</p>
<p>New services can include better discovery, recommendations, curricular integration and measurements of quality&nbsp;</p>
<p>The developer should be able to take the prototype and build with it / over it.&nbsp;Let the community speak to itself through the timeline of the learning registry (common metadata timeline).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Key messages:</strong></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Make possible a &ldquo;do-ocracy&rdquo; for those who run the project. Welcoming anyone who wants to make a difference.</li>
<li>Let the community speak to itself through the timeline of the learning registry (common metadata timeline)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Avoid bureaucratic heat death. Do as little as possible, as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Investment of time is a strong currency in education.&nbsp;Time constraint for teachers to find the resources &ndash; make it easy for them.&nbsp;</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>1. Practical Re-use</strong></p>
<p>Much is spoken about the potential for OER to reduce design time and to  reduce costs, but is this really the case and where is the evidence?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gabi Witthaus </strong>(University of Leicester, OSTRICH) &amp; <strong>Jamie Grace </strong>(University of Derby)<br /><strong>Some thoughts on OER reuse from Derby to Kabul</strong><br />This is a two-part presentation from members of the JISC and HEA-funded OSTRICH Project at the Universities of Leicester and Derby. Gabi Witthaus will start by reporting on the experience of delivering two workshops on OERs for Afghan academics and students in Kabul in February 2011, as part of a DfID-funded collaboration between the University of Leicester, the Open University and Kabul University. Approximately 30 academics and six students attended the workshops. Most had never heard of OERs before, and all were eager to find additional sources of teaching and learning materials that could be legally copied, adapted and reused. The workshops involved participants in conducting a search for OERs relevant to their fields of study and then reflecting on the potential advantages and barriers to reuse of OERs in their context. Their reflections on both the process of searching for suitable OERs and the potential reuse of OERs in their learning and teaching, and some implications arising out of this for the wider open access community, will be discussed.<br />Jamie Grace will then present on the case for the use of OERs in legal pedagogy, with reference to his experience of using OERs in his teaching at the University of Derby.<br />Transparency in the law and transparency in pedagogy: Firstly: &lsquo;The law&rsquo; is freely available (it is a human right, of sorts, to have access to the law in the UK, so that one might engage with one&rsquo;s right to freedom of expression and right to a fair trial), and typically freely available through texts of decided cases and legislation on the Internet. Secondly, individuals have the legal right to access our teaching materials through the Freedom of Information Act 2000, where the accessibility of teaching resources is determined by &lsquo;prejudice to commercial interests&rsquo;. Thirdly, the publication of more information in a more competitive HE environment, not less, over time, means that it could be in our institutional interests to be more open the world at large about our educational resources. What we must conclude is that any barrier to the uptake of OERs cannot currently be said to be legal or financial, and must only be due to institutional reticence and an ideology of academic freedom that promotes the development of pedagogic values behind closed doors.</li>
<li><strong>Timos Almpanis </strong>(Learning Technologist/ Associate Lecturer in Blended Learning<br /> Southampton Solent University) <strong><br />How OER were embedded in the module 'Developing the Online Learning Experience'</strong><br />The purpose of the 'Developing the Online Experience' module is to increase participants' awareness of blended and online learning techniques so that they become familiar with the various ways in which technology can be used to enhance the students' learning experience. Increasing awareness about OER enables lecturers to enrich their materials further and focus more on the ways in which students engage with the materials and in facilitating learning. OER have been used in various ways in the module 'Developing the online learning experience'; OER were integrated with other subject-related learning resources such as journal articles, book chapters and presentations from the face-to-face sessions.<br />To encourage participants&rsquo; own use of OER, they were featured in a <a href="http://mycourse.solent.ac.uk/mod/book/view.php?id=160120" target="_blank">face-to-face session</a> in which participants were asked to work in groups to evaluate the use of some of the most common OER material on websites such as OpenLearn, Jorum, MIT Courseware and more. Furthermore, learning activities - both group and individual - were based around Open Educational Resources as participants were asked to search, identify and evaluate an online, publicly available, structured activity that could be relevant to their subject area.</li>
<li><strong>Tim W Lowe</strong> (Department of Mathematics and Statistics, The Open University)<br /><strong>Use of OER by an Open University Maths Course</strong><br />The Open University launched a new Level 1 mathematics course: MU123, Discovering Mathematics in February 2010. Whilst the course assumes students have some basic mathematical skills already, we are aware that many students, especially those returning to study, may need some preparatory revision. To help address this, we created a set of "Maths Help" resources on the OU OER site OpenLearn. This allows our students to begin to prepare for the course before they receive their course materials, and provides a resource for others. The material contained in the resources is based on a previous OU course.<br />The presentation will discuss these resources together with usage details and feedback from students.<br /><br /> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Impact of OER</strong></p>
<p>An ever growing number of education providers are joining the OER revolution,  but what is the impact and who is benefitting the most?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dave White</strong> (Project Manager of the JISC&nbsp; OER Impact Study,  University of Oxford) <br /><strong>Broadcast or Conversation: What does &lsquo;openness&rsquo; mean to universities?</strong><br />Drawing on the initial findings of the JISC funded OER Impact project this presentation will explore how OER is being used/reused and the implications of institutions claiming to be &lsquo;open&rsquo; in their engagement with the web.</li>
<li><strong>Andy Lane,</strong> (Senior Fellow, Support Centre for Open Resources in Education (SCORE), The Open University)<br /><strong>The Support Centre for Open Resources in Education: Fostering community actions and reflections</strong><br />The recent Online Learning Task Force report was called Collaborate to Compete and included recommendation 6, which says' Investment is needed for the development and exploitation of OER to enhance efficiency and quality' and suggested that this should be the responsibility of the JISC, HEA and the Open University (as part of its national role). The OU involvement is through the HEFCE funded SCORE initiative which is working with other English HEIs to:<br />Publish more OER or relevance to the HE sector Provide information, advice and guidance through publications and events alongside JISC and HEA Run a Fellowship programme that enables HE staff to engage in active scholarship around the use of OER<br />This presentation will explain in more detail these strands of work and also highlight the wider set of organisations and activities throughout the world that are trying to foster communities around the use of OER and get those communities to reflect upon the value of OER for transforming teaching and learning practice.</li>
<li><strong>Steve Stapleton</strong> (Open Learning Support Officer, University  of Nottingham)<br /><strong>Open Educational Resources do save time and students do use them</strong><br />This presentation offers two case studies focused on the use and re-use of OER by staff and students at Nottingham. The first provides evidence of re-use by an academic from the School of Geography. The case study includes survey results showing that OER can save time with no compromise on quality. The second case study shows how students at Nottingham&rsquo;s campus in China have been using open resources to support their studies, to learn how to evaluate academic resources and to support them on their journey to becoming global citizens.</li>
<li><strong>Rob Pearce</strong> (Learning and Web Technologist, HEA Engineering Subject Centre, Loughborough University)<br /><strong>Tracking OER</strong><br />In partnership with the JISC, the HEA Engineering Subject ran a pilot programme to support Open Educational Resources. The goal of the programme was to make a wide range of learning resources available as OERs. The project outputs were placed in the Jorum Open and a number of &ldquo;web 2.0&rdquo; websites such as YouTube and Slideshare in order to maximise their exposure to the community and for ease of re-use. The pilot project set in place a number of methods for attempting to measure and track OER usage and re-usage. Towards the end of the project a tracking code prototype system, named Date of Birth codes (DOB codes) was applied to several released resources as an experiment. The code is added to the copyright notice of an OER to maximise the likelihood of its reproduction.<br />Example code: &copy; rcp:140510:a0001<br />The system has no resolver service and no central regulatory agency; usage and code creation and management depends on the ubiquity of the Google search engine. In one sense it&rsquo;s a librarians nightmare &ndash; loosely controlled, no vocabulary with a small chance of accidental duplication etc. but on the other hand it&rsquo;s a pragmatic response to a process that is impossible at the moment to regulate. Details of the technique can be found via this link: <a href="http://icesculpture.wordpress.com/make-evolved-oer-discoverable/" target="_blank">http://icesculpture.wordpress.com/make-evolved-oer-discoverable/.</a></li>
<li><strong>Joel Duffin</strong> (via Skype (CEO, OER Glue)<br /><strong>OER Glue</strong><br />OER Glue is a uniquely open approach to online learning that lets content be used where ever it is found rather than requiring it to be copied into a new system. OER Glue can be used to efficiently find content, assemble courses, and teach online by &ldquo;glueing together&rdquo; open education resources and integrating with popular online services including Google Documents, Blogs, Facebook, Twitter, and discussion and assessment tools. OER Glue&rsquo;s web browser add-on approach lets you gather video, images, and text from web pages and put them and widgets into existing web pages. Authors and teachers can use this functionality to wrap context and navigation tools around online content and to integrate content and services from multiple sources in a coherent manner. This approach addresses licensing issues by modifying content and integrating services "in place" after they are loaded in the web browser. OER Glue is in private beta right now and looking for partners who are interested in enhancing existing courses and building new ones using OER Glue as well as providing feedback and input on the design of the tool. <a href="http://www.oerglue.com/" target="_blank">OER Glue website</a></li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Nathan Yergler is Chief Technology Officer, Creative Commons</p>
<p><strong>Learning from the Web for Learning on the Web</strong></p>
<p>The move towards open courseware and open educational resources has resulted in a tremendous shift: there are more learning materials available online for use, remix, and repurposing than ever before, and creators and learners alike are discovering new ways to collaborate. But problems exist: search and discovery are by no means solved, and when the web is your classroom, getting useful information about how learners connect to materials is difficult. Can we look to the Web for lessons that can be applied to Learning on the Web? Can we look at best practices and lessons learned, and extrapolate useful information for learning and education? What should we expect, given the evolution of the Web?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea of universal access to teaching and learning resources is made possible by the Internet, but our legal and social systems don&rsquo;t always allow that idea to be realised. Copyright was created long before the emergence of the Internet, and can make it hard to legally perform actions we take for granted. To achieve the vision of universal access, someone needed to provide a free, public, and standardised infrastructure that creates a balance between the reality of the Internet and the reality of copyright laws. That someone is Creative Commons.&rdquo; (creativecommons.org).</p>
<p>Since joining Creative Commons in 2004 Nathan has been instrumental in supporting growth in the use and re-use of Open Educational Resources (OER) by educators and informal learners around the world.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The OER University, presented over Skype by Wayne Mackintosh, International Centre for Open Education / OER Foundation</p>
<p>The OER university is a virtual collaboration of like-minded institutions committed to creating flexible pathways for OER learners to gain formal academic credit. The OER university aims to provide free learning to all students worldwide using OER learning materials with pathways to gain credible qualifications from recognised education institutions. It is rooted in the community service and outreach mission to develop a parallel learning universe to augment and add value to traditional delivery systems in post-secondary education. Through the community service mission of participating institutions we will open pathways for OER learners to earn formal academic credit and pay reduced fees for assessment and credit.<br />The OER university concept is derived from the original etymology of "universitas magistrorum et scholarium" referring to a community of scholars. The OER university is an innovation partnership of like-minded institutions committed to creating pathways for OER learners to gain academic credit through the formal education system. As such we use the lowercase "u" to refer to the OER university collaboration. The OER university is not a formal teaching institution and does not confer degrees or qualifications -- but works in partnership with accredited educational institutions to provide credit for OER learning on the pathway to awarding credible credentials.<br />The OER University will</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable accredited educational institutions to provide assessment and credit pathways for formal academic credit at reduced student fees, which lead to recognised credentials. </li>
<li>Offer courses and programmes based entirely on open education resources and open textbooks licensed under free cultural works approved open content licenses. </li>
<li>Implement scalable systems of volunteer student support through community service learning approaches. </li>
<li>Promote the design and teaching of courses utilising open pedagogical approaches to facilitate networked learning. </li>
<li>Use free and open source software for its administration.</li>

<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/user/view/1137">Helen Beetham</a> <br />1:08pm 16 March 2011</p>
<p>Hello, great to hear from others who are going to be at the Impact event, and to know that Antonio is going to be there. I'm leading one of the workshops and most of my experience of evaluating OER comes from the UK-OER pilot programme, which funded Humbox. Humbox (of course) was one of the most amazing and in my eyes interesting of the projects, because of it's focus on sharing in a community of common interest. It will be really interesting to catch up on its ongoing impact.</p>
<p>Before the event I'd be interested to have people's views on a couple of questions. The first is about content itself. When we are thinking about impact, <strong>what is it about content that makes it more or less OPEN, in an educational contexts. And also, what is it about content that makes it more or less EDUCATIONAL, in an open context?</strong> I'd be interested in ideas.</p>
<p>As soon as we start to ask these questions I think we come upon the question of who is using content, and for what purposes. Different uses will lead to different criteria for evaluating openness and learning potential, maybe? Anyway, I'd be interested to hear from you, and will perhaps have time to post my second question later.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Wikipedia is increasingly used by university students for<br />"pre-research", <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/125899/">to gain context and explore ideas for course<br />assignments and research projects</a> [1]. Yet many among scientists,<br />academics and other experts are <a href="http://www.jmir.org/2011/1/e14/">reluctant to contribute </a>to Wikipedia,<br />despite a growing number of <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/members/aps-wikipedia-initiative/">calls from the scientific community</a> to<br />join the project .<br /><br />The <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research_Committee">Wikimedia Research Committee </a>has just launched a survey to<br />understand why scientists, academics and other experts do (or do not)<br />contribute to Wikipedia and other collaborative projects, and whether<br />individual motivation aligns with shared perceptions of Wikipedia<br />within expert communities. We hope this may help us identify ways<br />around barriers to expert participation. The survey is anonymous and<br />takes about 20 min to complete.

              <title>Reflecting on Arts Practice</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5013</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5013</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Before reflecting on my practice as a whole and the theoretical principals I have learnt, I feel it necessary to include some introductory information regarding my new job role of &lsquo;Arts Learning and Teaching Online&rsquo; (ALTO) UAL college coordinator, as a result of these changes I have refocused my learning and teaching research to concentrate on my new role which builds upon my earlier secondment and fellowship research around online learning and teaching.</p>
<p>As ALTO college coordinator I will contribute to the successful completion of the ALTO Project, the core of the project is concerned with the creation and sharing of Open Education Resources (OERs). The role provides a rare opportunity to observe and contrast how learning content is created, used, shared and re-purposed by staff and students within specific courses across the university and with partner institutions.</p>
<p>The fundamental challenge of the ALTO project is to facilitate &lsquo;institutional change&rsquo; promoting online collaborations that address &lsquo;the four Rs of OER and teaching and learning practice&rsquo; David Wiley (2008):</p>
<p><strong>Reuse:</strong> the right to reuse the content in its unaltered/verbatim form (e.g., reduce repetition)</p>
<p><strong>Revise:</strong> the rights to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself</p>
<p><strong>Remix:</strong> the right to combine the original or revised content with other content to create something new</p>
<p><strong>Redistribute:</strong> the right to share copies of the original content, the revisions, or the remixes with others</p>
<p>As part of my ALTO role I will work closely with a specific group of staff and students exploring the use of online &lsquo;resources&rsquo; and &lsquo;learning objects&rsquo; within the curriculum of the course using Brookfield&rsquo;s (1995) four critically reflective lenses: <em>The autobiography, our student&rsquo;s eyes, our colleague&rsquo;s experiences and Theoretical literature</em>.</p>
<p>Before attempting to understand or view perspectives of others, I first need to understand my own, the educational theory I&rsquo;ve read to date has brought about a conceptual change in how I view my practice and I can now step back and reflect on the larger picture.</p>
<p>For my reading review I questioned &lsquo;how students and staff perceive and engage with open learning in the arts and how tacit and explicit knowledge can be communicated and experience online.</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;&hellip;.</em><em> With the reduction of contact time and increasing class sizes, open online learning could prove essential as the dynamic of participation changes, for example tacit and explicit knowledge is structured in new ways, peer learning is encouraged, less onus is placed on the teacher and the student becomes a lot more empowered in the community of practice.&rsquo;</em> (Reading review extract)</p>
<p>To explore the notion of &lsquo;how&rsquo; and &lsquo;why&rsquo; rich media resources could be integrated into learning and teaching methodology I first looked at my own experiences.</p>
<p>Although the following example only demonstrates a basic saving of time with reduced imparting of information, it highlighted and reaffirmed the potential, effectiveness and acceptance of our students to use rich media in their learning.</p>
<p>Example: Fine art video students were asked to watch a 10 minute video resource I posted on process.arts: <a href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/final-cut-pro-getting-started-1">http://process.arts.ac.uk/content/final-cut-pro-getting-started-1</a>. The video demonstrates the basics of getting started using Final Cut Pro (video editing software), students pulled out their head phones, sat quietly and watched through the video, they followed the instructions, following along to the directions given, at the end they were ready to start their projects. My usual approach of demonstrating these basic tasks to the group at the beginning of class often takes twice the time and students seem to be less focused and confident about their ability, in contrast to when they are self directed<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>. For the remainder of the class I would continue to teach as a group and offer one-to-one to those who would like to continue, primary focus would be technical understanding of the processes.</p>
<p>Through this experience I changed my teaching method to include a different style of interaction by reducing the time I spend &lsquo;imparting technical information&rsquo; and instead I tried focusing on the students ability to work intuitively and independently to try and &lsquo;work things out for themselves&rsquo; given the correct support and guidance. This approach resulted in more meaningful one-to-one exchanges about ideas and practice. There was a better understanding of how technical knowledge could be tailored to fit into the idea; ideas were driving the learning, not the process.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reification shapes our experience. It can do so in very concrete ways. Having a tool to perform an activity changes the nature of that activity.&rdquo; (Wenger 1998: 59)</p>
<p>I made the following changes to my teaching approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meet with students individually to discuss their      ideas and view their preparation, this is very important, ideas and      processes can change quite radically at this point, there is a sense from      the beginning of mutual understanding of each others practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Confirm a plan of action with the student on how      best next to proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Produce effective rich media online tutorials to      Impart &lsquo;generic&rsquo; technical skills to enable the students to begin their      projects independently.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ask students to view online resources I have recommend prior to any planned teaching sessions, send resources to them via UAL email.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reduce &lsquo;demonstration&rsquo; type classes in favour of      Independent working, thinking and research in a &lsquo;community of practice&rsquo;      learning environment where formal and informal learning strategies are      encouraged, e.g. student &lsquo;buddying&rsquo; where conceptual or technical      connections are found.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Face-to-face, group and one-to-one discussions      centred on ideas, problems and practice.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Explore online media as means of continuing      learning and teaching through the &lsquo;community of practice&rsquo; developing      formal and informal approaches to learning and teaching through      presentation, communication, feedback and discussion of work and ideas using      online rich media and resources. </li>
</ul>
<p>Shreeve, chapter 4 (2008) helped me reflect on my practice and general approach to teaching, I strongly relate to the paralleling and collaborating strategies associated with category 5: Integrating:</p>
<p><strong>Paralleling</strong>: &lsquo;The tutor is in effect carrying on their own practice whilst teaching and sharing that with students&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong><em>Collaborating:</em></strong><em> This strategy is about joint activities that remove the distinction between the tutor and the student. It recognises that there is little to separate the neophyte practitioner and the tutor and the sense of power relations between them is diminished&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Shreeve&rsquo;s strategies have influenced conceptual change in my practice; I am keen to explore how rich media online resource environments like ALTO can inform these strategies and enhance practice online by exploring how this approach can help course alignment and enhance deep learning.</p>
<p>Although technology is just a means to an end, academics will have to start thinking of how curriculum and teaching methodology could be adapted by integrating technology to better meet the needs of today&rsquo;s learners and the learning styles. (Njenga and Fourie p206)<strong></strong></p>
<p>Its generally unknown how OER content is going to be repurposed and reused, its thought ALTO will attract a mixture resources, mostly granular in nature, similar to those uploaded on process.arts.ac.uk, although these standalone pieces of content are interesting they are difficult to assess in terms of &lsquo;usefulness&rsquo; regarding learning aims, objectives and outcomes. Therefore these &lsquo;informal&rsquo; learning resources could be dismissed as having little or no academic significance or use to the curriculum framework.</p>
<p>The ALTO project could facilitate the gap between &lsquo;formal and informal&rsquo; learning online by encouraging the creation and use of &lsquo;learning objects&rsquo; (collections of learning resources) thematic content to inform and enhance learning activities, aims, objectives, outcomes and evaluation. (See (<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">http://ocw.mit.edu/</a> a leading example of this in practice)</p>
<p>Questions I will be exploring as part of my ongoing practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>How would a      discipline-based, cross-university online community of practice help to      overcome perceived UAL staff reluctance to create and share teaching      resources in an OER environment?</li>
<li>How can the      student voice influence the use of online resources?</li>
<li>How can rich      media OER content be re-purposed by staff and students?</li>
<li>How are OER      resources evaluated      in terms of pedagogic relevance? </li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<h4><strong>An open online resource showing day to day arts practice of staff and students at UAL.</strong></h4>
<p>process.arts.ac.uk, an open resource sharing art practice online,  featuring day-to-day studio/professional practice of staff and students  of the six colleges of the University of the Arts London, (UAL) staff  and students. OER content is tagged with #ukoer.</p>
<p>Currently anyone can view and comment on content posted on <a href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/redir.aspx?C=83212f6e40cc443a8dbd5c5a510e975a&URL=http://process.arts.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://process.arts.ac.uk/</a> only UAL staff and students can login to the site using their generic  LDAP UAL username and password, once logged in UAL users can contribute  and upload video, image, audio and text to the site. The look, feel and  functionality of the site are similar to social networking environments.<br /><br />Process.arts.ac.uk  is in its very early days, UAL staff are the primarily users to date,  most staff require assistance in the production of content including  documenting, preparing and transferring content. Students have been  involved in the project via teacher led projects including studio and  workshop recordings/documentation of processes etc some students have  submitted their own posts reflecting or documenting their studio  practice, showing examples of work in progress, all students have  managed to upload content without support. Some students and staff have  said they &lsquo;like the idea of being all together, side by side in the same  learning development space and being able browse and comment on each  other&rsquo;s ideas&rsquo;.<br /><br />University of the Arts London is predominately a  making university, the process.arts project tries to address the problem  of how staff and students document, communicate and share the explicit  and tacit teaching and learning processes involved in educational and  professional studio art practice. Learning and teaching &lsquo;problems&rsquo; could  be highlighted and resolved within this space, learning could happen  outside studio/tutorial time, enhancing the teaching and learning  experience for staff and students not replacing it.</p>]]></description>

<p>It will be&nbsp;an internet-based resource for creating virtual practical resources from basic modules. This approach will make virtual experiments truly open in that instructors can create and tailor resources according to their own&nbsp; practise and students&rsquo; needs.</p>
<p><strong>Why am I doing it?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through my participation in the JISC sponsored &ldquo;Skills for Scientists&rdquo; project, I created online experiment resources for the JorumOpen repository under Creative Commons licensing. However, making resources &ldquo;open&rdquo; does not mean they will be used, and personal experience as a laboratory coordinator suggests that academic creativity in practical learning is vital. It is therefore apparent that although &ldquo;open&rdquo; in terms of being accessed, virtual experiment OERs are &ldquo;closed&rdquo; in the sense of creative re-use. The practical sandpit will therefore&nbsp;provide a modular means for creating virtual experiments with minimum complexity in programming and resources.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The pace of current technological advancement is phenomenal. In the last few years we have seen the emergence of ever more sophisticated gaming technologies, rich, immersive virtual worlds and new social networking services that enable learners and teachers to connect and communicate in new ways. The pace of change looks set to continue as annual Horizon reports testify (<a href="http://www.nmc.org/horizon">http://www.nmc.org/horizon</a>). Clearly new technologies offer much in an educational context, with the promise of flexible, personalised and student-centred learning. Indeed research over the past few years, looking at learners&rsquo; use of technologies, has given us a rich picture of how learners of all ages are appropriating new tools within their own context, mixing different applications for finding/managing information and for communicating with others (Sharpe and Beetham, forthcoming).</p>
<p>This paper explores the question: &ldquo;What is likely to be the impact of an increasingly &lsquo;open&rsquo; technologically mediated learning environment on learning and teaching in the future? In a world where content and expertise is often free and where services are shifting to the &lsquo;cloud&rsquo;, what are the implications for education? The paper takes a particular position on the notion of &ldquo;openness&rdquo;; considering it from a broad perspective covering four major phases of the academic lifecycle: design, delivery, evaluation and research:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Open design&rdquo;:</em> what would a vision of a truly open approach to design mean; beyond open educational resources towards a more explicit representation and sharing of the whole design process? A scenario of the future might be as follows: &ldquo;A newly formed course team brainstorm their initial ideas for the course, using visual representations which make conveying and sharing the essence of their ideas easy. They share this opening with others, through appropriate web 2.0 technologies. They invite comments &ndash; from other subject experts, from past students, from potential students. They use the web 2.0 space to continue to develop and refine their ideas, incorporating peer critique and leaving a visible audit trail of their design decisions and development process.&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Open delivery&rdquo;:</em> what would adopting a more open approach to delivery mean? What will be the impact of mixing institutional systems and freely available services? How can a more dialogic engagement for learning and teaching be fostered, starting as part of the design process described above but then carried forward during the delivery process?</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Open evaluation&rdquo;:</em> How can we harness and utilise the data we collect about learners on our course? How can we build on the understanding developed as part of the learner experience research work and the associated new methodologies? What new methodologies and approaches might we develop to gain new insights into the impact of a changing technological context for learning?</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Open research&rdquo;:</em> What will be the impact of the Open Access Movement for learning? How can we capitalise on the rich research data, which is now being made available on a global scale?&nbsp;</li>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4039</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4039</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Live blogging, 13:30 - OU conference Day 2</p>
<p><strong>Talk by Doug Clow</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://ispot.org.uk/">iSpot  - Your place to share nature</a></strong></p>
<p>Doug starts by saying that (iSpot. org.uk)&nbsp; helps people to identify their  observations of nature. One can take a photo and upload it to the iSpot website,  saying what they think it is (where they saw it etc). If someone thinks it's  something else, they can identify it too. Once&nbsp;the user&nbsp;gets the confirmation of  the identification, then&nbsp;they can learn more about it - in depth information of  other observations people made about the same thing . There is a web page for  every species in iSpto, aggregating all the available content&nbsp; (including  Wikipedia) about the species of the whole world.</p>
<p>At iSpot, after making an identification, the user can see who else agrees  with it. And the individual identifiers are 'ranked' in a reputation system at  the website. Once the user makes an observation and gets feedback,&nbsp;they can  build a portfolio of pictures (as more people agree with your observation) , it  increases&nbsp; their reputation in the website. Observatiosn can be of birds, plants  etc.</p>
<p>Many people who use iSpot also take a short OU course if they wish  (Neighbourhood Nature 5159). This leads to accreditation - it's a 10-point  course. iSpot has a partnership with BBC Radio 4, helping broadcasting the  project and enabling access to 'nature experts' . iSpot is Lottery funded, and  targets under-represented groups.</p>
<p>Users give lots of &nbsp;positive feedback&nbsp;about iSpot - they like the community  of people with knowledge and enthusiasm. People say "I can't go outside now  without 'seeing' things!". 130,000 visits to the site.</p>
<p>A good user story is that a 6-year old girl spotted a moth - Euonymus Leaf  Notcher ( a rare moth in Europe). It was its first observation in the UK. That  discovery was highly publicised in newspapers etc. iSpot counts on  collaborations with a number of specialist societies.</p>
<p>Participatory Learning: research driven by the work on iSpot (Clow,  Makryannis and De Liddo). Participatory Learning is a rich way of using new  online media, Doug argues, as it is in line with&nbsp;the OU mission of inclusive  education.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/fundraising/current-priorities/heat.php">HEAT:  Health Education and Training in Africa </a></p>
<p><strong>Talk by Alison Robinson (programme coordinator)</strong></p>
<p>Challenges in Africa:&nbsp; high incidence of maternal and child mortality,</p>
<p>Live blogging, 2pm - Conference Day 2</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS&nbsp;, TB and malaria increasing, critical shortage of health workers,  inadequate facilities and equipment. In Africa there's 900 maternal deaths per  1000,000 births. Africa has 11% of the world's population.</p>
<p>HEAT helps to address critical health workers shortage. The strengths of the  HEAT program are that it delivers significant impact for relatively small  investment, and it has the potential to train hundreds of thousands of health  workers. HEAT materials can be delivered in print, online or disk.</p>
<p>The pilot country of HEAT is Ethiopia. One of the reasons is that all  post-secondary education and training in Ethiopia is taught in English. Total  population is around 81 million, of which 84% live in rural communities. Every  year around 21000 Ethiopian women die due to complication of pregancy or  childbirth. It is a country of contrasts.</p>
<p>The health extension workers in Ethiopia are paid a small salary by the  Ministry of Health.&nbsp; They need to be female, speak local language and basic  English, amongst other things. Health Extension Workers' initial training need  to be upgraded to overcome the deficiencies in their initial training, and also  because the workers are keen to have a career path. The HEAT training is  provided by distance education. Restrictions on classroom capacity and  availability of teachers would take more than 10 years to upgrade 31,000 health  education workers.&nbsp; Distance learning can be completed between 18-24 months.</p>
<p>HEAT will be an online knowledge bank of training materials, both in text and  in multimedia form, delivered as OER . It will also include self-assessment  questions, resources and toolkits with case-studies etc.</p>
<p>HEAT has the support of the Ministries of Health and Education in Ethiopia,  funded by the Allan and Nesta Ferguson Trust. There will be 16 distance  e-learning modules, each one assessed by means of a tutor-marked assignment. The  first 4 out of 16 modules are being prepared and are&nbsp;due for completion be end  of July.</p>
<p>Challenges: some authors are experiencing difficulties in writing in a second  language. They are also leanring the methodology of distance learning.</p>
<p>Alison says that the work in Ethiopia has been enourmously rewarding.</p>
<p>HEAT beyond Ethiopia: all modules will be free to download. Conversations are  taking place to localise the content to Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana and Zambia.&nbsp;  Modules are adaptable also outside Africa.</p>
<p>HEAT vision: to create a consortium of countries and organisatiosn working  together aiming to tackle social inequalities in Africa.</p>

<p>Live blogging, 3:30 pm</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://aisantos.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/600px-wikipedia-logo-svg.png"></a><a href="http://aisantos.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/wikipedia-logo.jpg"><img title="wikipedia-logo" src="http://aisantos.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/wikipedia-logo.jpg?w=249" alt="" width="249" height="300" /></a>Openness  in Education: Talk by Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy starts by &nbsp;explaining that&nbsp;at Wikipedia it is not necessarily the case  that anyone can edit everything - there's a specific group of contributors that  edit, monitor and make the content available to the world. He also explains that  there is no relationship between Wikipedia and Wikiversity.</p>
<p>Jimmy discusses a little bit about the history and scale of Wikipedia. It was  ' the great experiment', he says, being the core idea to create a global  encyclopedia supported by volunteers. The vision statement is that every single  person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge .  Wikipedia is&nbsp;defined by Jimmy as &nbsp;"a free and high quality encyclopedia written  by thousands of volunteers in many languages". Neutrality&nbsp;and quality are  extremely important at Wikipedia. He argues that a minimum level of reliability  is necessary for the encyclopedia to be respected and popular. It is managed by  a series of community processes and control. At Wikipedia the idea of neutrality  has been the core : the firm rule is that there's a neutral point of view.  Wikipedia does not take a stand on any controversial issue - the reader is free  to make their own judgement .</p>
<p>What is free access? At Wikipedia it's first freedom of speech. The texts and  the software of Wikipedia are all free. He argues that Wikipedia is not  necessarily the most helpful format of information for the students to learn  with- but everything there can be repurposed in many different ways. Wikipedia  is an encyclopedia, which means that not everything belongs to Wikipedia. IT  offers a summary of the human knowledge with the depth of the material depending  on the subject.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a charity supported by donations, the average size for donation  is about $30 (dollars), but there is obviously big funding coming from the big  players, as Google etc, says Jimmy. The core of the donations however is made by  small donours. Over 275 million people visit Wikipedia every month. Funding at  Wikipedia happens organically, he says, not necessarily 'top-down'.</p>
<p>There's about 100,00 active contributors to Wikipedia,a ll volunteers. The  site is global. There are more than 3 million entries in English, but more than  500 million entries in other languages. There are 308,000+ articles in Chinese  alone, but it's small relative to the number of Chinese speakers that are  online. Wikipedia was banned in China for over 3 years. The Chinese government  has losen up in many ways, and now Wikipedia is generally available in China,  but certain pages are banned (e.g. some things about Tibet, the independence of  Taiwan etc). It's the 53rd most popular website in China. Jimmy says that they  would like to be more popular in China, and that it's fast growing over  there.&nbsp;Wikipedia has caused a cultural impact in China, he argues.</p>
<p>Wikipedia allows for Global content comparisons. In different parts of the  world, certain content can be more or less popular. Ex. 'Sex' is popular in  every language except French and Spanish. There are certain topics that are  equally popular, such as Star Trek and&nbsp;Star Wars...</p>
<p>Question: what's next for Wikipedia? In the short term, Jimmy explains that  the three priorities for them are: 1. quality (in the large languages, e.g.  English, instead of adding more, improving quality), 2. Growth in the developing  world (by running pilot projects ), 3. Usability (the software is not as  user-friendly as they would like it to be).</p>
<p>Question: Many educators are asking students to create Wikipedia pages, what  are your views on that? Answer: sometimes excited, sometimes not as much. It  depends on how the project is structured - quality is needed, and this usually  happens when the students are given appropriate background.</p>
<p>Question: How has been quality control over the years, and how have you dealt  with that? Answer: Several phases related to quality control, the most famous  quality problem beying vandalism.However, this is the problem we have&nbsp;lots  of&nbsp;hands on. Issues of bias for example, related to less popular and  controversial topics (e.g. Palestine, scientology etc). These articles are  closely monitored and are of high quality. More obscure topics (that people do  not care about much), are also problematic, because there are not &nbsp;many people  monitoring them. We are trying to get a system in which we can go through the  less popular topics, and that's a challenge for the future, I think - says  Jimmy.</p>
<p>Question: how is consensus generated? Answer: there's a pretty informal  mechanism to reach consensus, but it's mostly based on the issue of neutrality,  as I mention before. We developed some techniques over the years, as for  example, mentioning many different sides of the same story.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a very innovative way of sharing content, and it was an  insightful talk by Jimmy Wales.</p>]]></description>

              <title>E-learning Africa 2010: Using, Sharing and Repurposing OER</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3994</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3994</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>E-learning Africa &nbsp;2010 was held in Lusaka, Zambia, from 25th-28th May. There were over 1700 participants, and delegates had a varied professional background: local school teachers, lecturers, researchers, politicians and staff of various Ministries in Africa (education, health, international relations etc). The conference had therefore a number of different strands and dozens of parallel sessions to choose from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here I include a link to a blog post that I wrote about the conference at <a href="http://aisantos.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/e-learning-africa-using-sharing-and-repurposing-oer/">Open Content Online</a>, which contains an account of the conference, some photos and the power point slides that I used in my presentation (presentation also embedded below). I focused on the subject of copyright and licensing of educational materials, and showcased some experiences &nbsp;of the OU UK with sharing resources internationally through <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn">OpenLearn</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of my visit to Zambia, however, was the visit I paid to Aisha Project School. It is a community School (not supported by the government) in which there is a huge effort to include ICT use in the regular teaching practices of the school. Part of this effort is supported by the <a href="http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/centres/cce/projects/ictzambia/">OER4Schools </a>Project, funded by Cambridge University UK. The aim of the project is to help adopting and enhancing ICT use in the school by using enquiry-based learning. In summary and very simplistically, enquiry-based learning usually starts with a scenario, facilitated by a tutor, and the students are encouraged to come up with their own issues and questions. It is interesting to see how this type of pedagogy has been used with open education resources at Aisha Project School. To know more about their experience, please watch the interview with Mr Brighton Lubasi, Aisha ICT Manager and volunteer teacher.</p>
<p>I considered E-learning Africa to be a very interesting event, as it brought examples of practices in many fields in e-learning, to include mobile learning and a number of projects which &nbsp;explore the use of sports (e.g. football, World cup event etc) to capture the students' attention to learn new concepts (e.g. physics) and develop &nbsp;number of skills (e.g. confidence, team building, vision etc).</p>
<p>The info gathered at E-learning Africa about the use of OER contributes to the pool of information that we at <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/edit/olnet.org">OLnet</a> are putting together in an attempt to create an international landscape of OER practices ( examples, barriers and enablers) - coming soon here in Cloudworks.&nbsp;</p>

I teach on A215, which is taught online except for two day schools. My hope was that this video would personalise the experience a bit more for the students, as well as reinforcing some key information at the start of the course. I included the link in my introductory email to them."</p>]]></description>

<p>This particular presentation has had a number of iterations because of technical issues, which has been a good learning experience for a number of people.&nbsp; For the moment I am adding the presentations but I will come back and add a description of what was done and how.</p>
<p>Comments from Janet "I'd like to make a contribution to this conference.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;a collaborative wiki-based&nbsp;activity I have deleloped for our Evolution course (S366).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the link to teh wiki with&nbsp;the live activity is&nbsp;currently being used by S366 students, so it will only be available to those with access to the course website."</p>
<p>"Instead I have made my contribution a powerpoint presentation with video clips and sound which plays automatically, and I have uploaded it to slideshare. However, when I try to view it there, none of the video clips or the sound plays."</p>
<p>"My version of Powerpoint is 2003, as installed on my OU laptop.&nbsp; The camera, microphone with which the clips were recorded were all done with borrowed equipment on someone else's computer in the Regional Centre" (logitech quick cam software set up on Windows XP&nbsp;desktop PC with headphones and mouthpiece).</p>

              <title>From Open Content to Open Thinking</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3947</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3947</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>We propose that one of the barriers to adoption of Open Educational Resources (OERs) in common teaching practices is the lack of transparency of practitioners&rsquo; &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; around the production and consumption of those resources.</p>
<p>Thefore we propose to move from a paradigm of <em>opening up contents</em> and OER to a paradigm of <em>opening up people&rsquo;s thinking about OERs</em>.</p>
<p>Our objective is to make this thinking visible and exportable in a way that support the emergence of collective intelligence around OER. To cater for this we designed <a href="http://cohere.open.ac.uk/">Cohere</a>, a first prototype socio-technical infrastructure to gather Collective Intelligence around OER.</p>
<p>You can explore more these concepts by looking at the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AnnaDeLiddo/edmedia2010-de-liddo">PPT presentation</a> embedded here below. This is a presentation  for Ed-Media 2010 Conference, http://www.aace.org/conf/edmedia/, to be  held in Toronto, Canada, June 29 &ndash;July 2, 2010.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about <a href="http://cohere.open.ac.uk/">Cohere</a> you can also watch the movie, embedded here below, from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKykgBo-zGI&feature=player_embedded">submission to the Mozzilla Firefox Competition 2009: Jetpack for Learning</a>. In this movie we explain how Cohere can be used to enhance Web-Annotation to more effective learning.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<div>
<p><strong>Part of the <a href="http://olnet.org/" target="_blank">OLnet Project</a>'s mission is to investigate the   socio-technical infrastructure that will assist the Open Education movement in pooling   its "</strong><a href="http://olnet.org/node/102"><strong>collective   intelligence</strong></a><strong>". <br /></strong></p>
OLnet seeks to advance the movement's collective intelligence by   pooling the many different layers of evidence, that currently exist in   disconnected forms, on the use, reuse and unerstanding of Open Educational Resources. We are therefore considering a collective intelligence infrastructure as one way to:   
<ul>
<li>Invite your stories, informal feedback, or formal evaluation results   concerning a particular Open Educational Resource</li>
<li>Invite your inside knowledge of how the Open Educational Resource was designed (<strong>OER   Design Methods</strong>)</li>
<li>Invite your experiences and insights on tackling major challenges   facing the Open Education movement (<strong>OER Grand Challenges</strong>, e.g.   Organisational Obstacles, Remixing, IP Clearance...)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We invite feedback on the design storyboard of the Collective Intelligence infrastructure (please watch the video embedded here below).<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions for you are therefore...</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>What do you think of this design storyboard?<br /> </em></li>
<li><em>What would make these widgets 'killer apps' for you?</em><br /> ...so that you'd want to have these on your website, e.g. as an OER   educator, learner, publisher, remixer, researcher, funder...? Depending   on which hat(s) you wear, you might ask yourself:<br /> <em>What would I  like to know about an OER before deciding to use it  to learn, or teach  with?<br /> What would I like to know about the state of the art in a  given  debate, before deciding whether to enter it, or fund work on it?</em></li>
</ol>

The scope of the day will include presentations from the C-SAP Open Educational Resources project, findings from current C-SAP mini-project focused around e-learning, and a &lsquo;show and share&rsquo; session in the afternoon offering an opportunity to disseminate examples of practice from across our disciplinary networks.<br /><br /><strong>Morning Session</strong><br />Opening Keynote Neil Selwyn, London Knowledge Lab.<br />Neil Selwyn is sociologist working at the London Knowledge Lab. His research and teaching focuses on the place of digital media in everyday life, and the sociology of technology (non)use in educational settings.<br /><strong><br />Dissemination from the Open Educational Resources Project</strong><br />This will provide an opportunity to showcase, discuss, and reflect upon the work of the C-SAP &ldquo;Open Educational Resources&rdquo; project. Our project, &ldquo;Evaluating the Practice of Opening up Resources for Learning and Teaching in the Social Sciences&rdquo;, was part of a pilot programme (funded by the HEA and JISC), which sought to explore issues around the sharing of educational material from a disciplinary perspective. Whilst exploring, with our academic project partners, the principles and issues around releasing educational material (institutional, contractual, administrative), we have also sought to develop some insights into the processes of sharing practice, and look forward to discussing the findings in this forum.<br /><br /><strong>Afternoon Session</strong><br /><br /><strong>Call for Papers: Invited show and share presentations</strong><br />Alongside dissemination from recent C-SAP mini-project award holders, we offer an open invitation to submit abstracts for a &lsquo;show and share&rsquo; session around the use of e-learning within the social sciences. Some themes to consider might be:<br /><br />- Tools and techniques;<br />- e-Feedback and e-assessment;<br />- Collaborative development (working with peers to create materials);<br />- Disciplinary and curriculum practices;<br />- Staff development and organisational contexts;<br />- Student perspectives and expectations.<br /><br />If you would like to offer a show and share presentation, please complete the abstracts template and email the document to Darren Marsh, C-SAP Web and e-Learning co-ordinator (darren.marsh@c-sap.bham.ac.uk) <strong>by 14 June 2010</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Booking</strong><br />The event is free to attend, please use the online registration form to register: booking link: <a href="https://www.bhamonlineshop.co.uk/events/eventdetails.asp?eventid=162">https://www.bhamonlineshop.co.uk/events/eventdetails.asp?eventid=162</a>.<br /><br />If you require any other information please contact Frances Worrall by email f.l.worrall@bham.ac.uk or telephone: 0121 414 2995</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract<br /></strong></p>
<p>The paper will explore the question: &ldquo;What is likely to be the impact of an increasingly &lsquo;open&rsquo; technologically mediated learning environment on learning and teaching in the future? In a world where content and expertise is often free and where services are shifting to the &lsquo;cloud&rsquo;, what are the implications for education? The paper takes a particular position on the notion of &ldquo;openness&rdquo;; considering it from a broad perspective covering four major phases of the academic lifecycle: design, delivery, evaluation and research:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Open design&rdquo;:</em> what would a vision of a truly open approach to design mean; beyond open educational resources towards a more explicit representation and sharing of the whole design process? A scenario of the future might be as follows: &ldquo;A newly formed course team brainstorm their initial ideas for the course, using visual representations which make conveying and sharing the essence of their ideas easy. They share this opening with others, through appropriate web 2.0 technologies. They invite comments &ndash; from other subject experts, from past students, from potential students. They use the web 2.0 space to continue to develop and refine their ideas, incorporating peer critique and leaving a visible audit trail of their design decisions and development process.&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Open delivery&rdquo;:</em> what would adopting a more open approach to delivery mean? What will be the impact of mixing institutional systems and freely available services? How can a more dialogic engagement for learning and teaching be fostered, starting as part of the design process described above but then carried forward during the delivery process?</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Open evaluation&rdquo;:</em> How can we harness and utilise the data we collect about learners on our course? How can we build on the understanding developed as part of the learner experience research work and the associated new methodologies? What new methodologies and approaches might we develop to gain new insights into the impact of a changing technological context for learning?</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Open research&rdquo;:</em> What will be the impact of the Open Access Movement for learning? How can we capitalise on the rich research data, which is now being made available on a global scale? </li>
</ul>
<p>The paper will consider these four aspects of openness, will suggest some underlying principles to adopting an &ldquo;open&rdquo; approach, reflecting on perceived benefits and challenges. It will draw on research at the Open University, UK. In particular, our work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning Design (where we are developing tools and resources to help teachers design better learning experiences) </li>
<li>Open Educational Resources and in particular articulation of the associated set of Open Educational Practices around the creation, use and management of OER</li>
<li>Changing patters of user behaviour and discourse through a new kind of social networking space, Cloudworks.</li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The aim of this research programme is to explore the impact that an increasingly &lsquo;open&rsquo; technologically mediated learning environment will have on learning in the future. In a world where content and expertise is often free and where services are shifting to the &lsquo;cloud&rsquo;, what are the implications for education? This paper describes the research programme, which takes a particular position on the notion of &lsquo;openness&rsquo;, considering it from a broad perspective covering each major phase of the academic lifecycle: design, delivery, evaluation and research.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Suggested OER Reading List (for Academics New to OER)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3487</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3487</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>We would like to build up a suggested reading list for academics who  are new to OER and would welcome suggestions in this cloud either as  comments or links below.</strong></p>
<p>SCORE is a HEFCE-funded project (2009-2012) based at The Open University supporting individuals, projects, institutions and programmes within higher education in England who are engaged in creating, sharing and using open educational resources (OER). As well as publishing its own OER content, SCORE has a fellowship scheme, offers support and advice, mentors UK OER projects, offers events and online community support.<br /><br />A central part of SCORE is its fellowship scheme. SCORE expect to fund 36 fellowship projects between 2010 and 2012 with two thirds drawn from outside the OU. Fellows work is expected to inform, influence and impact on OER policy and practice across the higher education sector. Projects may be &lsquo;stand-alone&rsquo; or involve collaborations with other fellowship projects to address important themes in OER activity.<br /><br />Based flexibly at the OU in Milton Keynes, fellows can draw on the OU&rsquo;s expertise in creating, sharing and using OER. They will receive support from the SCORE team, mentors and the OU&rsquo;s OER fellowship community (which includes Open Learning Network (OLnet) international fellows).&nbsp; This reading list will be a useful resource not only for SCORE and OLnet fellows but also an open resource for anyone who is interested in finding out more about OER.<br /><br />For more information about SCORE: <a href="http://www8.open.ac.uk/score/" target="_blank">http://www8.open.ac.uk/score/</a><br />For more information about OLnet: <a href="http://olnet.org/" target="_blank">http://olnet.org/</a></p>]]></description>

To explore the way in which the spoken word and the written word can be used to communicate with the world. He presented a wide range of examples from the obscure specialised inaugural lecture, to the popular TV programmes and books. Now his Gresham lectures are available on youtube and his OU content presented to students on line.</p>
<p>His final comments were on the way that obscure research writing remains valued more than writing for the public.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Tim Unwin (UNESCO Chair in ICT for Development at Royal Holloway)</p>
<p>A recorded presentation of the way in which OER can influence development &ndash; leading with the issue of why OER is not more widely used in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa where there are significant initiatives).&nbsp; Content and licences as the meaning of OER is not enough in his view the need is to address &ldquo;open integrated learning contexts&rdquo; and the African crafting of &ldquo;knowledges&rdquo;. Co-creating new knowledges. There are several perceived benefits cited on the UNESC OER Wiki but the reality in Africa is that much is led from North America and Europe. On the UNESCO discussion less than18% African (mainly South Africa). Similarly the stories on the OER Wiki and projects on WikiEducator are predominantly non-African implying that there is an imperialist push to content.</p>
<p>Perceived needs in Africa reflect lack of content, high cost of books, poor quality teaching, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of understanding of benefits of technologies.</p>
<p>His own experience coves several projects leading to the ICT3D Collective. In each case trying to build shared capacities in using ICTs in educational delivery.&nbsp; He was self-critical about the impact of some of this work &ndash; tagging content and trying to make it available for different platforms has had limited impact. Though work on African Storytelling has been more successful. With good intentions though why has success been so limited.</p>
<p>Often blamed:</p>
<ul>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bandwidth</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electricity</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; computers</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of software</li>
</ul>
<p>But these are not the real issues. Rather:</p>
<ul>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes in personnel &ndash; key importance of leaders</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Funding mechanisms</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time commitment</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to understand meanings &ndash; more than just computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>So need to recognise practical realities:</p>
<ul>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the structure and financing of African universities</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; didactic model of teaching</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; role and income of university teachers</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intellectual elitism &ndash; to serve development needs</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dependency (on grants)</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; human capacity</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dominance of individualism</li>
</ul>
<p>There are ways forward though in building more sustained work in Africa, but also in actions that need to be taken in working with OER in UK: does it match to the direction that UK education is developing? Do we use OER ourselves? Are they of good enough quality? Can we find the time that is need to work with and learn from Africa.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Oxford OER examples: OpenSpire</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3400</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3400</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Peter Robinson led off a session demonstrating the OER work from Oxford University.&nbsp; The OpenSpires work had the dual aims of making talks and lectures available as OER, and to share the institutional implications of that work.. This built on the successful release of content by Oxford on iTunesU with &gt;3million downloads. The iTunesU licence limits to &ldquo;personal use&rdquo; which is more restrictive than desirable. Content across all topics and different types &ndash; with success in recording student-tutor discussions. Examples shown from publc speakers (Gordon Brown), museum collections, straight lectures, illustrated lectures, &hellip; . The central podcasting service used a role out approach to bring in self-recordings as well as supported recordings.&nbsp; Aim to minimise the time required &ndash; ideally to the time the event takes. Overall a syndication approach has been taken with the vision that eventually an ensemble of content from different providers can be constructed.</p>
<p>Reasons to share: personal, reputation, altruism, reward. The contributions should be sustainable as impact is fairly high.</p>
<p>Examples included:</p>
<p>a Philosophy lecturer (Marianne Talbot) who released a podcast of a lecture that then became the global No.1 on iTunesU. Making her possibly the &ldquo;most heard philosopher in the world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>An Art historian (Martin Kemp) described a seminar on how to validate whether or not a Leonardo Da Vinci manuscript is in fact genuine. Important to him was to be able to release his content with the implied quality of the Oxford University and also to then lead into further funding from the Gates Foundation. His own personal profile as a speaker, writer and broadcaster is supported by the free availability of his work.</p>
<p>Tristram Wyatt described how existing work on online study skills from Oxford and South Africa to be openly available and adaptable. The switch to having a changeable resource made them more useful. The investment in the content was fairly high compared to podcasts which has restricted how they have been able to go beyond an initially funded activity.</p>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3398</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Q: Considering OER content subject areas and types &ndash; what is most popular, what works well?</p>
<p>A: Jan &ndash; European Schoolnet has considered this around sharing resources and have looked at what travels well across borders. Their findings include the more visual that text based, science over humanities. This data is at school level however.</p>
<p>A: Andy &ndash; surprisingly varied. E.g current top 10 includes law, Welsh history, polymer engineering. Reasons also vary &ndash; topicality, links to courses, promotion, regional difference. Also difficult to track use that does not happen on site.</p>
<p>A: Oxford iTunesU data &ndash; e.g. entrepeneurship material. Science Enterprise took off tremendously &ndash; but not for obvious reasons. Brought benefits to the Business School through open availability.</p>
<p>A: Visual approach has attracted many people and encouraged creativity.</p>
<p>Q: Sara from Strategic Content Alliance. Is the user generated content monitored in any way?</p>
<p>A: Andy &ndash; we do not do any monitoring. The split site approaches allows more experimental approach in LabSpace.</p>
<p>Q: Melissa Highton &ndash; are there examples of local initiatives that offered training and incentives?</p>
<p>A: Jan &ndash; not much to say on training. For incentives &ndash; he has heard that MIT staff have used the OER as a factor in demonstrating pedagogic skills in an open and measured way for salary negotiation.</p>
<p>A: Andy &ndash; The Open University has used the student feedback in courses for reward and recognition. OER provide another factor that is more transferable to campus-based intitutions.</p>
<p>Q: Sheila Webber from Sheffield. There are individual motivations for publishing OER rather than institutional. Particularly hard to motivate reuse.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Giving Knowledge for Free: Jan Hylen</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3397</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3397</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Coming in via video-conferencing to talk about the work that he carried out for the OECD to produce the &ldquo;Giving Knowledge for Free&rdquo; report.&nbsp; (Some initial difficulties hit the presentation of the slides but soon sorted out.)</p>
<p>The basis for the work was recognising the &ldquo;new culture of openness in HE&rdquo; through open source software, open access, open educational resources. The study reported in 2007 looked at the activities through 4 dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>IPR issues</li>
<li>Cost/benefits (sustainability)</li>
<li>Incentives</li>
<li>How to improve access and usefulness</li>
</ol>
<p>Used the OER definition derived by UNESCO with a broad view of OER as including the tools, repositories and different scales of content. A broad definition is appropriate to be inclusive of new actions that are hard to predict.</p>
<p>Drivers for OER can be divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technological (bandwidth, capacity, improved software)</li>
<li>Social (digital natives, desire for interactivity, willingness to share, communities and collaborations).</li>
<li>Economic (lower costs, free hosting, models for monetising user created content)</li>
<li>Legal (Creative Commons licensing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Survey based approach to mapping the field had limited success when targeting universities directly with better indication from an open survey that could be completed by enthusiastic individuals. The result though cannot be seen as authoritative.</p>
<p>OER were targeted at post-secondary instructors, students and general public. The barrierless approach meant data was limited.</p>
<p>Types of initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publicly/institutionally backed e.g.s: OCW/OpenLearn/OpenSpires</li>
<li>Community approach: Open Course, Common Content, Free Curricula Center, &hellip;</li>
<li>In between (hybrid) models: MERLOT, Connexions, ARIADNE.</li>
</ul>
<p>The initiatives can be mapped on dimensions from small to big and institutional to community.</p>
<p>The report in 2007 was followed up in 2008 with a short study of six key initiatives that showed rapid increase in resources, visitors and diversity (languages and global use). The trends were towards less text and more video. And from individual enthusiasts to management adoption and institution recognition.</p>
<p>The US based data from MIT and Tufts implied users were well-educated, self-learners, from North America (note 57% were non-US visits and so no longer so likely to be true).</p>
<p>Use by learners was often as a supplement, in small chunks. Use by educators was limited by lack of time, skills and reward system.</p>
<p>A table of motivations reflected government (expanding access), institutional (altruism, sharing for improvement, attracting students) and individual reasons (supporting community, non-monetary gain, no reason not to go open).</p>
<p>Challenges remain quality, IPR, etc. For example quality can be centralised or decentralised, open or closed. IPR raises practical difficulties such as creative commons use of the non-commercial clause and what it means.</p>
<p>A sustainability checklist was produced to help guide towards sustainability &ndash; linking to grants, other activity (charge for extra content, paper versions), membership models. The contributor pays.</p>
<p>Policy implications at the institutional level reflect the &ldquo;risk of doing nothing&rdquo; and the need to have an IT strategy that recognises Open Access and OER, addressing the training and support and incentives for people to use and produce OER.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Andy Lane.</p>
<p>Content, Collaboration and Innovation: Past, Present and Future. OER can be considered as an extension of how universities have gone beyond their borders &ndash; with outreach. Andy reviewed the motivations that The Open University had for becoming involved in OER &ndash; movement, commitment to social justice, reputation, formal/informal cross-over, test-bed, sharing in as well as out (perhaps reducing costs), and a basis for collaboration.</p>
<p>The three space approach of OpenLearn &ndash; route in and information, safe space for learning (LearningSpace), more experimental &ldquo;educator space&rdquo; (LabSpace) is changing to bring in the many other pieces of content that reaches out from the OU &ndash; the OU/BBC open2.net, iTunesU, YouTube, Facebook and SCORE. With an additional outward looking research network provided by OLnet.</p>
<p>LearningSpace &ndash; has allowed OU to develop experience with offering a direct learning environment for open resources (based on Moodle) and how working with content in XML has provided freedom for the user to choose the format that they need if downloading, and the environment plus additional tools the opportunity to learn with the content <em>in situ</em>. Findings are that &ldquo;content is the hook&rdquo; with the OpenLearn proving flexibility for trying content out and building their own mix and match set that interests them as individuals.</p>
<p>Now nearly 10m unique visitors &ndash; of whom 126,000 have registered. 60,000 download &ldquo;print&rdquo; versions every month. But remains difficult to assess the value &ndash; with some clear examples emerging (eg Daniel Conn Time Online) and indications of recruitment through to the Open University and bothThere are also examples of the content being reworked into new forms and delivered through alternative platforms.</p>
<p>Looking forward &ndash; the lasting result of OpenLearn has been to encourage Open Innovation. There are now many different projects and activity, with new links to collaboration and new plans for the way the site works.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>OpenSpires is the Oxford University OER initiative sponsored by JISC and HEFCE, from May 2009 to April 2010. The aim of the initiative is twofold: 1) to provide the University's audio and video resources available online for free to a wide audience and 2) to enable the institution to investigate the impact and implications of making its resources available as OER.</p>
<p>Like most UK institutions, Oxford also licenses their content under the Creative Commons License,&nbsp;<a style="color: #0066ff; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: initial;" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/">BY-NC-SA</a>.

<p>Most of the content at OpenSpires is in the form of audio podcasts. This is because the University decided to build upon their ITunesU initiative. There are over 100 podcasts available at the moment. They can be found at&nbsp;<a style="color: #0066cc; text-decoration: none;" href="http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/">http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk</a>.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The initiative aims to serve as a window onto the courses provided by the University of Nottingham, and to increase learning opportunities for learners who cannot undertake formal qualifications. It also aims to advance pedagogy across the academic community. Open courseware is a term used to describe collections of educational materials that are freely available on the WEB, often available for translating and repurposing.</p>
<p>The U-Now materials are &nbsp;licensed under the Creative Commons license&nbsp;<a title="http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/" href="http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike UK 2.0 Licence (BY-NC-SA)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resources are offered in the form of PDF, Word doc, podcasts and ZIP files, and &nbsp;are offered on a variety of subjects: history, physics, psychology, business, mathematics, languages, film studies etc.</p>
<p>Where appropriate the content is SCORM conformant to support interoperability between VLEs. However, not all content is suitable for this format, mp3 for example.</p>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3204</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Open Exeter is a JISC-funded project to release existing learning resources as OER, under a suitable license for content use and reuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project was launched in May 2009, with the target to make available content equivalent to 360 study credits in their academic system. &nbsp;They aim to embed OER provision into their mainstream content production in the University. They envisage to administrate the production and publication process of the material by using an Information Technology Infrastructure Library system.</p>
<p>Open Exeter chose to adopt the Creative Commons License, attribution, non-commercial, share-alike (cc-by-nc-sa). They are working towards a&nbsp;streamlined copyright clearance system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interoperability of systems is also a concern to OpenExeter, so the materials they are launching can be downloaded as ZIP files, and are releases in the IMS Content Package format, too. At present, their VLE is Moodle.</p>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2978</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2978</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>A new cloudscape has been created to make commenting on individual contributions easier.&nbsp; Please see </strong><a href="/cloudscape/view/2128"><strong>http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2128</strong></a><strong>&nbsp; for a a full list of contributions and links to clouds for each one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>See below for the original call</strong></p>
<p>Want to contribute something about your project, work or research to the OU conference taking place online on 22 to 23 June 2010? We'd love to have it! Unlike previous conferences where papers are selected, we want non-paper based contributions and we accept anything (as long as it's relevant and not rude).</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>First create a digital artefact for us and upload it somewhere - some examples formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://slideshare.net">Slideshare</a> presentation</li>
<li><a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> video</li>
<li><a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> photos</li>
<li>Another Cloud in Cloudworks</li>
</ul>
<p>But you may choose another format (eg an <a href="http://xtranormal.com">Xtranormal</a> movie).</p>
<p>Then post your link below in the comments. If it is an embeddable format (eg YouTube), then I will add it in to this cloud, so all the content is visible here, and if not I'll add it as a link.</p>
<p>In the conference programme we have four discussion sessions where hopefully we can draw on these inputs. To have your contribution considered for inclusion in the main programme the <strong>deadline is 16 June</strong>.</p>
<p>We'd love to hear about your project and for you to help us explore the concept, perspectives and issues around openness in education.</p>
<p>You need to be registered in Cloudworks to submit content.&nbsp; The details of the overall conference are in the cloudscape: <a href="/cloud/view/2994">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2012</a>&nbsp;and the programme is in the cloud: <a href="/cloud/view/2994">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2994</a>.</p>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2782</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Establishing an OER institutional Project requires a number of actions on different fronts: the identification of a model for OER production, the engagement of staff members and a closer look at current business models.</p>
<p>This is a very vast topic for discussion but in this cloud we'll try to raise some of the important issues on institutional projects based on our own experience at the Open University UK and on the experience of our colleagues from other institutions across the world.</p>
<p>Some resources for our discussion are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sections <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit/Institutional_OER_Projects">6</a> and <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit/Setting_up_Your_OER_Project">7</a> of the <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit/About_this_toolkit">UNESCO OER Toolkit</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;presents a discussion on strategy, funding and technologies that can be used in an institutional project;</li>
<li>a video by Engin Kursun &nbsp;on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKUgxPUkvX8">Initiating an OCW Project</a>;</li>
<li>links to resources on' business models' kindly offered by Jacky Hood of the College Open Textbooks, Silicon Valley, USA</li>
</ul>
<div>So, from your experience, what are the advantages &amp; challenges of starting an institutional OER initiative?</div>

The answer will affect the tools you use, the license you apply, and how you share the content with your audience.">section 5</a> a nice and simple briefing on how to create and store content. It also briefly touches on reuse by mentioning wikis as a possible way to change content.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=16555">OpenLearn Research Report</a> &nbsp;(pg 28-32) is a very interesting resource to understand how existing educational materials can be transformed into OER, and also brings a discussion of the types of user that tend to access these resources and the modes of use (pg 32-60).</p>
<p>We have already discussed the <a href="http://olnet.org/node/119">barriers to remixing OER </a>but can we now discuss the main motivations? Why would a teacher/lecturer want to create and share the content they produce? 'What's in it for them?'</p><p>Contact details: Andreia Santos - a.i.santos@open.ac.uk</p>]]></description>

IT proposes a move from an individualistic and solitary teaching activity to a more collaborative one, involving a range of professionals: e.g. other teachers, media specialists and curriculum designers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supported Open Teaching is a perspective that complements the well-known Supported Open Learning pedagogy of the OU UK, and is geared towards the use of OER.</p>
<p>But the question is: How can we support "Supported Open Teaching"? Practical ideas are welcome...</p><p>Contact details: Andreia Santos - a.i.santos@open.ac.uk</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Today our focus will be on finding and using OER. <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit/Finding_and_Using_Open_Educational_Resources">Section 4 of the UNESCO OER Toolkit</a> presents a list of repositories to help practitioners find licensed content.</p>
<p>The toolkit also suggests that there is a set of requirements that are necessary for the resources to be of acceptable standards to use, but what are they?</p>
<p><strong>"It can be a frustrating experience trying to find good quality, appropriate and clearly licensed resources in the mass of existing material".</strong></p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit">UNESCO OER Toolkit</a>&nbsp;is a document produced by the OER community to the community itself. It represents the collective voice of the ones involved in providing and using OER, and points to some of the most relevant issues the community faces. An overview of the document is available <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit/About_this_toolkit">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week we will take a look at this document (and other related OER material) with the aim to promote reflective practice. &nbsp;Have we at OLnet been addressing the main research needs of the OER community? And what is the impact of our research? These are the overarching questions for us to bear in mind throughout the week.</p>
<p>In the first sections of the document, the OER toolkit brings to the fore the following ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the toolkit is aimed at developing countries in the southern hemisphere;</li>
<li>that universities in the southern hemisphere would benefit enormously with the use of OER, by decreased costs and increased access;</li>
<li>that there is an assumption that knowledge flows from developed to developing countries;</li>
<li>that not enough attention has been paid to the needs of the institutions in the southern hemisphere;</li>
<li>that more 'systematic' research into OER is needed, since all we know so far is '"anecdotal and shared only with a community of insiders" (section 2, Where next?)</li>
</ul>
<div>To what extent are these statements fair? How is our research relevant in this scenario? What other questions do these ideas raise? And finally, &nbsp;how can OLnet push this and/or other OER agendas forward?</div>
<p>In order to have some more food for thought here are some resource suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sections <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit/Background_to_Open_Educational_Resources">one</a> and <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit/The_Emergence_of_Open_Education">two</a>&nbsp;of the <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit">UNESCO OER Toolkit</a> (<em>Background to Open Educational Resources</em> and &nbsp;<em>The Emergence of Open Education</em>);</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>OLnet &amp; OER: How do our practices reflect and inform the&nbsp;world out there?</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the OLnet pilot virtual workshop. The aim of this workshop is to serve as a test bed for the OLnet team and guests on how to run a virtual workshop on OER (structure, tools, activities etc).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week we aim to use the <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit">UNESCO OER Toolkit</a>, the <a href="http://www.wikieducator.org/OER_Handbook/educator">OER Handbook</a> and the <a href="/cloud/view/2745 ">OpenLearn&nbsp;Research &nbsp;Report</a>&nbsp;as sources of information to prompt our discussions and reflections.</p>
<p>The plan is for us to reflect upon our own practices and discuss the ways in which we can better serve the OER community through our research, at the same time drawing on the community needs to drive our work.</p>
<p>The workshop runs from the 7th-11th Dec 2009, entirely online and counting on both synchronous and asynchronous activities and events. The&nbsp;workshop&nbsp;takes place&nbsp;mostly&nbsp; on <a href="/">Cloudworks</a>, and the activities and discussions will be released day by day. Please refer to the section "<a href="/cloud/view/2728">A. Programme</a>" on&nbsp; Cloudworks everytime you want to know what is going on. Alternatively, visit the '<a href="http://olnet.org/workshops">Workshops</a>'&nbsp;area of the <a href="http://olnet.org/">OLnet website</a>. In there you can access the programme and have a look at the '<a href="http://olnet.org/node/166">Noticeboard</a>' to get all the latest information and news about the event.</p>
<p>The <a href="/cloud/view/2728">pre-virtual workshop activities</a> are designed to help you get grips with technology we will use prior to the workshop, and also to get to know each other better. In case you have any questions about the virtual workshop or tools, please email me anytime at <a href="mailto:a.i.santos@open.ac.uk">a.i.santos@open.ac.uk</a>, and I will do my best to help.</p>
<p>A couple of helpful things to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>To navigate through the activities of the day, please use the<em> links </em>in the workshop area entitled 'Programme', then click on the corresponding day of the week (the links will take you straight to the webpages you need); </li>
<li>If you Twitter, the hashtag for the event is #olnetvw (vw= virtual workshop).</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to participate as much or as little as you can, but remember that the more you engage with the programme the better will be the overall outcome, because it is our collaborative work that will make it all happen!</p>
<p>Enjoy it! &nbsp;:-)</p>

              <title>What are the main barriers to reusing/remixing OERs?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2594</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2594</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>[First published at: <a href="http://olnet.org/node/119">http://olnet.org/node/119</a>]</p>
<p>In the <a title="OLnet home page" href="http://olnet.org/">OLnet</a> team we lately started a collaborative process of "reflecting" on Open Educational Resources reuse/remix challenges. In order to understand what these challenges may be we tried to answer to the following questions:</p>
<p>Why reusing/remixing and Open Educational Resource?</p>
<p>What are the barriers to reusing/remixing OERs?</p>
<p><a href="/index.php/cloud/view/2432">Liam cloud</a> summarized the answers that the OLnet team members proposed to the first question. In this Blog Post I just open for discussion and improvements the list of 20 barriers to OERs reuse/remix that the OLnet team identified as answer to the second question. Are this all the possible barriers? Are these the rights ones? We need help to enrich, revise, question and discuss this list with a wider group. If you have any idea, answer, or barrier to add to the list please add it in the comments, this would help enriching this collaborative reflecting exercise.</p>
<h2>What are the barriers to reusing/remixing OERs?</h2>
<p>1) Internationalization, OERs may be available but in a different language;</p>
<p>2) Cognitive overload: it is difficult to separate the 'content' from the 'context' in a OER, thus it is difficult to decontextualize an OER and re-contextualize it to a different learning context/purpose;</p>
<p>3) Cognitive overload: in terms of trying to illicit the implicit design of an OER and then needing to create a new design;</p>
<p>4) Cognitive overload due to Lack of good examples/ best practice:&nbsp; "remixing" an OER is a difficult concept to grasp, especially as examples of remixing might be difficult to find or something you wouldn't tend to stumble across;</p>
<p>5) Digital divide: lack of access to digital network implies no access to digital resources;</p>
<p>6) Digital divide: lack of digital literacy;</p>
<p>7) Lack of teacher's preparation and training in how to reuse OERs;</p>
<p>8) Distance from main stream teaching and learning practices and policy;</p>
<p>9) Curriculum alignment: OER may not fit specific curriculum, and vice-versa curriculums may not be designed around an OER reuse/remix culture;</p>
<p>10) Plagiarism: to which extent reusing and remixing an OER can be perceived as a form of plagiarism?;</p>
<p>11) Lack of technical support for teachers; institutionalized support i.e. a dedicated educational technologist team is considered important for promoting re-use within different educational instituions/contexts (relates to digital and socio-economic divides)</p>
<p>12) Copyright issues and different copyright jurisdictions: this is mostly about publishing original OERs, but it also relates to the ways in which an OER is 'translated' to different contexts/locations. It also hinders what other items, media objects can be added that are more relevant to a national culture / pedagogical context;</p>
<p>13) Lack of confidence: many teachers/tutors feel reluctant to reuse and publish their reused materials. One possible reason for that is that they feel that they tamper with something that was designed/published for a specific purpose/context; this relate with the Conceptual overload mentioned at point 2);</p>
<p>14) Lack of confidence: many teachers/tutors feel reluctant to "mess up" with someone else "good" design;</p>
<p>15) Lack of explicit learning design supporting the representation of resources and dialogue around their use in a particular context; if context/purpose and targetted audience alongside learning outcomes are not very explicit this makes more difficult to repurpose in a different context;</p>
<p>16) Lack of policy embeddedness and accepted institutional practices: OER use and re-use in mainstream educational institutions needs be legitimized by accepted national policies on education;</p>
<p>17) Issues of quality/legitimacy: some OERs are not considered worthy of using/remixing. Some advocates insist on putting ratings / quality and context indicators. That will enable tracing of use and perhaps stimulate re-use;</p>
<p>18) Lack of time: too much effort to put in reusing makes easier and faster to do it yourself from scratch;</p>
<p>19) Lack of tools to help deconstruct and reconstruct;</p>
<p>20) Lack of motivation - why should I, what's in it for me?</p>]]></description>

              <title>Why remix an Open Educational Resource?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2432</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2432</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>[First published at: <a href="http://olnet.org/node/68" target="_blank">http://olnet.org/node/68</a>]</p>
<p>One of the ideas in the world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources" target="_blank">Open Educational Resources</a> (OERs) that can be a bit strange to grasp at first is the idea of &ldquo;remixing&rdquo;. When I first joined the OLnet project and was telling people about it, a mention of remixing would often prompt people to ask &ldquo;why would I want to do that?&rdquo;, a perfectly reasonable question as many will have just experienced education as courses they learn from, but wouldn't actually change. Often OERs are just thought of as free courses, but remixing creates a much bigger opportunity. So I thought I would draw on the collective wisdom of the OLnet team and compile a list of twenty reasons to remix an OER.</p>
<p>The list is in no particular order, and by its very nature isn't an extensive exploration of the reasons to remix an OER, so if you think of any more it would be great to hear about them in the comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>Save yourself time and work by mixing in OERs with your own material to make something richer</li>
<li>Adapt the material to make it more accessible for people with different disabilities</li>
<li>Insert some cultural specific references to make a concept easier to understand</li>
<li>Translate it into another language</li>
<li>Correct any errors or inaccuracies</li>
<li>Keep the OER up to date by adding the latest discoveries or theories</li>
<li>Insert more media or links to other resources</li>
<li>Chop the OER up into smaller chunks that might be easier to learn from, or could be reused elsewhere</li>
<li>Adapt it for a different audience</li>
<li>Use the OER as the basis for a face to face lesson</li>
<li>Change the target educational level</li>
<li>Add input and participation from the people who are going to be using your remixed OER</li>
<li>Use the OER for a wider purpose by adding in other information</li>
<li>Changing the format of the OER to make it work in different computer based learning environments</li>
<li>To improve understanding of what an OER is by thinking about reasons to remix it</li>
<li>Insert a different point of view to that originally given in the material</li>
<li>Adapt it for different teaching situations</li>
<li>A way to experiment with new skills yo have gained (could be technical skills, media skills etc.)</li>
<li>To improve it</li>
<li>Because you can!</li>
</ol>
<p>As an IT person not an academic I'm more familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank">open source</a> than open educational resources, but the concepts do have a lot in common. With both you can just use the resources, you don't have to remix or contribute, and there is nothing wrong with that. If you do want to contribute though or you might feel an existing resource is near to what you want, you are free to build on it to meet new challenges.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->At the heart of the movement towards OER is the simple and powerful idea that the worlds knowledge is a public good and that technology in general and the wwweb in particular provide an opportunity for everyone to share, use and reuse it</p>
<p><em>Mike Smith and Cathy Casserly</em></p>
<p><strong>A personal perspective&hellip;</strong></p>
<p><em>Alberto Manguel</em></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Indistinct, majestic, ever-present the tacit architecture of that infinite library (of Alexandria) continues to haunt our dreams of universal order. Nothing like it has ever been achieved, through others libraries (the web included) have tried to copy its astonishing ambition.</p>
<p>The tower of Babel and the library of Alexandria stand as symbols of everything we are about.</p>
<p><strong>A UNESCO perspective</strong></p>
<p>Since wars being in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defence of peace must be constructed UNESCO</p>
<p>The aims associated with desire to build knowledge societies are ambitious. Providing basic education for all promoting lifelong education for all, encouraging the spread of research and development efforts in all countries&hellip;</p>
<p>Expenditure for education is one of the most productive investments that a country can make&hellip;</p>
<p>We are talking here about opening education</p>
<p><em>Sir Walter Perry (first VC of Open University) </em></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->..standards of teaching in conventional university was pretty deplorable, stuck me if you could use the media and devise course materials that would work for students all by themselves, then inevitably you are bound to affect for good the standard of teaching in conventional universities.</p>
<p><em>John Seely Brown</em></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->The web has just begun to have an impact on our lives. As fascinated as we are with it today, we&rsquo;re still seeing it in its early forms&hellip; My belief is that not only will the web be as fundamental to society as electrification but that it will be subject to many of the same diffusion and absorption dynamics as that earlier medium.</p>
<p><em>Sir John Daniel</em></p>
<p><em> </em>access, cost and quality &ndash; the iron triangle which has hindered the expansion of education, he argues that technology transcends this iron triangle.</p>
<p><strong>OER &ndash; a vision</strong></p>
<p><em>Brenda Gourley </em></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->The rise of the OER movement is one of the most exciting and indeed critical developments of our time</p>
<p>2002 group of academics met at UNESCO and were presented by early work by MIT, whereby they made their educational materials freely available. Term OER was coined then</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Open provision of educational resources enabled by ICT for consultation use and adaptation by a community of users for non-commercial purposes UNSECO, 2002</p>
<p>Hewlett foundation Fous of this component is on creating exemplars of academic content that are free and accessible to all on the web,, these will help raise the level of quality of academic content by setting a standard of practice&hellip; one criterion for our support of education..</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rice University Connexions &ndash; sharing knowledge and building communities http://cnx.org/ Began in 1999. Authors can create and collaborate, Instructors rapidly build and share custom collections, Learners can find and explore content</li>
<li>MIT open courseware, almost 200 courses online, a window into the institution.<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm</a> One of the visions and values of OER is that they provide opportunities for self-paces, directed learning. Now more than 200 institutions are now part of the open courseware consortium http://www.ocwconsortium.org/</li>
<li>Carnegie Mellon Open Learning Initiatives Open courses backed by learning research. Exemplars of high quality courses, backed by research, courses have assessment embedded in them. <a href="http://oli.web.cmu.edu/openlearning/">http://oli.web.cmu.edu/openlearning/</a></li>
<li>Open learning opening access to education <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/">http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/</a>. Launched in 2006, two sections learning space and labspace provides access to materials for editing or collaborative work, also backed by an extensive body of research.</li>

</ul>
<p>Now a network of over 900 people interacting and discussing OER issues</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->I am very pleased to see the whole wolrd around the table we wil be able to find a lot of expereisne and concerns - great success</p>
<p><em>UNESCO-IIEP OER forum participant</em></p>
<p>There is a wiki assoicated with this group and a handbook about how to use OER and a report on access.</p>
<p>Three main aims</p>
<ul>
<li>To advance the OER movement: awareness raising, communities and networks</li>
<li>To enable creation and use: developing capacity and quality assurance</li>
<li>To remove barriers: sustainability and copyright and licensing</li>
</ul>
<p>Plan to transfer the community to a UNESCO chair, which is a network, to help share lessons learnt.</p>

<p><em>Koichiro Matsurra</em>, UNESCO Director general</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->But the library of Alexandria was set up to do more than merely immortalize, it was to record everything that had been and could be recorded and these records were to be digested into further records a endless trail of readings and glossed that would engender in turn new glosses and new readings</p>

<p>Despite&nbsp; improvements in the range and quality of OER resourses, there is still a lack of take-up. This discussion will focus on the issues about why this might be the case.</p>
<p>This discussion can happen in face to face groups or here on Cloudworks...or both!</p>
<p>1. What do you think is needed to encourage uptake and reuse of OERs?</p>
<p>2. What types of resources would be useful from <em>your</em> point of view?</p>
<p>3. What are your views on this approach to developing learning and teaching resources and designs?</p>

<p>This is a complement to the <a href="../view/1868">Cloud</a> Andrew Brasher has put in on desiging an Open Educationa Resource. The Powerpoint slides give a conceptual overview of our ideas behind the design and reuse of an OER. A key factors is that we are suggesting it is important to make the Design of an OER explicit as well as the resource itself. <a href="http://e4innovation.com/?p=324">This blog post</a> also gives more details of our thinking behind this work.</p>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1852</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>
<b>Audience</b><br />
Workshop for researchers: OER researchers, learning design and pedagogical patterns researcher
</p>
<p>
<br />
<b>Focus of workshops</b><br />
•    To develop an evolving collective set of research questions and cumulative data for the area [Maybe some data that they can take away and analyse themselves]. Sharing of raw data – a principle of an open resource approach – to share and discuss<br />
•    To develop a shared understanding to define the intersections of the three domains and the benefits of combining them, to include: research questions, definitions, areas of activities, tensions and position, and core principles, what are the key journals and areas of activities<br />
•    To develop a shared research domain definition for this new field
</p>
<p>
<b>Resources<br />
</b>•    Key papers for the field – could we have an evolving list – papers plus discussion and in particular are there ones that are working at the interface<br />
•    Expertise database and funding sources<br />
•    Collective data gathering and reuse which can be mined for different purposes<br />
Data <br />
•    1. Collective share knowledge on key research questions, brainstorm and refine research question<br />
•    2. Data on research questions<br />
o    ‘’How do teachers do about the design process?” Source of data, findings, and then aggregate [Design strategies clouds, LD workshops, interviews with teacher]<br />
o    “What are the barriers to reuse of OER?<br />
•    3. Data mining of cumulative data sources [Could we draw in experts in other fields to help with this?]<br />
•    Existing tools, templates, processes and methods
</p>
<p>
<b>Activities/workshop ideas<br />
</b>•    Brainstorm of what they think are the key papers in the field and why and how they relate to this area – could set up clouds to discuss these<br />
•    Hashtag #olnetkeypapers and short rationale for why to read it<br />
•    Main research domain definitions - what are pedagogical patterns what are peoples perceptions of this – an evolving collective glossary for the field, could set up as a wiki, could have a jigsaw first, then brainstorm etc [Some sub-domains already have definitions, so need to hook into these]<br />
•    Virtual writing groups to develop shared understanding to define the intersections of the three domains: research questions, definitions, areas of activities, tensions and position, and core principles, what are the key journals and areas of activities<br />
•    Build a new social network for OER – share your network (and associated tools and resources) and exploit other people’s networks <br />
•    Thinking of ways of how each community can use each other’s resources – patterns – which OER should we be looking at? How can visualisation ideas from learning design be used in a pattern context<br />
•    Workshop on visualising patterns and metaphors for design <br />
</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The follow diagram is intended to give a flavour of a design cycle for the design and resource of Open Educational Resources (OER). In the centre is a representation of the process of design. Imagine a designer is creating a new resource and mapping their design process in a visualisation tool like CompendiumLD. As they work through the design process they can draw on existing content (from say existing OER repositories) and designs (say from existing design repositories or pedagogical pattern repositories). The use these pre-existing OER and Designs to general a new OER and a new associated design which can then be deposited back into OER and Design repositories.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[I join a course on &quot;Introductory Computer Networks&quot; and initially I follow the same course structure proposed by the professors of that course. However, it seems that students are not active learners and they are not engaged with the course. The assessment results are not satisfactory. I guess that the main reason for not achieving good results can be identified with the lack of significativity of of the course structure (bottom-up approach in network protocols). Then, I look for a resource or OER that suggests a course with a top-down approach (from application to network...). But the OER that I have found is not based on a project-based approach and case studies. So, I need guidance on how to redesign the course and need advice (patterns). I contact people who are more experts or find patterns ... I repuropose the OER that  I have found! Then, I share the new course and the patterns together with my course-team coleagures. And then, I publish he new course, its design and its design-principles or patterns that I have used.

<li>Before creating my module, I want to know what other resources on this topic are available across OER repositories. Is there a meta-search engine available?</li>

<li>Lastly, I need a method to apply the patterns to the OER to support my reuse of it. Do such methods exist? Might a learning design help?</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
<b>Overview</b><br />
The workshop will introduce participants to use a range of tools, methods and approaches to designing and evaluating Open Educational Resources (OERs). The session will include an overview of the OLnet initiative which is a new global network of support for researchers, users and producers of OERs. Participants will have a chance to try out some of the tools that have been developed as part of OLnet and to discuss relevance and application to their own practice. See also the related <a href="/node/562">Olnet cloudscape</a> and the <a href="/node/387">OULDI cloudscape</a>, which have additional resources.
</p>
<p>
<b>Outcomes</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>An awareness of the range of resources, tools and methods which are available to support the design and evaluation of OERs – including case studies of good practice, learning object repositories and learning design tools/methods</li>
	<li>An understanding of the OLnet initiative and how it can be used to support the design and evaluation of OERs</li>
	<li>Experience of thinking about the OER effectiveness cycle from different perspectives</li>
	<li>Hands on experience of some of the OLnet tools including CompendiumLD for visualising designs, Cloudworks for sharing and discussing the creation and use of OERs and Cohere for the development of complex collaborative co-argumentation and ideas</li>
	<li>An understanding of how the OLnet can be applied in their own teaching context.  </li>

              <title>Opening doors to digital learning – open educational repositories for community discovery, sharing, reuse and activity</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1576</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1576</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[•    Irish - National Digital Learning Repository NDLR, HEA funded<br />
•    Idea is to pull things together for the Irish context<br />
•    Outline: shifting paradigms, OER, strategies for achieving development and access to OER<br />
•    Take a moment to review the following slide on use of new technologies – identify two methods or tools you might use in your current teaching, how many of the methods or tools have you not heard of, who is using the resources, what are they using them for?<br />
•    Tools include: clickers, 2P, SMS, RLOs, OER, CAA, CMS, VOIP, folksonomy, cloud computing, social bookmarking, twitter, open journals, elf, zoho, drupal, sakai, moodle, audacity, bubbl-us, grupthink, pbwiki, slideshare, vanilla, colloquia, screencasting, e-portfolios, web-trails, googlejockeying<br />
•    CoP: sharing, reuse, activities, aggregation, harvesting, support, knowledge sharing and transfer, modification, improvement, communal development<br />
•    Tools and services need to be user-centred: need to come into the users own space and be of benefit for their individual interests; there is no such thing as a central portal anymore<br />
Approaches<br />
•    Institutions trying to develop their own T&amp;L resources: Challenges – expense, critical mass, paucity of shared experiences, difficult to sustain<br />
•    A national repository of shared T&amp;L resources: larger scale, more opportunity to support multiple subject areas, potential for greater reuse and collaboration, raising the bar for teaching and learning as a collective<br />
•    An open digital repository: Much more scalable, high potential for CoP contribution and reuse, international licence agreements already in place (Creative Commons Licenses), protection against commercial exploitation, easier to set up infrastructure (access and authentication not a problem), CCLearn<br />
OER movement<br />
•    Huge number of resources now available, but its about sharing resources as the key to this, cutting down some of the barriers, Lou McGill JISC report on barriers to sharing resources, barriers are more social and cultural rather than technical and legal<br />
•    Example: Openlearn (UK), Edshare (Jessie Hays - Southampton), BC Campus (Canada), IRISS learning exchange (Ireland), MIT Open Courseware (USA)<br />

              <description><![CDATA[<p>An activity used in the <a href="/node/876">evidence and outcomes session </a>at the OER meeting in Monterey March 2009:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each person writes down one research question they are interested in on a post-it </li>
<li>Everyone goes around the room and reads other peoples&rsquo; questions</li>
<li>Those with a similar research question or focus cluster together</li>
<li>Clustered post-its are grouped on a board and a plenary session discusses and refines them.</li>
<li>A final activity can be to brainstorm evidence and examples of existing research or projects that are addressing or provide some answers to these research question </li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <title>HippoCampus and Open Educational Resources</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/918</link>

              <description><![CDATA[Generally, there are two targets for OERs- one for students, and one for teachers.<br />
HippoCampus focuses on high school and community college.<br />
<br />
There are basic necessities for an OER- it must be curricular, complete, of a high quality, easy to use, and a teaching tool.<br />
<br />
Essentially, it must be as simple and effective as opening a text book.<br />
<br />
NROC is unique in that it fuses content for high school and higher education; it has complete foundations for entire courses, and can be made flexible to the needs of the teacher.<br />
<br />
Quality is of a very high concern- expectations are high for both students and teachers using this content.<br />
<br />
When introduced to the state of Oregon, the content was met with widespread acceptance.<br />
<br />
Flexibility can be brought to the teacher, district, or state- this makes the high quality content easier to use, no matter what the needs may be.<br />
<br />
One of the first steps in integrating content with the repository is completeness of the curriculum- no holes left for teachers to fill in themselves.<br />
<br />
This will phase out the need for textbooks, such as was done for history courses in Oregon.<br />
<br />
Overall, there has been great success with both students and teachers alike.<br />
<br />
 Unfortunately, the biggest hurtle is sustainability- how can content that is given away for free continue to be updated?<br />
<br />
 The answer is administrators, teachers, and users coming together to support the OER.<br />
<br />
The variety of ways to customize and utilize HippoCampus include customized sites and accessibility options (such as from an iPod).<br />
<br />
The pacing can also be tailored for the needs of anyone- mildly autistic, ADHD, or students who simply need more time with the content.<br />
<br />
This content can be adapted for pencil and paper use- exercises are embedded in the content itself, and parts can be utilized in presentations as the teacher sees fit.<br />
<br />
OER success is measured by usage, so the ultimate goal is expanding the amount of usage.<br />
<br />
<br />
