              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Multimedia Poster</h2>
<p>For an introduction to the project presentation please see the >multimedia poster</a> . I have also created an >accessible version</a> of my poster for people with sight challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Social exclusion has continued to be an enormous issue despite the increase in technologically rich learning platforms on the internet. A lot of those who use mobile technology have access to the internet but are unaware of the existence or use of OER (Online Educational Resources) and so they are being left behind.</p>
<p>My project is focus on the adaptation of OER for English language teachers. The essence of the project is to provide help to ensure the provision of learning materials to the marginalised teachers in the developing world, especially those in sub-Saharan African countries such as Nigeria.</p>
<p>The project will sensitise the teachers and help them acquire information and knowledge on OER. The English language teachers on the project will discover alternative ways of demonstrating what they know, and this will lead to a change in their classrooms as they begin to challenge their learners in more productive ways using materials from the OER sites.</p>
<p>Most teachers in Nigeria use mobile technologies and are on social media app networks such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram. This project will empower the teachers and improve their access to professional development and education available via OER sites (See O&rsquo;Connor, 2000). OER offers a plethora of choices.</p>
<p>My presentation will consider how systems can be created for teachers to have access to OER repositories. In recent times, there has been an increase in internet-based network of freely available online resources for learning and teaching. These open educational resources include highly interactive and innovative curricula, visualizations, simulations and lesson plans. There are features that support the use of real-world resources (see McArthur &amp; Zia 2008; Zia, 2001; Borgman et al., 2008). These increasingly available online resources are infrastructure available for teachers to use, access, and share, connect, create and adapt resources in ways that can change their practice (Borgman et al. 2008).</p>
<p>In the presentation, I will demonstrate that the use of social media technologies has an essential place in teacher professional development because teachers learn voluntarily. Teachers use forums to reflect on own practices and exchange ideas with colleagues (see Marcia &amp; Garcia, 2016). So, instant messaging software have helped teachers to adapt information, to re-conceptualize and to make information much more functional for their contexts (Cranefield &amp; Yoong, 2009). In very recent years, mobile learning devices have offered a variety of learning opportunities (see Macia &amp; Garcia, 2016; Rambe &amp; Bere, 2013; Cakir &amp; Arslan, 2013; Hwang, Huang &amp; Wu, 2011).</p>
<p>Given that WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook stand out in many studies as effective tools and applications used by many people and available in mobile devices. It is easy to create online community of practice using WhatsApp, Telegram or Facebook (see Baran &amp; Cagiltay, 2010; Wesley, 2013) and many teachers all over the world use WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook for social and learning purposes.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Since 1974, disabled students in England have been able to apply for non-repayable grants, known as &lsquo;Disabled Students&rsquo; Allowances (DSAs)&rsquo;, to assist with the additional costs incurred whilst completing higher education study (Willetts, 2014). Such grants provided allowances for specialised equipment, non-medical assistance such as note takers and specialised tutors, books and consumables, as well as travel allowances (Disability Rights UK, 2015). In addition to the support provided by DSAs, the introduction of the Equality Act 2010 placed a legal duty on businesses and education providers to take positive steps, referred to as &lsquo;reasonable adjustments&rsquo;, to remove barriers faced by people, due to their disability (Citizens Advice, n.d.). This includes making changes to the ways things are done e.g. provision, criterion or practice; physical features of buildings such as entrances and exits; as well as the provision of extra aids or services such as: induction hearing loops, providing information in alternative formats etc. (Citizens Advice, n.d.).</p>
<p>Despite the reasonable adjustments implemented by higher education institutions (HEIs), the costs of the DSA provision have risen sharply from &pound;101.3m in 2009-10 to &pound;145.8m in 2012-13, an increase of 44% (Weale, 2015). In 2014, the Minister for Universities and Science announced a series of changes to modernise the existing system to &lsquo;rebalance&rsquo; responsibilities for student support. Thus, ensuring that the limited public funding is available to those most in need, and provides the support they require (Willetts, 2014). The changes are designed to move away from a system of individualised support funded by DSAs, to one where HEIs play a greater role in supporting all students, regardless of whether they have a disability or not.</p>
<p>With these changes coming into force from September 2016, HEIs within England have been required to review and, if required, revise their current student support arrangements to ensure they are prepared for these changes and can support learners effectively (McNaught, 2016). Whilst there are many small and simple changes academic staff can take to improve the accessibility of their teaching such as: providing information ahead of sessions, creating learning materials which meet accessibility guidelines and encouraging students to record teaching sessions etc. (Canterbury Christ Church University, n.d.), this does not resolve the underlying issues. As McNaught (2016) summarises &lsquo;[t]eaching and learning pedagogies, practices and technologies can inadvertently create barriers for students with disabilities&rsquo;, to overcome these a different approach is required.</p>
<p>To address some of the challenges raised by these recent changes and the need for HEIs to make anticipatory, rather than reactive changes, this conference presentation will provide an overview and demonstration of a short online course being developed by the author. Built using the Canvas open education platform, this short course aimed at academics working within UK HEIs, will provide a more in-depth overview of the changes to disabled student support, whilst also introducing delegates to two educational frameworks; Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Inclusive Curriculum. Building on research undertaken by Marquis et al. (2016), this course will utilise a flipped learning pedagogy; whereby the learning materials are placed online and classroom sessions are used to enable deeper exploration and discussion of the topics raised (The Higher Education Academy, n.d.).

              <title>Nathan Casey&#39;s design narrative: Chinese (online) Camp</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9849</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Chinese (online) Camp</h2>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>My role in the design of the overall learning activity was two-fold:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>To advise the Design Team on how the aims of the course could be met in terms of overall structure, sequence of activities, activity type and type of activity template used</li>
<li>To create the course online content by building assets in our online content management system, and using these to create the individual activities within our online LMS.</li>
</ol>
<h2>&nbsp;Situation</h2>
<p>This short professional development course was designed for globally-distributed online teachers who work either from a physical teaching centre or from home. These teachers use a synchronous audiographic platform to work with students, but the majority of the students study is independent, using our own proprietary LMS (in a intended flipped classroom-type of model).</p>
<p>From our teacher satisfaction surveys, we understood that teachers wanted more networking opportunities with their global counterparts and to understand the experience of our students to a greater degree (both in terms of how students study independently using our online courseware, as well as their cultural background).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As one of our biggest groups of students are culturally Chinese, we wanted to provide an opportunity for teachers to learn more about the culture and language as well as use the exact same online learning management system as out students (this was the first time we had planned to do this, using a separate LMS for initial teacher orientation and professional development opportunities).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course itself consisted of a number of individual, primarily independent self-study activities, designed to be put into practice in a synchronous audiographic conference at the end of the one-week course. &nbsp;The content management system used for this course consisted of an asset bank and activity templates that dictated the form of activity, type of interaction and type of resource that could be used within it.</p>
<p><strong>Key actors:</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>The course Design Team: responsible for designing the overall structure of the course and individual activities within the course, managing the online LMS (inviting teachers, tracking individual progress and completion rates, etc), creating individual activity content and sourcing resources (video, image, audio)</li>
<li>The Production Team: (primarily this consisted of myself) Responsible for adding / building resources / assets in our content management system and using these to create the individual learning activities. Additionally to hep evaluate the pedagogic approach proposed by the Design Team and negotiate how the course aims / objectives may be more effectively met through structure / sequencing of the individual learning activities and the templates available.</li>
<li>The Academic Team: Responsible for testing the trial and beta versions of the course and providing feedback.</li>
<li>Global online teachers: these were our students.</li>
</ol>
<h2>&nbsp;Task</h2>
<p>Provide a new type of professional development opportunity that:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Facilitated networking and relationship building amongst our teachers from different global locations</li>
<li>&nbsp;Built awareness of main aspects of &lsquo;the student experience&rsquo; (in this case both culturally and using the same online independent study resources that our students use when studying with)</li>
<li>Developed (Mandarin) Chinese language awareness and ability to use basic phrases</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Success would be measured through:</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Participation</li>
<li>Course completion</li>
<li>Surveys at the end of the course (enjoyment and perception of &lsquo;usefulness&rsquo;)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Initial group collaboration / brainstorming to:</li>
<ol start="1">
<li>Clarify aims and objectives of course</li>
<li>Present the main features of the activity templates and how they could be used</li>
<li>Outline the creation and production process with key milestones / deadlines</li>
</ol></ol>
<p><em>Unexpected outcome</em></p>
<p>As opportunity to network was a key driving force behind this, it quickly became clear that our system did not easily support the type of interactions that we were hoping for. This led to myself, from a production side, more clearly outlining what templates were available and how they should / could be adapted and used in context of what we wanted to achieve.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Once the draft content outline had been created, a further group check to ensure that the sequence of activities was logical, clear and sound.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Unexpected outcome</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point it was clear that there was a knowledge &lsquo;gap&rsquo; between the types of activities that we could create and the types of activities that the design team wanted to include.&nbsp; At this point, I ran a further, more detailed knowledge sharing session to ensure that everyone understood what our system was capable of and how this would look / work in practice.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Design Team created detailed learning activity production notes, including sourcing / building relevant resources.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Expected / Unexpected result</em></p>
<p>As this was the first time we had done this, we expected to &lsquo;expect the unexpected&rsquo; especially at this stage.&nbsp; However, the sourcing / creation of materials took a lot longer than expected and further advice / guidance needed to be sought from the team who use the content management system to create content on a regular basis.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Content production: Putting resources into the content management system and using these to build a test course.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Unexpected outcome</em></p>
<p>Some of the resources created / sourced displayed differently than expected after being converted into Flash / HTML.&nbsp; This meant a second round of content sourcing / creation had to be undertaken.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Testing: the academic team tested the course and provided feedback.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Expected Result</em></p>
<p>The academic team agreed that the course meant the initial brief provided, and was effectively designed to meet the learning aims / objectives.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Course rollout (providing course details to developer team who released this into our live environment).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><strong>Intended objectives:</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>High interest in the course; more teachers than we could include in each session applied to participate.</li>
<li>Participation was initially high, but slowed towards the end of the week, with not all teachers within a group completing this within the required deadline.</li>
<li>Participation rates in the synchronous online audiographic conference were low: not all teachers attended.</li>
<li>Course survey rates were very positive: teachers enjoyed the course (both in terms of content and opportunities to interact) and perceived it to be useful (clear links between course content and how this could be used in class).</li>
</ol>
<p>However, there was also a clear need for greater peer-to-peer interaction opportunities and the course took longer than initially thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Unintended outcomes:</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>New ways of collaborating and working with our online LMS / CMS; clear need for further, more in-depth training for the team.</li>
<li>Understanding of how our &lsquo;student&rsquo; LMS and activity templates can be adapted and used to meet alternative needs (than those they were initially designed for).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Through this design experience, a number of underlying factors became very clear:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>All participants involved in learning design in this particular context / using this particular LMS and CMS need a clear awareness of, and knowledge about, the limitations of the system and activity templates.&nbsp; This helps efficiency during the design process as well as allows for more creativity when adapting the set activity templates to meet a variety of needs.</li>
<li>Although this course was only one-week long there was a clear need for more &lsquo;micro-touchpoints&rsquo; in which collaboration, discussion and comparison was engendered &ndash; this would not only help teachers to feel connected but also build rapport and a feeling of community that could only help when approaching the live session (and increase participation / completion rates).</li>
</ol>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;&lsquo;Social&rsquo; templates (in which teachers listened to audio recordings of their peers and responded to these in kind) were only used to a very limited degree and these were the most popular activities &ndash; these need to be utilised to a greater extent and additional activity templates that allow for such interaction developed.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>From this experience it was clear that we needed to provide more of a forum which facilitated and afforded such experiences and opportunities (as described in the point above) outside of a structured &lsquo;course&rsquo; of study.</li>
<li>Attitudes towards the &lsquo;authentic experience&rsquo; could have been more thoroughly investigated and the teachers encouraged to reflect on this and what this may mean for their students (e.g. why were the live session attendance rates lower than expected?&nbsp; What implications may this have for the students that they work with and what they do during the live sessions that they themselves facilitate?).&nbsp; This still has not yet been fully explored during future iterations of the course.</li>
</ol>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>OK, week 2 of the mooc is nearly over, but I've been thinking a lot off-line about my dream project and how to bring it about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have set up two complementary working groups to help bring the online course into being - the first is a team of experienced practitioners, with specialist expertise in areas of content relevant to academic advising in higher education. This group exists off-line, with a first meeting in early February, and I will be adapting the content we already have in google, so that all members of the group can see/comment and build on what we have.</p>
<p>The second group is a group of close colleagues. I will follow - where possible - &nbsp;the pattern of engagement of the mooc to support how we develop the design and activities of the project. During this week (calendar week rather than course week) it is my intention to start to share outline designs with this group.</p>
<p>So we can see that, within the mooc, I haven't yet found a suitable study group. I will keep an eye on one that is around DIY audio/video since I may be setting this up for the specialists to add snippets of multimedia to the largely textual resource that we have.</p>
<p>I've listened to the weekly introduction and browsed the ecology of resources. Whilst I agree that context is highly important, and I also agree that significant are the relations between the learner and their context (people, places, things) - I am not sure how thinking about this specifically at this stage will help me to design a better course.&nbsp;However, I wholeheartedly embrace the idea of a learning scenario and will be writing one or two to start bringing some reality into the learning design.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello and welcome to my first learning journal cloud.</p>
<p>I am an educational developer at Oxford Brookes University in the UK - one of several colleagues from Brookes in the mooc. At work I am immersed in the continuing professional development of academic and learning support colleagues - much of which is mediated or supported electronically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am delighted with the timing and topic of this mooc - it fits so well with my learning and development intentions - and I am very excited to reconnect with former colleagues and collaborators whose names are appearing in the cohort, as well as making connections with new educators who may share similar perspectives to my own. I've posted up my 'dream' as instructed, which is to develop a course on academic advising.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also now had a chance to scan some of the introductions and projects posted by others and am already almost overwhelmed with ideas - and as others have said, feel that I'm arriving late. I was one of the many who struggled for an hour or more to get into the launch on Monday, and have had little time between then and now to engage. My intention is to contribute what I can over the coming weeks. Part of me knows that participation will pay off in dividends - there is a fantastic community gathered around this mooc. On the other hand, I know that my time and energy is limited and that I will struggle to keep up with the pace and depth of discussions, so I need to remain focused on making progress on the project I have outlined in my Dream - namely an online development course for academic advisers at my institution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My other personal challenge through engagement in the mooc is to improve my online identity, which is currently embarrassingly sketchy...</p>]]></description>

              <title>Frances Deepwell: My &#39;dream&#39; for a short course on academic advising/tutoring</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7173</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7173</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Professional Development for Academic Advisers</h2>
<p>One of the educational development projects I&rsquo;m working on right now is to develop a short online induction for all academic advisers (personal tutors) at our University. Just for clarity, this is not for specialist professionals in advising, this is for mainstream Faculty who support a certain number of advisees through the duration of their HE studies - the advice can be about a range of things such as making sense of their own learning across courses, keeping on track, developing critical self-awareness, gaining practical experiences outside the taught curriculum, making sense of professional options etc. <br /><br />This online course is a team development within the institution, and is based on our recent institutional research into students&rsquo; and staff experiences of academic advising and student support. <br /><br />I want to take advantage of the mooc community through sharing ideas on what works well, getting feedback on our developing design, and gaining insight into existing resources, which I am sure are plentiful. One of the major constraints we are facing is time and the timeline. The course needs to be up and ready for roll-out by the end of May. <br /><br />The other constraint is that the course will be part of the mandatory training for Faculty - the participants of the course will be across the spectrum of academic colleagues, and therefore the course needs to be inclusive of all HE levels, disciplinary and pedagogical variations, mode and location of students.<br /><br /></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">The Challenge</h3>
<p>I hope to achieve an online course which assists academic colleagues/faculty in becoming more confident and consistent in fulfilling their responsibility to provide academic advice to their advisees. There are information pages on the academic adviser role, which are being updated at the same time <a href="http://www.brookes.ac.uk/student/services/handbook/yourrole.html">http://www.brookes.ac.uk/student/services/handbook/yourrole.html</a> but the intention is to make this a learning experience rather than an information exchange.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Pedagogical approach</h3>
<p>The pedagogical approach is determined by team agreement and pragmatics. <br />The pedagogical intentions of this course pose some internal conflicts, which I&rsquo;ll need to resolve - here are three of them:</p>
<ul style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<li style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline;" dir="ltr">the course should be largely self-directed and stand-alone, but I want to offer something other than a page-turning tutorial</li>
<li style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline;" dir="ltr">the learning is both informational and reflective (for some, the learning is intended to bring about a transformational shift in professional behaviours)</li>
<li style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline;" dir="ltr">progress, or at least engagement in its elements, needs to be monitored</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Technologies:</h3>
<ul style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<li style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline;" dir="ltr">Moodle will be the base platform - other technologies will be determined later. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Stimulating review by Al Bird of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/handbook/index.html">Social Learning Handbook </a>and the <a rel="external" href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/working-smarter-fieldbook-|-september-2010-edition/14309750">Working Smarter Fieldbook</a>. Concludes that training and development professionals must show themselves to be credible. How? By focusing formal training where it works best (and weeding it out where it doesn't - especially when it's costly and unnecessary). Both books point to 'performance consulting' in their analyses of people-productivity challenges (as opposed to 'training needs analysis'). They argue that we should probe deep and look at what creates the 'problem' for an individual/team/organisation and what can be done to improve performance in a hard business sense. The answer will not necessarily be 'training' (it may involve, for example, clearer role definition, opportunities for collaboration, better performance management or regular coaching). 'As with some of my clients, better to knock off the word "training" and simply call it a "needs analysis"'. This means not prejudging the outcomes (as we are wont to do).</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>We are a team of reasearchers who are keen to find out about how Institutes have prepared academics (or are proposing to prepare) for the move to teaching in innovative learning spaces.</p>
<p>Many of these spaces are technology enhanced offering teaching staff the opportunity to utilise the many opportunities and affordances they bring with them. Research has alerted us to the fact that many academics continue to use traditional teaching methods in these spaces because they have not necessarily been prepared for a change in pedagogy or alerted to methodologies that include using technology in a collaborative manner.</p>
<p>We are keen to hear about any success stories, or even those that were not so successful, so we may design a framework for change practice. We welcome your thoughts and research findings on this cloud.</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation, Caroline, Geoff, Trish and Pauline</p>]]></description>

<p>SCoPE is an online community hosted by BCcampus in British Columbia, Canada. The core activity in SCoPE is scheduled seminar discussions facilitated  by volunteers. This is a tradition that began with the Global Educators' Network in 1999 as part of the TeleLearning Network of Centres of Excellence. At SCoPE we also host special interest groups (SIGs) by request,  online conferences, and special projects as they emerge. Ideas for  seminar discussion topics and other SCoPE activities emerge through participation in the communitiy.</p>
<p>SCoPE seminars are free and open to the public. We attempt to cater to busy professionals. In that sense, there is no registration process for seminars and members are free to participate according to their own time and interests. We welcome participation on the periphery through the Web and RSS; no login is required.</p>]]></description>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->A multiliterate teacher understands the many ways that technology interacts and intertwines with academic and interpersonal life, and actively learns how to gain control over those aspects impacting teaching, social, and professional development. Multiliterate individuals are aware of the pitfalls inherent in technology while striving for empowerment through effective strategies for first discerning and then taking advantage of those aspects of changing technologies most appropriate to their situations. These strategies include managing, processing, and interpreting a constant influx of information, filtering what is useful, and then enhancing the learning environment with the most appropriate applications.</p>

Alongside the adaptation of existing courses and activities, often staff will be at a loss as to what they really want to include in an LMS course.<br /> <br /> It was suggested that faculty, alongside considerations of how they will adapt specific activities using <a href="http://efest2008collaboratingbydesign.pbwiki.com/">the ICTELT model and framework</a>, draw up a mindmap that identifies the main functionality and design of the LMS course they wish to use. However, some faculty found this a challenge, so I have developed the following <a href="http://www.mindomo.com/view.htm?m=2bd537cb41c349508eb65e01fc3bbf4c">mindmap 'model'</a>. It is flexible and users of it are encouraged to change it to suit their purposes. You will need to go to the Mindomo site where the map is hosted to view it properly.<br /> <br /> Although the central starting point of the mindmap is labelled "course" it could just as easily be a Community of Practice, a department, or a support unit that wishes to improve their communication. Users, therfore, should change or omit any of the elements that are irrelevant to them.<br /> <br /> Any feedback that you might have on what I have missed out, or suggestions for improvement would be very much appreciated.</p>]]></description>
