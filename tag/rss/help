              <title>Badging in Cloudworks</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6622</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6622</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/5/5238240_856b4a82a1.jpg" alt="Image by Leo Reynolds http://www.flickr.com/photos/lwr/5238240/" hspace="25" width="257" height="231" align="right" />Badging is one of the exciting new features that we have introduced to Cloudworks.</p>
<p>You can find a list of Cloudworks badges, and apply for or issue your own <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/badge/badge_list">here</a>.<em>

</em></p>
<p><strong>What is a badge?</strong></p>
<p>A badge is a way of recognising skills and achievements developed through informal learning, wherever that might take place. Badges can provide a focus and motivation, and are a way of signalling achievement to others (friends, family, employers, educational institutions and communities).</p>
<p>The badges used in Cloudworks are supported by <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges">Mozilla&rsquo;s Open Badges project</a> and any registered Cloudworks user can issue, earn and display a badge in their profile page.</p>
<p>For more badge FAQ visit the excellent <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges/FAQs">Mozilla FAQ</a> page.</p>
<h4>What kinds of skills and accomplishments can badges represent?</h4>
<p>Badges can represent a diverse range of skills, competencies, qualities, achievements and interests, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>"hard      skills" like completing a course, mastering a      specific concept or activity </li>
<li>"soft      skills" like critical thinking, reflection, communication      or collaboration </li>
<li>community      aspects like reputation and status </li>
<li>specific      accomplishments or activities like leaving helpful      comments for other learners, logging into an online learning web site for      10 consecutive days </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applying for a badge</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/badge/badge_list">Badge List</a> to see all the badges available on Cloudworks. To review the criteria for any badge, click on the badge title. When you feel that you have gathered enough evidence to show that you have met the badge criteria, click on the red button 'Apply for badge'<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Providing evidence</strong></p>
<p>The badge issuer may have been quite specific about how you could  provide evidence, but if they haven&rsquo;t you must decide how best to do it.  Your evidence might consist of a reflective blog post, or a photo, a  document, a diagram, a screen shot, or an activity stream and you will  need to be able to link to all your evidence via one URL &ndash; so it needs  to be held online somewhere. If you have a number of different pieces of  evidence you want to submit, the easiest way of doing this is to set up  a Cloud. Use the text box to describe your evidence and how it meets  the criteria and then &lsquo;Add content&rsquo;, &lsquo;Add embedded content&rsquo; or &lsquo;Add  link&rsquo; for as many pieces of evidence as you need. Then copy and paste  the URL for you evidence Cloud into this page. If you want to know more  about how to share pictures, videos, documents and ideas on Cloudworks,  there&rsquo;s <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2522">a Cloud</a> about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What if I don&rsquo;t meet the criteria?</strong></p>
<p>Someone will check that the evidence that you have provided meets the criteria. If it doesn&rsquo;t, they will give you feedback to say why and you will get as many chances to resubmit new or revised evidence as you need.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when I am awarded a badge?</strong></p>
<p>When your badge application has been approved you will receive an  email letting you know. You will also be given the opportunity to click a  link to add the badge you were awarded in Cloudworks to your Mozilla  backpack if you have one. You can find out more about setting up your  Mozilla Badge Backpacks on the <a href="http://openbadges.org/en-US/">Mozilla Open Badges website</a> but please remember that if you want to be able to transfer you  Cloudworks badges over to Mozilla you will need to use the same email  address when you set up your Backpack as you used to set up your  Cloudworks profile.</p>
<p><strong>Displaying your badge</strong></p>
<p>Your badge will automatically be displayed on your Cloudworks profile page. If you add your badge to your Mozilla Back Pack you can also display it on Twitter, Facebook and Google+. You can also invite people to see your Back Pack by sending them the URL link to it. Badging is quite a new concept but in the future there are likely to be far more places you can display your badges.</p>
<p><strong>Becoming a badge 'issuer'</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/badge/add">'Create a badge' page</a>. Begin by giving your badge a name and describing it. Then add the name of the issuer (this might be your name, the name of your course or institution but make sure you have permission to use the course or institution&rsquo;s name on your badge). The default issuer is Cloudworks.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing an image</strong></p>
<p>Badges need to be a particular size and format; these restrictions are set by Mozilla. You will also need to make sure that you have permission to use the image. Once someone has been awarded a badge, the badge image it will appear on their Cloudworks profile page, and may also be added to a Mozilla backpack. Remember that badges should look worth having!</p>
<p><strong>Setting badge criteria</strong></p>
<p>Setting the right criteria for your badge is really important. All the rules you might normally apply to setting clear, achievable and demonstrable assessment criteria apply here too but with open-badges you also need to be careful not to overburden the verifiers &ndash; remember there is a chance that hundreds of people might apply for you badge! As you set the criteria, also remember that applicants will need to be able to prove that they have achieved the criteria by linking to one URL as &lsquo;evidence&rsquo; (which of course might be a Cloud or blog post linking to other URL evidence but essentially all evidence will have to sit online). It is up to the applicant to decide how to demonstrate they have met the criteria but it is helpful if you are able to make suggestions about how they might do this. For example the criteria for a Cloudworks (beginners) badge might read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up your Cloudworks user profile &#40;you will use your      profile&rsquo;s URL as evidence for this badge&#41;</li>
<li>Complete the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4891">Cloudworks cloudquest      challenge</a> and add your answers at the bottom of the cloudquest Cloud</li>
<li>Participate with      more than 5 comments in any <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1896">Cloudworks flash debate</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Choosing a badge approval process</strong></p>
<p>You can either choose a specified verifier or group of verifiers who will check evidence meets criteria and approve or reject applications, or you can leave it to the Cloudworks community to judge whether the badge should be awarded. If you use the latter process then you need to say how many of the community need to agree that criteria have been met. There are pros and cons to each process so think about what will work best in your case.</p>
<p><strong>Being a verifier</strong></p>
<p>You may be asked to become a verifier for a particular badge of badge application. The role of the verifier is a really important one. When you verify an application, make sure that you carefully check that the evidence provided by the applicant really does meet the badge criteria. If the evidence does not yet meet the criteria you must ensure that you give the applicant constructive feedback so that they are able to resubmit successfully should they want to. Even if the application is successful, it is good practice to give feedback.</p>

              <title>Conference Info: Using Elluminate</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3921</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3921</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><a title="elluminate by edtechie99, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36439943@N06/4687270003/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4687270003_b821b79d04_m.jpg" alt="elluminate" width="179" height="91" /></a></p>
<p>The the OU 'Learning in an Open World' conference (22-23 June 2010) is being sponsored by Elluminate who are providing the synchronous conference space. This cloud has links to the sessions <strong>and help for known connection problems (see extra content)</strong>. Please add comments about any problems connecting to this cloud so we know for future use.&nbsp; For full details of the conference see: <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2012">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2012</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Logging in:</strong></p>
<p>Each of the four sessions takes place in a different Elluminate space, ie it has a different URL. This means you have to log into each one separately. You can only log in near the session start time, not days before. There is a limit of 400 users in each session. We can't prebook people I'm afraid, so it is a case of first come, first served.</p>
<p>The links for each session are:</p>
<p>Session 1 (22nd June, morning) playback: <a href="https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-06-22.0052.M.2B75F29C80EFE7AAEF7138B1D7E4AF.vcr&sid=cpp1">https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-06-22.0052.M.2B75F29C80EFE7AAEF7138B1D7E4AF.vcr&amp;sid=cpp1</a></p>
<p>Session 2 (22nd June, afternoon) playback: <a href="https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-06-22.0516.M.D86AEB8E871EAD6819856184070D75.vcr&sid=cpp1">https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-06-22.0516.M.D86AEB8E871EAD6819856184070D75.vcr&amp;sid=cpp1</a></p>
<p>Session 3 (23rd June, morning): (waiting for playback link)</p>
<p>Session 4 (23rd June, afternoon):&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #005488; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" href="https://sas.elluminate.com/m.jnlp?password=M.9DDE389EFCE7B76F7880AE9C0939F4" target="_blank">https://sas.elluminate.com/m.jnlp?password=M.9DDE389EFCE7B76F7880AE9C0939F4</a></p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<p>Elluminate is easy to use, when you log in it launches another window, which contains the main presentation space, a text chat window and a list of who is online. You should test your setup beforehand (you may need to install Java), just so you know it works ok on your machine by visiting:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elluminate.com/Support/?id=62">http://www.elluminate.com/Support/</a>.&nbsp; if you do have problems, please see fixes in extra content section below before contacting the helpdesk for support.</p>
<p>You should ensure that you can access the setup room and that your audio is working. If you have problems, please look at the Elluminate knowledge base: <a href="http://support.elluminate.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=2653">http://support.elluminate.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=2653</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sessions</strong></p>
<p>During the sessions there will be a number of moderators who will focus discussions and deal with problems. However, please try to sort out any technical issues prior to the conference, so the chat sessions are not filled with this. Due to the large number of users, not everyone will have access to the microphone, instead during the discussion sessions moderators can allocate it to someone if they 'raise their hand' (by clicking next to their name). The text chat window will form the main channel for discussion during presentations.</p>
<p>There is a discussion slot during each session. For these we have set up a number of 'rooms' in Elluminate. You can move between rooms easily, by dragging your name onto that room. Once you are in a room, you won't hear what happens in the other rooms, so we can have multiple parallel discussions.</p>]]></description>

              <title>How to...sharing a CompendiumLD Learning Design on Cloudworks</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3687</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3687</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Sharing, discussing and downloading a CompendiumLD learning design is easy to do using Cloudworks.&nbsp; Ideally Learning Design Clouds should include as a minimum both a picture of the design, a link to the zip file for others to download, and some explaination about the context it has been designed for (and possibly how well it's worked!) You may also choose to embed a video or slideshow, add links to resources such as websites and documents or add underpinning academic references. All of these will help promote discussion around the design.</p>
<h2>Sharing a design</h2>
<p>Cloudworks is not a repository so it is not possible to upload a file directly to a site. In this guide we will assume that you will use<a href="http://www.flickr.com/"> Flickr</a> to store Learning Design .jpegs and <a href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/static.py?hl=en&page=guide.cs&guide=21008">Google docs</a> to store your zip file but you could use other repositories, or even your own website.</p>
<p>Before you start, get a .jpeg (image file) of your design from CompendiumLD by opening the design, clicking on File &gt; Export &gt; Jpeg image file. Save the file and upload to Flickr (for more info go to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/photos/">Flickr FAQ</a>). Then export the learning design in a zip file by clicking on File &gt; Export &gt; Learning design file. Save this to your desktop and then upload to <a href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=guide.cs&guide=21008&topic=21010">Google docs</a>. Make sure that you have allowed sharing by clicking on Sharing &gt; Get the link to share&gt; Allow anyone with link to view.</p>
<p>Then...</p>
<p>Set up a new Cloud by clicking on '<a href="/cloud/add">Create a Cloud</a>'.</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Name your design</p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> Give a quick description of your design and the context in which you have used it. You may also want to explain what feedback or discussion you would like around your design i.e. would you like people to try it out and then tell you how they used it? Would you like suggestions about how to solve a design problem? Would you like technical or pedagogical advice?</p>
<p><strong>Add a link:</strong> Add the link to the zip file that you were given by Google docs</p>
<p>Once you have clicked on 'create a Cloud' you will be asked to add tags (to help others find your design) and then go to the Cloud. When you go to the Cloud, click on add embedded content and add the URL for your design image in Flickr.</p>
<p>Finally add your Cloud to the '<a href="/cloudscape/view/2101">Learning Activity Designs</a>' Cloudscape by clicking on 'Add Cloud to Cloudscape' then searching for 'Learning Activity Designs' and clicking on 'Add Cloud to Cloudscape'.</p>
<p>Done!</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2889</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2889</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<div>
<h3>What is the difference between a Cloud  and a Cloudscape?</h3>
<p>Clouds can be anything of relevance to learning and teaching, for example: a website; a description of a learning activity; a case study; a resource or tool; or a summary of a presentation. You can also use clouds to pose questions to the Cloudworks community.</p>
<p>A Cloudscape is simply a collection, or bundle, of related Clouds. You might set up a Cloudscape to group Clouds around a topic (i.e. assessment), an event (i.e. a conference or course), or set up a personal Cloudscape to group Clouds you are particularly interested in. One Cloud can belong to any number of Cloudscapes. For more guidance, see <a href="/cloud/view/2554">How to set up a Cloud or Cloudscape</a>.</p>
<p>Clouds and  Cloudscapes have different functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud:</strong> for discussion, sharing and debate</p>
<ol>
<li>Have  a discussion</li>
<li>Embed  a video or image</li>
<li>Add  a link</li>
<li>Add  an academic reference</li>
<li>Add  extra content </li>
<li>Add  tags</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cloudscape:</strong> for collecting, linking and following  Clouds</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow  the Cloudscape</li>
<li>RSS  feed</li>
<li>View  Cloudstream</li>
<li>Add  tags</li>
<li>Add  Clouds</li>
<li>Upload  a picture</li>
<li>Add  a Twitter feed</li>
</ol></div>
<h3>I didn't receive my registration email - what should I do?</h3>
<p>When you first register you will be send a confirmation e-mail automatically. This will usually happen immediately but in unusual cases may take longer. Sometimes the automatic e-mail will end up in a spam folder so please also check there. If you still haven't received an email after about an hour please contact the team <a href="mailto:cloudworks@open.ac.uk">cloudworks@open.ac.uk</a></p>
<h3>I've lost my password - what should I do?</h3>
<p>If you have lost or forgotten your password, the site can quickly send you a new one.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on Log in</li>
<li>Click on <a href="/user/forgotten_password">Forgotten Password</a></li>
<li>Enter the e-mail address associated  with your account and click send</li>
<li>You will receive an email within a  few minutes (if you don&rsquo;t, check your spam folder)</li>
<li>Click on the link</li>
<li>You will be sent another e-mail with  your new 5 character password</li>
<li>This new password should be changed  as soon as possible. Log in and  change your password by going to your profile page</li>
</ol>
<h3>How do I upload files?</h3>
<p>Cloudworks is not a repository - this means that it is not possible to upload files onto the site. We have done this for a number of reasons, not least because we recognise the issues associated with uploading documents to multiple places (such as editing and managing permissions).</p>
<p>We have made it really easy to embed or link to papers, slideshows, videos, learning designs and pictures etc. For more information on how to do this see <a href="/cloud/view/2522">&lsquo;Sharing pictures, videos, case  studies and ideas through links and embeds&rsquo;</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>My Cloudscape picture is too big. How  can I reduce its size?</h3>
<p>It is possible to upload a picture to a Cloudscape (it is not yet possible to do this  in a Cloud see <a href="/cloud/view/2522">&lsquo;Sharing  pictures, videos, case studies and ideas through links and embeds&rsquo;</a> ) but the following restrictions apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>The  image must be landscape not portrait.</li>
<li>We will crop the picture to 256 &times; 192 pixels. If you want to control how the picture will be cropped, please upload an image of those dimensions. </li>
<li>Maximum  file-size of 500 KB. Maximum upload dimensions (in pixels): 1024 &times; 768.</li>
<li>JPG,  GIF, or PNG image formats</li>
</ol>
<p>You may  find that you have to reduce the size of the picture or compress the file to  upload it:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HP062473551033.aspx?pid=CH010344601033">Using  Microsoft Office Picture Manager to resize your picture</a></p>

<p><a href="http://ww.wikihow.com/Shrink-a-Photo-in-iPhoto">Using Apple's iPhoto to resize  your picture and/ or file size</a></p>
<p>It is worth  noting that you can't do this in Paint.</p>
<h3>How do I add a Twitter stream?</h3>
<p>You can add a Twitter stream to a Cloudscape but not to a Cloud. You can not add a Twitter stream to someone else's Cloudscape unless you have been given admin permission for the cloudscape by the Cloudscape owner. Please note that Tweets are only available from Twitter for 3 months so if you want to keep an enduring record of the discussion you will need to set up a Tweet archive (using a service like <a href="http://twapperkeeper.com/">Twapper Keeper</a>)</p>
<p>To add a Twitter  stream to a Cloudscape go to the Cloudscape and click on edit. Add your <a href="http://help.twitter.com/forums/10711/entries/49309">(#) hash tag</a> in  the Twitter tag box. For more information about setting up a #tag and Twitter archive  please see <a href="/cloud/view/2524">'Using Twitter in  Cloudworks'</a></p>
<h3>Can I restrict access/ add editors to  my Clouds and Cloudscapes?</h3>
<p>The Cloudworks site is open, which means anyone can search for and view everything on the site. However, it is possible to manage permissions to Cloudscapes you have set up. By clicking on <em>'permissions'</em>on the right hand side of your  Cloudscape page you can:</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Close your Cloudscape so that other people can't add Clouds to it</li>
<li>Add one or more users as a 'poster' - this means they can add Clouds to an otherwise closed Cloudscape</li>
<li>Give one or more users full admin rights of your Cloudscape</li>

<h3>Why are my items being moderated?</h3>
<p>It is  really important to us that Cloudworks stays free of spam and we use an  external spam filter on the site called <a href="http://mollom.com/">Mollom</a> which is 99.77% effective. From time to time, the filter will mistakenly identify a message as spam and put it forward for moderation. During working hours will quickly pick these up, check and clear them - although this might take longer at the weekends or in the evenings (GMT). This is likely to be a one-off occurrence.</p>
<p>If you are  finding that your posts are constantly being sent for moderation then please  contact us <a href="mailto:cloudworks@open.ac.uk">cloudworks@open.ac.uk</a> .</p>
<h3>Can I change my password or picture?</h3>
<p>You can  change all of these on your profile page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log-in and click on the red tab with  your name on. </li>
<li>From the drop-down box choose 'Your  Profile'</li>
<li>Then either 'edit' to change your name and other details, 'edit picture' to change or add your picture, or 'change password' to change your password.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Can I have two accounts with the same  password?</h3>
<p>An email address can only be linked to one profile. If you want to set up another profile, for a group or course for example, you will have to choose a different address.</p>
<h3>How can I change my email  notifications?</h3>
<p>You can  switch off and on the following email preferences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Notify  me when somebody follows me</li>
<li>Notify  me when someone comments on one of my Clouds</li>
<li>Notify  me when someone comments of a Cloud on which I have already commented</li>
<li>Receive  occasional e-mails from the Cloudworks team</li>
<li>Display  my e-mail address on my profile</li>
</ol>
<p>You can do  this by logging-in, clicking on the red tab with your name on, and choosing 'E-mail  Preferences'.</p>]]></description>

              <title>How to set up a Cloud or Cloudscape</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3>What are Clouds and Cloudscapes?</h3>
<p>A Cloud could be an idea, tool, question, advice or learning design. For example a brief introduction and a link to a new mindmapping tool, or a question about how you might use Twitter in the classroom successfully. It could also be a session at a conference or workshop activity and contain your slideshow, a discussion stream and links to relevant research and academic references.</p>
<p>You might set up a Cloudscape when you want to bundle together several ideas, tools, activities (Clouds) together. For example for your own use you may want to pull together all Clouds relating to e-assessment, or several activities that relate to one workshop. Clouds can belong to any number of Cloudscapes. If you are still not sure of the difference between a Cloud and a Cloudscape you may find it useful to watch this short <a href="/cloud/view/2413">video</a></p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Cloudworks is an excellent way of engaging event participants in key themes <em>prior</em> to the start of the programme, providing a space for discussion, resources, links and references <em>during</em> a conference and persists as a space for ongoing reflection and engagement <em>after</em> the conference has finished. This Cloudscape has been set up to guide you through the process of setting up your own Conference or event Cloudscape.</p>

<h3><a title="Why use Cloudworks rather than a different tool to support your event?" name="Why use Cloudworks rather than a different tool to support your event?"></a>Why use Cloudworks rather than a different tool to support your event?</h3>
<p>The functionality of Cloudworks compares very well with other tools that are commonly used at conferences (see below) &nbsp;but the site has the added benefit of having an existing and thriving community of people passionate about education. We believe that Cloudworks does three things better than other sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitates open,      cross-group discussion, collaboration and knowledge creation.</li>
<li>Aggregates discussion,      slideshows, videos, related links, papers and academic references all in      one place.</li>
<li>Creates an archive of the      event that people can use to reflect, and continue to develop emerging      themes and ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key terms: Cloudscape:</strong> <em>a home page for the event or conference</em></p>
<p>(see <a title="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1963/all/5#clouds-in-cloudscape" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1963/all/5#clouds-in-cloudscape">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1963/all/5#clouds-in-cloudscape</a> for an example)<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Step 1 Register and set up profile" name="Step 1 Register and set up profile"></a>Step 1 Register and set up profile</h3>
<p>Consider setting up a conference or event organiser profile instead of using your personal profile. This will help you differentiate between your role in organising the event or conference and your role as participant. If you do decide to do this please note that you will have to use a different email address to the one used for your personal profile.</p>
<p>When you set up your new profile you will be asked for the name of the institution or organisation, a Twitter name, an email address and your &lsquo;interests&rsquo; (in the case of the conference this will be focus and themes). Try to fill as much of this in as possible as it will help people find you and hear about the event.</p>
<p>Use a picture that is recognisable to conference or event goers - perhaps a logo or a picture of the building where the event will be held.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Step 2 Set up a Cloudscape" name="Step 2 Set up a Cloudscape"></a>Step 2 Set up a Cloudscape</h3>
<p>Setting up your Cloudscape well in advance of the event ensures that the URL can be used on publicity materials. An event Cloudscape is just like any other Cloudscape but used in a different way. From the home page click on the Events tab at the top of the page and you will see a list of upcoming events, and on the right a beige support box. In this box you will see a link which says <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/add">create a cloudscape</a>. Click on this.</p>
<p>Title: Enter the title of the Conference and in the summary box add the venue and dates.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The description section of your Cloudscape will probably include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A short description of the      conference - title, focus, venue etc</li>
<li>A hyperlink to the      conference website </li>
<li>Hyperlinks to other      relevant webpages (i.e. multimap)</li>
<li>An outline of the      conference timetable</li>
<li>Contact information</li>
<li>A link to a <a href="http://twapperkeeper.com/">TwapperKeeper</a> archive (where Twitter is being used)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using html</strong></p>
<p>If you are confident in using html (or know someone who is) you can edit the text by clicking on the html button at the top of the Description text box. This way you can add anchors so that visitors can navigate more easily around a longer description, and use different heading colours and fonts etc to structure the page.</p>
<p><strong>Adding tags</strong></p>
<p>Tags will help people find your Cloudscape, so choose 3 or 4 which you think represent the event well (these may match your profile &lsquo;interest&rsquo; tags)</p>
<p>If you add a <a href="http://help.twitter.com/forums/10711/entries/49309" target="_self">#tag</a> in the Twitter tag box, any Twitter activity which includes your tag will be streamed down the right hand side of your Cloudscape.</p>
<p><strong>Dates: </strong>Add the start and end date of your event, and the location. Your event will now automatically appear in the Event listings.</p>
<p>Click on &lsquo;Create Cloudscape&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Step 3 Adding Clouds" name="Step 3 Adding Clouds"></a>Step 3 Adding Clouds</h3>
<p>Before you start adding Clouds to your Cloudscape take time to consider how you would like to structure them - this will depend on your event and there is no right or wrong way of doing it. Please note that Clouds will appear in alphabetical/ numerical order so take case to title them so that they appear in the order you want them to!</p>
<p>We recommend that, where possible, conference organisers set up &lsquo;placeholder&rsquo; Clouds for each item and then encourage presenters to take responsibility for organising, maintaining and promoting their Cloud. &nbsp;This ensures that presenters only add what they are happy sharing, and we have noticed that where more ownership is given to contributors, Clouds are better used and richer in content and discussion. To do this you will need to ask presenters to register on Cloudworks and then give them administration rights to the Cloud (click on &lsquo;Permissions&rsquo; on the right of your Cloudscape and then use the &lsquo;search users&rsquo; box; once your presenter&rsquo;s profile is found, click on &lsquo;<em>add as admin&rsquo;</em>. See the link to a word document with support information for presenters &ndash; please download and amend as appropriate.</p>
<p>You will also need to decide whether you want to allow others to add additional Clouds to your Cloudscape. If you decide against this click on &lsquo;Permissions&rsquo; on the right of your Cloudscape and then on &lsquo;<em>make Cloudscape closed&rsquo;</em>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p><strong>1 day workshop:</strong> consider setting up Clouds around topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction (including      aims, outcomes and plan)</li>
<li>Activities </li>
<li>Groups</li>
<li>Themes or discussions (one      for each)</li>
<li>Evaluation </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1912">Example</a></p>
<p><strong>1 day conference:</strong> consider setting up Clouds around topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agenda or programme</li>
<li>Keynotes (one for each)</li>
<li>Presentations (one for      each)</li>
<li>Workshops</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1913">Example</a></p>
<p><strong>Multi-day or large conferences: </strong>set up Clouds as for smaller conferences, but use the &lsquo;Sections&rsquo; tab function to further categorise these for easier navigation. For example you may create tabs for day 1, day 2 etc or individual tabs for Keynotes, presentations, workshops, papers, posters etc.</p>
<p>To use the &lsquo;sections&rsquo; function, set up all the Clouds you want to then click on &lsquo;<em>Manage sections&rsquo;</em> on the right of your Cloudscape page. Click on &lsquo;<em>add a section&rsquo;</em> to add new sections and then click on &lsquo;<em>Add Clouds to a section&rsquo;. </em>This is very easy to do and prevents the problem of an endless and overwhelming list of Clouds on your Cloudscape!</p>
<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/1963/all/5#clouds-in-cloudscape">Example</a> (see the tabs at the top of this hyperlink view) &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a title="Step 4 Promoting and moderating your Cloudscape" name="Step 4 Promoting and moderating your Cloudscape"></a>Step 4 Promoting and moderating your Cloudscape</h3>
<p>If your Cloudscape is to be successful then you will need to allow time for someone to promote it (i.e. using email, Twitter etc) and then encourage people to contribute (by asking and answering questions, thanking contributors and adding links, references and comments yourself). Once the Cloudscape has taken off you will need to do less of this but it is very important at the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Becoming a featured Cloudscape</strong></p>
<p>If you would like your Cloudscape to become featured on the front page, please make your request by email to <a href="mailto:cloudworks@open.ac.uk">cloudworks@open.ac.uk</a> and please make your image as close to 256 &times; 192 pixels as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Emails and publicity materials</strong></p>
<p>Ideally include the URL for your Cloudscape in all publicity material. This gives people a chance to find out about the space and explore. If this is not possible then it will be very important to inform people at the event. Delegates will need to know how to use it and a link to a delegate information document can be found on the right of this page. Please download and amend it as required. <em>It is especially important to ensure as far as possible that delegates are aware that the site is open to all before they begin to contribute.</em></p>
<p><strong>Using Cloudworks for delegate registration</strong></p>
<p>You can use Cloudworks to register delegates. Ask them to register, log in, and then click on the 'attending'' tab at the top of the Cloudscape. As the conference organiser you can then contact all registered delegates via email through the site with conference updates, information and activities.<em><br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Using Twitter to promote the event more widely</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 15% of traffic on Cloudworks comes through referrals from Twitter, for events and conferences the percentage is likely to be significantly more. &nbsp;Once you have set up your Cloudscape, tweet the URL out to your followers from time to time before, during and after your event. Ask others to retweet it.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Using Twitter in Cloudworks</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2524</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2524</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Using <a href="http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ELI7027.pdf">Twitter</a> with Cloudworks allows for discussion which can be faster and more dynamic, and which pulls in people from a wider community. You may decide to incorporate Twitter into your Cloudscape when you want to include a wider discussion about a key question or issue. For example, Twitter can be used during workshops or conferences and be added to your Conference or workshop Cloudscape. The resulting discussion can be academically or creatively interesting in itself, and provide an excellent snapshot or record of the event or learning. Please note that although you can add a Twitter stream to a Cloudscape, you can not add one to a Cloud and you can only add to a Cloudscape you have created or been given editing permission for.</p>
<p>You will need to create a <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter account</a> if you don&rsquo;t already have one.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>(#) Hash tags</strong>. Hash tags are designed to create groupings on Twitter. Anyone joining a discussion about your Cloudscape will add your #tag to the message and it will be picked up and added to your Cloudscape Twitter stream. You create a hash tag by prefixing a short word with a # symbol like this - #cloudworks. Choose a #tag word which is short and relevant to the theme of your Cloudscape i.e. for the LAMS 2009 European Conference we chose #LAMS. Then add you #tag to your Cloudscape (in the Cloudscape edit window).</p>
<p><strong>Promoting your #tag</strong>. You then need to tell people in the Twitter community that they can join the discussion at use your tag. If you are an established Twitterer and already have people following you that would be interested in commenting on your Cloudscape then update your Twitter status with a link to the Cloudscape and your hash tag. If you want to promote your Cloudscape more widely then search for communities in Twitter who may also be interested in your Cloudscape i.e. by searching themes such as learning, assessment etc. and invite their group (using their hash tag at the start of your update and yours at the end). It is likely that you will need to continue to promote your #tag over time and as your discussion develops.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>When people start using your hash tag in their tweets they will appear in the stream on the right of your Cloudscape page.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Twitter archives</strong>. Your Twitter stream will only last a couple of months and then disappear so we recommend that you use a Twitter archive such as <a href="/cloud/add/twapperkeeper.com/" target="_self">TwapperKeeper</a> . You will then need to add your TwapperKeeper archive URL as a hyperlink in your Cloudscape description.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3>Copyright and Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
<p>Cloudworks is a place to share, find and discuss learning and teaching ideas and experiences and by default all comments and content added are currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved" target="_self">All Rights Reserved</a>&nbsp; (although you will soon be able to choose to be covered by a&nbsp; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/" target="_self">Creative Commons</a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">Attribution</a> or <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/uk/" target="_blank">Attribution-Non-commercial</a> licence instead). Creative Commons licences are designed to make sharing and collaboration easier.</p>
<h3>Embeds and links</h3>
<p>It is worth noting though that Cloudworks is not a repository, this means that it is not possible to upload files to the site. All documents, slideshows, videos etc must be hosted on another site (such as Flickr or Slideshare) and linked to, or embedded into a Cloud (<a href="/cloud/view/2511" target="_self">example</a> - scroll down). All work linked or hyperlinked to, or embedded will be covered by the permissions set on the&nbsp; 'host' site i.e. Flickr, YouTube etc. It is important<em> </em>that you adhere to the permissions given on the host site.&nbsp; For example, if you embed a photograph from Flickr it must be your own photo, or one that you have permission to upload, or published under a Creative Commons licence and properly attributed. When you refer to someone else&rsquo;s ideas or theories then they must be referenced, or attributed as appropriate to the work. Where appropriate and available create a &lsquo;link-back&rsquo; to the original online source.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3>Sharing</h3>
<p>Cloudworks is not a repository and you cannot upload your files to Cloudworks but you can easily link to files and content stored elsewhere on websites such as Flickr, Slideshare, YouTube &nbsp;etc. These files can be shared by linking, embedding or added in the text as a hyperlink.</p>
<p><strong>Text</strong>. To add text to a Cloud, either click on <em>'Add content'</em> (if your text is informational) or add text to the '<em>Contribute</em>' box further down (if your text is conversational).</p>
<p><strong>Links.</strong> To link to another web page, just click on '<em>Add link' </em>which can be found towards the top of the page. The links you have added will appear in the middle column beside the discussion.When you add a link you will be asked to give the link a title (so other people will know what it is) and the URL (webpage address i.e. http://www. cloudworks...).</p>
<p><strong>Embeds.</strong> If you want the document, video or slideshow to viewed from the Cloud, rather than just linked to, you can add it by clicking '<em>Add embedded content'</em>'. Again, you will be asked for a descriptive title and the URL. The following sites are supported by this embed function:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://5min.com/">5min</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_self">Amazon Product Images</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_self">Flickr</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/">Googledocs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://video.google.com/" target="_self">Google Video</a> </li>

<li><a href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hyperlinks.</strong> Most links will be created by '<em>add link</em>' as above, but occassionally it will be more appropriate to create a hyperlink in the text, for example if you want to create a link to help explain something you're discussing. To do this highlight a word or phrase while editing, and then click on the chain icon. You will be asked for the URL and whether you want the hyperlink to open in a new or the same window.&nbsp; If you create a hyperlink the link will not appear with other links, only in the text.</p>
<h3>Copyright and Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
<p>As detailed in the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/about/tandc">Terms and Conditions</a>, when you add content or comment all your rights are reserved by default.&nbsp; However work linked to, hyperlinked to, or embedded will be covered by the permissions set on the&nbsp; 'host' site i.e. Flickr, YouTube etc. It is important<em> </em>that you adhere to the permissions given on this site.&nbsp; For example, if you embed a photograph from Flickr it must be your own photo, or one that you have permission to upload, or published under a Creative Commons licence and properly attributed.

<p><strong>Creating a user account.</strong> You can view everything available on the site, but if you want to create Clouds or Cloudscapes or if you want to add comments, links, content or references, then you need to <a href="http://cloudworks.open.ac.uk/index.php/user/register.html">create an account</a>. Once you have created an account you can &lsquo;follow&rsquo; both people and Cloudscapes.</p>
<p>'<strong>Following'.</strong> In order to get the best out of the site it is a great idea to begin to follow a few Cloudscapes, clouds and people that interest you as soon as you register. Use the 'tags' link at the top of the page, the Cloudscapes tab or the site search engine to find topics that interest you. Open the Cloudscape/ cloud and click on follow - you can always unfollow if you change your mind. . Find people using the 'people' tab at the top on the page and follow in the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Email alerts. </strong>You will be sent email alerts when someone adds something to a Cloud you have contributed to or a Cloudscape you are following, or if someone starts to follow you. These alerts are an excellent way of keeping in touch with what is happening. If you want to change your email preferences, do so <a href="/user/email/" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Setting up a profile.</strong> Once you have registered, you can set up a profile and include some information about yourself. Your profile page automatically includes your personal Cloudstream, the Clouds you have added, the Cloudscapes and people you are following, and who is following you. All the Clouds created by the people and Cloudscapes you are following are also collected under your Cloudstream.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cloudworks.ac.uk" target="_blank"><strong>The front page</strong></a>. The front page shows a rolling list of particularly active Clouds on the right hand side, featured Cloudscapes are presented in the middle panel and below this, Cloudstreams for Clouds, Cloudscapes, Comments, Links, References and Extra content can be seen. Click on the ones that interest you.&nbsp; RSS feeds can be set up for each of these at the bottom of the front page.</p>
<p><strong>Search engine</strong>. If you are looking for something specific then it is usually quickest to use the site search engine. Enter a word or phrase, and Clouds and Cloudscapes which include that word or phrase in the title or summarytwill be listed. Click on one of these to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Using the tabs at the top of the page.</strong></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><a href="/cloud/cloud_list" target="_blank"><strong>Clouds.</strong></a> You can get a list of all the Clouds in the site by clicking on the' Clouds' tab at the top of the page. A title and brief summary for each Cloud is provided. Click on the link to go to the Cloud.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><a href="/cloudscape/cloudscape_list" target="_blank"><strong>Cloudscapes</strong></a>. Clicking on the 'Cloudscapes' link lists all the Cloudscapes in the site, as with individual Clouds a brief description of each Cloudscape is provided. Clicking on a particular Cloudscape will take you into it and will show all the Clouds associated with that Cloudscape.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong><a href="/tag/" target="_blank">Tags.</a> </strong>If you are browsing (rather than looking for something specific in which case use the search engine) click on the 'tags' link. This will take you to a tag 'cloud' which is ordered according to the popularity of the tag. Click on the tag that interests you for a list of Clouds and Cloudscapes asscociated with that word. You can set up an RSS feed to be updated with any new content added associated with that tag eg new Clouds and Cloudscapes associated with assessment.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><a href="/user/people/" target="_blank"><strong>People</strong></a>. If you are looking for people from a certain institution, or are looking for a specific person, click on the 'people' tab. You will be asked whether you want to search by name or institution. Once you have found the name you are looking for click on the person to see their profile. Click on 'Follow' to follow them. You can also search for content by looking at people's profiles and seeing what Clouds they have set up or are following and keep up to date with their activity by setting up an RSS feed.</p>
