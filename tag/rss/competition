              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>You learn by doing and collaborating, watching videos, accessing just-in-time information from your mobile device, mentoring, and more. Why, then, does the Human Resources department only give you slides to learn from?</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s workers and corporations are united in wanting more access to the formal, non-formal, and informal learning needed to support an increasingly skilled workforce (The Education Commission, 2016; Pew Research Center, 2016a and 2016b). However, today&rsquo;s corporations largely store their learning resources in virtual learning environments (VLEs) that have adopted a uniform way of storing content. This uniform way, called SCORM, was incredibly helpful when it was designed nineteen years ago, and it still has an important role to play today. When SCORM was created, computer-based training was relatively new and organisations needed a single way to store and track training. For a time, innovation in elearning stopped at the known, established boundaries of the VLE (Weller, 2014, p. 194).</p>
<p>Now, a new need has developed: a way to store and track learning when it occurs on mobile devices, or through social and collaborative activities, or offline by reading a book or engaging in stretch assignments, or when participating in simulations or augmented and virtual reality programmes.</p>
<p>An innovation that meets that need was first released in 2013, and had its last planned update in 2016. It is the Experience API (xAPI). xAPI provides a common format for capturing data from today&rsquo;s distributed learning landscape (Rustici Software, n.d.). With xAPI in place, you can free staff development from the confines of SCORM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rely less on elearning courses designed from slides and more on learning experiences;</li>
<li>Recognise learning from formal and informal or non-formal activities (Downes, 2015);</li>
<li>And track not only clicks and views but also correlate learning with performance (Torrance, 2016).</li>
</ul>
<p>Managers and other decision-makers within learning departments and organisations are at a critical point. They need a source from which to gain a high-level, jargon-free understanding of the benefits of xAPI, common applications and uses of xAPI to support learners as they access modern and innovative learning opportunities, best practices and lessons learned, and information they should provide to their learning development and learning technology teams to prepare for implementation of xAPI (HT2 Labs, n.d.).</p>
<p>In my conference presentation, I will discuss and share a workshop created to meet those needs. The workshop helps managers, even those without extensive technical backgrounds, to be prepared to move forward with discussions and decisions about xAPI within their organisation. My presentation will show some of the workshop features and provide attendees with tools they can take with them, for use in their future endeavours.</p>

              <title>policy, politics - and show-biz</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8544</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is an extract from a call for urgent action on <a title="part two" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8528" target="_blank">the politics of education</a>. &nbsp;It says that it's shock that stokes the energy needed to reclaim curriculum.&nbsp; Shock can live dangerously enough to step outside the shallow and narrow manipulation of opinion.&nbsp; It's small-mindedness that puts the future of education at greatest risk. &nbsp;And its big thinking that will bang on the doors of show-biz politicians.</p>
<p>The starting point is that the UK electorate mistrusts politicians - some hold them in contempt.&nbsp; Politicians may not deserve this; but surveys vary only on the extent to which they show it. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s easy enough to find politicos doing nothing more impressive than angling for power. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;d be surprised if you&rsquo;ve not also noticed some trying to get something worthwhile done. &nbsp;And then we have the razzle-dazzle-&lsquo;em performers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe we should be thinking of politicos in three groups: politicians, policy makers and performers?:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electioneering politicians</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serious policy makers</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show-biz performers.</p>
<p>But is every politico only one these?&nbsp; Surely they move there-and-back across a range of standpoints?&nbsp; That movement would make each position an episode in a story, rather than a category on a list. &nbsp;Mind you, some politicos don&rsquo;t move their standpoints very much.</p>
<p>Much of politics deserves to be dismissed.&nbsp; But the serious stuff is where policy makers genuinely try to do something worthwhile with education. &nbsp;And they deserve respect. &nbsp;They also deserve to be interrogated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take, for example, policies to &lsquo;raise aspiration&rsquo;. &nbsp;And who could be against that?&nbsp; But, before the cheering starts, let's ask the questions. &nbsp;Are we rooting for aspirations to be a good out-of-work dad?&nbsp; &nbsp;Do we favour aspirations to quit work and end that stress?&nbsp; Suppose it were an aspiration to oppose the economic growth that damages the planet and ruins the neighbourhood? &nbsp;And, even if any of these get a political cheer, who would make sure that the neglected poor are in on this aspiration thing? &nbsp;A politican can win applause for a claim to &lsquo;justice available to all&rsquo;. &nbsp;But there&rsquo;s enough argy-bargy among the sources cited here to show that &lsquo;justice&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean what you think it means.&nbsp; Neither does &lsquo;available&lsquo;.&nbsp; Nor does &lsquo;all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Policy for aspiration is about people&rsquo;s chances in life - far too important to be left to politics, and certainly not to show-bizz. &nbsp;It's not a lot of laughs, not in Sunderland, anyway. &nbsp;So, if anything can help Alice in Sunderland it will be policy&nbsp;interrogation&nbsp;- acting in whose interests? - heeding which voices? - driven by what stakeholders?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<em>Prospect Magazine</em>&nbsp;monograph,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/free-download-poverty-in-the-uk/">Poverty in the UK</a>, makes a good start on policy.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t know how its seventy pages could have packed in more disagreement about what it should be.&nbsp; Never a dull moment.</p>
<p>And, of course, things changed before&nbsp;<em>Prospect&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;ink had dried.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s out-of-date on bishops, popes and action in the name of religion.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t caught up with what&rsquo;s happening on wages, debt, predators, and economic myths. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s behind the curve on the philosophy of &lsquo;what's fact?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what's knowledge?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;what's valuable?&rsquo;. &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s longer on opinion than on evidence.</p>
<p>But it bumps into all the influences on Alice&rsquo;s life chances.&nbsp; And it surprised and provoked me into trying to get the argument for progressive education into something like a narrative form.&nbsp; A narrative needs a starting point leading to a turning point.&nbsp; Does this?</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; fast-growing technologies mean that unfettered growth is damaging the planet &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; those technologies are also strengthening commerce and weakening government  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; and they&rsquo;re bringing both help and harm to people&rsquo;s personal and social well-being</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; so people can think for themselves about what they believe, value and expect &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the thinking is located in communities that become strangers to each other &nbsp;</p>
<p>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which means that each community makes a different demand on education</p>
<p>... &nbsp; &nbsp;no resolution of this is inevitable it persists with consent and withdrawn consent changes everything&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a narrative if it sets out one thing leading to another. &nbsp;It's like a journey, moving on from the starting point and coming across the turning points. &nbsp;A turning point often surprises and sometimes shocks. &nbsp;And either can lead to unanticipated change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are surprises coming to educational professionals - especially if they are so convinced of their righteousness that they've waited for politicians to ride to their rescue. &nbsp;But they've been&nbsp;stood up, so should they withdraw consent? &nbsp;The planet has enough examples of withdrawn consent for people to wonder whether the days of national politics are numbered. &nbsp;Some of the people are brits. &nbsp;And some of those are students</p>
<p>Could it be a turning point for 'provoking the imagination and realising new possibilities'? &nbsp;And how crazy is it to wonder that, if educationist can't rely on national government, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea to look around for what might be more reliable?</p>
<p>This blog&rsquo;s evidence show that a national government stability depends on inclusive and responsive institutions.&nbsp; It documents policy which excludes open institutions. &nbsp;It quotes&nbsp;global commerce's&nbsp;unresponsive scripts for education. &nbsp;There are, of course, denials; but the evidence is that commerce is moving in on education and policy is not obstructing it.</p>
<p>And so the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) is sticking its neck out. &nbsp;It wants national governments to back off. &nbsp;National governments are too big to grasp locally variable experience, and too small to protect that experience from globally-generated damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSA looks instead to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal">The Power of Cities</a>&nbsp; (journal #3).&nbsp; For a start, it requires us to rise above the show-biz clowns in charge of some of our cities.&nbsp; The more important reality is that around half the world&rsquo;s population is living in metropolitan areas.&nbsp; Sunderland is among them.&nbsp; And the numbers are increasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cities people need to learn to live with all kinds of others. &nbsp;They are close enough to the action for people to know what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;And cities are big enough for them to find more than one way of dealing with things. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why RSA-chief Matthew Taylor (p.5) recognises cities as a promising new setting for designing education policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are significant advantages. &nbsp;A city can develop a network of local stakeholder organisations, reaching to all its neighbourhoods, outlying villages and other settlements. &nbsp;Few locations are entirely out of urban reach. &nbsp;Those that are choose to be.</p>
<p>Political scientists (pp.20ff) find four upsides. &nbsp;Cities have: (1) a wide-enough range of sources to draw upon; (2) a great-enough range of ideas to engage with; (3) a willingness to let go of what no longer works; and (4) an ability to re-integrate the insights that large-scale clumsiness has fragmented. &nbsp;They&nbsp;see cities as thriving on that scope and complexity rather than relying on the bogus persuasiveness of the narrow and shallow.</p>
<p>There are exceptions but, world-wide, cities are gathering approving coverage. &nbsp;The records show that they can act quickly on dealing with the consequences of global warming. &nbsp;They are well placed to undermine trafficking in flesh and drugs.&nbsp; They are moving into locally-relevant crime-control measures, traffic-management schemes and health-and-safety programmes. &nbsp;And no policy needs this combination of local responsiveness and wide-ranging scope than a policy for education.</p>
<p>And cities do not need to be dependent on commercial and government funding; indeed, they really need to be looking elsewhere.&nbsp; Economists (pp.10ff) have tracked city-based capacity for gaining alternative funding with fewer strings attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also business-world voices (pp.32ff) that can see how such trends are usefully getting organised independently of commerce and state.&nbsp; They are seen to be fostering change that is owned by communities and is developed on a human scale. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Metropolitan smarts seem to hold out a hope of dumping national politicking and outflanking global power. &nbsp;But Matthew Taylor advises the hopeful not to hold their breath: it&rsquo;s going to take time. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s right: there are logistical issues for anchoring civil society to metropolitan areas; market players try to eliminate competition not encourage it; and transatlantic trade agreements already protect them. &nbsp;Matthew Taylor is talking about policy, and policy takes time to be realised. &nbsp;It will need persistent stakeholder action to neutralise shareholder guile.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a long haul. &nbsp;It won&rsquo;t be completed in a parliament - I doubt in my lifetime.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m betting it will happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a narrative that is relatively easy to talk about.&nbsp; And a backstory that is not. &nbsp;Education needs the bigger story...</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; civil society is bigger than the big society  because it gets organised for coordinated action</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stakeholder&rsquo;s interests are wider than shareholder&rsquo;s  because they work with the people whose lives are affected</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; citizen voice is bigger that consumer demand  because it knows how a local past, present and future belongs to local people</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conversation is bigger than commissioned consultancy  because it voices both expertise and experience&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning for action is bigger than winning an argument  because it understands the narrative in order to change it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the backstory. &nbsp;It makes the promise possible. &nbsp;The evidence is that without informed resistance to the hegemonic power that it reveals there can be no progressive education. &nbsp;It shows that the resulting promise can be kept with or without national government support. &nbsp;It believes that nothing is inevitable and that withdrawn consent can change everything.&nbsp; It holds to the stakeholder interests and voice that can make change happen.&nbsp; And it insists that education is community property and must be returned to its owners.</p>
<p>Alice will believe none of this unless her educators do.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Bill Law<br /></strong> <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p><strong>on causes-and-effects</strong></p>
<p>Political influences have been famously characterised by a UK prime minister as &lsquo;events, dear boy, events&rsquo;.&nbsp; He also confessed that politics are &lsquo;the art of the possible&rsquo;. &nbsp;His remarks display a genteel modesty about power.&nbsp; It was long ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The political management of events and possibilities has since been seriously weakened.&nbsp; This account shows how increasingly powerful and globally-situated commercial interests besiege domestic politics.&nbsp; Part of the political response is to concede to those interests, and some of these concessions relate to education. &nbsp;But there are conflicts of interest and frustrations of intention embedded in all of this.&nbsp; The politics of all colours sometimes seem to call less on genteel modesty than on futile desperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet government needs to be able plausibly to declare that it can make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives. &nbsp;And so where it finds itself a global loser, it looks for domestic wins. &nbsp;The bigger reality is that issues for contemporary society reach from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; But plausible politics contains attention, keeping it close to home. &nbsp;And education is close to everybody&rsquo;s home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the evidence here is that education is close to home in a sense that central governments are in no position to manage.&nbsp; The dynamics&nbsp;found here&nbsp;of how people learn are precarious, complex and local.&nbsp; Their causes and effects play out differently in different neighbourhoods. &nbsp;Central claims to educational solutions can be made to sound plausible, but this evidence shows them rarely to be credible.</p>
<p>Central directives cannot accommodate local variability. &nbsp;Claims to be acting in everybody's interest do not stand up. &nbsp;This section includes evidence that what is proposed for education-for-all actually works well in some localities, but is demonstrably damaging in others.</p>
<p>Government needs a narrative for education. &nbsp;But it's the backstories, reaching wider and probing deeper, that point to hope. &nbsp;They lift education above government press releases of the narrow, the shallow and the easier to take on board. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The politically neglected particularly need the backstory if their needs are to be understood. &nbsp;And there are out-of-power and opportunistic politicians claiming to understand those neglected interest. &nbsp;The political landscape is being reshaped.</p>
<p>It would be understandable were preoccupied educators to overlook it. &nbsp;But it would be a mistake. &nbsp;Prevailing political narratives shape the future of education in the interest of the constituencies they serve. &nbsp;The backstories are essential to an understanding of how any of those futures will play out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This section revisits the art of the possible and its events, searching among backstories for leads on progressive action. &nbsp;There's no shortage of troublesome news here. &nbsp;The challenge is to make good use of bad news. &nbsp;The section searches for what educators need to understand in order to set up credible causes of needed effects which ignite realisable hope.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; causes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/freedom-for-sale-by-john-kampfner-1784894.html">Freedom for Sale</a> - think-tank based analysis, illustrating how world-wide global corporations gain control of national governments - it describes how weakened governments pump up domestic anxieties, notably concerning health and education - their promises of liberation camouflage the realities of a global capture of governments, and the services they commission</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators working with students and stakeholders need a voice speaking deeply and widely enough to tell of global pressure in terms of local needs</p>
<p><a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Restating_the_State.html?id=mbHpaptI7CwC&redir_esc=y">Restating the State</a> - collection of articles by politically-sophisticated authors, showing that repeated attempts to reduce the size of the state have failed - this is a failure of both the political right and left - the failure includes various attempts to reduce the costs of education - the collection examines the state&rsquo;s weak relationship with market forces, but concedes the relationship as necessary - however it also argues that a sustainable future needs a clear idea of what makes a public good - that means reconciling public ownership with individual rights, a renewed sense of citizenship, and a commitment to personal-and-social well being - the articles assume that solutions will be found in the generalised processes of national politics, it therefore speaks in largely abstract terms</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->education stakeholder groups are not political abstractions but&nbsp;organisers of informed&nbsp;action&nbsp;that is&nbsp;concrete, operational and locally-recognisable</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6344672">Is PISA flawed?</a> - education journalist&rsquo;s report on doubts about the international politics of education - the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has world-wide influence on the politics of education - but statisticians claim that its methodology is misleading - its host, the Organisation for Economic and Cultural development (OECD), shows more interest in setting out clear results for besieged politicians than in disentangling the complexities of education&rsquo;s causes and effects</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders can work on research data in conversation with the people in all education institutions who understand research methods</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/11/why-nations-fail-acemoglu-robinson-review">Why Nations Fail</a> - journalist&rsquo;s review of a world-wide academic explanation of why national survival depends on what kind of political institutions they set up - it characterises some political institutions as &lsquo;extractive&rsquo; because they exclude from benefit all but the few, that is themselves and their closest supporters - the explanation contrasts these with &lsquo;inclusive&rsquo; institutions, which distribute the benefits of action to the many, that is most or all of their citizens - the explanation also shows how history documents the prevalence of these competing orientations - and it shows how, over time, control of technology and science have change the balance of power in favour of exclusion - that trend is discrediting politics, undermining governments and causing political collapse</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders groups need to include both reliable expertise and authentic experience in education if they are to neutralise politicised exclusion&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/29/europe-british-politicians-stand-up-anti-eu-populism">Beware this populism sweeping across Europe</a> - journalist&rsquo;s review of professor of politics&rsquo; account of populism in politics - following the explanation of &lsquo;Why Nations Fail&rsquo;, it argues that institutions once set up for informed debate are being invaded by the political stoking of emotional heat - the resulting intentions are contained inside a narrow scope, where easy conclusions can be reached from short statements - the tactic often invites anxiety, provocation and blame - a consequences is that the extent and complexity of conflicted political realities are overlooked - the overall argument points to the dangers to democracy in seeking only for political advantage - such politics lacks the courage of leadership which brings people to where they can claim citizenship, grasp realities, find social membership, and value education</p>

<p><a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Schumpeter.html">Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</a> - scholarly definition of the neo-lib theory which is increasingly embraced by national governments - it argues for &lsquo;creative destruction&rsquo; which allows businesses that are not growing to collapse, so that they can be replaced by enterprises seeking growth - but neo-lib thinking ignores the many ways in which a settled business can be valued by&nbsp;its community - and so its thinking demands that effective local education must be scaled up, so it become more generally and commercially marketable - but this the right-wing hijacking of a left-wing theory - creative destruction was&nbsp;first&nbsp;designed to reinvigorate useful local businesses - and that is what neo-lib economics fails to do</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->local education means by definition not to be scaled-up and its stakeholders are there to invigorate what is at its best scaled-down&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/09/labour-unite">&lsquo;...Unions aren&rsquo;t influential enough...&rsquo;</a> - economic commentator&rsquo;s argument that the voice of working people has been suppressed by a closed circle of corporate power and political establishment - the argument is that experience of work-life, and the agencies that support it, are not represented in the UK parliament - nor in any other fairly-reported part of public life</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->progressive educators are close to worker representation&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;where both are committed to people&rsquo;s fulfillment and well-being&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jul/24/charities-voluntary-sector-five-years-existence">&lsquo;...we&rsquo;ve got five years left...&rsquo;</a> - journalist&rsquo;s report of think-tank research into the future viability of &lsquo;third-sector&rsquo; charities and volunteering - the research is illustrated by anecdotal reports on what active members of society think of government appeals to &lsquo;the big society&rsquo; - those appeals are for the third sector to meet the demands that first-sector policy and second-sector commerce cannot or will not supply - this is neo-lib thinking, supportive of private-sector commerce and committed to reducing public-sector spending - but community-based educators are part of the third-sector and, as charitable or voluntary outfits, they are not commercially motivated - neither do they see themselves as agencies of the state - the title of the report reflects widespread pessimism concerning the future of genuinely charitable and voluntary helping agencies</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators and their stakeholders need to be able to call on locally-rooted third-sector outfits for their hands-on understanding of local needs&nbsp;</p>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->there can be no unthinking importation of culture but local stakeholders can outflank shallow and narrow thinking by finding like-minded thinking abroad</p>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholder voice means that useful, valued and often informal leadership can be found at all hierarchical levels in education</p>

<p><strong>on results</strong></p>
<p>Why are arguments about politics, once started, so hard to stop? &nbsp; It's not hard to see why some people get started - they're looking for the point.&nbsp; But it's not always easy to find. &nbsp;And even harder to agree what it should be.</p>
<p>Much depends on what sort of results people want to see. &nbsp;Are they a return on investment?&nbsp; Is that the tax we pay?&nbsp; Should we be getting at least as much out as we put in? &nbsp;Suppose it's more like a fee? &nbsp;Would that be like an admission charge for membership of society? &nbsp;Suppose some people can't afford it? &nbsp;Could the payoff be held in common ownership? &nbsp;Would we then let people draw on it just because they need it? &nbsp;How would we know?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And why would anyone see it one way and dismiss all others?&nbsp; Is it because, as a species, we each protect our own's best chances to survive and flourish? &nbsp;Do we extend that protection to people we like? &nbsp;And who are like us? &nbsp;They and their children? &nbsp;People we've never met.&nbsp; Other people&rsquo;s children? &nbsp;Is this getting out of hand?</p>
<p>And where do we find these people? &nbsp;Citizens on the street? &nbsp;Workers in the economy ?&nbsp; Claimants on benefits? &nbsp;Grandparents in care. &nbsp;Immigrants at the airport? &nbsp;Subjects of the queen? &nbsp;Should different roles have different rules?</p>
<p>Such talk is full of contradiction, complexity and confusion.&nbsp; Never let anybody tell you &lsquo;it&rsquo;s as simple as that!&rsquo; - they don&rsquo;t know that they don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;I suppose that's why it&rsquo;s hard to bring a political argument to an end - there&rsquo;s too much to disentangle, much of it irreconcilable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This material finds why it is that claim the political high ground. &nbsp;It also finds what kind of evidence points to that claim being a fact, or an opinion, or a lie. &nbsp;The argument here is that there is no more important task for educators than enabling that critical thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evidence stems from three question to be put to any education programme:&nbsp;</p>
<ol><ol><ol>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->interests</strong> does it serve?&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->voices</strong> should it heed? &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what can <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders</strong>&nbsp;do about it?</li>
</ol></ol></ol>
<p>The questions locate education policy where it can be done with or without the support of party politics.&nbsp; Education policy has no need to be tied to a party, but it does need to be established as a movement. &nbsp;That means taking a stand on pressures and priorities. &nbsp;Which means looking wider and deeper than where party politics is prepared to go. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jun/30/population-growth-wipe-out-life-earth">&lsquo;Humans are the real threat&rsquo;</a> - statistical mathematician&rsquo;s estimates of what he takes to be the most pressing priorities for government action - he calculates the probabilities that what any organisation can do about anything will be curtailed most by its damaging impact on the biosphere and the diminishing availability of resources&nbsp;- in a range of issues for education, stretching from the personal to the planetary, there is no more basic voice for policy than that&nbsp;- it makes the neo-lib pursuit of unlimited growth non-viable - educators, acting independently of the interests of commerce and government, can develop informed, authentic and constructive ways of enabling students to work on these base-line realities</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators and their stakeholders can see unrestrained growth as an issue for the well-being of students&rsquo; and for the children they have and will have&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/9365">&lsquo;...Rescuing the enlightenment...&rsquo;</a> - review of a free-thinking publication, arguing that there can be no idea more significant for education than &lsquo;enlightenment&rsquo; - it originates in the politics of resisting control by crown and mitre - it values well-being and fulfillment above obedience and salvation - it is contentious, arguing that the right to independence can be curtailed by the powerful - and also that control is as much asserted by background and culture as by nation and state - wherever it focuses, the thinking is rejected by some who see it as an instrument of western intellectual imperialism - but enlightenment offers no guarantee of either truth or progress, it thrives on argument - and similar stands have, in both medieval North Africa and in modern Europe, made educational progress possible - the enlightenment&rsquo;s part in education would be to engage students in the value of critical thinking concerning control by political power, by religious belief or by monetary wealth - and it would enable students to act on that independence</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->there&rsquo;s no escape from competing claims on education so its stakeholders need to know where to take a stand</p>
<p><a href="http://helenaroy.wordpress.com/2012/10/27/review-justice-whats-the-right-thing-to-do-by-michael-sandel/">Justice - What&rsquo;s the Right Thing to Do</a> - commentator&rsquo;s review of an ethics publication arguing that values are what a society says they are - this may be because they are convenient to some dominant interest - but it may also be because they accord with what most people can recognise as, in some sense, &lsquo;good&rsquo; - goodness can attach to a handed-down belief about what is honorable, virtuous or safe - it can move into the protection of a person&rsquo;s right to act on behalf of self and those close to self, the self responsibly accepting the consequences of the resulting action - but values can move farther into the justice of protecting people&rsquo;s well-being, not because they are thought of as deserving or responsible but because they belong to a shared humanity - an outcome of education is, then, the enablement of students to take a defensible position, while offering the same respect for others as they would argue for themselves - there is no greater demand on imagination than picturing what you would wish from a society if you did not yet know where, with what, and to whom you will be born - and there are few issues which call more widely or deeply on what a good education should promise</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators and their stakeholders are part of a civil society independently voicing the values and interests of people engaging with living together</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/19/richard-hoggart-virtue-and-reward-review">Virtue and Reward</a> - journalist&rsquo;s review of a scholarly reappraisal of &lsquo;The Uses of Literacy&rsquo; - it is a book setting out learning as enabling &lsquo;working-class&rsquo; people usefully to examine critical issues - the learning does not lead to ready-made answers, nor is it materialistic, and it is worked out with others in a community, sharing a culture - the re-appraisal contrasts then with now - in contemporary cultures literacy is found to be for asserting opinion, urging &lsquo;have your say&rsquo;, &lsquo;get your message across&rsquo; and &lsquo;win attention&rsquo; - there is less interest in what &lsquo;The Uses of Literacy&rsquo; takes to be &lsquo;respectable&rsquo; or &lsquo;responsible&rsquo; thinking - and, it&rsquo;s true, such old-fashioned talk is now unlikely to impress - it should, however, be possible to ask that learning is &lsquo;informed&rsquo; and &lsquo;thought-through&rsquo;, and to hope that learning can enable people for reflective as well as assertive conversations - such a society would then be equipped to undermine what is shallow and narrow - and learning would enable people to change their minds - the review raises political issues, including the effects of close links between the US and UK - but the reappraisal doubts that the politics of education can do much about any of this - yet government needs to know how lost reflectiveness and contemporary assertiveness is reshaping what&rsquo;s left of progressive policy - the reflective uses of literacy were never more needed - and, if government can&rsquo;t see that, education&rsquo;s stakeholders can</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->a society relies for its survival on educators enabling people to deal with issues in ways that are informed and thought through</p>
<p><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/807-politics">Politics - the Central Texts</a> - annotated link to publications on progressive politics - the focus is on the neglected needs and lost potential of the excluded - the publications are broad-based, drawing on philosophy, social theory, economics, law and politics - they set out what needs to be done to raise hopes for establishing a full and democratic life - this is argued to require developing a pragmatic and comprehensive alternative to neo-liberalism - the starting point is a diagnosis of limited political imagination - it makes politics arbitrary and haphazard - but the reality need not be chaotic where members of a society can reconceive, reform and rebuild it - and&nbsp;nothing is inevitable concerning&nbsp;property, democracy and wages - but what influential interests institutionalise curtails all such possibilities, and much of human potential is being lost - these documents argue that things will remain like this until members of each society are surprised by events which provoke the imagining and realising of new possibilities - the breadth and depth of the intellectual sources informing this argument call for big thinking, developing a broader and deeper understanding of what's going on than is commonly understood</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->education thinking needs to be wide enough to connect and open enough to explain so that purposes are imaginative enough to make a difference</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>policy, politics - and show-biz &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This final section is allowing itself to be surprised by events that 'provoke the imagining and realisation of new possibilities'.&nbsp; That shock lives dangerously, by stepping outside the shallow and narrow. &nbsp;The assumption here is that it's small-mindedness which poses the bigger risk.</p>
<p>The starting point is that the UK electorate mistrusts politicians - some hold them in contempt.&nbsp; Politicians may not deserve this; but surveys vary only on the extent to which they show it. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s easy enough to find politicos doing nothing more impressive than angling for power. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;d be surprised if you&rsquo;ve not also noticed some trying to get something worthwhile done. &nbsp;And then we have the razzle-dazzle-&lsquo;em performers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe we should be thinking of politicos in three groups: politicians, policy makers and performers?:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electioneering politicians</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serious policy makers</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show-biz performers.</p>
<p>But is every politico only one these?&nbsp; Surely they move there-and-back across a range of standpoints?&nbsp; That movement would make each position an episode in a story, rather than a category on a list. &nbsp;Mind you, some politicos don&rsquo;t move their standpoints very much.</p>
<p>Much of politics deserves to be dismissed.&nbsp; But the serious stuff is where policy makers genuinely try to do something worthwhile with education. &nbsp;And they deserve respect. &nbsp;They also deserve to be interrogated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take, for example, policies to &lsquo;raise aspiration&rsquo;. &nbsp;And who could be against that?&nbsp; But, before the cheering starts, let's ask the questions. &nbsp;Are we rooting for aspirations to be a good out-of-work dad?&nbsp; &nbsp;Do we favour aspirations to quit work and end that stress?&nbsp; Suppose it were an aspiration to oppose the economic growth that damages the planet and ruins the neighbourhood? &nbsp;And, even if any of these get a political cheer, who would make sure that the neglected poor are in on this aspiration thing? &nbsp;A politican can win applause for a claim to &lsquo;justice available to all&rsquo;. &nbsp;But there&rsquo;s enough argy-bargy among the sources cited here to show that &lsquo;justice&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean what you think it means.&nbsp; Neither does &lsquo;available&lsquo;.&nbsp; Nor does &lsquo;all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Policy for aspiration is about people&rsquo;s chances in life - far too important to be left to politics, and certainly not to show-bizz. &nbsp;It's not a lot of laughs, not in Sunderland, anyway. &nbsp;So, if anything can help Alice in Sunderland it will be policy&nbsp;interrogation&nbsp;- acting in whose interests? - heeding which voices? - driven by what stakeholders?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <em>Prospect Magazine</em> monograph, <a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/free-download-poverty-in-the-uk/">Poverty in the UK</a>, makes a good start on policy.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t know how its seventy pages could have packed in more disagreement about what it should be.&nbsp; Never a dull moment.</p>
<p>And, of course, things changed before <em>Prospect&rsquo;s</em> ink had dried.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s out-of-date on bishops, popes and action in the name of religion.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t caught up with what&rsquo;s happening on wages, debt, predators, and economic myths. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s behind the curve on the philosophy of &lsquo;what's fact?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what's knowledge?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;what's valuable?&rsquo;. &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s longer on opinion than on evidence.</p>
<p>But it bumps into all the influences on Alice&rsquo;s life chances.&nbsp; And it surprised and provoked me into trying to get the argument for progressive education into something like a narrative form.&nbsp; A narrative needs a starting point leading to a turning point.&nbsp; Does this?</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; fast-growing technologies mean that unfettered growth is damaging the planet &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; those technologies are also strengthening commerce and weakening government  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; and they&rsquo;re bringing both help and harm to people&rsquo;s personal and social well-being</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; so people can think for themselves about what they believe, value and expect &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the thinking is located in communities that become strangers to each other &nbsp;</p>
<p>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which means that each community makes a different demand on education</p>
<p>... &nbsp; &nbsp;no resolution of this is inevitable it persists with consent and withdrawn consent changes everything&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a narrative if it sets out one thing leading to another. &nbsp;It's like a journey, moving on from the starting point and coming across the turning points. &nbsp;A turning point often surprises and sometimes shocks. &nbsp;And either can lead to unanticipated change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are surprises coming to educational professionals - especially if they are so convinced of their righteousness that they've waited for politicians to ride to their rescue. &nbsp;But they've been&nbsp;stood up, so should they withdraw consent? &nbsp;The planet has enough examples of withdrawn consent for people to wonder whether the days of national politics are numbered. &nbsp;Some of the people are brits. &nbsp;And some of those are students</p>
<p>Could it be a turning point for 'provoking the imagination and realising new possibilities'? &nbsp;And how crazy is it to wonder that, if educationist can't rely on national government, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea to look around for what might be more reliable?</p>
<p>This blog&rsquo;s evidence show that a national government stability depends on inclusive and responsive institutions.&nbsp; It documents policy which excludes open institutions. &nbsp;It quotes&nbsp;global commerce's&nbsp;unresponsive scripts for education. &nbsp;There are, of course, denials; but the evidence is that commerce is moving in on education and policy is not obstructing it.</p>
<p>And so the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) is sticking its neck out. &nbsp;It wants national governments to back off. &nbsp;National governments are too big to grasp locally variable experience, and too small to protect that experience from globally-generated damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSA looks instead to <a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal">The Power of Cities</a>&nbsp; (journal #3).&nbsp; For a start, it requires us to rise above the show-biz clowns in charge of some of our cities.&nbsp; The more important reality is that around half the world&rsquo;s population is living in metropolitan areas.&nbsp; Sunderland is among them.&nbsp; And the numbers are increasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cities people need to learn to live with all kinds of others. &nbsp;They are close enough to the action for people to know what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;And cities are big enough for them to find more than one way of dealing with things. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why RSA-chief Matthew Taylor (p.5) recognises cities as a promising new setting for designing education policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are significant advantages. &nbsp;A city can develop a network of local stakeholder organisations, reaching to all its neighbourhoods, outlying villages and other settlements. &nbsp;Few locations are entirely out of urban reach. &nbsp;Those that are choose to be.</p>
<p>Political scientists (pp.20ff) find four upsides. &nbsp;Cities have: (1) a wide-enough range of sources to draw upon; (2) a great-enough range of ideas to engage with; (3) a willingness to let go of what no longer works; and (4) an ability to re-integrate the insights that large-scale clumsiness has fragmented. &nbsp;They&nbsp;see cities as thriving on that scope and complexity rather than relying on the bogus persuasiveness of the narrow and shallow.</p>
<p>There are exceptions but, world-wide, cities are gathering approving coverage. &nbsp;The records show that they can act quickly on dealing with the consequences of global warming. &nbsp;They are well placed to undermine trafficking in flesh and drugs.&nbsp; They are moving into locally-relevant crime-control measures, traffic-management schemes and health-and-safety programmes. &nbsp;And no policy needs this combination of local responsiveness and wide-ranging scope than a policy for education.</p>
<p>And cities do not need to be dependent on commercial and government funding; indeed, they really need to be looking elsewhere.&nbsp; Economists (pp.10ff) have tracked city-based capacity for gaining alternative funding with fewer strings attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also business-world voices (pp.32ff) that can see how such trends are usefully getting organised independently of commerce and state.&nbsp; They are seen to be fostering change that is owned by communities and is developed on a human scale. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Metropolitan smarts seem to hold out a hope of dumping national politicking and outflanking global power. &nbsp;But Matthew Taylor advises the hopeful not to hold their breath: it&rsquo;s going to take time. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s right: there are logistical issues for anchoring civil society to metropolitan areas; market players try to eliminate competition not encourage it; and transatlantic trade agreements already protect them. &nbsp;Matthew Taylor is talking about policy, and policy takes time to be realised. &nbsp;It will need persistent stakeholder action to neutralise shareholder guile.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a long haul. &nbsp;It won&rsquo;t be completed in a parliament - I doubt in my lifetime.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m betting it will happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a narrative that is relatively easy to talk about.&nbsp; And a backstory that is not. &nbsp;Education needs the bigger story...</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; civil society is bigger than the big society  because it gets organised for coordinated action</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stakeholder&rsquo;s interests are wider than shareholder&rsquo;s  because they work with the people whose lives are affected</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; citizen voice is bigger that consumer demand  because it knows how a local past, present and future belongs to local people</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conversation is bigger than commissioned consultancy  because it voices both expertise and experience&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning for action is bigger than winning an argument  because it understands the narrative in order to change it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the backstory. &nbsp;It makes the promise possible. &nbsp;The evidence is that without informed resistance to the hegemonic power that it reveals there can be no progressive education. &nbsp;It shows that the resulting promise can be kept with or without national government support. &nbsp;It believes that nothing is inevitable and that withdrawn consent can change everything.&nbsp; It holds to the stakeholder interests and voice that can make change happen.&nbsp; And it insists that education is community property and must be returned to its owners.</p>
<p>Alice will believe none of this unless her educators do.</p>

<p class="qote" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>asked to suggest a university mission statement, a philosophy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;professor suggested &lsquo;analysing concepts for our region&rsquo; </em></p>
<p align="right">urban myth?</p>
<p>Philosophy poses the most basic of questions - &lsquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo;, &lsquo;how do we know?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;why does it matter?&rsquo;.&nbsp; They often-enough need some kind of answer before anybody does anything about something.&nbsp; The trouble is that they rarely get quick-and-easy answers; they get what the professor calls &lsquo;concepts&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My shot at seeing how educators work on such questions is set out in an <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497">account of what educators can do</a>.&nbsp; It shows a lot going on, much of it is based on little more than opinion, and all of it is fiercely contested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Politicians also lay claim to similar what-how-why questions - they need to say what they&rsquo;re doing, how they go about it, and why it&rsquo;s a good idea. &nbsp;This blog takes a look at the opportunities they grasp, the connections they make,&nbsp;the options they find, the complexities they navigate, and the gains they make.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be a quick and easy read; nobody can deal with it in one take. &nbsp;But nobody needs to.&nbsp; So scan the pages to find what your work can act on. &nbsp;Skip what looks as though it can safely be ignored.&nbsp; Then figure what sort of political support education on your particular patch needs.&nbsp; No two are the same.</p>
<p>But mark this: one of the reason why proposals don&rsquo;t deliver is because something else needed to be done first.&nbsp; And that sometimes means recovering the at-first-ignored and making it the now-reconsidered.</p>
<p>I somehow doubt that the philosophy professor&rsquo;s suggestion galvanised those bosses into reconsidering the organisation&rsquo;s mission statement.&nbsp; But educators don&rsquo;t need a script; this is a range of starting points for thought and action. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Like earlier blogs, each step suggests action by students working with their educators, and by the stakeholder groups representing local interests in education.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on mood</strong></p>
<p class="text">Phrases like &lsquo;sea-change&rsquo;, &lsquo;its time has come&rsquo;, and &lsquo;cometh the hour&rsquo; reflect a belief in the importance of political timing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an ability to shape and catch a nation&rsquo;s mood. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s still about what, how and why to make a move - but it's also about when.</p>
<p class="text">Good timing can be no more than piggyback opportunism - today&rsquo;s headline becomes tomorrow&rsquo;s &lsquo;what teachers must do!&rsquo;. &nbsp;Politicians quickly learn not to waste a crisis. &nbsp;Managed well, good timing can transform a minority myth into a majority belief. &nbsp;This is not recommending that.</p>
<p class="text">But clever political timing sees education as a happy hunting ground for claims that politics can improve electorate's lives.&nbsp; And the claims often turn out to be ignorance of what has already been tried and discredited.&nbsp; Doesn't this mean that educators must get involved in understanding the mood they're dealing with?</p>
<p class="text">But it can't mean following any socio-political consensus. &nbsp;The search here is for durable springs for sustainable action.&nbsp; Like philosophy it's searching for underlying realities, for their reliability, and for their value.&nbsp; So how do we attract a contrary mood's&nbsp;interested attention in that? &nbsp;The way things are changing makes that an interesting question for educators and their studetns - and vital to how they learn from each other.</p>

<p class="text"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on connections</strong></p>
<p class="intro">If other peoples' timing can damage education then educators' timing can progress it.&nbsp; Timing takes hold of connections in the comings-and-goings of what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; It may link to the unfamiliar, and that may be unwanted by some.&nbsp; An exploratory brit careers-work programme was significantly entitled &lsquo;Connexions&rsquo;.&nbsp; But influential professional voices chose to canvas its imperfections. &nbsp;Might such resistance be habits-of-mind dressed up as professionalism?</p>
<p class="intro">Changed connectedness moves professionalism on, reframing conversations about what needs to be done.&nbsp; It pushes the questions beyond &lsquo;what to do?&rsquo; and &lsquo;when to do it&rsquo;.&nbsp; They are now about &lsquo;whom do we listen to?&rsquo; and &lsquo;who do we need to listen to us?&rsquo;&nbsp; These are questions of trust.</p>
<p class="intro">The slowest reader of political economy will soon come across complaints that &lsquo;nobody&rsquo;s listening!&rsquo;. &nbsp;But is it possible to listen to everybody?&nbsp; And what if the cry &lsquo;listening is what it&rsquo;s all about!&rsquo; turns out to be the right-foot left-foot politics of the hokey-cokey? &nbsp;</p>
<p class="intro">And so connectedness is complexity: customers are not always right; deals are struck both over the counter and under it; wanting is not the same as needing; claims are not invariably justified. &nbsp;All may demand a hearing. &nbsp;But not all can be heeded; or should be.</p>
<p class="intro">Shaping the connectedness of progressive education is the work of its stakeholder groups.&nbsp; Their links range from local-and-informal communities to established-and-institutionalised organisations.&nbsp; It means not just allowing things to take their course; it needs a tough-minded deliberate positioning of communities and organisations.&nbsp; It reaches outward to the experience it serves, and inward to the expertise it offers. &nbsp;At it's best it is a nicely-timed and appropriately-connected conversation.</p>

<p class="text"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on complexity</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Policy should be informed by expertise.&nbsp; In education it&rsquo;s hard to avoid the claims of psychology and economics.&nbsp; But there are also the social sciences and cultural theory.&nbsp; All of this is complicated enough, but it is further complicated by doubtful claims, maneuvering&nbsp;for position and as-yet unresolved issues. &nbsp;Whatever you want to urge on politics, Google can inform a&nbsp;plausible&nbsp;but&nbsp;bogus opponent.</p>
<p class="text">The journey is as much a literary as a scientific one.&nbsp; Null hypotheses are hard to formulate; there is too much going on in learning for anybody to be able to say what is never the case.&nbsp; And, anyway, education is a search for what might be so as much as an account of what might not. &nbsp;There is no last word on education.</p>
<p class="text">For most people the need to make sense of education is urgent. &nbsp;And complexity confuses.&nbsp; This attempt to say something useful about education is not inventing complexity where there is none, it is recognising the complexity that is out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">As a species we need to make sense of things, and confusion gets in the way.&nbsp; For some it can mean caving in to what appears to be chaos.&nbsp; That surrender doesn&rsquo;t say that education can be anything we want it to be; it says that education may be nothing at all.&nbsp; Some students agree - and some of them have a point.</p>
<p class="text">But facing complexity means you're still interested, and if you&rsquo;re not confused then you&rsquo;re just not paying attention. &nbsp;Enabling people to tell the difference between which of this is plausible and which is credible is what educators do. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">And there is also this: the more anybody can take account of complexity, then the more ways that person has of figuring out what to do about it. &nbsp;It's a repertoire which can say 'if this won&rsquo;t work, what about that?'.&nbsp; Repertoires have survival value; they make complexity&nbsp;a solution,&nbsp;not a problem. &nbsp;They mean that nothing is inevitable. &nbsp;Taking some complexity on board could keep you and your work afloat. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">All of this makes complexity a starting point, not a place to jump ship.&nbsp; Actually the discomfort of saying &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know where this is going!&rsquo; energises the pursuit of meaning, and finding meaning gives purpose to action.&nbsp; But all of this comes while dealing with complexity, not while evading it.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on beliefs</strong></p>
<p class="text">Complexity and confusion are troublesome.&nbsp; Is it so hard to understand why people are more likely to spend their energy on dealing with the urgent simplicities of day-on-day survival?&nbsp; The contemplation of the complexities of long-term hope gets squeezed out. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">But education needs to be convincing about hope. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a promise, and to break it is to invite rejection.&nbsp; And that turning away can be to where people find their simplest beliefs confirmed.&nbsp; Among the simplest of beliefs are to be quick in instinct, fierce in competition, and strong in retaliation.&nbsp; They may not feel like aberrations to avoid; they&rsquo;re as likely feel like models to emulate. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s education that can feel like the aberration.</p>
<p class="text">The signs of turning away include classroom phenomena: fidgeting with devices, camouflaging comics, gazing out of windows.&nbsp; And there be media giants out there. &nbsp;Media distractions can feel more real than lessons.&nbsp; They include the adoration of the famous, which can breed dependence.&nbsp; And there is also the rage against everything else, and that can breed fear. &nbsp;The media have a strong narrative; it recounts how &lsquo;we bring you closer to what you hope for, and we defend you from what you&nbsp;hate&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">That may be the story, but there is an undeclared back-story. &nbsp;It's about people becoming believers in what politics and commerce want them to believe.&nbsp; It's the backstory which has the greater impact on their chances in life: anybody who can capture beliefs is well on the way to being in charge. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">The backstory is both complicated and inconvenient to dominant interests. &nbsp;So it gets little attention in the media. &nbsp;It can exasperate people attending to filleted versions of the news. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s not too hard to label anyone who tries to draw attention to that as the true outsiders. &nbsp;Informed educators may qualify for the label. &nbsp;Wear it with pride.</p>
<p class="text">But few educators can be surprised to find cynicism among their students.&nbsp; So, is there a way forward? &nbsp;There's no shortcut; the evidence here is that students need to be drawn into a conversation, and that it must start from what they believe. &nbsp;And that may mean working with impulse, suspicion and hate.</p>
<p class="text">So, let's ask ourselves, &lsquo;is academic learning any good at thinking about such things?' and 'do its exams measure how well people are getting on with it?&rsquo;. &nbsp; On the first, our brains discard redundant learning. &nbsp;People quickly forget what they do not get a chance to use. &nbsp;You may have noticed that. &nbsp;On the second, the disappointed are entitled to their doubts about exams.&nbsp; We have not evolved to waste energy on pointless striving. &nbsp;That too?</p>
<p class="text">All of this leaves academic educators holding an awkward student question: &lsquo;but miss, why are we doing this?&rsquo;. &nbsp;Making &lsquo;because it&rsquo;s in the exam&rsquo; the end of the matter positions educators as running the most expensive selection system ever devised.&nbsp; Worse than that, it cops out of the promise.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">The needed conversation may start cynically. &nbsp;But it's actually about finding personal fulfillment, claiming social membership, earning economic independence, and counting on planetary well-being. &nbsp;And all of that makes the interest of the &lsquo;shirkers&rsquo; and &lsquo;strivers&rsquo; as one - indivisible.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Evading the issues insulates education from all but commercial and political concerns.&nbsp; It makes learning a closed system.&nbsp; And it makes what people will wind up believing a foregone conclusion. &nbsp;Some people like that idea. &nbsp;Not progressive educators.</p>
<p class="text">Any understanding of democracy demands that everybody involved in education is clear about where it stands on working with belief. &nbsp;&lsquo;Everybody involved&rsquo; is commerce and politics, it&rsquo;s education and it&rsquo;s stakeholders, and - most of all - it's students. &nbsp;&lsquo;Being clear&rsquo; means declaring what beliefs are worth airing and whether any doubts should be suppressed.&nbsp; The more genuinely inclusive is that appeal then the stronger its narrative.&nbsp; And that narrative determines who gets into bed with whom, and who gets kicked out.</p>

<p class="qote" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>I'd rather leave the job I love than teach the government&rsquo;s propaganda</em></p>
<p class="qote" align="right"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/may/18/gove-leaving-teaching-curriculum-changes-history?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487">the secret teacher</a></p>
<p class="main">The secret teacher speaks for himself; we don't know how many other teachers and lecturers would endorse this condemnation of curriculum abuse.&nbsp; But he may well get a cheer from educators who would not call themselves &lsquo;teachers&rsquo; or &lsquo;lecturers&rsquo;.&nbsp; Education has agencies other than schools-and-colleges.&nbsp; Every locality has some such free-standing voluntary agency or social enterprise. organising help in what is called &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="main">My shot at explaining all this is set out in an earlier <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8484">account of education and policy</a>.&nbsp; I examined influences on education, the beliefs they call upon, and the risks they pose.&nbsp; Here I ask how education can respond to those pressures, by forming and activating stakeholder groups as part of civil society.&nbsp; Civil society, by definition, acts independently of commercial and political pressures.&nbsp; And stakeholder groups give voice to that independence.&nbsp; This blog asks what kind of conversations about education that independence sets up.&nbsp; It means probing what different groups want from curriculum, what commitments they each seek, and what varied outcomes they try to realise.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">The possibilities are far-reaching, especially when education for selection is set alongside education for well being.&nbsp; I look for what gets argued when education for competitiveness is set alongside education for fulfilment.&nbsp; The term &lsquo;learning-for-living&rsquo; crops up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">Curriculum development needs all the independent support it can find in schools and colleges.&nbsp; But an independent education may need civil society more than is yet obvious, even to the secret teacher and his allies.&nbsp; This blog faces the probability that education will be privatised; government is in no position to resist the leverage of commercial interests looking for new markets.&nbsp; Thinking about the future of education needs, then, to grapple with all the possibilities - if not in the public service then in civil society.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">It&rsquo;s a long-term project - bigger than a parliament.&nbsp; But Labour is calling for local communities, in partnership with businesses, to be free of arbitrary demands for unsustainable growth, and working for locally-valued outcomes.&nbsp; Those calls resonate with the forward-looking possibilities signposted here.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on priorities</strong></p>
<p class="intro">Most people can answer to their own satisfaction the question &lsquo;what&rsquo;s education for?&rsquo;.&nbsp; Everybody has some experience to go on.&nbsp; But agreement in a group is less likely - people have different experiences.&nbsp; Some claims are at such levels of word-playing malleability to be useless: talk of &lsquo;inspiration&rsquo;, &lsquo;confidence&rsquo;, &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo; and &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; can obscure more than it illuminates.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not easy for stakeholders to get enough detail on the action that such claims call for.&nbsp;&nbsp; They need to get to grips with how far such underlying priorities can stretch...</p>

<p class="sub"><strong>education, interests and 'noises-off'</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/education-a-very-short-introduction-by-gary-thomas/2002267.article">Gary Thomas</a> has distilled curriculum thinking into an hour-or-so of reading.&nbsp; He maps a six-thousand-year history of education.&nbsp; I find his account riveting - it&rsquo;s of a struggle.&nbsp; In the blue corner, an insistence on the need for formal and reliable facts.&nbsp; In the red, trust in the case for an open and progressive process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, before the bruising starts, it&rsquo;s a pointless match - have you ever come across an unprocessed fact? or a fact-free process?&nbsp; So we should be able to find a consensus.&nbsp; But it's hard to find.&nbsp; Educators and their stakeholders need to understand why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author helps by taking a close look at pragmatics, constructivism and marketisation.&nbsp; I've tried here to take account of all that.&nbsp; But I can't help noticing that the author leaves out pretty-well all of what neurology, the social sciences and cultural theory bring to an understanding of curriculum.&nbsp; So where are the clues to understanding?&nbsp; Are they in what we can see included? or in what we can't see because something's left out?&nbsp; We'd have to ask who ignores what?&nbsp; And why would they do that?</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve managed to set out here, I find it hard to lose the suspicion that this is not really a debate about ideas, it&rsquo;s about whose interests are being served.&nbsp; A content-driven factual understanding of how things are suits some, and they are glad to see it included.&nbsp; A process-driven curriculum addressed to critically scrutinising how things got this way will upset some apple-carts</p>
<p>Assembling this account of what educators can do has repeatedly come across those conflicting interests.&nbsp; Any claim made, or research reported, or policy announced stands in a frawework of one set of interests or another...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>neo-lib&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; shareholder &lt; &gt;&nbsp; cosmopolitan&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; street-level&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; civil society&nbsp; &lt; &gt; stakeholder</strong></p>
<p>It also finds the interests managed in a range of settings...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>systemic&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; institutional &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; conversational</strong></p>
<p>Some of this is &lsquo;noises-off&rsquo; - hard-to-decipher murmers of what is somewhere being canvassed, or the wangling of manoeuvres, or - eventually - what turns out to have been downright misleading.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found some of what is signposted here in the news, but the news can also be a daily parade of immediate events, short-term consequences and facile solutions.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s too little time, space or attention-span to pose uncomfortable questions - just enough for evasive answers.&nbsp; Claims to transparency are so narrowly framed as to be laughable.&nbsp; Education needs larger frameworks, demanding disclosing answers.&nbsp; Am I paranoic to sense that there's some probing to do here?</p>
<p>And probing done before any compromises are made.&nbsp; A resolution can only be negotiated from what is put on the table.&nbsp; There's no compromise with absolute beliefs.&nbsp; And compromise with partial disclosure is a commitment to little that's worth having.&nbsp; Garry Thomas&rsquo;s story is in part an account of what kind of limp resolutions are left dangling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educators are not responsible for any of this, but neither can they afford to ignore it. This account of what they can do is widely-enough framed to take account of the gamut of interests and the reach of exchanges.&nbsp; So there&rsquo;s a lot here.&nbsp; But the more educators take into consideration, the more bases for action they can search.&nbsp; And this blog has argued that the action can include root-and-branch curriculum reform - with or without the support of the 'noises off'.</p>

<p class="main" align="right"><a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-times-they-are-achangin-lyrics-bob-dylan.html">Bob Dylan</a></p>
<p class="main">This is not about acoustic and electric guitars.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more important even than that.&nbsp; This is about change - from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; And the times they are a-changin&rsquo; alright, but more than Bob knew.&nbsp; More than anybody could know.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">He held out hope for a generation; but no generation gets the last word on anything.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s little consensus on what anybody can do about what's happening.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy enough to trot out vague promises - &lsquo;more choice&rsquo; is popular, &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo; might get applause, and &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; a murmur of approval.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re pretty fluffy concepts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m suggesting that they camouflage more than they illuminate.</p>
<p class="main">I&rsquo;m thinking about the way influence is exerted, how it fragments societies, whether myths can easily posture&nbsp; as reality, why there are so few whistle blowers, and the risk all of this poses for us all.&nbsp; Growing fear needs transposing into sustainable hope.&nbsp; Educators are in no position to fix that; this is about how students will figure it for themselves.&nbsp; But this is pragmatic, it signposts what can help.</p>
<p class="main">It is a companion piece to an earlier blog - &lsquo;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8466">what education gets from politics</a>&rsquo;.&nbsp; If it feels a bit scowling-grumpy, ask yourself whether we've passed the limits of what smiley-nice can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">It's addressed to education&rsquo;s stakeholders.&nbsp; These are the families, educators, voluntary groups and social enterprises concerned for what students can gain from education.&nbsp; It signposts useful ideas, arguments and evidence.&nbsp; Each source is followed by an item for a stakeholder agenda.&nbsp; Education doesn&rsquo;t need shareholders looking for a pay-off, it needs stakeholders probing who is getting what out of education, and whether its stakeholders need to do something about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff here, because there&rsquo;s a lot going on.&nbsp; It may be best to start from the signposts which point to your work now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll update the list as things change - and they will.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll also open up other areas of enquiry.&nbsp; You can track this, and other news, by dropping in on <a title="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/billaw" target="_blank">my Twitter page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub">I don&rsquo;t want to be unfair to Bob Dylan - I don&rsquo;t dare.&nbsp; But the issues are too troublesome for uplifting inspiration.&nbsp; The point is this: stakeholders need students to get more from education than they&rsquo;ve so-far been in a position to realise.&nbsp; Boundaries need to be pushed.</p>

<p class="text">Should the wishes of the rich-and-powerful prevail?&nbsp; Are the people who most need help least likely to get it?&nbsp; Should we be surprised that there is little resistance?&nbsp; Is there damage that is not being openly confronted?&nbsp; And, if any of this is so, how does education resist being bounced into compliance with it?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s evidence on all of this, showing the interplay between politics and commerce - and its consequences for how we live together.&nbsp; Or don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>There is a salutary tale here.&nbsp; It concerns an aspect of education fully enmeshed in these issues.&nbsp; Careers work is about who gets to do what in society.&nbsp; It has a century of research-and-development to draw on.&nbsp; It assiduously canvasses policy support.&nbsp; The commercial world can be counted on to take an interest.&nbsp; It has had some kind of representation in most education settings.&nbsp; Yet it is struggling to secure its own future.&nbsp; What went wrong?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible that it defended a past rather than reaching for a future?&nbsp; That would explain why it ran out of recognisably useful things to say.&nbsp; That retro-thinking was framed by a psychologically-understood individualism, linked to economically-understood opportunity.&nbsp; Such simplicity was, for a time, convenient to both commerce and politics.&nbsp; But it has little place in a privatised, digitised and globalised world.&nbsp; And it has no room for the social-and-cultural complexities of a fragmented, polarised and damaged social world.&nbsp; It has produced not so much inspiration as desperation - and the confusion seems to have taken refuge in what is called &lsquo;career-chaos theory&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But students don&rsquo;t need to be told about chaos.&nbsp; It they are to find meaning and purpose in confusion, it will need more time and space where students can learn about what&rsquo;s going on, and how they can&nbsp; make sense of it.&nbsp; Little of that can be done in hit-and-run careers interviews.&nbsp; This is not to say that face-to-face help is not necessary, but it is to say that it is not sufficient.&nbsp; Careers work has never found the need to draw on the full range of processes available to a well-constructed curriculum.&nbsp; It needs to do that now.&nbsp; The whole of what is set out here need the full scope of a curriculum designed to deliver learning for living,</p>
<p>This website is about innovation.&nbsp; And innovation means the 'creative destruction' of what can no-longer help.&nbsp; Should that be a lesson to us all?</p>

              <title>what education gets from politics</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>What education needs from politics is much less control and a whole lot more imagination.&nbsp; I try here to say something useful about how things got this way.&nbsp;&nbsp; My conclusion is that the way things are demands more than an adjustment here, a fix there and a re-launch sometime.&nbsp; I'm arguing for mind-boggling imagination, in support of learning-for-living usefulness, based on root-and-branch innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>stakeholder voices</strong></p>
<p>The way things are is not a happy story.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s certainly not hard to find reports that politics is remote from experience.&nbsp; People's life-and-work is changed for the worse by politicos claiming to be acting for the better.&nbsp; The people I&rsquo;m thinking of are <em>students</em>, in the <em>communities</em> where they and their families live, with their <em>helpers</em> in schools and colleges and in civil society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All three groups are stakeholders - a term which includes shareholders, but reaches far beyond them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll talk a lot about stakeholder voice - how different people, in different groups, differently voice their interests in education.&nbsp; Each speaks with an indispensable authority of the sense they make of their experience.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s more leadership for education than its designated leaders necessarily know about.&nbsp; There are also more conflicts of interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, the most pressing need has to do with the way in which students now need to navigate a path through accelerating change - a journey too-often signposted for manipulation, deceit and predation.&nbsp; Educators cannot ignore this.&nbsp; But stakeholder responses vary: some see market opportunities, some wonder what markets do for social well-being or personal fulfilment, and some argue for critical thinking to enable students to deal with whatever is thrown at them.&nbsp; I try to show how and why politics shows an active interest in some of this, promises but does not deliver on some, and largely ignores some.&nbsp; Educators are bound to wonder why.</p>
<p class="text">There's plenty here for you to disagree with - and plenty of opportunity for you to say why.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>abstractions and metaphors</strong></p>
<p class="text">But there&rsquo;s no quick-and-easy way to talk about education.&nbsp; Attempts at any length resort to abstract nouns.&nbsp; Various stakeholders variously call on such concepts as...&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="text">&lsquo;achievement&rsquo; - &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; - &lsquo;fairness&rsquo; - &lsquo;fulfilment&rsquo; - &lsquo;progress&rsquo; - &lsquo;self&rsquo; - &lsquo;well-being&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">They&rsquo;re rarely defined in ways that everyone accepts.&nbsp; Some get regularly redefined.&nbsp; And when any of them are loaded into a conversation about accelerating change, a person can get lost.</p>
<p class="text">It gets worse.&nbsp; As politics turns to education for responses to its own problems, the list lengthens, to include for example...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;aspiration&rsquo; - &lsquo;career&rsquo; - &lsquo;choice&rsquo; - &lsquo;citizenship&rsquo; - &lsquo;employability&rsquo; - &lsquo;enterprise&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">They&rsquo;re pretty fuzzy concepts.&nbsp; Some are demonstrably meaningless.&nbsp; But some people&rsquo;s interests find one or more term compelling - even compulsory.</p>
<p class="text">When definitions don&rsquo;t help, metaphors sometimes can.&nbsp; They substitute abstract talk with talk of the tangible.&nbsp; Metaphors conjure images which can be visualised as part of a narrative.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s possible to talk of education...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote">as if it recounted <em>&lsquo;a journey&rsquo; - </em>or<em> - &lsquo;a race&rsquo; ........ </em>or as if featured<em> - &lsquo;a trap&rsquo; - </em>or<em> - &lsquo;a key&rsquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">Such images matter.&nbsp; And narrative seems to be the species&rsquo; default way of making sense of what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; It gives voice to experience...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>what did he say? - why&rsquo;s that so important to her? - </em><br /><em>what can she do about it? - he won&rsquo;t like that!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">Ministerial pronouncements and stakeholder response can be narrated in such terms.&nbsp; But education can&rsquo;t rely wholly on such talk - it can deceive.&nbsp; Thinking about education can use narrative, but it needs hard evidence.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>imagination and reality</strong></p>
<p>I've put in links to imagery that stakeholders might find worth engaging.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the first...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote">Imagine no possessions<br /> I wonder if you can<br /> No need for greed or hunger<br /> A brotherhood of man<br /> Imagine all the people sharing all the world</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text" align="right">John Lennon</p>
<p class="text">John Lennon bequeathed <a title="hope" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnlennon/imagine.html" target="_blank">hope</a>, not least to young people.&nbsp; He sees young people as moving on together, as if on a shared journey.&nbsp; He avowedly does not see them as being taken in one-by-one, as in a trap.&nbsp; He wrote this when an economy, culture and technology made such western-hemisphere hopefulness seem possible.&nbsp; Contemporary experience needs a different narrative - not least for students, with their educators, and in their communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>student voice</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">So what kind of narrative might resonate with students these days?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no hope in a story of entrapment, but it might be worth wondering about the attractions of racing imagery - where people can be winners...&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose students mainly value education to help them be winners?</li>
<li>so that they seek coaching? - to get ahead of the pack? - finding an inside track? - to the finishing line?</li>
<li>might that mean that giving way to others is believed to be weakness?</li>
<li>what about if the belief were that losers have only themselves to blame?</li>
<li>would anybody then expect that excluding others from the game is how the competitive win?</li>
</ul>
<p>Are students finding such talk any more &lsquo;hard to do&rsquo; than John Lennon found in his imagining?&nbsp; Probably not: such competitiveness is not hard to understand in a stagnant economy, where one person's gain will be another's loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a lot of issues embedded here.&nbsp; There is evidence that finishing-line learning gets lost when the race is thought to be won.&nbsp; It's learning for a result, not learning for life.&nbsp; But the beliefs, values and expectations associated with such a story can, nonetheless, embed in the culture of a school, a college or a project...</p>
<ul>
<li>how far would education be valued for the advantages it gives to &lsquo;me&rsquo;, over &lsquo;others&rsquo;?</li>
<li>are relationship increasingly valued for their &lsquo;worth-knowing&rsquo; networking?</li>
<li>and about the excluded, who do they believe they can most count on when it matters? - day-on-day? - in a crisis?</li>
<li>do such outsiders have any value to the advantaged - worth talking to? - caring about? - given as much as a nod?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">This may not be what John Lennon calls &lsquo;brotherhood&rsquo;.&nbsp; And there is some evidence of loss of eye-contact in competitive cultures.</p>
<p class="text">Such issues are not intended for research schedules; they are the makings of fuller conversations.&nbsp; For the helpers these are listening conversations - helpers need to know what sense students are making of their experience of education.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">So what about John Lennon's talk of &lsquo;possessions&rsquo;? - among which socially-isolating on-line devices may be significant...</p>
<ul>
<li>are there possessions that are more valued than, say, on-line devices? - like what?</li>
<li>do we know what such feelings-for-things are about? - fun? - contacts? - status? - what else?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s fun, would that be exciting? - impulsive? - dramatic? - extreme? - dangerous? - what more could it be?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s about contacts? - does that mean with people whom &lsquo;I like&rsquo;? - or are &lsquo;like me&rsquo;? - what&rsquo;s most to like? - what people? - found where? - valued why? - something else?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s about status, would that have anything to do with expensive stuff? - up-to-date? - looking good? - feeling good? - having followers? - what else?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s plenty of room for imagination here, but it&rsquo;s not John Lennon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If educators find any trace of a &lsquo;me-now-and-fun&rsquo; culture, is it showing any traces of what some call &lsquo;immature&rsquo; - and some would call &lsquo;infantilised&rsquo;.&nbsp; There's evidence, and not only among young people. &nbsp; A second bit of imagery:&nbsp; Aldous Huxley attributes such attitudes to most of us, in his ironic <a title="huxley" href="http://classiclit.about.com/od/bravenewworld/fr/aafpr_bravenew.htm" target="_blank">imagining</a> of a <em>Brave New World</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s no limit in such talk to why-is-this-important-to-anybody questioning.&nbsp; Neither is there any limit to what-can-anyone-do-about-it hope.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>educator voice</strong></p>
<p class="text">Inserting words like &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo;, &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; and &lsquo;choice&rsquo; into a message captures comfortable compliance.&nbsp; Other words, like &lsquo;entrap&rsquo;, &lsquo;impulse&rsquo; and &lsquo;infantilise&rsquo; feel more like uncomfortable warnings.&nbsp; But both sets of terms belong to each other, like the conflicted dialogue in a well-told story.&nbsp; Educators do not come empty handed to that conversation.&nbsp; Engaging imagery, tracking sense-making and questioning meaning - that's what educators do.&nbsp; Whatever trap-door may be slammed shut, educators can find a key.</p>
<p class="text">Maybe.&nbsp; But what if education were favourably enough disposed to government to be itself susceptible to capture?</p>
<ul>
<li>is it worth asking how favourably disposed to government educators want to be? - need to be? - are?</li>
<li>what if prevalent social attitudes are more inclined to trust governing voices?</li>
<li>and suppose governmental and commercial priorities were to become interchangeable with each other?</li>
<li>would it then be possible that terms like &lsquo;markets&rsquo;, &lsquo;brands&rsquo;, &lsquo;customers&rsquo;, and &lsquo;choice&rsquo; meld education's aims with political and business-world claims? - okay with that?</li>
<li>if these are trends, then should educators be using on-line sources to track them? - and any place for &lsquo;professional&rsquo; and &lsquo;popular&rsquo; journalism?</li>
<li>and how much of this do government&rsquo;s &lsquo;expert&rsquo; advisers illuminate? - or do its commercially-based lobbyists?</li>
<li>should any of this be a concern of educators? - and would that be only if it concerns education and assessment? - or if it affects student&rsquo;s chances in life? - or because it has broader stakeholder significance? - like what?</li>
<li>but what if such trends are already shaping stakeholders attitudes? - how, then, is any of this making learning-for-living more accessible to some people? - and less to others?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">If any part of this line of conversation seeks to maintain independence then it is more than about skills and theory, it's about ethics.&nbsp; It seems to me to be easier to make ethical claims in mission statements, than to demonstrate ethical commitments in a crisis.&nbsp; There is here the makings a conversation for educators, their mentors, trainers, associations and theorists to get into.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Because the situation is critical, an independent education service faces formidable issues...</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose educators are asked to treat what students bring out of art, work and creativity as no more than saleable commodities?</li>
<li>what if history were to become a feel-good account of a great nation&rsquo;s leaders?</li>
<li>on another tack, would it matter if an uncomprehended &lsquo;nudge&rsquo; supplants any need to understand the whys-and-wherefores for taking action? - or if back-of-the-envelope &lsquo;tips&rsquo; were thought to be enough to guide what people need to do?</li>
<li>and what if, then, any resulting self-confidence and positive thinking become the prime outcomes of education? - and if not that, something more troublesome? - like asking awkward questions - or dissent?</li>
<li>would it matter if any me-and-mine individualism tightened its hold on curriculum? - setting aside the sense people make of their experience in their neighbourhoods? - about their inheritance and upbringing? - among their connections? - and their attachments to others?</li>
<li>would psychology then be strong enough to carry the explanatory freight concerning what people learn? - and what they do with the opportunity to learn? - rather than an understanding social-and-cultural-group influences on their attitudes?</li>
<li>and would any loss of the sense of living-with-others mean that local and systemic influences on learning are down-played? - allowing the need for socially-located help to be curtailed? - and, despite policy-and-commercial claims to &lsquo;openness&rsquo;, not open to scrutiny?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">There is evidence that political pronouncements shape prevalent attitudes.&nbsp; But policy promises of &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; might not be freedom as most people think of it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s freedom for families to manoeuvre into high-rated schools, and for commerce to edge education towards privatisation.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not freedom for families get their kids into a local school which they have come to think of as theirs.&nbsp; Nor for independently-minded teachers to escape derogatory labelling.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s certainly not a freedom that John Lennon imagined &lsquo;would make the world as one&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="text">A third piece of imagery: are there any traces here of George Orwell&rsquo;s <a title="orwell" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087803" target="_blank">nightmare</a>? - take control of the language, substitute belief for reality, re-write the past.&nbsp; Evidence of social control includes reports of clever news management neutralising what policy does not want heard, smothering it with press releases which are cut-and-pasted into news items by compliant journalists.&nbsp; The media gain is to capture attention and extend the reach of advertising.&nbsp; Popular demands for satisfaction make for a headline-driven curriculum requiring educators to come up with solutions to situations where they can have no control.&nbsp; And much of each requirement is written by politicos, their advisers and lobbyists.&nbsp; Some of it is lies.</p>
<p class="text">There are different interests at stake here - different students, different educators, in different communities, differently benefit - and are differently harmed.&nbsp; But independent educators make a different use of the headline-driven curriculum: enabling a critical grasp of what the media claim, engaging students in asking on what evidence?, on behalf of whom?, and why?&nbsp; How many politicos have you noticed asking for such disturbance?</p>
<p class="text"><strong>&nbsp;<br /></strong></p>
<p class="text"><strong>community voice</strong></p>
<p class="text">The politics of promise rests on a belief in the possibility of unlimited growth.&nbsp; The evidence is that the economics of such beliefs is unreliable, especially concerning the risks and costs of collateral damage.&nbsp; And that damage ranges from the personal-and-frightening, to the planetary-and-catastrophic.&nbsp; People need a new narrative, making new sense and based on sane assumptions.</p>
<p class="text">Isn&rsquo;t that what education is for?&nbsp; It would be surprising to find that no teacher wanted to help with any part of the processes suggested here.&nbsp; A tough test is the purest of all disciplines - maths (said to be god's language).&nbsp; The most basic grasp of probability undermines the most plausible of bogus promises.&nbsp; That educator needs only to understand that this is not just about acquiring skills for an examination, it&rsquo;s about transferring learning into life.</p>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s much talk of curriculum reform; a lot of it about the needs of the economy and the usefulness to employers.&nbsp; That story needs retelling...</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose we start from an assertion that a pressing need for education is to enable the navigation of a path through change? - how far would the features of that challenge be to deal with overload? - confusion? - deception? - risk? - and what more?</li>
<li>would that mean enabling people to probe and interrogate every promise, enticement and manoeuvre?</li>
<li>and how far do they need to be able to do that as individuals? - with friends? - in groups? - on-line?</li>
<li>do current conditions need an increased ability to scrutinise, probe and interrogate persuaders? - does the phrase &lsquo;critical thinking&rsquo; convey any of this?</li>
<li>if so, is enough attention given to critical thinking in calls for reform from policy? - commerce? - the media? - religion? - if not, is it up to educators to do more about it? - and students? - and other stakeholders?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">Not all educators will say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to all of this.&nbsp; But this reform doesn&rsquo;t need all educators.&nbsp; The need is for independent educators.&nbsp; Who work with the voice of stakeholders.&nbsp; With their ethics in good order.</p>
<p class="text">The issues raised here are locally experienced, but they are globally generated.&nbsp; The planet is peppered with regimes who find it easier to nudge, entice, cajole and threaten people into compliance than to educate them into autonomy.&nbsp; They breed dependence on dominant and controlling voices.&nbsp; They feed into every conflict, fear and risk that we all face.&nbsp; It justifies violence against outsiders and breeds docility in the group.&nbsp; Educators were never more deeply and urgently implicated.&nbsp; Not least in the UK.</p>
<p>A fourth piece of imagery: John Lennon, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell each rates his mention.&nbsp; But so does Norman <a title="Jewison" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZFaPezzM4k" target="_blank">Jewison</a>, for his movie <em>Rollerball</em> (since disastrously re-made).&nbsp; It tells of a world where global commerce has become the government, shaping what people are to believe, value and expect.&nbsp; The instrument of control is the game - fast, extreme, where winning and losing has life-and-death significance - and, it seems, is impossible to resist.&nbsp; It seems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>why so much detail?</strong></p>
<p class="text">Is there too much to bother about here?&nbsp; Some say so.&nbsp; But the evidence is that the more ideas we take on board the greater our repertoire for action.&nbsp; Complexity is not necessarily the problem, in some form it's necessary to the solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is certainly much more going on in teaching-and-learning than is immediately obvious.&nbsp; Anyone who wants not to be bothered by complexity should stay away from curriculum.</p>
<p class="text">The task of reform is, then, demanding.&nbsp; A sane understand must explain uncomfortable causes-and- effects if we are effectively to deal with crises concerning our economy, technology and security.&nbsp; What we do about education is doubly important: for how educators help students now, and for how students go on learning - life-wide and life-long.</p>
<p class="text">The enemy of all this is not &lsquo;what-if&rsquo; thinking.&nbsp; The biggest danger is &lsquo;if-only&rsquo; thinking.&nbsp; I doubt that there has been a reform movement that has not been colonised by such single-minded claims...</p>

<p class="text">This is not colonising the action with ready-made proposals.&nbsp; But neither is it discarding all the proposals that are within reach.&nbsp; If we can agree about what&rsquo;s going on, in all its complexity, then we can trawl proposals that can be adapted to those needs.&nbsp; And the more we&rsquo;ve got to go on, the better.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">This innovative strategy does not start with provision but with need.&nbsp; The perspectives which inform the process are not from institutions but from more widely-rooted stakeholders.&nbsp; It is, then, a process of letting go and holding on.&nbsp; It discards what is no longer appropriate, useful or tenable.&nbsp; And it turns to what is.&nbsp; This is what needs mind-boggling imagination, enables learning-for-living usefulness, and calls on root-and-branch innovation.</p>

<p>Some people have a taste for dystopian narratives, such as <em>Brave New World</em>, <em>1984</em> and <em>Rollerball</em> - and there are plenty more.&nbsp; The best of these bad-news stories are not mere frighteners, to send us behind some sociological sofa.&nbsp; Their imagery takes us to another place, where we can recognise warnings concerning our own society.&nbsp; A well-written dystopia is for grown-ups - however old or young they may be.&nbsp; Grown-ups are people who can figure out how to make good use of bad news.</p>
<p>This is a website about innovation.&nbsp; And this blog claims that UK education is facing as critical a challenge to innovation as it has ever faced.&nbsp; How do we make good use of that bad news? - contribute to the on-line discussion below, or by e-mailing <a href="mailto:bill@hihohiho.com">Bill</a>...</p>

              <title>Capitalising on learners’ cultural differences</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/89</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<strong>Cultural differences between learners can be an asset, if learning activities give them shared goals and make them aware of commonalities.</strong>
<p>The Learning@Europe project brought together school students from several European countries to learn about European history and culture.
<p>
Each class was paired with a class from another country to form a team, and this was given the goal of winning learning games and exercises against a second team formed of classes from another two countries; so it would be, for example, Italy and Spain against France and Poland.
<p>
Socialising and working collaboratively within their teams built trust amongst students and made them aware of commonalities; in the online learning environment, their nationality was not immediately apparent.

              <title>Team games: motivation through competition</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/87</link>

              <description><![CDATA[Competitive games can motivate participation, but have their dangers: learners may start to play aggressively, and winning strategies may diverge from the intended learning.

To get the benefits of competition without the drawbacks, the Learning@Europe project set up competition between collaborating groups: schools from two countries were paired against schools from two other countries. 

The competition was real, in that the games had clear winners and losers, but teams could not hinder each other; eg in a treasure hunt in 3D virtual maze, players could see their opponents and check their progress but not prevent them from collecting objects.

The game tasks were designed to be closely tied to learning (eg collect from the maze four objects based clues relating to taught content) and to require collaboration (eg sharing knowledge and discussing moves – since each school could have only two players in the maze.)

See pp 13-14, ‘Competition among collaborative groups’; pp. 11-12, ‘Fostering collaboration’. [Franca Garzotto, Caterina Poggi]
