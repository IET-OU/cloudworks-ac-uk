              <title>MON: &#39;Making the Most of MOOCs&#39; - Digital Learning with the University of the Third Age (Wendy Maples)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9527</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9527</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>The multi-media conference presentation will be a demonstration of my &lsquo;Making the Most of MOOCs: Digital Learning with the University of the Third Age&rsquo; work-in-progress, presenting the rationale for and development of an appropriate-technology web-based platform to facilitate informal online learning, and the digital learning resources that will make up its content.</h2>
<p>The &lsquo;Making the Most of MOOCs&rsquo; project involves research into digital learning inclusivity and, more specifically, consultation with Southeast University of the Third Age (U3A) representatives in order to identify an appropriate web-based learning platform and to source/develop learning resources to support digital literacy for informal educational purposes. The project emerged from my general interest in digital literacy for informal education and from a happenstance conversation with a former academic colleague, now a passionate member of the Southeast U3A Network, who was investigating better means of supporting online learning amongst U3A members (Pitt, G. 2015a).</p>
<p>The U3A was established to support and encourage lifelong learning amongst its members. This endeavour has meant almost exclusively self-generated learning activity presented and discussed at face-to-face meetings. However, informal interviews with U3A representatives (Staniforth and Pitt 2015, Pitt 2015b) and a report by the U3A Trust&rsquo;s Standing Committee on Education (2015) indicate that some U3A members wish to make better use of educational content that is increasingly available through &lsquo;MOOCs&rsquo; (Massive, Open, Online Courses) or other online educational resources (OERs). In accord with the U3A&rsquo;s understanding that learning is a social activity, some U3A members would also like to explore the wider potential social and inclusivity benefits of online networks. Early discussions with Southeast U3A Network representatives suggest that &ndash; in broad contrast to data on the relevant age demographic identified by the Office for National Statistics (2015) &ndash; the large majority of members have access to the Internet, with their main purpose to its use being communications with friends and family through Skype and email. Some U3A members routinely use the Internet for educational purposes, and there are some U3A groups who, over the past year, have utilised MOOCs to inform group discussions (U3A Standing Committee on Education, 2015).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there is extensive member expertise on a huge range of topics, there is currently limited member knowledge, expertise and confidence about distance and online learning. The U3A Southeast Network representatives group has therefore asked me to scope an appropriate web-based platform and digital learning materials to support: 1) Better use of MOOCs and other OERs; 2) Greater social learning opportunities for U3A members unable to attend face-to-face U3A meetings; 3) Greater interactivity between &lsquo;virtual U3A&rsquo; members and face-to-face members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &lsquo;Making the Most of MOOCs&rsquo; multi-media presentation will address pilot project work-in-progress, covering: 1) Background data and scholarly research informing inclusivity issues for the U3A age demographic; 2) The U3A&rsquo;s OER needs and interests, based on consultation with Southeast U3A Network representatives; 3) Initial investigations into appropriate web-platform technologies that best facilitate online learning practice; 4) Initial investigations and/or development of digital learning resources to be &lsquo;housed&rsquo; on the platform.</p>

              <title>Deborah Judah&#39;s Design Narrative: e Assessment Conference Online</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8305</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p><em>I organised an e assessment conference online using Elluminate which was aimed at staff in the post-16 education sector</em></p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>As an eLearning advisor working for the Jisc Regional Support Centre I was the lead organisor of the first online conference we have organised. The conference took place over 3 days in the first week of December and we used Elluminate as the medium. I worked with 2 other people in my organisation and we had presenters from the UK and Australia. The idea was to provide a conference where people could explore aspects of e assessment and and by using an online forum it was possible to open it up to people throughout the UK. We provided a mix of presentations from academics, Jisc Services and vendors.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>We wanted to provide up to date information about eAssessment and enable debate between the presenters and delegates. Another action was to give the delegates the opportunity to participate in a conference online.</em></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Planned the conference using mindmap tools</em></li>
<li><em>Outlined outcomes for delegates and outcomes for the Jisc RSC</em></li>
<li><em>Booked the Ellluminate sessions</em></li>
<li><em>Delegated tasks to the members of the organisation who would be involved in the conference</em></li>
<li><em>Approached and booked the presenters - we planned a presentation from an academic, a Jisc service and a vendor each day. In addition there was a keynote on the first day and end of last day.</em></li>
<li><em>The plan was the people could sign up for the whole conference or parts of it</em></li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><em>We had over 60 delegates participate in the conference; many of whom attended more than one workshop. As expected our organisation developed a good expertise in using Ellluninate to provide a conference. It was unexpected that most of the &nbsp;delegates were not from the Yorkshire and Humber area (which is the region our organisaiotn supports) however we got a good mis from all the sectors or post-16 education. We felt that we met the objectives and this was evidenced byt the feedback we received from the post conference survey.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>The reflection on the experience was that personally it was a success and I felt I had achieved something I had set out to do and seen it from conception to delivery. As an organisation we learned that there were a few issues to iron out when having an online conference. We had offered presenters a practice session but not all of these took it up. &nbsp;In a future conference we will make this compulsary so that some of the issues that arose could be avoided.</em></p>]]></description>

<p>Chairs: Maarten de Laat, Caroline Haythornthwaite, Shane Dawson &amp; Dan Suthers</p>
<p>Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS) 47,</p>
<p>January 6-9, 2014, Waikoloa, Big Island, HI</p>
<p><strong>PAPERS DUE: June 15, 2013</strong> via the HICSS conference system</p>

<p><strong>Social Media &amp; Learning</strong></p>
<p>This minitrack calls for papers that address leading edge use of technology, research methods and system design to analyze and support learning in social networks. The ability to generate and maintain rich networked connections through social media, social networking, crowdsourcing, cloud technology, and social computing has a profound impact on the way we solve problems, learn, innovate and develop our identities, and the value this creates for individuals and groups. This minitrack will bring together state of the art research that furthers social theories of networking and learning, such as networked learning, collaborative learning, viral learning, and social capital, in combination with for example social and learning analytics and social network analysis to help visualize, develop and facilitate formal, non-formal and informal networking and learning settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We call for papers that use, analyze and/or develop technology and online tools to examine social networking and learning phenomena through social media. We specifically welcome papers that address new and exciting areas of research in the networking and learning potential of social media or the potential value social media creates for connectivity, development, and growth. Some of this work might be driven by social media and networking research in relation to education, organizations, gaming, simulation and 3d worlds. We encourage papers that address learning and value creation through social media in any setting: education, work, daily life, home, and &lsquo;serious leisure&rsquo;. Appropriate social media and learning behavior ranges from same-time, same-place to anytime, anywhere that increases interactions among participants via social media in formal and informal learning settings and mixtures thereof, and may include collectives from learning crowds to communities, teams and networks of practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We envision that papers will:</p>
<ul>
<li>examine the foundations for social media and learning in online networks, crowds and communities;</li>
<li>analyze and/or support the role of social media and networks in learning;</li>
<li>address value creation in social media and online communities and networks;</li>
<li>develop methods for analyzing social media and learning;</li>
<li>implement social network analysis to reflect social media, networking and learning processes;</li>
<li>address awareness and visualization of social networks and communities;</li>
<li>develop metrics for characterizing and following social networking and learning trends;</li>
<li>implement and develop tools for automated data capture and data analytics on social networking and learning;</li>
<li>discuss empirical trends in social networking and learning on and through the Internet, including issues and opportunities relating to information literacy, literacy and new media, ubiquitous learning, viral learning and entrepreneurial learning;</li>
<li>examine economic models, trends and markets for social media and learning, including open source and open access and viral models;</li>
<li>examine the design and facilitation of social media and learning in online networks, crowds and communities;</li>
<li>show development and use of new social media tools, devices (laptops, mobiles, OLPC ), and spaces and their networking and value creation potential; or</li>
<li>discuss ethical issues relating to learning online, including issues relating to data capture, analysis and display, and learning about controversial subjects or anti-social activities.</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><em>&ldquo;With the lights out, it&rsquo;s less dangerous&rdquo;: tapping into teen  spirit to inform technology design for personal energy consumption  understanding.</em></p>
<p align="left">In this presentation I&rsquo;ll report on a series of research studies conducted with teenagers to develop design ideas for ways in which learning technologies might support young people who want to learn and understand more about their personal consumption of energy.&nbsp; Energy sustainability is prevalent in political and popular rhetoric and yet energy consumption is rising.&nbsp; Teenagers are an important category of future energy consumers, but little is known of their conceptions about energy and energy saving.</p>
<p align="left">Findings from our early studies suggest that teenagers are aware of energy issues at an abstract level, but do not apply this information in the context of their behaviour.&nbsp; We identify indirect energy use and the relative energy intensity of different behaviours as important areas for learning.&nbsp; For example, behaviours of particular relevance to teenagers are use of electronic devices, and choice of food and personal care products.&nbsp; These findings have implications for the design of technology to support learning about energy in informal contexts and have informed the development of an Ecology of Resources model (Luckin, 2010) of the teenage participants&rsquo; personal contexts, which includes their world resources (people, tools, knowledge, skills, and environment) and their personal resources (conceptions, motivations and concerns around energy consumption).&nbsp; This model is now being used to support the on-going participatory technology design process with groups of teenagers drawn from UK secondary schools.</p>
<p align="left">I&rsquo;ll talk about the range of methods we employed to understand teenagers&rsquo; personal learning contexts and the manner in which our findings are now being used to develop a mobile phone application with a small group of teenagers in two secondary schools in the South of England.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.gold.ac.uk/gleu/futuretense/ft-banner-220px.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /> Goldsmiths Learning Enhancement Unit is hosting an international  conference to profile individuals or groups of staff and projects, that  have shaped, challenged or shifted learning and teaching in their higher   education contexts.  There will be space and opportunity for engaging  with potential futures of technology-enhanced learning as well as  interrogating what familiar concepts such as &lsquo;interdisciplinarity&rsquo; and  &lsquo;research-based teaching&rsquo;  really mean in practice.</p>
<p>In an exciting collaboration, Martin Conreen, who lectures in  Goldsmiths' Design Department, and Mark Miodownik, Professor of  Materials and Society at University College and Royal Institute  Christmas Lecturer, will be giving the keynote.</p>
<p>Other key speakers include education campaigner and journalist  Melissa Benn, Glasgow School of Arts education leader Professor Linda  Drew, Goldsmiths cultural scholar Professor John Hutnyk, audio learning  innovator Andrew Middleton and Kings College neuroscientist and Wellcome  Collection adviser Richard Wingate.</p>
<p>The event is free - <a href="http://futuretense.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">but you must register</a> -&nbsp; and <a href="http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/travel-fund" target="_blank">you may be able to get funding to attend</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A note from me on Cloudworks...</strong></p>
<p>I first encountered Cloudworks while studying on H800 last year, so this seemed like a good place to create a space around the event.&nbsp; I think I might be a little rusty, so any feedback on my attempt is most welcome!</p>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5937</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5937</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></h3>
<p>By the end of this session, delegates will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Understand      the aims of the OULDI project, CloudEngine and Cloudworks,</li>
<li>Understand      what functionality CloudEngine offers,</li>
<li>Understand      how CloudEngine may benefit you and your organization,</li>
<li>Understand      how to login to a CloudEngine site, create a cloud and find resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Session Outline</strong></h3>
<p>Social and participatory technologies - with their emphasis on sharing and user production - seem to offer great potential for educators in supporting their professional development and in sharing best practice; however a recent review of the use of these technologies in an educational context leads to a bleak conclusion:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;..even though &lsquo;Web 2.0&rsquo; tools seem to have the right mix of affordances to facilitate sharing and discussion of educational ideas, this is not happening spontaneously across the broad educational community, nor is it happening at scale where the real macro benefits of the collective intelligence affordances (L</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>vy, 1997) and sheer scale of the web comes into effect&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Conole (2010)</p>
<p>This paper focuses on an output of the JISC-funded Open University Learning Design Initiative (<a href="http://ouldi.open.ac.uk/">http://ouldi.open.ac.uk</a>) which aims to address this mismatch: &lsquo;<strong>CloudEngine</strong>&rsquo; (<a href="http://getcloudengine.org/">http://getcloudengine.org</a>), social web software, centred on social objects &ndash; Clouds and Cloudscapes.</p>
<p>The CloudEngine code has been developed using design-based research (DBR), adopting an iterative cycle of rapid prototyping, user testing and adaptation. Development of the prototype site &lsquo;<strong>Cloudworks</strong>&rsquo; began in 2007. Cloudworks is a specialised social networking site for sharing, debating and co-creating ideas, designs and resources for teaching, learning and scholarship in education. Cloudworks has ca.4000 registered users and visitors from 165 countries (Feb 2011). The site is hosted by the Open University but open to all. The CloudEngine code was released under an open-source license in October 2010 and can be used by any community interested in sharing ideas.</p>
<p>This paper will review our most recent evaluation work on the impact of Cloudworks in supporting open &lsquo;communities of enquiry&rsquo;, collaborative knowledge building, and shared assets (e.g. interests, goals, ideas, see Alexander, 2008; Anderson, 2007; Downes, 2005). It will suggest wider applications of the CloudEngine code. There will be a structured opportunity to explore Cloudworks and CloudEngine.</p>
<h3><strong>Activities &amp; approximate timings</strong></h3>
<p>Please provide an indication of how the session will be structured and how activities and discussion will be facilitated. For discussion papers please include a few indicative questions which will focus the discussion element.</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation &ndash; 15 minutes,</li>
<li>Mini-workshop &ndash; 20 minutes,</li>
<li>Questions and discussion &ndash; 10 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><em>Mini-workshop</em></strong></h4>
<p>Pre-requisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>A laptop (or tablet &ndash; basic usage of      Cloudworks/CloudEngine is possible with an iPad),</li>
<li>It is desirable, but not essential to create      an account on Cloudworks (<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk">http://cloudworks.ac.uk</a>)      before the event.</li>
<li><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5945">Cloudquest activity</a></li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The effective use of social and participative media is seen as a key  requirement in 21st Century academic practice and professional  development. This case study describes a collaborative, student-led  initiative which, identifying a gap in existing Doctoral training  provision, engaged in delivering a series of interactive sessions to PhD  students and Early Career Researchers at the University of Nottingham.  With an emphasis less on the technologies and more on their social,  participatory and collaborative affordances, the sessions were designed  and presented by two PhD students to raise awareness of social media and  provide an opportunity for discussion and shared practice. Hosted and  supported by one of the University Graduate Centres, the sessions were  supplemented by an online resource. In this presentation, we will  summarise the initiative with key observations, perspectives and  feedback from the organisers and attendees, discuss implications for  practice within training and professional development contexts, and  outline future plans in this area.</p>

              <title>Symposium: Design Perspectives for Learning with Social Media: Reconciling  Informal and Formal Learning through Web 2.0? </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4091</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<h4><strong>Andrew Ravenscroft, &nbsp;Steven Warburton, &nbsp;Stylianos Hatzipanagos,</strong><strong>and Gr&aacute;inne Conole&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<p>Although the widespread use of social media reflects how Web 2.0 technologies have become embedded in our lives, there are still significant challenges in harnessing these and their related practices for learning. One expectation is that they will provide the means to reconcile informal and formal learning to allow for a more seamless transition between meaningful activity inside and outside of educational institutions or the workplace. But how do we support such processes or progressions? The approach adopted in this symposium is to see <em>design</em>, or <em>learning design</em>, as the key paradigm to address this challenge. But designing for this constantly evolving technological landscape creates new problems and complexities. This symposium will present different approaches to design from experts who specialise in the field of social software for learning, and who are concerned with both bridging informal and formal learning and questioning what we consider to be legitimate learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Will design really make a difference to practice?   
<ul>
<li>Role of theory?   
<ul>
<li>Tensions with practice?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are your own experiences of using social media for learning-teaching?</li>
<li>What social media tools do you use in your practice?</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>New technologies have immense potential for learning, but the sheer variety possible also creates challenges for learners in terms of navigating through an increasingly complex digital landscape and for teachers in terms of how to design and support learning interventions. How can learners and teachers make informed decisions about what technologies to use in the design and support of learning activities? This presentation will consider this question and present a new methodology for design &ndash; &lsquo;learning design&rsquo;, which aims to shift the creation and support of learning from what has traditionally been an implicit, belief-based practice to one that is explicit and design based. Learning design research at the Open University, UK has included the development of a set of conceptual design views, a tool for visualising designs (CompendiumLD) and a social networking site, for sharing and discussing learning and teaching ideas and designs (Cloudworks). An overview of this work will be provided, along with a discussion of the perceived benefits of this new approach to educational design.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3993</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3993</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This cloud presents a short video presentation created for the <a href="/cloudscape/view/2012" target="_blank">OU 2010 Conference <em>Learning in an open world</em></a>. It describes work being carried out as part of the development of the new IT and Computing course TU100 <em>My Digital Life</em> (out in October 2011).</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>TU100 incorporates the use of multimedia, open content and Web  2.0 tools in teaching and assessment. The materials presented here relate to Part 1 of Block 4, which introduces multimedia in a&nbsp; creative and practical way. Students will be asked to create their own short presentations to share and discuss with others, and the various activities around their presentations will contribute directly to assessment of their work in the block.</p>
<p><strong>The course materials</strong></p>
<p>Part 1 (B4) is  structured around the tasks involved in creating a video from stills  with a soundtrack using <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" target="_blank">Picasa</a> and <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>. I used these same tools to prepare the conference contribution.</p>
<p>The video-making is developed as the preparation of a response to Michael Wesch's <em>The  Machine is  Us/ing Us</em> (embedded below). The text explores some aspects of my reading of Wesch's video, in particular, around the idea of 'futures', picking up on a fundamental point: that  we've all got a <em> role</em> to play in creating the future rather than only  prophesying  about  it ('futurology').</p>
<p>In this way, while introducing some basic image and sound  manipulation processes, we're also exploring broader issues related to  borrowing, remixing and sharing materials on the Web, with a view to get  students thinking about what is at stake (in terms of, for example, copyrights) and where this may all be heading.</p>
<p>The video prepared as part of the course materials includes a soundtrack put together from piano samples taken from the<a href="http://www.freesound.org/" target="_blank"> FreeSound  Project</a> and some recordings of my daughter's voice, as well as images chosen  from the  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/" target="_blank">Creative Commons pool in Flickr</a>. The conference contribution uses a soundtrack (already a remix) from <a href="http://ccmixter.org/" target="_blank">ccMixter</a>. Students in the course will be given a Media Database compiled from various open content sources.</p>
<p>At this point, a Take 1 of the course video is available that needs a bit of work to incorporate useful feedback from others (and some improvements to the audio track). However, one  of the points of the Part is to illustrate that it's possible to do   interesting work without masses of expertise of expensive equipment. Perfection in a 'professional' sense isn't what we're after: we're after getting people thinking and engaged in a creative way.</p>]]></description>

<p>"PIVOT is the Professional Identity and Values Organisation Tools and offers videos and downloadable exercises for users to have a go at a set of techniques for self-directed enquiry and self-managed learning.</p>
<p>A lot of work went into their creation and this conference seems like a good opportunity to make them more widely available.</p>
<p>Here is a link to&nbsp;the PIVOT pages: <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/pbpl/projects/pivot" target="_blank">www.open.ac.uk/pbpl/projects/pivot</a>"</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Youtube introduction to the PIVOT pages - well, after a few rehersals and playing around with webcams and video capture software I've done it and uploaded it. But there's a problem with the sound being out of synch which rather spoils the effect! Aanybody had this problem and know how to cure it?"</p>]]></description>

My hope was that this video would personalise the experience a bit more for the students, as well as reinforcing some key information at the start of the course. I included the link in my introductory email to them."</p>]]></description>

<p>"Instead I have made my contribution a powerpoint presentation with video clips and sound which plays automatically, and I have uploaded it to slideshare. However, when I try to view it there, none of the video clips or the sound plays."</p>
<p>"My version of Powerpoint is 2003, as installed on my OU laptop.&nbsp; The camera, microphone with which the clips were recorded were all done with borrowed equipment on someone else's computer in the Regional Centre" (logitech quick cam software set up on Windows XP&nbsp;desktop PC with headphones and mouthpiece).</p>

              <title>From Open Content to Open Thinking</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3947</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3947</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>We propose that one of the barriers to adoption of Open Educational Resources (OERs) in common teaching practices is the lack of transparency of practitioners&rsquo; &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; around the production and consumption of those resources.</p>
<p>Thefore we propose to move from a paradigm of <em>opening up contents</em> and OER to a paradigm of <em>opening up people&rsquo;s thinking about OERs</em>.</p>
<p>Our objective is to make this thinking visible and exportable in a way that support the emergence of collective intelligence around OER. To cater for this we designed <a href="http://cohere.open.ac.uk/">Cohere</a>, a first prototype socio-technical infrastructure to gather Collective Intelligence around OER.</p>
<p>You can explore more these concepts by looking at the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AnnaDeLiddo/edmedia2010-de-liddo">PPT presentation</a> embedded here below. This is a presentation  for Ed-Media 2010 Conference, http://www.aace.org/conf/edmedia/, to be  held in Toronto, Canada, June 29 &ndash;July 2, 2010.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about <a href="http://cohere.open.ac.uk/">Cohere</a> you can also watch the movie, embedded here below, from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKykgBo-zGI&feature=player_embedded">submission to the Mozzilla Firefox Competition 2009: Jetpack for Learning</a>. In this movie we explain how Cohere can be used to enhance Web-Annotation to more effective learning.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><a title="elluminate by edtechie99, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36439943@N06/4687270003/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4687270003_b821b79d04_m.jpg" alt="elluminate" width="179" height="91" /></a></p>
<p>The the OU 'Learning in an Open World' conference (22-23 June 2010) is being sponsored by Elluminate who are providing the synchronous conference space. This cloud has links to the sessions <strong>and help for known connection problems (see extra content)</strong>. Please add comments about any problems connecting to this cloud so we know for future use.&nbsp; For full details of the conference see: <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2012">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2012</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Logging in:</strong></p>
<p>Each of the four sessions takes place in a different Elluminate space, ie it has a different URL. This means you have to log into each one separately. You can only log in near the session start time, not days before. There is a limit of 400 users in each session. We can't prebook people I'm afraid, so it is a case of first come, first served.</p>
<p>The links for each session are:</p>
<p>Session 1 (22nd June, morning) playback: <a href="https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-06-22.0052.M.2B75F29C80EFE7AAEF7138B1D7E4AF.vcr&sid=cpp1">https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-06-22.0052.M.2B75F29C80EFE7AAEF7138B1D7E4AF.vcr&amp;sid=cpp1</a></p>
<p>Session 2 (22nd June, afternoon) playback: <a href="https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-06-22.0516.M.D86AEB8E871EAD6819856184070D75.vcr&sid=cpp1">https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-06-22.0516.M.D86AEB8E871EAD6819856184070D75.vcr&amp;sid=cpp1</a></p>
<p>Session 3 (23rd June, morning): (waiting for playback link)</p>
<p>Session 4 (23rd June, afternoon):&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #005488; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" href="https://sas.elluminate.com/m.jnlp?password=M.9DDE389EFCE7B76F7880AE9C0939F4" target="_blank">https://sas.elluminate.com/m.jnlp?password=M.9DDE389EFCE7B76F7880AE9C0939F4</a></p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<p>Elluminate is easy to use, when you log in it launches another window, which contains the main presentation space, a text chat window and a list of who is online. You should test your setup beforehand (you may need to install Java), just so you know it works ok on your machine by visiting:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elluminate.com/Support/?id=62">http://www.elluminate.com/Support/</a>.&nbsp; if you do have problems, please see fixes in extra content section below before contacting the helpdesk for support.</p>
<p>You should ensure that you can access the setup room and that your audio is working. If you have problems, please look at the Elluminate knowledge base: <a href="http://support.elluminate.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=2653">http://support.elluminate.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=2653</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sessions</strong></p>
<p>During the sessions there will be a number of moderators who will focus discussions and deal with problems. However, please try to sort out any technical issues prior to the conference, so the chat sessions are not filled with this. Due to the large number of users, not everyone will have access to the microphone, instead during the discussion sessions moderators can allocate it to someone if they 'raise their hand' (by clicking next to their name). The text chat window will form the main channel for discussion during presentations.</p>
<p>There is a discussion slot during each session. For these we have set up a number of 'rooms' in Elluminate. You can move between rooms easily, by dragging your name onto that room. Once you are in a room, you won't hear what happens in the other rooms, so we can have multiple parallel discussions.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>C-SAP e-Learning Forum: sharing materials and practice in the social sciences</strong><br /><br /><strong>Organised by:</strong> C-SAP<br /><strong>Venue:</strong> Kensington Close Hotel, London<br /><strong>Date of event:</strong> 8 July 2010<br /><br /><strong>Event Description</strong><br />This event will provide a forum for presenting some of our recent project work around the sharing of electronic educational resources, and explore the processes, methods and practices of sharing and using e-learning materials and tools which engage our colleagues in the social sciences. The scope of the day will include presentations from the C-SAP Open Educational Resources project, findings from current C-SAP mini-project focused around e-learning, and a &lsquo;show and share&rsquo; session in the afternoon offering an opportunity to disseminate examples of practice from across our disciplinary networks.<br /><br /><strong>Morning Session</strong><br />Opening Keynote Neil Selwyn, London Knowledge Lab.<br />Neil Selwyn is sociologist working at the London Knowledge Lab. His research and teaching focuses on the place of digital media in everyday life, and the sociology of technology (non)use in educational settings.<br /><strong><br />Dissemination from the Open Educational Resources Project</strong><br />This will provide an opportunity to showcase, discuss, and reflect upon the work of the C-SAP &ldquo;Open Educational Resources&rdquo; project. Our project, &ldquo;Evaluating the Practice of Opening up Resources for Learning and Teaching in the Social Sciences&rdquo;, was part of a pilot programme (funded by the HEA and JISC), which sought to explore issues around the sharing of educational material from a disciplinary perspective. Whilst exploring, with our academic project partners, the principles and issues around releasing educational material (institutional, contractual, administrative), we have also sought to develop some insights into the processes of sharing practice, and look forward to discussing the findings in this forum.<br /><br /><strong>Afternoon Session</strong><br /><br /><strong>Call for Papers: Invited show and share presentations</strong><br />Alongside dissemination from recent C-SAP mini-project award holders, we offer an open invitation to submit abstracts for a &lsquo;show and share&rsquo; session around the use of e-learning within the social sciences. Some themes to consider might be:<br /><br />- Tools and techniques;<br />- e-Feedback and e-assessment;<br />- Collaborative development (working with peers to create materials);<br />- Disciplinary and curriculum practices;<br />- Staff development and organisational contexts;<br />- Student perspectives and expectations.<br /><br />If you would like to offer a show and share presentation, please complete the abstracts template and email the document to Darren Marsh, C-SAP Web and e-Learning co-ordinator (darren.marsh@c-sap.bham.ac.uk) <strong>by 14 June 2010</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Booking</strong><br />The event is free to attend, please use the online registration form to register: booking link: <a href="https://www.bhamonlineshop.co.uk/events/eventdetails.asp?eventid=162">https://www.bhamonlineshop.co.uk/events/eventdetails.asp?eventid=162</a>.<br /><br />If you require any other information please contact Frances Worrall by email f.l.worrall@bham.ac.uk or telephone: 0121 414 2995</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The Virtual MPhil in Computing is an innovative research programme delivered entirely at a distance, supported by a blend of synchronous and asynchronous Internet technologies. These technologies support the core processes of the programme, the organisation of students around research themes, and fostering peer group collaboration to complement the traditional supervisor-student relationship. A Second Life (SL) environment, called deep|think, was designed to support Virtual MPhil students.</p>

              <title>Your Contributions for OU &#39;Learning in an Open World&#39; conference - How to contribute</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2978</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2978</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>A new cloudscape has been created to make commenting on individual contributions easier.&nbsp; Please see </strong><a href="/cloudscape/view/2128"><strong>http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2128</strong></a><strong>&nbsp; for a a full list of contributions and links to clouds for each one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>See below for the original call</strong></p>
<p>Want to contribute something about your project, work or research to the OU conference taking place online on 22 to 23 June 2010? We'd love to have it! Unlike previous conferences where papers are selected, we want non-paper based contributions and we accept anything (as long as it's relevant and not rude).</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>First create a digital artefact for us and upload it somewhere - some examples formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://slideshare.net">Slideshare</a> presentation</li>
<li><a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> video</li>
<li><a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> photos</li>
<li>Another Cloud in Cloudworks</li>
</ul>
<p>But you may choose another format (eg an <a href="http://xtranormal.com">Xtranormal</a> movie).</p>
<p>Then post your link below in the comments. If it is an embeddable format (eg YouTube), then I will add it in to this cloud, so all the content is visible here, and if not I'll add it as a link.</p>
<p>In the conference programme we have four discussion sessions where hopefully we can draw on these inputs. To have your contribution considered for inclusion in the main programme the <strong>deadline is 16 June</strong>.</p>
<p>We'd love to hear about your project and for you to help us explore the concept, perspectives and issues around openness in education.</p>
<p>You need to be registered in Cloudworks to submit content.&nbsp; The details of the overall conference are in the cloudscape: <a href="/cloud/view/2994">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2012</a>&nbsp;and the programme is in the cloud: <a href="/cloud/view/2994">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2994</a>.</p>]]></description>

<li>Please turn on your mobiles and anything else&hellip;</li>
<li>Books important &ndash; its about giving learners choice</li>
<li>James plans to talk about mbile learning</li>
<li>Is mobile learning about using mobile device, is it learning on the move, or mobility of the learenr</li>
<li>why do we have mobile devices and why more than one?</li>
<li>Iphone only 2 years old from a phone to something that you can communicate and collaborate in a wealth of ways, changed the way we do it</li>
<li>PSP allows you to watch video, listen to audio, watch images, wifi, got a browser, can be a content creator</li>
<li>Often with technologies can have unintended consequences</li>
<li>Learners can appropriate their devices for their needs</li>
<li>Why arent universities braintraining?</li>
<li>You dont get web 2.0 stuff unless you do it</li>
<li>Starting to see with young kids that they are appropriating technologies with ease</li>
<li>Web technologies makes it easier to engae learners in a variety of ways</li>
<li>Service such as Qik turns your mobile device into a TV device</li>
<li>Not about banning the technologies its about educating the users</li>
<li>Twitter is transformative, twitter is about the coffee... coffee conversations</li>
<li>With new technologies comes new responsibilities </li>
<li>We can learn so much more by working across sector boundaries</li>
<li>Learners can access their infomration where and when they want to, they can choose where and when they want to learn</li>
<li>Blurrs the boundaries between formal and informal learning</li>
<li>Concept of visitors and residents in the digital landscape</li>
<li>Benefits of time, personalisaton, reflection</li>
<li>We need to develop new ways of working</li>

<li>Technological barriers</li>
<li>Costs (of devices and connectivity)</li>
<li>Theft as an issue</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Choice - we all have different personal preferences. It's the context that's importnat. Raido, TV, theatre, internet etc all site side by side....</li>
<li>The world is changing but are our institutions changing?</li>
<li>We start college in September because our students need to get the harverst in ;-)</li>
<li>We need to adopt a more holistic approach, we need to be responsive to the needs of learners, think about the activities students do and we need to think about flexibility, we need to start charing and collaboratiing.</li>
<li>Stop thinking about barriers and think about solutions, need to change our culture</li>
<li>The future of learning needs to be in the hands of learners</li>

              <title>Presentation: Goodyear, Kali &amp; Tickner Complex spaces for learning: theory and practice in design, co-design and re-design</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2762</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2762</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Complex spaces for learning: theory and practice in design, co-design and re-design</strong></p>
<p><em>Peter Goodyear, Yael Kali and Sue Tickner</em></p>
<p>Plan is to produce a report out of the event, want people to feel free to be frank.</p>
<p><em>Peter Goodyear</em></p>
<p>A central challenge that emerges from the changing landscape is about working out how we can make pedagogical sense of these changes. Can we view design as a means of managing this change, what would this look like? Spaces for learning &ndash; physical, virtual are becoming more complex. Couple that with a notion that students will and should be more actively involved in reconfiguring their own learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience of co-design with students and also re-design</li>
<li>Design as imaging other people&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>Activity distributed in complex ways across time, space, tools and people</li>
<li>Students and teacher co-configuring activity relationships and learnplaces</li>
<li>Extended concept of self-regulation: activity relationships and tools/resources</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lassez-faire&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;Instructional design</p>
<p>[loose vs. tight structures]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not just about managing activities but the social interactions., also how to make good choices about tools and resources.</p>
<p>Is design too complicated &ndash; should we just let students get on with it??? Some argue from the position of students as experts anyway, aligning with Prensky&rsquo;s notions, whereas now most don&rsquo;t subscribe to that position. In reality students&rsquo; digital habits are very varied, they may not know how to use these technologies for learning</p>
<p>Alternative approach to help students find their way through this space, need classic application of instructional design and more rigour, discipline, etc.</p>
<p>In reality it&rsquo;s probably somewhere in between.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Teaching as design</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diversifying student needs and expectations</li>
<li>Rising expectations abut graduate capabilities</li>
<li>Intensification of pressures on teaching staff</li>
<li>Accelerating technological change</li>
</ul>
<p>Increasing stress on traditional teaching processes</p>
<p>Accumulating research evidence about learning and teaching</p>
<p>Activity-centred design &ndash; design cannot be content focussed, must be on what the student does. It&rsquo;s the alignment between the desired learning outcomes and the activities we want the students to engage with. A key element of the design challenge is designing the student tasks. Of course students will interpret what we ask them to do (for good or bad). There is a gap between the tasks we set and the activities the students do.</p>
<p>We must remember that learning is physically situated &ndash; there are multiple learnplaces and this is fundamentally important and shapes the quality of the activities the students do.</p>
<p>Also learning is socially situated, groups, teams and communities + virtual teams, groups, and communities</p>
<p>Accelerating interpenetration of the digital and material worlds</p>
<p>Ubiquitous computing/ambient intelligence</p>
<p>Rise and rise of personal technologies</p>
<p><strong>Three inter-related components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Outcomes</li>
<li>Activity &ndash; place is a part of this, as is community. We must remember we don&rsquo;t control these spaces </li>
<li>Task</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need to think about scale &ndash; macro, meso and micro. For each we can think about tasks, tools and people. A lot of what we do as teachers is at the meso level. Design of a single task, mapped to a single coherent activity. Timeframe days or weeks. The set of tools, spaces and other resource needed for the learners works on a specific activity. Usually the concern of a teacher or programme team, may be co-configured by the learner(s). People: arrangement into working groups that persist for the length of the activity.</p>
<p>Teaching as design is indirect because of</p>
<ul>
<li>The legitimate and unavoidable gap between tasks and activity</li>
<li>Co-configuration of the complex mix</li>
<li>Autonomy exercised by students in making choice about who to work with and how but needs careful scaffolding</li>
<li>Plus alignment up and down the system macro &ndash; to micro-</li>
<li>Against this can we support teachers design work?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sue Tickner</em></p>
<p>Imaging learning: enabling design</p>
<p>Design/learning</p>
<p>Action (Revised design) &ndash; feedback &ndash; opportunity to respond (feed forward)</p>
<p>Dialogic process to reach a mutual understanding &ndash; when design is collaborative there are more opportunities for feedback and so learning</p>
<p>Levels of collaborative design?</p>

<li>On the fly, rapid changes according to feedback. In the moment imaging the immediate learning needs, they need new space for this, just in time, highly responsive contextual, at extreme, similar to formative testing, rapid prototyping, labs observation, on going support. Examples &ndash; one-click surveys within a course, watching their intros in labs, group discussions need to come back together, add a new whole class one. Also process &ndash; design stems from philosophy and values, reflected in methods, the &lsquo;teachable moment&rsquo;</li>
<li>Negotiated marking criteria/assessment rubrics. Co-constructed bibliographies and resource banks. Evaluation criteria for group processes. Spaces for students to create/share their own resources. Examples role play scenarios, resource bank wiki. Educ 230 Wikis, blogs, negotiated assessment criteria, self-assessment, group process critique. Self and peer assessment, criteria and review. Orientation course &ndash; chat, RSS feeds, practice wikis. Self, group, lecturer-reflection. As locus of control shifts during the shared assessment process, there is also a greater appreciation that all learners are teachers and teachers continue to be learners.</li>
<li>Students co-construct teaching resources in groups using whatever of the available technologies/resources they choose. Then create teaching spaces and co-teach. Students create resource banks and presentations to share. TLT group smart classrooms. Communication and making connections, sharing resources, encourage learners to interact spontaneously.

<p><strong>Redesign as a strategy to create, refine and share design knowledge gained in an iterative design process</strong></p>
<p>Approach to design &ndash; methodological approach &ndash; design-based research and strategic approach the use of the design principles and the design principles database (DPD)</p>
<p>Methodological approach &ndash; Barab and Squire 2004, Collins, Joseph and Bielaczyc 2004, The design-based research collective 2003</p>
<ul>
<li>Iteration 1</li>
<li>Iteration 2 Enactment of the revised version of the features, data gathering, data analysis and conclusions</li>
<li>Iteration 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Design Principles Database</p>
<p>Edu-design-principles.org Create an infrastructure for the community of educational technology designers and learning scientists to capture synthesise and discuss design knowledge</p>
<p>Structure is hierarchical have over 100 examples. Features then pragmatic principles (general guidelines about design, but also connected to learning theory) and then meta-principles</p>
<p>Example: web-based jigsaw activity: philosophical perspectives</p>
<p>Specialization groups in online discussions (progressivism, existentialism, essentialism), the knowledge sharing in home groups, then individual application of the knowledge in a new context (using perspective to analyse a school)</p>
<p>DP1: engage learners in peer instruction. Rationale &ndash; taking the role of instructor can encourage sutdents to depend understaning of content, increase motivation etc Topping 1996 Linn and His 2000 But trade off main contribution to those who instruct and less to those who learn</p>
<p>DP2: reuse students artefacts as resource for further learning</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iteration 1 &ndash; First version was unstructured discussion, found very low application of the knowledge in a new context, Students focussed on the perspective they had specialised in.</p>
<p>Iteration 2: Provided them with a tool. Collaboratively constructed table as attachment in the forum. Found application of knowledge was even lower!!!</p>
<p>Iteration 3: Used the same table, but this time students didn&rsquo;t download, it was in a wiki format. This made a big difference, because when they completed their rows they could see what others had contributed and could compare and contrast. Also enabled them to edit each others&rsquo; contributions. So a better application of DP3 and DP4</p>
<p>DP3: provide knowledge representation and organisation tools</p>
<p>DP4: Employ multiple social activity structures</p>
<p>Lessons learned &ndash; redesign as a strategy to create, refine and share design knowledge gained in an iterative design process. Design based research approach provides insights about the use of technology to apply design principles</p>
<p>Design knowledge gained in this process can become part of the design principles (tips: tradeoffs, pitfalls, limitations)</p>
<p>Comments on the presentation</p>
<ul>
<li>Small tweaks in redesign can have a huge impact on the success of the activity.</li>
<li>Interesting that between iteration 2 and 3 the major change was in the tool rather than the tasks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Learners can be initially quite reluctant to edit their co-learners contributions, need to encourage and support that</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>What do you do when people don&rsquo;t agree about the edits in the wiki, one delegate has a forum alongside the wiki so there can be a negotiation about how the wiki is edited</p>
<p><em>Issues </em></p>
<p>Co-design: Think about situations where you have handed over to the students, so there is considerable autonomy given over to the students. Think around tasks, tools, or how they work with others. Wants us to concentrate on the latter two rather than tasks.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>One example with masters&rsquo; students. Give flexibility to choose their research questions and focus and which databases to use, but they wanted to be guided more.</li>
<li>Cancelled all lectures once and told students to go and look at the materials online.</li>
<li>Students working in a global context and had to negotiate a project. They all abandoned the learner management space and took their discussion to a private space.</li>
<li>P/g e-learning course, last year moved to more flexible approach, allowed them to take over certain parts of the course and they choose the tools they wanted to use and moderated the space.</li>
<li>Put students into a public social networking site and asked them to share they professional practice and some interesting debates occurred in the communities.</li>
<li>Another example got the students to write a chapter around their subject area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Re-design: Has anyone got examples they can share of good re-designs? It's not just about re-designs which are based on solid data but also scholarly practice - teachers often have a natural, intuitive understanding of what works and what doesn't. Iterative re-design is surely an inherent part of teacher practice.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Mark Nicols &ndash; Invited Speaker</p>
<ul>
<li>New way of thinking about e-learning, challenge the assumptions we make, expose the things we take for granted.</li>
<li>No powerpoint, no slideshare, no handouts &ndash; just have to concentrate on what I am talking about</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Focus of the talk is on the dangers of group thinking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Marc Prenskys work &ndash; digital natives and immigrants, cited over 15000 times!</li>
<li>Disproves a tenant of web 2.0 wisdom of the crowd &ndash; can be dangerously wrong. The combine opinion is more valuable than the expertise of one. Connect to others</li>
<li>Prensky was wrong and we as the wisdom of the crowds bought it</li>
<li>We need to ask serious questions for what we are taking for granted &ndash; we are suckers for bright lights, free and easy learners</li>
<li>Prensky became true because we all thought it was true</li>
<li>There are so many sources of information we tend to take shortcuts, we go with our comfort zone, our paradigm</li>
<li>Many of our shared values as e-learning researchers may well be wrong &ndash; we never serious challenge our beliefs, our online connectivity only exacerbate this problem Clay Shirky &ndash; we tend to link with people who are just like us</li>
<li>The narrowing of opinions &ndash; web 2.0 narrows our thinking</li>
<li>We cling to ideas and maxums without ever challenging them, we choose who we listen to and also who we don&rsquo;t listen</li>
<li>Those who question the value of e-learning are not here.</li>
<li>We uncritically accept evidence that agrees with our beliefs</li>
<li>We don&rsquo;t adequately read anymore, we read the exec summary and assume we have what the whole report is about. We don&rsquo;t look at the deeper context.</li>
<li>Evaluation of evidence-based online learning report, from US came out earlier this year. Based on in-depth analysis. Exec summary online learning better than face to face blended is better again. But more deep reading is contrary to this, very little difference. Actually the difference appears to be more to do with the fact that online courses require students to spend more time on task than the technological dimension. Latest report from educause also indicates that faculty need to work harder online as well.</li>
<li>Little evidence that e-learning is better at the meta-level, reality is that students and faculty have to work harder, have higher drop out and is expensive.</li>
<li>A lot of the rhetoric of e-learning is little more than a dream.</li>
<li>Public libraries have been available for centuries but in reality students go to universities.&nbsp; So what&rsquo;s new?</li>
<li>Laurillard</li>
<li>Everyday knowledge is based on experience, serve our immediate needs</li>
<li>Academic knowledge is different, more complex &ndash; relating to descriptions of the world, its about paradigm construction and criticisms. Its knowledge about everyday knowledge, its based on our reflection of everyday knowledge and the search for hard evidence, serve society needs</li>
<li>This distinction is essential, universities are about dealing with academic knowledge</li>
<li>&nbsp;We need to beware of group thinking, we need to be more critically aware of our area and the wisdom of the crowds discourse associated with it.</li>

              <title>What is a Design Atelier? </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2715</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2715</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Prompted by an interesting discussion at a JISC Cluster Meeting I have created this cloud to explore further what a Design Atelier actually is?&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Background<br /></strong>The <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearning/curriculumdelivery/atelierd.aspx">ATELIER-D</a> project takes as its starting point the centuries-old methods of learning and teaching in the studio of a master artist or craftsperson. The project brings the spirit of the atelier into the 21st century. It develops the notion of the &lsquo;virtual design studio&rsquo; using ICTs to create powerful learning and teaching environments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In his keynote presentation at the OpenLearn conference&nbsp;30-31st October 2007 at The Open University (OU), John Seeley Brown used the term &lsquo;atelier&rsquo; to characterise an emerging form of learning and teaching based on social networks, a distinct participatory approach by learners and teachers and pedagogy rooted in practice. Seeley Brown drew on his experience in architecture education but many in the parent domain of design education will recognise the well-established and powerful approach offered by the atelier (see link below).<br /><br />As part of the JISC funded ATELIER-D project the OU are researching how a virtual atelier can be created using the latest Web 2.0 tools that support a wide range of distance learning designs students.<br /><strong><br />This cloud<br /></strong>This cloud seeks to promote discussion about what you think a Design Atelier is?</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the key attributes that make up a Design Atelier?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>What makes it so special?</li>
<li>Is the nature of the physical space important?&nbsp; Should it be large and open or small&nbsp; and private?</li>
<li>What type of teaching methods should be used?</li>
<li>How can communication be used to support learning?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>This link&nbsp;below takes&nbsp;you to a short video clip to prompt the discussion. <br />Your thoughts and views are most welcome.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Keynote: Peter Bradwell: Becoming an Edgeless University</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2705</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2705</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Peter argued that Universities current ways are working are not sustainable. He identified the challenges of Universities as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining standards</li>
<li>Rising demand and widening participatrion</li>
<li>Strained resources</li>
</ul>
<p>He suggested that in order to survive they need to become 'edgeless' and that technology can help with this, supporting collaboration, availability of information and people ie that technology is/ should be central to the way institutions provide learning and facilitate research.</p>
<p>In the second part of the keynote he suggests that Universities can embrace technologies in different ways in the move towards edgelessness - helping teachers teach and learners learn, communicating research and in thinking about ways of connecting with the world. He invited the audience to vote on the issues.</p>
<p><strong>Helping teachers teach and learners learn</strong></p>
<p><strong>Priorities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Teaching students to analyse information and work collaboratively</li>
<li>Putting lecture notes, podcasts and videos on line</li>
<li>Providing more interative teaching</li>
<li>More online contact with students</li>
<li>Training staff and academics</li>
</ul>
<p>In a vote the audience of this keynote thought the first and last of these should be priorities.</p>
<p><strong>Inhibitors and challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Staff skills and awareness</li>
<li>Staff engagement and willingness to learn</li>
<li>Lack of institutional interest or leadership</li>
<li>A lack of resources to invest</li>
<li>It's difficult to know what and when to change</li>
</ul>
<p>The audience said the 3rd of these most significant - if you get this right the rest will follow.</p>
<p><strong>Priorities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Making research more freely available</li>
<li>'Curation' of research data</li>
<li>Openness with institutions' data</li>
<li>Promoting shared resources</li>
<li>Understanding researchers'/ academics' needs</li>
</ul>
<p>Promoting shared resources scored the most highly.</p>
<p><strong>Priorities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>New more flxible degree courses</li>
<li>Links with alternative providers like School of Everything</li>
<li>More purely online provision</li>
<li>Collaboration between institutions</li>
<li>Staff training in supporting new kinds of learning</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inhibitors and challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The way formal education in funded mitigates against innovation</li>
<li>We don't know enough about what learners want</li>
<li>It's hard to balance online provision with face to face needs</li>
<li>Universities should retain the current models of teaching provision</li>
<li>maintaining a pursuit of 'widening participation'</li>
</ul>
<p>The first of these was considered fundemental by the voters.</p>
<p><strong>Catalysts for change</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Staff training and support</li>
<li>Supporting collaborative research platforms</li>
<li>A greater recognition of and status for high quality teaching</li>
<li>Understanding the value and role of your university</li>
<li>More resources dedicated to improving the use of technology</li>
</ul>
<p>Middle one scored higher than the others here.</p>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2684</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Early thinking</strong></p>
<p>This cloud has been set up as a space to live blog Martin Bean's keynote.</p>
<p><strong>Early thinking &ndash; the power of the personal</strong></p>
<p>8 weeks into the post &ndash; talk will provide some reflections and ideas for the future</p>
<ul>
<li>The power of personal for the students is what makes the difference</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What is the appropriate role of technology?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>People, places, methods and ideas &ndash; the importance of the OU&rsquo;s founding mission, still true today</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Still an external view of the Ou as being grounded in a broadcast paradigm but we have moved on from this. Our research and scholarship is critical not only in its own right but for the benefits for learning and teaching. Martin hears many stories about how the OU has changed their lives or the lives of people they know, the AL role is critical in this respect, the student experience is very much linked to the AL.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Aspirations to expand OU reach to other areas in the UK, work-based and internationally.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Amazing innovations &ndash; itunes hit 10 million downloads last week</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s about experimenting and trying out new things</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Quality assurance is critical and we must maintain that. We rank at the top in terms of various quality measures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Graduates of the OU are amongst the most employable in the UK&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The regions and the nations &ndash; an inspiration. Martin visited all the regions over the summer and learnt a great deal. We need to make stronger connections between the regions and central Milton Keynes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Widening participation is also key and is embedded in what we do &ndash; working in prisons, employer engagement and other outreach activities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The importance of the Associate Lecturers and their role, supported open learning (SOL) ALs are the main personal contact point for our students. The way that ALs feed forward for students, empowering students &ndash; &lsquo;I can do this&rsquo;. The critical role of ALs in the student experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some concerns:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A question of who we are? Are we too open? Do we do them any favours in terms of letting them start anyway.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The relationship between Milton Keynes and the regions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We need to move to all of us considering ourselves as part of the OU &ndash; ca. 12, 500 staff &ndash; Als are equally part of this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Our systems and processes need updating &ndash; need to ensure our technologies are fit for purpose.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Does the university realise the critical role that the regions play in terms of the OU? Local will continue to be important.</li>
<li>Consider the challenges facing HE &ndash; globalisation, privatisation, massification</li>
<li>Transforming information into knowlledge</li>
<li>Need to educate citizens for new types of work</li>
<li>We cannot depend on young graduates alone</li>
<li>Learning in the workplace needs to becme integral</li>
<li>HE must remove artifical barries - link school, FE and HE together</li>
</ul>
<p>Making change possible</p>
<ul>
<li>Three key considerations: people, processes and technology</li>
<li>People spend too much time on the technology and not on the people aspects and how it will be used. </li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I would be very keen to here views from Associate Lecturer's on cloudworks and how it might be used as a space for ALs to discuss learning and teaching issues and to share practice and experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your views of the site?</li>
<li>What ideas have you got for how it might be used?</li>
<li>The site is open and can be viewed by anyone - this has advantages (we have people looking at the site from 140 countries) but are there any issues with this, would it deter you from using the site? </li>
<li>Can you see this as a complementary 'open' space alongside existing closed OU-tutor forums?</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The use of podcasts, Webcasts and streamed video is fast becoming commonplace in our courses, alongside the more traditional CD- or DVD- delivered elements. Some of us are actually producing our own objects using, often, demo versions of software or open source tools. Looking to the bigger picture beyond course production, I think it's safe to say that students would profit from being able to develop the types of skills we're now developing through this sort of work.</p>
<p>So: what about getting our students to use these media to communicate their ideas and understandings, that is, what about integrating multimedia work into assessment?</p>
<p>These are some questions that come to mind:</p>
<p>In what ways can we usefully teach students to create their own multimedia objects?</p>
<p>What is involved (conceptually and in practice) in assessing these objects?</p>
<p>How can this type of work be integrated with other work in a course?</p>
<p>Is it possible to create a basic framework that can be adapted to the requirements of different disciplines?</p>
<p>An attempt at addressing these questions is currently taking place in the development of the new Computing &amp; ICT course TU100 . At the moment, there's a forthcoming D2 of a course unit teaching students how to prepare multimedia, using a framework that could potentially be adapted to any discipline and 'format' (another area of questioning I might have included in the list above), and discussion is ongoing on the related assessment, but I thought it would be interesting to invite other people's views!</p>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2583</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>According to Andrei, there is a simple and obvious condition for any psychological knowledge to be accepted and used by practitioners &ndash; both teachers (trainers, instructors) and instructional designers. This condition is that a practitioner should be able to do significantly more, both in explanation and in practice with such knowledge than would be possible on the basis of common sense or practical experience alone. Podolskij will distinguish two different aspects: (a) the developmental dimension which requires planning and designing, along with determining the short- and the long-term developmental consequences and the extent to which learning/teaching processes influence the student's cognitive, personal, moral, social, and emotional development, and (b) developmental changes that can also be viewed as a direct and immediate aim of the learning/teaching processes. His presentation describes two types of developmental dimensions of the instructional design and instructional technology and also considers main paths to apply those dimensions in the instructional designer&rsquo;s and teacher/trainer/instructor&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>Students, schools and learning &ndash; its is widely accepted by students that arrival at school means powering down for a few hours. After school they resume their technology infused lives and leverage a wide range of emerging technologies to fine tune their skills in communicating, collaborating, creating and contributing</p>
<p>Technology had enabled students to be not only uber communicators but also to develop strong teamwork skills and to view the process of content development as a key part of the new learning process</p>

<li><strong>OCI Office of Cyberstrcture Cyberinfrastructur</strong>e emerged as a term ca. 2003. Goal is to provide as many communities accces to high performace computing and network as much as possible and support education and reseach in those areas</li>
<li><strong>CDI (Cyberanable learning and Discovery Program</strong> started 2007 Looking at complex scientific data and exploring new concepts. Aims to explore radically new concepts, approaches and tools at the intersection of computing and bioldgy. 5 themes - knowledge extraction, interacting elements, computational experimentation, virtual environments and educationa research and studetns in computational discovery</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cyberlearning Initiative report</strong> out last year - what is cyberlearning?&nbsp; 58 page report, "imperative that NSF establish a coherent approach to cyberlearning to enable the transformational promise of technology for improving educational opportunity"</p>
<p>Integrative technology that can be used transformatively in learning, for example use of interactive GIS maps, technology augmentation to the learning process. enables things that wouldn't be possible otherwise</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extend strategic partnerships, including public-private partnerships</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But a climate check on education...</strong></p>
<p><em>How are we leaving behind?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Only 71% of 9th grader graduate from high school</li>
<li>2000 schools produce 50% of nations dropouts</li>
<li>Lack of student engagemne is key predictor of dropping out</li>
<li>Unemployment and poverty</li>
</ul>
<p>So innovation and transformative education in a climate of the face of a national crisis</p>
<p>Persistent challenges in u/g education - disconnect in student preparedness, need to engage students early, forge strong links betewwn K-12 and universities, institutions/faculty/teachers need to know their studnets, increase faculty access to and support iin using new pedagogy, incorporating new technologies, address student demographics (Latino population fastest growing, least likely to go to college)</p>
<p><strong>Advancing educational partnerships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maths Science Partnership - MSP program 2002. Supports partnerships between K-12 and others For example Stark Country Maths Science Partnership</li>
<li>Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) 2003.Preparing professionals and IT works in the US CITERA Comprehesnive IT Education in Rural Areas</li>

<p><strong>Defining optimal technology use - Are we there yet?</strong></p>
<p>Going back to Means et al (1993) In some cases we are there=, in others not</p>
<p><strong>Cyber challlenge</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation of technology - use and integration</li>
<li>Understand modern learners</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>From the AECT website: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;                                     His presentation will start by summarising outcomes from recent research on how university students approach complex inquiry-based learning tasks that involve significant use of educational technology. The research reveals significant variations in how students make sense of such challenges, how they negotiate between their own and their teachers&rsquo; goals, and how environmental factors influence the nature and outcomes of their learning activity. The discussion will focus on some of the ways in which students&rsquo; conceptions of learning, and other beliefs about learning, interact with their technological choices and with their use (or non-use) of the various kinds of support that their teachers provide. This picture of students exercising autonomy in their learning, but making choices that are not always optimal, will then be used as a backdrop for explaining a conception of university teaching called &lsquo;teaching-as-design&rsquo;. Peter will sketch a model of teaching-as-design and then focus on forms of knowledge and ways of knowing that stand a reasonable chance of improving teachers&rsquo; educational design activity. Finally, he will draw out some implications for an educational technology research agenda that is fit for the purpose of improving the integrative challenges of teaching-as-design.</p>
<p>Professor of education and co-director of the CoCo Research Centre, University of Sydney, Senior Fellow, Australian Learning and Teaching Council</p>
<p><strong>Three parts to the keynote</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Research into students experience of learning in blended learning contexts</li>
<li>Concept of teaching as design</li>
<li>Forms of knowledge capture, ways of sharing expertise for design between teachers involved in designing for students</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1. Learning through inquiry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inquiry learning is about - all forms of educational activity that give a central place to students ingvetigattive work. For example problem-based learning,&nbsp; project-based learning, or&nbsp; collaborative knowledge building</li>
<li>It may be Individual&nbsp; or group based, and often involves discussion for coordinated as well as knowledge building</li>
<li>Draws on: 
<ul>
<li>Important in terms of development of graduate capabilities &ndash; Argyris, C (1998) "Teaching smart people how to learn" &ndash; Harvard Bus Review on Knowledge Management, Cam MA</li>
<li>Boulton G and Lucas C 2008 "What are universities for?" <a href="http://www.leru.org/">www.leru.org</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning to deal with complexity, helping students to deal with this</li>
<li>Goodyear and Zenios 2007 BJET 55 (4) discussion collaborative knowledge work and epistemic fluency</li>
<li>Researching university students experiences of blended learning from a phenomenographic perspective 0 students conceptions of learning, students approaches to study &ndash; strategies and intentions.Undertook a set of In depth interviews n = 20, open ended survey n = 50 and likert scale instruments n =100</li>
<li>New book Ellis and Goodyear Routledge, 2009</li>
<li>Taped and transcribed &ndash; each read independently by 3 researchers &ndash; illuminating phrases and main themes noted and compared, further reading, categories, comparison, discussion, final agreement</li>
<li>Three areas: conceptions, f2f approaches, online approaches</li>
<li>Adv in Health Sci Educ (2008) 13: 675-692</li>
<li>Concepts of PBL a way if developing independent clinical reasoning and problem solving abilities through to more restricted views as a way of covering topics to answer problems, a way of followig a predefined process. Get a lot of variation between the students in terms of what they think they can get out of PBL</li>
<li>Approaches &ndash; deep vs. surface. Find that very few of the students are actually adopting deep learning approaches</li>
<li>Distribution of conceptions and approaches &ndash; the majority are not adopting richer notions of PBL or deep approaches, there is a mis-match between the teachers intentions and what they students are actually doing. Translates through to end of course grades</li>
<li>Students should make choices in HE need to become autonomous, about how they respond to the tasks set for them, what tools and resource to use</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>But their choices are less than optimal. The patterns we see are familiar from 30 years of HE research, but we are picking it up in contexts where technology plays a role too.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Students are looking to us &ndash; their teachers for guidance&rsquo;s even about the educational use of technologies</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What form should design guidance&rsquo;s take when it needs tow ork in participatory/co-design/co-configuration context?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Teaching as design</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The decline of the compliant learner &ndash; in HE there isn&rsquo;t a systematic approach to instructional design/learning design. The challenges teachers are facing now are incredibly complex, to try and help students benefit from the opportunities need a more systematic approach need to use some design tools. Some of ideas of instructional design have assumed a compliant learner &ndash; they will do what they are set. This is not true in HE and we don&rsquo;t want them to be compliant. We want them to be creative, to interpret the task, to appropriate it. Design more about the crafting of affordances than the determination of activities.</li>
<li>The architecture of productive learning environments</li>
<li>Educational design as the crafting of affordances</li>
<li><em>From sage on the stage to guide on the side</em></li>
<li>Teaching as telling towards teaching as facilitation</li>
<li>Learning by listening to learning by doing (more activity-based learning)</li>
<li>But we also need to include &ndash; teaching as design&hellip; <em>ie to the team with a scheme</em></li>
<li>C21 learning is different and we need to adapt our design methods to better reflect this&ndash; learning to think for a living, teacher-researcher, extended professional</li>
<li>Multiple intended learning outcomes tasks &ndash; lead to activity &ndash; leads to outcomes</li>
<li>Distinction between task (what the teacher sets for the student to do) and activity (what the students actually do)</li>
<li>Legitimate (re)interpretation of task: creative, personalised, &ldquo;satisficing&rdquo;</li>
<li>Learning is physically situated &ndash; &ldquo;learnplaces&rdquo; and is socially situated &ndash; groups, teams and communities</li>
<li>Then design centred on student activities &ndash; people, community and tools, resource and infrastructure, social relations, place. With the tasks as the &ldquo;rules&rdquo;</li>
<li>Indirect approach to design &ndash; learnplace, social space and tasks</li>
<li>We need to design these design components (task, tools, people) from the micro, meso and macro level. We need to better integrate across these as well.</li>
<li>Teaching as design &ndash; indirect because legitimised by the students gap bet task specified and subsequent student activities</li>
<li>Co-configuration of the complex mix of material and digital tools, resources and places</li>
<li>Autonomy exercised by students in making choices about who to work with and how</li>
<li>Plus alignment up and down the system &ndash; macro to micro</li>
<li>Against this backdrop how can we support teachers&rsquo; design work?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Capturing and sharing experiential and evidence based knowledge for design</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Goodyear and Retalis, forthcoming edited collection on current research on pedagogical patterns. &ldquo;Technology-enhanced learning design patterns and patterns languages&rdquo;</li>
<li>A pattern is a solution to a recurrent problem in a context Alexander et al., 1977</li>
<li>A pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a millions times over</li>
<li>Structure: context, essence of the problem, rationale, the solution (which is action orientated), smaller patterns</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Pedagogical pattern: Umpire</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Defines a role that is useful in a umber of group task patterns</li>
<li>Lively discussion can generate emotion and someone will occasionally say something offensive&hellip;</li>
<li>Solution make it responsibility o the group to deal with offensive comments, give one or two students the role of umpire</li>
<li>Lower level patterns &ndash; scribe and wrapper and whistle</li>
<li>These fit together in a pattern language</li>
<li>Course, inquiry task, planning group _ problem scenario, umpire + scribe + wrapper</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Design patterns and pattern languages: take home points</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Design as intimately involved in balancing competing forces</li>
<li>Contextualised guidance vs. universal principles</li>
<li>Linking rationale to action-oriented guidance including students</li>
<li>Rationale can draw on experience theory empirical data etc</li>
<li>Performance support balance with professional development</li>
<li>Giving names to useful recurrent forms is a significant contribution (for example the jigsaw pattern)</li>
<li>Linking design patterns to software etc</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>
<p>Students are active interpreters of task requirements</p>
<p>Educational designs need to have ways of helping us talk abut design of good tasks</p>
<p>In relation to tasks, tools and people, students will need to exercise significant autonomy in their choices, often make sub-optimal choices, there are things we can do to help with this, better scaffolding, changing the culture</p>
<p>Major practical challenge &ndash; managing the interface between increasing smart and ubiquitous technologies and the local infrastructure</p>
<p>Transforming knowledge so that its application by time poor undertrained teachers and in local contexts</p>
<p>Having a shared sense of the architecture of what we are trying to create can really focus outputs from research in educational technology/learning sciences &ndash; a clearer sense of the users of research and the specifics of their needs</p>

              <title>Changing nature of conferences</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2577</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2577</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I am interested in is the subtle ways in which new technology begins to alter standard practice over time, and without these changes being planned. In the academic world I think the conference is one such area. The academic conference can be seen as one of the core practices in higher education. It achieves many vital functions in academic practice, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge sharing - you get to present and listen to other talks</li>
<li>Validation - by sharing research and ideas within a subject community you get validation </li>
<li>Networking - you establish a network of peers</li>
<li>Recognition - publishing conference papers is often a first step for researchers to publishing papers and are recognised outputs</li>
<li>Socialising - slightly different from networking, there is a social element to conferences which make them enjoyable</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past few years remote participation has become more commonplace. By remote participation I don't mean solely online conferences, but rather the sort of vicarious, casual participation many of us undertake. This type of participation is often unofficial, and uses low key, free technology. It is often a hybrid of the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter hashtags</li>
<li>Live streaming (whether official or via an individual)</li>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Live-blogging</li>
<li>Video/audio updates </li>
<li>Flickr streams</li>
<li>Slideshare presentations</li>
<li>Cloudworks/Friendfeed aggregations</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few things that interest me about this. The first is how does it change the nature of the conference to have this broader participation? Secondly, how can conference organisers and presenters best take advantage of it and incorporate it into the conference? Thirdly, what is the experience like for the remote participant compared with the 'real thing'? For this last question,<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=CveXD_2fdMNq_2bII6qse1N4zg_3d_3d"> I have created a quick 5 question survey</a> to get a feeling for how remote participation compares with real attendance.</p>
<p>In this debate I'd really like to get opinions and views from people on how conferences have changed and, perhaps more importantly, ideas for how they could change in the future.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Keynote: Seely-Brown Learning in/for the digital age – where engagement matters even more</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2567</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2567</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Learning in/for the digital age &ndash; where engagement matters even more</strong></p>
<p>Not a formal talk, evocative images instead</p>
<p>Reimaging Dewey for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century &ndash; Dewey was way ahead of his time</p>
<p>Today we may now be able to better apply Dewey&rsquo;s ideas</p>
<p>Challenge we face &ndash; preparing students for a world of constant change</p>
<p>We need to rethink what we need to learn and how we actually learn</p>
<p>Leveraging how the net generation thinks, works, learns, socialises might social media be our friend?</p>
<p>From:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cartesian view of learning &ndash; knowledge as substance &ndash; I think therefore I am, and pedagogy as knowledge transfer. If we think of learning lie this change will be resisted &ndash; I teach, you learn, cultivate the neat rows of disciplinary knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>To</p>
<ul>
<li>The social view of learning &ndash; we participate therefore we are &ndash; understanding is socially constructed, we come into being through our interaction with others (object relation theory)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not about knowledge being socially constructed which is a post-modern view, more abut knowledge and learning becoming personal through interaction with other, through social construction</p>
<p>Suggesting we view learning more like this....we learn in and through our interaction with others and with the world</p>
<p>Nothing beats collaborative study groups &ndash; especially around homework and exam preparation, the social construction of understanding is real. Study grops very powerful, this is the model the Open University in the UK use and these work both face to face AND virtually if constructed right. Students in their own spaces/rooms but connecting vritually as if they are all together.</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t we turn everyone into being both a learner and a teacher? Nothing clarified ideas better than explaining them to others....And in social networks across communities/friends: blogs, facebook, myspace, second life. Now study groups or just plan bull sessions can naturally extend to peer groups galore inside and outside of school.</p>
<p>Beyond text book learningL learning about.... learning to be Michael Polanyi</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning about - explicit</li>
<li>Learning to be - tacit</li>
</ul>
<p>Need to reverse the flow: Productivity inquiry &ndash; I get stuck I need to know more, learning on demand. The Internet can really facilitate this, can provide answers to problems you ahve. Situated learning as the dominate form of learning. The context creates much of the meaning.Studetns able to learn on demand are set for life, they have the key competences to cope with change.</p>
<p>So what kind of learning is in tune with both Dewey and the net generation?</p>
<p>With today's world and the powers of technology there are many ways to express ideas - visual, musical, procedural, cinematic. It's no longer just about text.</p>
<p>Life in the digital age - a culture of participation, building, tinkering, remixing and sharing - circle of consuming and producing. Creating meaning by what I produce and others build on a remix, open source culture. In the blogospher there is no cheating, it is a self-correcting system, you link, you build on the work of others. A peer community.</p>
<p>Open source community, the remix community. Something fundamental is now happening, in past generation our sense of personal identity came from what i wear, own, control now this is shfiting, in the net gen world, it is not what i own that matters, it is what i have done and shared and what other people have built on. Other pick up on and build. That is the essence of open source - social capital, reputational capital. This define remix and also gaming culture such as world of warcraft, there is a sense of constantly constructing things and sharing them, so that others can pick up on and build on. This is very optimistic if we can tap into this and build on it in an educational context.</p>
<p>Mix, remis and mashup creative tinkering and the play of imagination. But it can also be creative reading like in fandomw, fans filling in the back story in highly imaginative ways. Ah creative meaning by integrating their imagination with that of the author in remix.</p>
<p>Tinjerig as a learning platform and its death and rebirth as remix, mashiups etc.</p>
<p><em>Tinkering<br /></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Noun1: tinker a person who enjoys fixing and experimenting with machines and their parts. </li>
<li>Tinkerer as experimenter: a person who enjoys testing out innovative ideas; "she was an experimenter in new forms of poetry"</li>
</ul>
<p>But nowadays machines are too complex, too difficult cognitively. We can't understnad them. But is reappearing in the digital world and it's gender nuetral.</p>
<p>Tinkering as a new form of identity.</p>
<p><em>Examples</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"Fanomw" - back stories by fans. A front story - Matrix. Remix of the matrix using naruto animme series. Amazing mapping between the two cultures. This is a very skilled remix by a 23 year old from London. This has been passed around the world, added to&nbsp; and commented on. </li>
</ul>
<p>Genres of participation afforded by new media - DML: Mimito, ConnieYowell. Threeyear study.</p>
<p>Three genres of participaption</p>
<ul>
<li>Friendship driven hanging out MySpace, facebook, twitter, sms, second life, neo=pets, pokemon</li>
<li>Interest driven - messing around - robotics, anime, astronomy, chess, music, history, biugs</li>
<li>Geeking out</li>
</ul>
<p>Competences - maths, literacy, science, social studeis, science, critical inquiry, collbaoration, problem solving, peer learning creativity, imagination</p>
<p>Example: YouMedia: Virtual space, Around the ages are physcial books, present of digital media, enhanced their interest in physical books. A place where youth can hang out, mess around, geeek out. From the website:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>YouMedia</strong> @ CPL is an innovative, 21st century learning space, housed at the Harold Washington Library, created to connect young adults, books, media and institutions throughout the city in one dynamic space designed to inspire collaboration and creativity. By working both in teams and individually, young adults will have an opportunity to engage in projects that promote critical thinking, creativity and skill-building.</li>
</ul>
<p>The long tail in learning - leveraging the vast resources on the net. Moving beyond limited shelf space and local ocmmunities of pracitce. Supporting the rise of an ecology of learning/doing niches. "Ah I am passionate about this niche topic, I want to learn.do more!"</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>MicroObersvatory network - Harward-Smothsonian Center for Astrophyscis. 5 self-contained weatherised reflcting telescopes with CCDs deployed around the world. It's an open source repository. Everything has to be open, you are expected to participate in discussion around what you have uploaded.Lagoon nebula by a student called Stephanie.</li>
<li>The rise of the pro-amateur class; from amatrue to professional. From latin - amator - lover, Niche communiities of co-creation learning and sharing: passion-based learning. Mix of telescope, camera, and internet/blogs/yahoo groups/data bases.</li>
<li>Learning as curation/narration story telling and play lists hits the galaxies. Can download to your laptop, from microsoft. Students can take trajectories through the galaxies. Trips become play lists, which can be passed round. Worldwide telescope.</li>
<li>Bugscope - virtual laboratry accessed via the net by kids. Educating future scientists by providing access to virtual instrumentation. Tokay Geckos. Virtual Scanning Electron Microscope. </li>
<li>History: Uncle Tom's cabin and american culture. lATH site. A key trust is a sense of doing history os an act of uncovering, ask what got uncovered rather than what got covered.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, jsb - remix, user gnerated contet, blogs and co-creation buyt where is thaere any guarantee of quality adn the seat of authority?</p>
<p>Britannican vs. wikipedia: both are equivalent? Actually no wikipedia is better! But that finesses the question of quality. Key: ew reading practice are called for!. Authoriry vs. timeliness - in a rapid evolving world. You read the two things different. Wikipedia is always evolving, requires new reading practices. Look at the edits, can see what parts of the article are being contested and by whom. CAn see into the back ground. The first view into the practice of scholarship. Evolution of knowledge, contested knowledge. New form of literacy.</p>
<p>Snapshot of a student's life - global communiites. and local communiites. Learning network - museums, libraries, after school, home, online, school - a learning ecology and trajectories through this ecology. Learning beyond school. A blended epistemology - homo spein ma as knower (knowledge), tools as instrumental - to homo faber man as maker</p>
<p>Casual vs. deep tinkering. CAsual form of messing around, deep - know how/what can be pushed around, rearranged, repurposed, modified, intimate famiiarity</p>
<ul>
<li>Homo sapien - knowing</li>
<li>Homo fabre - making</li>
<li>Homo ludens - playing (have we over looked the importance of playing)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Concentraing on playing</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Learning as riddles, leading to reframing or registering the world</li>
<li>As a freedom to fail, fail and fail again, then get it right (think of extreme sports)</li>
<li>As play of imagination - poetry</li>
<li>As in an epiphany - suddening falling in place as in solving a riddel</li>
</ul>
<p>The new golden triangle - imagination, intuition and inspiration - a sense of awe combining home sapien, faber and ludens</p>
<p>Culture emerges through play - Homo Ludens</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>When recreation becomes an act of recreation/remix and productive inquiry - culture of learning - a culture that thrives on participatyr lifelong learning and perhaps the ulimate sustainable model.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Keynote: Doug Johnson</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2563</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2563</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Schools for the Net Generation</strong></p>
<p>Doug talked about the Net Generation drawing on a range of studies. His focus was on the implications for schools and for how we teach.</p>
<p><em>Net Generation - learning styles</em></p>
<p>Teachers are still vital - computers can't replace humans</p>
<p>Social learners</p>
<p>Seek personal information</p>
<p>Remixed 0 share, 57 % content creators</p>
<p>Learning styles - mind shaped by technology and media (hypertext minds, read visual images, inductive discovery, learn by doing, shift attention rapidly - tune out of things not of interest, need encouragemnet to reflect, expect fast responses)</p>
<p><strong>From entertain to engage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Purpose: enjoyment - learning</li>
<li>Impact: ephemeral - permanent</li>
<li>Relevance: little or non &ndash; high</li>
<li>Problems: escape - solving</li>
<li>Creativity: shown by others &ndash; shown by the learner</li>
<li>Activity: passive - interactive</li>
</ul>
<p>This generation are more interactive, they are contet producers</p>
<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Relevance</li>
<li>Use, not ban, web 2.0 tools</li>
<li>Teach and use collaborative groups</li>
<li>Teach copyrights from point of view of the creator</li>
<li>Emphasis on safe and ethical use</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Values</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Acheivement oriented - cool to be smart, focused on grades, rules, schedules and agendas</li>
<li>work on things tht matter</li>
<li>Identify on parent vlaues</li>
<li>Busy with extra activities</li>
<li>Unaware of the consequences o their tech use - 75% agree - downloading and file sharing is so easy to do, its unrealistic to espect people not to do it</li>
<li>This generation is "differently moral"</li>
</ul>
<p>Need to teach the kids how to protect themselves, from themselves as well as others</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Outlines the nature and extent of the problem, the latest research and practical strategies to deal with problematic behaviours online and mobiles. A large section details with what schools can do to keep the community safe and reduce the risk o litigation</p>
<p><strong>Live blog notes</strong></p>
<p>Works with adolescents</p>
<p>Beyond generation y &ndash; towards generation z</p>
<p><em>Books</em></p>
<p>1. The princess bitchface syndrome</p>
<p>2. When to worry, what to do about it</p>
<p>Single biggest transformation &ndash; movable type face ca. 14 C is the Internet</p>
<p>Digital divide &ndash; adults charged with the care of next generation feel as though they are shout out on the other side of the bedroom door</p>
<ul>
<li>Online mental health services <a href="http://www.moodgym.anu.edu/">www.moodgym.anu.edu</a> - mood online training programme, impact amazing as good as session with real psychologist</li>
<li>Computer game designed to help kids with anger management, <a href="http://www.reachoutcentral.com.au/">www.reachoutcentral.com.au</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Depression single most problematic problem kids will have, youth beyond blue programme Reachout.com site</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Kid helpline can talk to a professional counsellor or a chat-line any time</li>
</ul>
<p>What is happening with families in terms of cybersafety, students are at risk online because they lack judgement are impulsive (aren&rsquo;t developed in terms of brain capacity till mid twenties). There is low parent involvement in what kids are doing online, parents are frozen out, kids see access as right and private, parents are ignorant of the dangers of the online space. We need to develop a digital spine &ndash; a set of groundrules. Filters and other mechanisms for restricting access are very crude and don&rsquo;t work. Problem is anonymity is leading to inappropriate behaviour, kids thing they are anonymous</p>
<p>Need to help empower parents and educate them to help ensure kids are safe online, the schools need to be more proactive in this process.</p>
<p>Need to help empower parents</p>
<p>Six most popular activities for teens online</p>
<ol>
<li>Chatting on MSN: treats include predators in chat rooms, don&rsquo;t always know who they are talking to, other problem is what kids do to each other online. Solution is not to ban the internet, need to educate the kids and give them the skills they need to use the internet safely</li>
<li>Text messages: Mobile explosion, more phones than people, 14, 500 text messages in one month! Very high mobile phone ownership, 8-11 yr olds 18%, 12-14 yr 75% and over 15 90%, mobile web commonplace within a year</li>
<li>Social networking sites &ndash; facebook, myspace. Teens flaunting sex and drugs on MySpace. Up to 97% of 16-17 yrs olds claim to use at least one social networking service. Should you regularly monitor what your kids are doing online? Lost in cyberspace &ndash; fears that new networks are breeding grounds for real-life tragedies. Google &ldquo;how to kill yourself&rdquo;</li>
<li>Downloading music, videos etc. Censorship now meaningless as a result. </li>
<li>Also gaming sites. World of Warcraft &ndash; some obsessed, 15 hours a day.&nbsp; Super columbine massacre &ndash; where you can relive the massacre &ndash; this is very sick. Gang rape revence games cheats ban &ndash; where you rape a mother and two children.</li>
<li>Web surfing &ndash; cyberia mostly lawless</li>
</ol>
<p><em>How is this impacting on kids and schools?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Impacts on teachers &ndash; cyberbullying affects 1 in 10 teachers &ndash; Guardian 4/4/09</li>
<li>Ratemyteacher.com can see what the students have said about teachers &ndash; deformation of character</li>
<li>The story of the shower girl &ndash; HeraldSun 22/3/07 filmed having sex in a shower and it was uploaded to a website</li>
<li>Some kids are using the internet obsessively</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Worlds of kids &ndash; 4 + 1</em></p>
<ul>
<li>4 worlds of an adolescent peer world, school world, family world, inner world and now digital world</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why the fifth world &ndash; quantitatively different, virtual cameleons online, trying to work out who they are</li>
</ul>
<p>Used correctly &ndash; great tool:&nbsp; Big attraction for kids: Desire to be with age mates &ndash; social networking enables this, Anonymity, Search for identity etc, For young girls &ndash; has a biochemical component</p>
<p>Schools need to get their acts together &ndash; current policies are inadequate, emphasis on banning things, no student involvement in drafting of policy, no curriculum back up, no staff PD, no leadership</p>
<p>Governments need to be seen to be doing something, <a href="http://www.netalert.gov.au/">www.netalert.gov.au</a></p>
<p>How easy is it to bypass the filters &ndash; very easy, Tom Wood 16 yr old took 30 mins to bypass it, then a YouTube video on how to do this</p>
<p><em>What can schools do?</em></p>
<p>National centre against bullying &ndash; important to have a neutral organisation to take things forward, rather than the Government</p>
<p>Built on success of the SunSmart programme for safety against skin cancer created e-Smart. Trials currently taking place in Victoria.</p>
<p>E-Smart is voluntary - policies, practices, curriculum, parent education, StaffPD, student involvement. Low bar to entry but have to improve year on year.</p>
<p>Kate McCaffrey&nbsp; &ldquo;Destroying Avalon&rdquo;, first novel on cyber bullying, offers insight into the cyber bullying worlds</p>
<p>http://www.fremantlepress.com.au/booksmain.htm</p>
<p>Good practice - New Zealand NetSafe The Internet safety group</p>
<p><strong>Policy development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a cybersafety team (must include students and the IT people)</li>
<li>Cybersafety stocktake &ndash; search for your schools, digital footprint &ndash; type in school name into social networking sites and google</li>
<li>Implement technical safety system</li>
<li>Create initial cybersafety policy</li>
<li>Create acceptable use agreements</li>
<li>Board of trustees must agree</li>
<li>Present draft policy to the staff and get agreement</li>
<li>Present policy to parents and students - perhaps as a parenting quiz nights</li>
<li>Get consensus and get staff, parents and students to sign the agreement</li>
<li>NetSafe training for specialist roles</li>
<li>Integrate cybersafety into the curriculum</li>
<li>Expain use agreement to new students and paretns - have them signed up!</li>
<li>Explain also for new staff</li>
<li>Review the policy and use agreements annually - have to ensure there is time to do this</li>
</ul>

              <title>Presentation: Conole - Design in practice: aligning ‘design creativity’ with ‘design practice’</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2559</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2559</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Design in practice: aligning &lsquo;design creativity&rsquo; with &lsquo;design practice&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>New technologies offer exciting possibilities for education: new forms of communication and collaboration, rich, multimedia resources, immersion in authentic virtual worlds and gaming environments. However understanding how to use these technologies and how to design courses which capitalize on their potential is far from trivial. Furthermore, despite the fact that designing learning activities is a core aspect of education, the design process is purely understood and there is a tension between design creativity versus design planning. At the Open University in the UK we have a research and development initiative (the Open University Learning Design Initiative, <a href="http://ouldi.open.ac.uk/">http://ouldi.open.ac.uk</a>) which is developing a range of tools, methods and approached to help teachers and developers make more pedagogical informed and effective use of new technologies. The session will describe the initiative and work to date. In particular it will describe CompendiumLD a tool we have developed for visualizing and guiding the design process and Cloudworks a social networking site for sharing learning and teaching ideas. It will also outline how this work is feeding into a related project, Olnet (<a href="http://olnet.org/">http://olnet.org</a>) which is a global network to facilitate researchers and users of Open Educational Resources.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Update on LLUK 'Career Guidance Qualifications Framework' to assess progress made to date - Deirdre to contact Pat Pugh at LLUK to discuss innovation element required within the evolving new framework.</p>
<p>Link to 'Vitae' - Sheri from CRAC&nbsp;to upload the appropriate weblink&nbsp; and other related impact studies as discussed in our meeting. Also, look out for more information on 'ICOULD' which contains over 1,000 career stories; it's planned to promote these in new multi-media contexts - watch this space!</p>
<p>Career Adaptability International Research Group - Prof. Jenny Bimrose is the UK lead person overseeing this innovative development. Noted: There is scope for organisations to pilot a 'first draft' instrument for measuring individuals'career adaptability. Contact Jenny at IER if you want to find out more.</p>
<p>Exciting ERASMUS project involving 28 member states and 40 European Partners, mainly from Higher Education Institutions, with a strong focus on the training of guidance practitioners. Contact Rachel at UEL if you want to find out more. Also, some fun and education developments taking place at UEL with students and staff using the&nbsp;'Secondlife' virtual learning environment.</p>
<p>Plans underway to submit an ESRC bid, led by IER, Warwick University and Loughborough University. The Careers Innovation Group members are invited to participate in helping to inform and shape this potentially exciting&nbsp;outline proposal. Contact Jenny for more information.</p>
<p>ACEG is getting involved in&nbsp;forging closer working links with the Institute of Education Business Excellence to influence new curriculum and CE/IAG developments. They also have recently appointed a&nbsp;new Editor to work on the ACEG Careers Journal (Chris Thomas). Look out for details of next year's ACEG Annual Conference to be held on 7/7/10 in Bristol. This year's annual conference was a great success! Also, we understand that the DCSF funded 'Careers Co-ordinators in England' Research Report is due to be published towards the end of September.</p>
<p>Connexions Derbyshire are keen to work with colleagues on initiatives linked to NEET at 18-19, particularly innovative work with young males. In addition, new and innovative approaches are being adopted by staff working in Schools/Colleges and community-based settings. They are also analysing careers service&nbsp;user perspectives particualrly 18-21 year olds.</p>
<p>The International Centre for Guidance Studies (iCeGS)&nbsp;is developing new materials for nurturing and supporting 'practitioner researchers' . The 11th iCeGS Annual Lecture is scheduled on 10th December at Derby University, Kedleston Road Site. Barry Hopson is the keynote speaker which should provide some lively interactions with the audience. Siobhan has some great information on newly published LSIS materials 'Career Learning for the 21st Century'. Look out - she's kindly offered to upload this onto&nbsp;our website.</p>
<p>AGCAS is continuing to develop its 'Practitioners Forum' to help raise the voice of professional staff and to profile good and interesting policies and practices.</p>
<p>South West Careers Ltd. are in the process of planning a vibrant STEM Conference.</p>
<p>Dr Bill Law is currently working with iCeGS on a 'storyboarding' initiative designed to explore 'turning points' in individuals' lives. Different scenarios can be played out to test out the 'what if.....' questions.&nbsp;Look out for 'Bill Law Storyboarding' on the iCeGS website sometime soon.</p>
<p>Dr Deirdre Hughes is planning to launch a 'National Campaign for Careers' in her new role as incoming 'President of ICG' on 5th &amp; 6th November at the Hilton Hotel, Blackpool. She will be announcing an exciting new&nbsp;programme of 2010 events, a festival week to celebrate the history of careers work and its achievements across the UK (likely to be held in May 2010) and 'high fives', 'key facts: evidence and impact' and 'interpretations of work in the 21st century'. If you or your organisation wants to join in this exciting&nbsp;Campaign, simply contact: <a href="mailto:deirdre.hughes3@btinternet.com">deirdre.hughes3@btinternet.com</a></p>
<p>Also look out for 'NEET SPEAKS' ethnographic research study, led by Deirdre working closely with Geoff Bright, Sarah Davies and Prof. David Davies, on 'Voices of NEET Young People in Doncaster'. Plans are underway to publish the rich text findings in an academic journal and professional journal so that lessons can be learnt from this experience.</p>
<p>Finally, the MATURE Programme, led in the UK by Professor Jenny Bimrose and Professor Alan Brown at IER, Warwick University,&nbsp;is researching knowledge maturation&nbsp; and organisational agility in differing contexts.&nbsp;Careers Innovation Group members plan to offer peer review and comments on the findings as they unfold. Here's a flavour of&nbsp;thematic areas&nbsp;currently being developed: Careers Practitioners use of ICT and LMI; CPD-related issues (people tagging - systems and processes in organisations); working with clients at a distance; using mobile telephones and links to career guidance policies and practices.......and there's more to come!</p>

It would make more sense though if we shared our presentations somewhere that all attendees can access them so I've set up this cloud as that place.

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Opportunities of technologies for learning &ndash; but why have we not got real change and impact?</p>
<p>Not much evidence of a tangible gain in inclusion&hellip;&nbsp; Are we seeing real changes, dramatic changes in our students?&nbsp; Issue of conscious government neglect. Technological solutions cant be serious considered and wont work unless it occurs in an appropriate socio-cultural context. &nbsp;There is the question &ndash; how do we know its making a change? We need to rethink quality. Some of the design tools might be the solution but also wondered if they were new bottles for old wine? Morton&rsquo;s student profiling, useful but does it enhance learning? &nbsp;Still is a worthwhile innovation. Technological developments may serve a variety of needs not just enhancement for learning? What are our value positions as distance educators? We can use technologies in ways that are compatible with their value positions. We need to understand we have a value base and this is important.&nbsp; Our first commitment must always be to the values enterprise, we must not be beguiled by the technologies. Inspirational keynote by Sugata. Not what can be achieved by giving students computers, but releasing them from the constraints of formal education. Seeing learning in new ways. OERs: best idea that never worked. Who has used them? Transformative potential of OER coming out of Carnegie work, shift from teachers to learners? We have not prepared the ground for embedding OERs. Doesn&rsquo;t matter how good an idea is, if we don&rsquo;t prepare the ground for it, and support it.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Home groups: Reflections on the conference</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2365</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Reflections on the conference overall</p>
<p><strong>Group 1</strong></p>
<p>Used wordle to summary the discussions &ndash; emerging role of teachers, becoming facilitors, self-directed learning how re present questions how are the stories told and convincing others ROLE or SOLE?</p>
<p>Friends and learning partners find a friend learning partners, build community, cultural issues, privacy concerns, marketing potential, student success = e-learning partner?, how do you self-select</p>
<p>In or out of the clouds? Cloud and cloud like concepts, issues for developing countieis, course developers.learning technoologists, cloud like groups/tols or 3<sup>rd</sup> party tools reinvent or reuse, does it make a difference? Course retention, how do we measure if it makes a difference?</p>
<p>OER &ndash; are they really open and accessible, how far can you go in sharing, corporate copyright holders, need for IT skills, central access point/index &ndash; dewey?</p>
<p>Whole wordle &ndash; learning, role, technology, partner, stories, teachers.</p>
<p><strong>Group 2</strong></p>
<p>Keynote 1: Our group thought more ethnographic research is needed to look at peer group and also unscripted support and learning. Reflected a move away from teacher-centred to learner-centered</p>
<p>Keynote 2: transparency vs. privacy, also raises some management issues, also a cultural component which could be of great use</p>
<p>Keynote 3: Scalability as an issue for Cloudworks, does the number affect it, is it about&nbsp; Is design peripheral or central for a teacher more what makes for successful innovation. Is it about community at the overall level or sub-communities.</p>
<p>Keynote 4: Who does OER support more &ndash; teachers or learners? OER&rsquo;s as beneficial for developing countries.</p>
<p><strong>Group 3</strong></p>
<p>Different approach &ndash; looking at more of a thematic output. Keynote 1: was to do with the role of the teacher in the learning process, learning happens when students are given access to knowledge, keynote 2: more about the function of the role of the institution, communities of learning and how they relates to individual students motivation to learn &ndash; learning for work, or for its own sake. Keynote 3: impact &ndash; recognised they we don&rsquo;t have anyone in our own institution thinking about clouds &ndash; technologies in all sense of the word open doors that we may not even realise exist. Coming here enables us to share our experiences. Keynote 4: learning takes place when all sources of knowledge are available freely to students, we need to think about how to make this available to our students&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Group 4</strong></p>
<p>Five key issues</p>
<ol>
<li>Context: the issue of context kept remerging, cultural differentiation, gender issues, whatever we do, context is very important and we need to bear it in mind.</li>
<li>Invisibility of teachers and students &ndash; the group thought that the design process needs to be more open, there are also legal issues and privacy issues. </li>
<li>Critical thinking &ndash; recurrent problem, range of tools can be used, how do all these tools actually enhance learning, rather than just support it? It isn&rsquo;t just about &ldquo;googling&rdquo; things.</li>
<li>OER and access</li>
<li>Mobile learning &ndash; have huge potential for learning, can work anywhere anytime. How does it help students to actually learn? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Group 5</strong></p>
<p>Points relate to the experience of the conference, experience of awareness raising, exposure to a range of things, opportunity t think, reflect and inspiration. Valuable to be exposed to so many people from different countries. Sharing how things are at home. Exposure to new ways of using technologies. Experience of teaching through distance and the concept of openness, exposure to web 2.0 and beyond. Raised questions about technology and pedagogical issues? How will technologies improve pedagogy? Regard the tools as tools. Communities of learning are key. Exposure: related strongly to idea of examples of good practice. Struck by the innovations in the papers &ndash; the hole in the wall for example &ndash; an example of good pedagogy. New students are different to those from the past, the issues of pacing was raised. We need to rethink new mechanisms for retention. Gaps: maybe not enough emphasis on including the excluded. Inspiration &ndash; take back an awareness of the issues we hold dear as distance educators, the vision of distance providing access.</p>
<p><strong>Group 6</strong></p>
<p>Sugata: kids can be just as self-motivated as adults students, possibly</p>
<p>But were the learners orchestrated? Is there such a thing as a teacher? Are the kids autodidacts or is there a learning designer behind the hole in the wall&gt;</p>
<p>Freedom to learn, motivations, outcomes - can u test with adults</p>
<p>Morten &ndash; does more access and participation in online self-paced open enrolment, degrade quality of education, does more mean worse? Analysis still on going &ndash; need evidence</p>
<p>Learning is not a single, one-way passive activity, it is bi-</p>
<p>Grainne: neat, cute functional and efficient &ndash; why don&rsquo;t we use it? Why don&rsquo;t we make better use of the technologies &ndash; resistance &ndash; we don&rsquo;t have enough time, Mason &ndash; time is the new distances, distance &ndash; disadvantage social, economic or spatial Answer &ndash; Andrew Marvell &ndash; &ldquo;To his coy mistress&hellip;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->At the heart of the movement towards OER is the simple and powerful idea that the worlds knowledge is a public good and that technology in general and the wwweb in particular provide an opportunity for everyone to share, use and reuse it</p>

<p><strong>A personal perspective&hellip;</strong></p>
<p><em>Alberto Manguel</em></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Indistinct, majestic, ever-present the tacit architecture of that infinite library (of Alexandria) continues to haunt our dreams of universal order. Nothing like it has ever been achieved, through others libraries (the web included) have tried to copy its astonishing ambition.</p>
<p>The tower of Babel and the library of Alexandria stand as symbols of everything we are about.</p>
<p><strong>A UNESCO perspective</strong></p>
<p>Since wars being in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defence of peace must be constructed UNESCO</p>
<p>The aims associated with desire to build knowledge societies are ambitious. Providing basic education for all promoting lifelong education for all, encouraging the spread of research and development efforts in all countries&hellip;</p>
<p>Expenditure for education is one of the most productive investments that a country can make&hellip;</p>
<p>We are talking here about opening education</p>
<p><em>Sir Walter Perry (first VC of Open University) </em></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->..standards of teaching in conventional university was pretty deplorable, stuck me if you could use the media and devise course materials that would work for students all by themselves, then inevitably you are bound to affect for good the standard of teaching in conventional universities.</p>
<p><em>John Seely Brown</em></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->The web has just begun to have an impact on our lives. As fascinated as we are with it today, we&rsquo;re still seeing it in its early forms&hellip; My belief is that not only will the web be as fundamental to society as electrification but that it will be subject to many of the same diffusion and absorption dynamics as that earlier medium.</p>
<p><em>Sir John Daniel</em></p>
<p><em> </em>access, cost and quality &ndash; the iron triangle which has hindered the expansion of education, he argues that technology transcends this iron triangle.</p>
<p><strong>OER &ndash; a vision</strong></p>
<p><em>Brenda Gourley </em></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->The rise of the OER movement is one of the most exciting and indeed critical developments of our time</p>
<p>2002 group of academics met at UNESCO and were presented by early work by MIT, whereby they made their educational materials freely available. Term OER was coined then</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Open provision of educational resources enabled by ICT for consultation use and adaptation by a community of users for non-commercial purposes UNSECO, 2002</p>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2343</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This cloud summarises the discussions of the &ldquo;home group&rdquo; called &ldquo;the icelandic cloud&rdquo; at the Cambridge International Conference of Open and Distance Learning. The full cloudscape for the conference is available <a href="/cloudscape/view/1890">here</a>. The aim of the home groups is to enable participants to discuss in more depth issues that arise out of the keynote presentations.</p>
<p><em>Discussions after <a href="/cloud/view/2338">Sugata Mitra&rsquo;s keynote</a></em></p>
<p>One of the central discussion points of the group was around the issue of what is the role of face-to-face teaching versus online. Sugata&rsquo;s three characteristics particularly struck a cord with the group, in terms of factors to foster/support learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a safe place/environment for learning</li>
<li>Associate with play</li>
<li>Ensure that it is a non-structured environment</li>
</ul>
<p>We wondered how these factors could be applied in an adult learning context? One of the participants told us he had been an online tutor for 12 years and that he felt he know much more about his online students than face-to-face ones because of the level of interaction and dialogue.</p>
<p>The quality of the construction of the learning process online was raised as an issue &ndash; how should such spaces be constructed and supported?</p>
<p>There were different views in the group however in terms of the degree to which student actually want to collaborate and work with others. In particular, students who are in a work-based context often just want to focus on what it is that they need to do to get through and pass and they actively don&rsquo;t want to work with others. [Interesting this tied in nicely with Morton&rsquo;s statistics from his university where only 36% of students choose to take up the option of having a learning partner.</p>
<p>The group also discussed what were the different factors, which make an online learning context successful &ndash; such as the size of the group, the degree of moderation, the amount of structuring. Gender issues were also raised as an issue.</p>
<p><em>Discussions after <a href="/cloud/view/2340">Morton Paulsen&rsquo;s keynote</a></em></p>
<p>If students are all self-paced, how does the assessment actually work? What is the ratio of students to tutors? Maybe the solution is to have individualised, unique assignments. The partnership model and the flexible pacing are key features and will influence the design of the courses, activities and assignments. Partnership mode will foster better learning, through dialogue with another. Interesting that most of the students opted to work individually rather than with others. What was really striking was the amount of student control.</p>
<p>Many students learn very well in a structured, group project. &nbsp;Sometimes we have to realise that group learning is good for students even if they don&rsquo;t want to do it! Enables divergent rather than convergent learning and understanding. It&rsquo;s a challenge and there is an issue in terms of the balance.</p>
<p>In the Open University, New Zealand a lot of students get their own learning partners via the workplace. It was interesting in Paulen&rsquo;s statistic to see that only 36% of students wanted a learning partner. Is there a difference if you are at the beginning of your study or the opposite ie once you have more confidence you are willing to work with others. Likewise there are likely to be discipline differences, for example are Arts-based students more likely to want to work together and discuss than Science-based students? Also is there a gender difference?</p>
<p>We wondered what kind of tools the students studying with NKI have to support the learning partnerships?</p>
<p>The more freedom you give to the students, the more important the planning and structuring needs to be. Needs a complex, well balanced system to support this.</p>
<p>Asby&rsquo;s law &ndash; the more complex the situation, the more complex the structure needs to be. <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/REQVAR.HTML">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/REQVAR.HTML</a> The law of requisite variety</p>
<p>Motivation &ndash; how are the students motivated when they are working on their own.</p>
<p>Importance of continual encouragement via letters and emails &ndash; has a direct impact on retention.</p>
<p>One of the issues for institutions with a large number of modules is how do you coordinate it &ndash; for example ensuring you don&rsquo;t have all the assignment deadlines at the same time.</p>

              <title>Keynote: Paulsen - Visualizing student profiles through NKI’s online catalogue and student network</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2340</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2340</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Will live blog Morten's keynote here...</p>
<p>NKI is a non-state distance institution in Norway</p>
<p>Key focus for Morten is: How can we make online students more visible?</p>
<p><em>Background</em></p>
<ul>
<li>NKI Distance Education &ndash; one of Europe largest provides of online distance education, more than 110,000 enrolments since 1987</li>
<li>Broad range of subjects</li>
<li>About 400 courses, ca. 11,000 students in ca. 40 countries, ca. 70% women</li>
<li>Only self paced courses, start whenever they want, individual progress plans</li>
<li>Have a mixture of online and correspondence students</li>
<li>Cooperative online education allows students a lot of individual flexibility &ndash; can start and finish when they want but also access to a learning community &ndash; difficult to balance these two things &ndash; cooperative learning: learning in networks, similar to what we see in social networking</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Philosophy</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Individual freedom within a learning community in which online students serve as mutual resource without being dependent on each other.</li>
<li>Support individual freedom &ndash; can start whenever they like, they have tools to develop their individual progress plans, automatic tracking of turnaround time.</li>
<li>Also have tools to support learning communities, forum etc. Also a learning partner system so they can find a study buddy to work with and a global catalogue</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of innovations at NKI &ndash; started in 1986 &ndash; first Learning Management System through to individual learning system, continuous tracking and turnaround, learning partner system</p>
<p>Continuous turn around &ndash; average time is 2 days. Introduced in 2004, resulted in much discussion in the teachers&rsquo; online forum and a few voiced strong criticisms. But the average response rate dropped as a result of the introduction of the system. In 2008 introduced automatic e-mail reminded to tutors.</p>
<p><em>Individual planning system as voluntary option in 2004</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Makes it easier for student to reach their study goals, students can see individual progress and so can the tutors</li>
<li>In January 2009 started to email individual monthly progress reports to all students&nbsp; - contains contact information, LMS settings, progress report and planned progress. Intention is to send a personal, positive statement to every student, every month.</li>
<li>Have lists with information about next submission umber and planned submission dates make cooperation easier.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Boldic award 2006 &ndash; NKI&rsquo;s learning partner</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Innovative service for voluntary cooperation between students in a large online community.</li>
<li>Inspired by facebook, linked in etc</li>
<li>Consists of 4 steps. Make your personal presentation, decide who may access it, search for potential learning partners and invite someone to become your learning partner.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Global presentation</em></p>
<p>Their presentation has details about when they started, if they have learning partners, list of the courses they have enrolled on, etc. Encourage them to enter some more personal information about themselves, picture, interests, previous educational and work experience etc. They can choose whether or not to have a profile and the extent to which it is open or closed. 36% want a learning partner and 64% don&rsquo;t. Default is limited visibility and don&rsquo;t want a learning partner. Quite a number of the students prefer to work alone.</p>
<p>Google translation of global catalogue: http://<a href="http://www.nki.no/pp">www.nki.no/pp</a></p>
<p>Presentations show that online courses support individual needs and challenges &ndash; some key phrases from their presentations</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need flexibility to study&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of student with young children: &ldquo;When I got pregnant I found that it was easier to finish school via online courses&rdquo;</li>
<li>A range of learning challenges and illnesses: &ldquo;I have dyslexia&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits: like opportunity to share their experiences with other students, friends and family. Valuable also for the field of distance education. Distance students can tend to be quite invisible, this helps to make them more visible. Great ambassadors for NKI and information for new students, trustworthy testimonials. Presentations have resulted in more co-operations as they know each other better. Students also now know more about their students.</p>
<p><em>Transparency or privacy?<br /></em></p>
<p>What kind of information should be available? Transparency or privacy? Paulsen leans more towards transparency.</p>
<p>Risks: inappropriate content, copyright issues, criticisms from dissatisfied students, student who explore too much personal information. But on the whole have had few issues and problems. Paulsen believed transparency improves quality, error correction, preventive quality, learning quality. Also it promotes cooperation.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The antithesis experiment &ndash; towards a curriculum, pedagogy and technology for self regulated school education</strong></p>
<p><em>Sugata Mitra, University of Newcastle</em></p>
<p>Sugata outlined some of his work over the past decade or so and his vision of&nbsp; new education for children&hellip;</p>
<p>These are some live blogging notes from his keynote.</p>
<ul>
<li>There will always be people in the world who are willing to mediate in children&rsquo;s learning for say an hour a week with no remuneration. Therefore if we create clouds of mediators and children on the internet and an arrangement by which they can interact, potentially then we would have an alternative schooling.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In past three years Sugata and his team have created 12 Self Organised Learning Environments (SOLEs) in addition to the several hundred &lsquo;hole in the wall&rsquo; computers that exist in India, Cambodia and several African countries. There exists a cloud of mediators that have begun to interact with these SOLEs. The cloud is self-organised and called a Self Organised Mediation Environment (SOME). The mediator interact with the children over Skpe.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a paper describing this work in more detail, refer to (also linked above):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.academypublisher.com/jetwi/vol1/no1/jetwi01015559.pdf">http://www.academypublisher.com/jetwi/vol1/no1/jetwi01015559.pdf</a></p>
<p>He decided recently to come up with a new, bolder title for this keynote...</p>
<p><strong>New title for the talk: The future of learning</strong></p>
<p><em>Learning in the past</em></p>
<ul>
<li>1983 (around the start of the Int. Cambridge Conference) was 26 years ago, can we say that 26 years from now will be at least as different as 26 years ago/ So what was it like in 1983?&nbsp; IBM PC doesn&rsquo;t exist, windows doesn&rsquo;t exist, networking is an idea in labs, the internet doesn&rsquo;t exist. Computers in schools consisted of screens of text with children&rsquo;s answers questions &ndash; BBC micros, but little learning evident. Going back further to images of Victorian learning in the UK, presents an image of: no girls, aging male teacher (with a stick), with a blackboard, sadly you can still&nbsp; find examples of this in some parts of the world today. More generally, nowadays the blackboard has been replaced by a whiteboard and a smartboard, the teacher is typically a young women. What are the changes and where are we heading?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The origins of the hole in the wall experiment</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The hole in the wall experiment is now 10 years old. 1999 urban India big issue is the digital divide. What about poor children in rural India? Computer teachers are now necessarily good at computing! Ie if they are good they will go into industry. Government trained them, all the good ones leave and go into industries, the bad ones go into cities, the really bad ones go into rural areas &ndash; where they say computers are expensive and not for children. Hence the idea of the hole in the wall to bring computers to children &ndash; windows plus Internet, in a slum area. Assumed that it would be broken/stolen. Didn&rsquo;t happen, saw two children one showing the other how to browse. Passers by might have helped. Even with no one there to help they worked out how to use it, download, browse etc. The kids engaged with it and worked it out.&nbsp; Repeated the experiment &ndash; found kids learnt English so they could use the computer, adults would say you gave us a computer in a language I don&rsquo;t understand so I cant use it, whereas the kids learn how to and are more resourceful.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The first phase lasted about five years. Conclusions: </li>
</ul>
<blockquote><ol>
<li>groups of children can learn to use computers on their own irrespective of where they are (in India, Cambodia, 7 African countries, UK and Norway),</li>
<li>After 9 months &ndash; basic windows, chat, browse, download, play video, email, games and educational material &ndash; they do it because of adult management and administration, it&rsquo;s a self organising system, share the time, manage themselves, etc. ,</li>
<li>These effects can be achieved if you put the computer in a safe open area where the kids can explore and play on their own, away from adult supervision. It happens because of the absence of adults, </li>
<li>Cost is ca. 3 US cents per child per day &ndash; ca. 30 dollars per child over a three year period leading to an irreversible change.</li>
<li>Also distinct improvement in the kids&rsquo; schoolwork &ndash; English, Maths. Also a change in social values, improvement in school attendance, reduces school drop out rate and reduces petty crime. Generates local goodwill. </li>
</ol></blockquote>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Hyderabad experiment 2002: &ldquo;given the appropriate digital resources groups of kids can improve their English pronunciation by themselves&rdquo;. Poor city in Southern India with lots of small private schools trying to teach English. Teachers have a Southern Indian accent and so learn English with this. Used a speak to text engine, train the machine in your language and then you can dictate it and repeat it back and adapted the programme so that the kids could do this on their own, process of trial and error.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The BBC experiement in Varna in 2005. A village of kids who sing, and somehow they found the recording facility in windows and were able to record themselves. Phase2 can self organise to teach themselves, improve their skills and english, they don&rsquo;t need instruction.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What happens next? </em></p>
<p>Sugata has been at Newcastle for three years now. If this is all true, what is there that children cant learn on their own. Can Tamil speaking kids learn biotechnology in English on their own. Put hole in the wall in Kuppam in 2007, which was hit by the 2004 Asian Tsunami. Downloaded material on biotechnology and DNA replication.&nbsp; Came back after two months &ndash; 22 kids. Post test &ndash; 30%!!! It happened all because of a 12 year old girl. She phoned an uncle in Bombay &ndash; she asked him the meaning of the word DNA, he explaied&hellip; The real power of peer pressure&hellip; as a method of learning.</p>
<p><em>So now what?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The Gateshead experiment. All the kids have a laptop. Kids have the laptops but nothing is happening. Tool 32 10 year olds. Divide yourself into groups of 4 and then asked each group to do something. Usually 3 friends and a boffin. Every group of 4 can use only one computer, can talk within the group, switch between groups, look at others groups work and claim it as their won. Gave them 6 GCSE questions, best group did it in 20 minutes, 45 minutes for the worst group, everyone got everything right! Methods &ndash; google, wikipedia, copied answered them. Came back two months later and did the same test. 70% got 70% correct. Why? Think its because of the group of 4, one writes the answer down, others disagree, look at other sources, discuss the different answers etc. Peer collaboration and discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How far can we go?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The Longbention project. Group of 60 kids, what do you want to be when you grow up &ndash; foot ballers and fashion designers. The Longbention community project. Watched TED talk on Leonardi de Vinci. Organised into groups of 4. They go on the computer and research what they have just seen. Then made presentations and discussion. After about 8 &ndash; 10 sessions, would their aspirations of what they would like to be. TV only shows basic role models, internet expands their views. In India where there is a bigger divide between rich and poor kids have greater aspirations ironically. In UK where gap not so big they don&rsquo;t want to work that hard, aspire that high.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Latest work</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Now 13 SO<em>&nbsp;</em>LEs in operations in Hyderabad and Maharashtra. Have game shows with GCSE questions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Presence&nbsp; remote presence, Self Organisaed Mediation Environments &ndash; grandmothers who were willing to talk to kids over Skype. Got 200 grandmothers volunteered &ndash; one hour of their time free, most are retired English teachers. Fantastic resource. The teacher is available and kids can ask for help if they need it.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The future</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Subsidised broadband and electricity in all schools</li>
<li>Self organised fault tolerant technology</li>
<li>Self organised learning environments as part of the timetable</li>
<li>Clouds of mediators as part of faculty</li>
<li>A curriculum that is based on questions which has some meaning (kids ask the question &ndash; why am I doing this?)</li>
<li>A self-organised assessment system</li>
</ul>
<p><em>His vision....what might be possible with a little imagination and vision...<br /></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Schools of clouds &ndash; clouds of kids interacting with clouds of mediators driven by questions and a desires to know....</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->10 million retired teachers &ndash; one hour a week, 10 billion kids&hellip;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Bridging the gap between policy and practice: a reflective review and looking forward to the future Session: e-learning as policy for education.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Without a doubt e-learning is now truly embedded in all educational institutions; from the provision of an appropriate technological infrastructure to support teaching, research and administrative activities in the institutions through to the innovative use of technologies for learning. National and international policies in the area reflect this and are filled with rhetoric about the potential technologies offer for education &ndash; personalisation, flexibility, adaptively, lifelong learning and engaging authentic and immersive environment. However, closer inspection suggests that there is still a gap between the promises inherent in the policy rhetoric and actual use in practice. The talk will focus on a e-learning timeline, mapping the shifting directions of policy perspectives and their subsequent impact on practice. It will reflect on implications for the future.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some of the key questions for me are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the current e-learning policy drives/agenda?</li>
<li>To what extent is policy impact on practice?</li>
<li>How much are newer social and technological trends being reflected in e-learning policy? </li>
<li>How wide is the gap between policy and actual practice?</li>
<li>What interventions might be put in place to narrow the gap between policy and practice?</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This cloud has been set up for my keynote at <a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/r06/conference/">the Cambridge International Conference of Open and Distance Learning 2009</a> on 24th September 2009.This cloud can also be used as a discussion space around the themes and issues raised in the keynote.</p>
<p>The talk focuses on work we are undertaking as part of the<a href="http://ouldi.open.ac.uk"> OU Learning Design Initiative </a>and the Hewlett-funded <a href="http://olnet.org">Olnet initiative</a>. A key focus of our work is the development of tools, methods and approached to support the desing of innovative learning activities and Open Educational Resources (OER). The website provide further details on both initiatives and links to assocaited tools, resources and publications. For this keynote I want to focus in on one strand of our work; namely how to leverage technologies to promote bettter sharing and discussing of learning and teaching ideas and designs.</p>
<p>When asked what they would find most helpful to enable them to use technologies more in their teaching, most teachers say "give me examples, in my subject area" and "point me to relevant people I can discuss these issues with". Web 2.0 technologies - with their emphasis on sharing, networking, user production, seem to offer the solution. However uptake and use of web 2.0 sites such as Facebook, Ning, Flckr, and Twitter for educational purposes has to date being marginal.</p>
<p>Some of the key questions in relation to this work are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why have web 2.0 technologies not been taken up more extensively in learning and teaching?</li>
<li>What are the barriers to teachers sharing and discussing their learning and teaching ideas and designs?</li>
<li>How can social networking practices be harness and used in an educational context? </li>
</ul>
<p>Also see related clouds and ongoing discussions on these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/cloud/view/1919">How do we get people to share designs and ideas - is social media the answer?</a></li>
<li><a href="/cloud/view/1921">How do you foster the motivation for learning?</a></li>
<li><a href="/cloud/view/1935">What are the barriers for sharing ideas and designs of OER?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The talk will then outline the development of a social networking site for learning and teaching, <a href="//">cloudworks</a>; which is attempting to apply web 2.0 practices to support dialogue and sharing around learning and teaching ideas and designs.</p>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->There has never been a more exciting time for researchers interested in the place of media in people's lives. The growth of diverse online offerings and easy-to-use creative tools, coupled with the global economic downturn, has made traditional media and conventional broadcasters increasingly uncomfortable. Some critics are concerned about the future of 'quality' media for audiences to enjoy, but others celebrate this flourishing of non-elite, grassroots media.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[•    Reasons for using learning technologies, open and distance teaching universities and learning technologies, rhetoric on widening access and actuality, policy enablers and barriers, e-learning strategy for DCU www.dcu.ie/~foxs/<br />
•    Distance education to online programmes, use of LT in traditional HEIs, proposal that 2 modes are merging, will this happen???<br />
Three stage development<br />
•    Minimum/introductory: online information, etc<br />
•    Intermediate/contextual: some embedded activities<br />
•    Advanced/transformational: significant shift in pedagogical practice<br />
Rationales for adopting LTs<br />
o    Enhancing reputation <br />
o    Information skills/literacies<br />
o    Supporting disabled students<br />
o    eAssessment and plagiarism<br />
o    Improving quality of T&amp;L<br />
o    Increasing flexibility<br />
o    Widening access<br />
o    Reducing costs/improving cost effectiveness<br />
•    OBHE 2004 research – why use elearning? Enhancement of on-campus teaching came out as the most important factor, closely followed by enhancing on-campus flexibility; whereas Sloan – top reasons students from new geographical regions or new markets, and contribute to extension efforts<br />
•    Improving quality of T&amp;L: Abundant evidence – engagement, active learning, higher order skills, group skills/collaborative, etc; also learning outcomes but at a cost…<br />
•    Bates (2000) cost and learning technology; introduction of new technology is likely to lead to increase rather than reduce costs<br />
Widening access<br />
•    Extending access: educational disadvantaged, people with disabilities, under represented minorities, mature students/second chance<br />
•    Distance education – equity and access<br />
•    To provide a second change to HE for adults who do not wish to enter F/T education or who cant do so account of family and or work Ewing Report 1987<br />
Outside of Europe<br />
•    States – over 800 colleges offering at least one off campus UG programmes<br />
•    Almost 600 colleges offering at least one PG off campus programme<br />
•    Almost 4m student talking at least one full online course<br />
•    Australia – dual mode embedded?<br />
•    Canada – Athabasca and large providers<br />
•    Europe<br />
•    CEC 2006 aimed at best qualified students need to grasp the challenges presented by lifelong learning agenda<br />
•    Rhetoric: OECD 2006 – equity of access, lifelong learning, HEA strategic plan (2008), National Access Pan (2008), Smart Economy (2009) – flexible learning for up skilling<br />
Conclusion<br />
•    Mismatch between rhetoric and reality – socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor<br />
•    Funding mechanisms are undermining the policy rhetoric for widening access<br />

              <title>Opening doors to digital learning – open educational repositories for community discovery, sharing, reuse and activity</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1576</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1576</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[•    Irish - National Digital Learning Repository NDLR, HEA funded<br />
•    Idea is to pull things together for the Irish context<br />
•    Outline: shifting paradigms, OER, strategies for achieving development and access to OER<br />
•    Take a moment to review the following slide on use of new technologies – identify two methods or tools you might use in your current teaching, how many of the methods or tools have you not heard of, who is using the resources, what are they using them for?<br />
•    Tools include: clickers, 2P, SMS, RLOs, OER, CAA, CMS, VOIP, folksonomy, cloud computing, social bookmarking, twitter, open journals, elf, zoho, drupal, sakai, moodle, audacity, bubbl-us, grupthink, pbwiki, slideshare, vanilla, colloquia, screencasting, e-portfolios, web-trails, googlejockeying<br />
•    CoP: sharing, reuse, activities, aggregation, harvesting, support, knowledge sharing and transfer, modification, improvement, communal development<br />
•    Tools and services need to be user-centred: need to come into the users own space and be of benefit for their individual interests; there is no such thing as a central portal anymore<br />
Approaches<br />
•    Institutions trying to develop their own T&amp;L resources: Challenges – expense, critical mass, paucity of shared experiences, difficult to sustain<br />
•    A national repository of shared T&amp;L resources: larger scale, more opportunity to support multiple subject areas, potential for greater reuse and collaboration, raising the bar for teaching and learning as a collective<br />
•    An open digital repository: Much more scalable, high potential for CoP contribution and reuse, international licence agreements already in place (Creative Commons Licenses), protection against commercial exploitation, easier to set up infrastructure (access and authentication not a problem), CCLearn<br />
OER movement<br />
•    Huge number of resources now available, but its about sharing resources as the key to this, cutting down some of the barriers, Lou McGill JISC report on barriers to sharing resources, barriers are more social and cultural rather than technical and legal<br />
•    Example: Openlearn (UK), Edshare (Jessie Hays - Southampton), BC Campus (Canada), IRISS learning exchange (Ireland), MIT Open Courseware (USA)<br />

              <title>A consideration of learning activity: towards an activity-based approach</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1575</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1575</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[•    What’s good about e-learning? – don’t know the answer and don’t think the research is very clear about it<br />
•    About articulating our learning designs and implicit practice<br />
•    Dominance of the acquisition metaphor, content- driven perspective<br />
•    Confusion of the role of technology and digital tools play in learning: spectrum from enthusiasts in terms of using technologies and those who are phobic about it, don’t want to use the technologies. At both ends of the spectrum we need a more reflective approach<br />
What is activity theory?<br />
•    Engeström’s work Recording at CSALT 2002 video summarising CHAT. Explains what it is and how it is useful for understanding learning and in particular how it can be used wrt new technologies. A movement to have a more socially mediated cultural perspective of learning. Learning distributed between individuals, tools, resources and community. Expanding the unit of analysis for learning. Shift from some of the cognitive science perspectives of learning – information processing to socio-cultural perspective<br />
•    Card, Moran, and Newell (1983) The psychology of human-computer interaction, Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum GOMS lab-based work shift to an AT framework<br />
•    Nardi and others argued that we needed alternative theories to take account about the social dimensions of learning. <br />
•    Third generation AT: when 2 or more activity systems come into contract there may be contradictions and tensions. Can look at micro, meso and macro levels, Gay and Hembrooke, 2004 Activity-centre design an ecological approach to design smart tools<br />
•    Roth (2004) AT and education an introduction – mind, culture and activity 11(1), 1-8<br />
Case study 1 – using a VLE in large class teaching<br />
•    1st year U/G in Business, large groups of students, used AT to analyse the introduction of online activities and multimedia tutorials in the VLE within particular modules<br />
•    How do the technologies mediating the students in terms of achieving their objectives, used focus groups, think-aloud, contextual interviews, surveys, diary studies and observation<br />
•    VLE played a small part in their overall activities <br />
•    Nuances of students’ appropriation of the VLE and conceptualise this practice<br />
•    Online space – new shared object for students and teachers<br />
•    Identification of influential variables – time online, alignment of assessment, peer group, interactive tutorials integrated with course design VLE as one-to-many medium<br />
•    Tension emerged with new workload and assessment methods but student received more feedback than previously and lecturer could make course milestones more visible <br />
Case study – blogs for learning<br />
•    One to many relationship of the VLE, web 2.0 practice, was there a change did it help facilitate the students in a different way<br />
•    2nd yr u/g occupational therapy students on clinical placement, fieldwork activities with professional therapists in a range of setting, use of blog<br />
•    Interested in roles and division of labour, tutor led, but want students to critically reflect on their practice, blogs allowed a new dimension of social support<br />
•    Changes in role of students – participative mediated through the use of blogs, Visibility of activities of members, tensions emerged compulsory nature of the task <br />
Value of adopting an AT approach<br />
•    AT useful for design, implementation and evaluation of technology, provides a basis for dialogue of context and role awareness, provides a roadmap detailing opportunities to integrate research findings on a theoretical empirical and practical level, recognised the multi-dependent variables at play at multiple levels<br />
•    Challenges: not explicit in how to investigate the mediating role of technologies (methods and interpretation of data), difficult to generalise findings  across contexts<br />
•    Roth 2004 AT as a dynamic system – transformational potential, agency of AT, a means of changing the current systems and processes, expose the current status quo to a critical gauze, there is potential for change<br />
•    The shared challenge: understanding the mediating potential or application of new technology can be challenging; we aren’t walking up the hill alone, lets help each other up the hill. <br />

              <description><![CDATA[•    Lighting your workload despite continuous assessment<br />
•    Don’t be lead by the technology, use it in a way that is meaningful for you<br />
•    Important to integrate the technology, rather than bolt it on<br />
•    Dual paradigms: technologies with amazing affordances but a teacher approach which is outdated and teacher-focused<br />
•    Why bother investing the time? Marking loads of assessments, tired of handling loads of lab books and scripts, facilitate more group work with less administration, means of providing individual feedback <br />
•    Teaching – continuous assessment, what’s so good about VLEs, types of assignment, online quizzes, quiz strategies, managing your grading. The SIF project: portal, increasing capacity<br />
•    Online quizzes: quizzes, websites, glossaries, discussion<br />
•    Offline: quiz, lab notebook, in class assessment, presentations<br />
•    Examples: Revision after each topic, lab work, continuous assessment, allocating choice of activity or groups, online quizzes, effective strategies, student information<br />

              <title>Tensions between e-learning innovation and institutional quality control: can we square the circle?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1573</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1573</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[Maggie McPherson from the University of Leeds did the opening keynote for a symposium as part of the Institute for the study of knowledge in society.<br />
•    Adopting a holistic approach to e-learning. <br />
•    Need to step back and think about what is underpinning everything.<br />
•    How can define and conceptualise learning?<br />
•    What are the components?<br />
•    Where is e-learning in this<br />
•    Can we measure the quality of e-learning?<br />
•    Learning – Claxto (1996) – adult learning is profoundly influence by implicit theories of learning acquired at school; teachers tend to reproduce their implicit models in the ways in which they themselves go on to teach<br />
•    Atherton, J.S. (2005) Learning and teaching – what is learning? http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/whatleare.htm<br />
•    Three overlapping circles – what is taught but not learnt – wasted effort, what is both taught and learnt and what is learned but not taught – for better or for worse.<br />
•    What is taught is not the same as what the students learnt – Atherton, 2005; therefore perhaps before thinking about teaching quality we should first consider what education is for.<br />
•    Perkins (1992) three goals<br />
•    Retention of knowledge<br />
•    Understanding of knowledge<br />
•    Active use of knowledge<br />
•    Confucius – I hear I forget, I see I remember, I do I understand<br />
•    Glasser – We learn 10% read, 10% hear, 30% see 50% we see and hear 70% discuss 80 experience 95&amp; what we teach others<br />
•    Before we teacher we need to remember there are also pre-conditions: Maslow’s hierarchy of needs + Glasser’s choice theory<br />
•    Physiological needs (survival), safety (belonging/connecting), love/belonging (power/significance), esteem (freedom/responsibility) self-actualisation (fun/learning)<br />
•    To design a more effective learning experience perhaps we should think of learning in new ways – move from teacher knows best model that replicates how we were taught, ditch content is king, thin about adopting strategies that encourage curiosity, create environments tat enable discovery.<br />
•    So why e-learning? Is it about the technologies? Handheld devices, virtual worlds, etc. Can they help engender curiosity, but we have to think also about technological determinism. <br />
•    We build a building but then the building shapes us, it constrains our actions, the same is true of learning environments using technologies. But with e-learning we can’t see the walls.<br />
•    Benefits of e-learning: new forms of communication, access to previously inaccessible information, connects people in new ways, allows individuals/groups that previously had little or no opportunity to connect.<br />
•    There are claims that e-learning is able to enhance teaching quality by enabling opportunities to create learning that is: individualised, adaptive, active, ubiquitous, contextualised, experiential (BECTA); but in reality we are only at the beginning of understanding how technologies can support these kind of practices<br />
•    Elesig.ning.com useful community exploring how students are using technologies. <br />
•    Where is your own “added value” to be?<br />
•    Increasing active participation in learning<br />
•    Providing ore personalised learning<br />
•    Making available previously inaccessible materials<br />
•    Connecting previously unconnected learners<br />
•    Overcoming barriers to learning<br />
•    Assisting diverse learners to achieve their potentials<br />
•    Preparing students for employment<br />
•    Offering more timely learning opportunities <br />
•    What do students actually want – many students are increasingly familiar with interactive technologies and increasingly want to be in control of their own learning; they don’t want to be talked at – they want to be co-creators and be part of the cast; HE needs systems that allow a shared authority – this not only needs a change of culture in teaching, learning and assessment but a change in traditional quality control as well. <br />
•    Can we really measure the quality of e-learning? What is quality and who’s asking?<br />
•    Kirkpatrick 94: reaction/learning/application of learning/return on investement<br />
•    Arboug 2001 – pedagogical issues/quality of materials<br />
•    Zhao 2003 – course effectiveness/access – infrastructure/student satisfaction/academic satisfaction<br />
•    Kistan 2004 – fit for purpose/value for money<br />
•    Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance – Pirsig, 1976 quote – the philosophy of quality “You know what it is, yet you don’t know what it is”.<br />
•    In terms of HE, quality of learning could be defined in a number of ways when considered from perspective of multiple stakeholders so it matters who is asking! Students, academic, institutions, learning and teaching committees, quality assurance agencies.<br />
•    And when you add e-learning into the mix, you also have to consider the following<br />
•    Technology developers, institutional accountants, learning designers, support staff (such as librarians), tax payers, parents, employers, government funding bodies, educational ICT agencies<br />
•    Moreover there are real differences in perspective that need to be considered – lure of e-learning might be its potential to solve problems by better connecting students and tutors to admin through VLE, yet students like the liberated connectivity afforded by social software and technology that promised to dilute that supremacy just wont satisfy the most technically adept.<br />
•    UK QAA is very administrative – focus on audit trails<br />
•    We need to build evaluation into the fabric of learning and teaching to find out what is really happening.<br />
•    Purpose – determine or fix something, examine and judge standards, reflect on objectives, decide the worth or merit of something.<br />
•    Evaluation: What is our pedagogical design? How does it feed into course design, How do we evaluate the relationship between the two?<br />
•    Pedagogical effectiveness + course content + tutor support + learning outcomes<br />
•    McPherson and Nunes 2004 EMAR model: Action Planning (philosophy, learning models, ped stategy, ped tactics), Action Taking (Course environment, tasks, learning activities, learning outcomes), Action Evaluation (Evaluation of course and programme)<br />
•    Learning theories website: http:carbon.cudenver.edu/~mryder/itc_data/idmodels.html/#constructivism<br />
•    Types of evaluation Barnhardt, Bruce and Rubin 1993 Electronic quills: a situated evaluation of using computers for writing in classrooms, designing evaluations. Three types of formative, summative and situated. Aspects: focus, audience, purpose, variability of setting, measurement tools, time of assessment, results<br />
•    Checkland (1970s) Systems thinking and real world: Become familiar with the problem, express in a rich picture, create some root definitions, create conceptual models, compare rich pictures and models, discuss feasible/practicable changes, implement change. Can be used as a framework for carrying out evaluation. <br />
•    Cabrera and Trochim, 2006 The dynamic between the components of a theory of systems evaluation: Boundary critique, cycles, perspectives, scales, phases, etc. Can convert these mental models into methodological models. Leads to a systems evaluation matrix.<br />
•    Need to think of pedagogical and ICT as the building blocks for knowledge: Analogy: DNA + building blocks of life.<br />
•    Need to think of new ways to think about learning and learning design. The tools we have available enable us but also constrain us. Learning can be as individual as DNA – have in the mix tutor, content, resources and tools, environment, culture, background, personal preferences, etc…<br />

<b>Articulating the layers: <br />
</b>Module and sessions: simple session (class), module of 12 lectures, but also compound session (lecture plus labs)<br />
Session and learning activity – base-level learning activity, LAMS tools for orchestration of sequences of activities<br />
Where does dialogue based learning fit into this? At the compound level? 
</p>
<p>
Basis of any dialogue is exchange – question, answer, feedback as a base interaction

	<li>Extrinsic design – educational meaning</li>
	<li>In a teaching context are working within a designed context – the space has been designed, the books have been designed, the tools the students use – many of these artefacts were not explicitly designed for an educational context</li>
	<li>Move to intrinsic design – through the digital environment , can take more control of the design you are using than we could in the past</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Why design for learning?<br />
</b>Design 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is intentional purposeful approach to learning (of others)</li>
	<li>Represents intention so that it can be communicated and acted on in new contexts</li>
	<li>Supports structure or scaffolds actions</li>
	<li>Relies on general principles or rules of thumb but leaves room for contingent responses</li>
	<li>Is a skilful reflective evidence-based practice</li>
</ul>
<p>
Pedagogic intention can be articulated and enacted with the support of technology<br />
These articulations can be shared with other people and systems involved in the learning process<br />
•    The people are adopting new roles<br />
•    The systems are likely to be digital<br />
•    The learning process takes place in a TEL context
</p>
<p>
Communicating educational meaning through design<br />
Designer with a design intention who designed something – a mediating object which is delivered to a learner<br />
•    OpenContent, OpenCourseware, OpenLearn<br />
•    RLOs, GLOs, widgets<br />
•    IMS Learning Design, TENCompetence, ReCourse
</p>
<p>
But in reality this design is usually mediated by some other person, different kinds of representation might be needed for this level<br />
•    Communities of practice, Community tools, rules/protocols<br />
•    Ontologies, folksonomies, taxonomies<br />
•    Patterns and patter languages
</p>
<p>
Existing design practice is very varies<br />
Tools are rarely experienced by practitioners as pedagogically neutral
</p>
<p>
Design tools must enable collaborative design<br />
Tensions – diff levels of design, design for learning/design for teaching, representation, structure/flexibility of designs, aggregation/orchestration approaches and tools, the role of face to face interaction<br />
Orchestrating technologies – VLEs etc course or module as base unit, focus on purposes of the designer/institution. Top-down management<br />
But there has been a shift in recent years towards aggregating technologies<br />
Aggregating technologies – feeds, aggregators, drawing on web services, RLOs, widgets and applets, small scale learning outcomes, object or activity as base unit, focus on needs of user, modularity, reusability and interoperability, self-organising systems<br />
•    Old educational users – user requirements, text book ets tv, curriculum,<br />
•    Users 2.0 – agile development – tell us what you want today, searchers, wikis, youtube etc learners are doing the designing<br />
<br />
<b>Liz Masterman and Marion Manton<br />
</b>Pedagogy theory and pedagogic planning in digital worlds<br />
•    What is the value of theory to teachers?<br />
•    Pedagogical planners<br />
•    What do we mean by theory?<br />
•    How has theory has been embedded into three areas?<br />
(Lawes, 2004) Theory gives a framework of understanding that ultimately improves the quality of practice and leads to the transformation of subjective experience
</p>
<p>
Theory can provide a glue between technology and practice<br />
Teachers need help with using technology; the Trojan mouse effect (Sharpe and Oliver 2007). Planner tools can help with this providing advice and guidance about going about the design process<br />
How might we use theory in these planners?<br />
•    Theories – Cook, 2002 a means of understanding and predicting explanatory power<br />
•    Models – such as Kolb’s leaning cycle <br />
•    Frameworks – such as Laurillard’s Conversational 
</p>
<p>
Framework: a structure and vocabulary that support concepts<br />
What theories? Whole load of them –range of names, don’t correspond to each other<br />
What power do we endow their theories – strongly directly or just for device<br />
Comparison of three pedagogical planner tools – DialogPlus, phoebe, LPP<br />
•    DialogPlus – followed Mayes and De Freita classification of learning theories – associative, cognitive and situative. Learning outcomes related to Blooms and linked to tool type Laurillard. Provided context sensitive guidance for creation of learning activities<br />
•    Phoebe – context-sensitive guidance’s planning tool alongside a guidance tool provides just general guidance<br />
•    LPP Distilled theories and principles based on conversational framework
</p>
<p>
Practitioner’s responses to using these tools <br />
•    Many see theory as a cornerstone of professional practice<br />
•    But do teachers consciously espouse formal theories or are they more driven by prior experience and reflective practice?<br />
•    Distinction between theories of learning and e-learning is contentious<br />
•    Volume of explicitly material on theory on Pheobe could be daunting particularly for novice teachers<br />
New work in the TLRP TEL LDSE project<br />
•    Aim is to assemble a web-based environment for teachers – will be researching and trialling a number of tools<br />
•    Theories – Bloom’s taxonomy, Briggs CA, Laurillard CF and Kolb’s learning cycle<br />
•    Show uses how different models result in different kinds of learning experience<br />
•    Challenges – how do we deal with intuitive theories based on reflective practice, local institutional models, what kind of pedagogy model underpins the tool – need to shift from ‘present, practise, produce’ towards. ‘activate, engage, contribute’<br />

	<li>What is the role of methodology and theory in pattern mining in learning communities?</li>
	<li>Are there universal patterns supporting the design of international learning communities? If nt how can a pattern capture the success of a solution but also report on limitations across learning contexts?</li>

</ul>
<p>
What’s different/similar?<br />
Case 1 design solutions in agreement with all team members<br />
Case 2 elf-directed learning in international teams<br />
Why learning? Identifying values is important to design pattern mining<br />
Context in which patterns are valid: limitation and strength of a pattern<br />
Pattern mining is really a design process – ill-defined, wicked, value driven, synergetic – design pattern is like a designed product or system – problem-solutions co-evolution first idea/insight<br />
Misuse/adaptation to new context – new design pattern?<br />
Internationally and generally valid patters possible.<br />

<b>Do you believe in patterns? Christian Kohls and Till Schummer<br />
</b>Challenges in pattern mining<br />
1.    mining methods<br />
2.    agreement on findings<br />
3.    confidence level<br />
4.    usefulness
</p>
<p>
Online training support – applying a set of patterns to support this<br />
1.    Rehearsal: test run of the online training session<br />
2.    Invisible co-host – never do a training alone, second person assists and can answer questions, provides links, observation<br />
3.    Prepared examples – demonstrating some software use of good examples to illustrate the use, use examples that are real and meaningful
</p>
<p>
Challenges in pattern mining<br />
1.    Hard to get to patterns, partly because they are very volatile, when is the start and finish of a seminar? 
</p>
<p>
Methods<br />
Inductive approaches – personal retrospectivon – individual contributions, sociological interviewing others, mining workshops – community contributions, artifactual observe and analyse Kerth and Cunningham, 1997; DeLano <br />
Deductive approaches – by pure argument – derive new patterns, experimental – testing existing patterns 
</p>
<p>
Agreement on findings<br />
Pattern in the real world, recurrent structure – eg the essence of online trainings <br />
Might be too abstract ie describing an online training only in terms of that applies to all web events, incomplete – eg describing an online training but leaving out some essential elements<br />
Agreement on the form <br />
Agreement on function<br />
Agreement on aesthetics<br />
Subjective vs. objective knowledge across these three things
</p>
<p>
Confidence <br />
This could be a solution but its never been tested, if used once a little more confident, a re-test design – maybe just coincidence, a recurrent design – pattern
</p>
<p>
Usefulness<br />
Interesting design patters; design patterns; general patters<br />
Till Schummer – Different perspectives for the pattern scout<br />
Pattern language for supervising PhD students<br />
Patterns as a tool for organisational learning<br />
What is the role of values for the creation/use/whatever of educational design patterns in education/design/whatever?
</p>
<p>
What is design – Mok create meaningful connections among people, ideas at technology shaping the way people understand their relationships with new products<br />
CoxL design is what links creativity and innovation. It shapes ideas to become practical and attractive propositions for users and customers<br />
Crawlue – making sense of how people live and behave, and drawing insights from the observations has always been at the heart of what the best designers do<br />
Design – align up to then conflicting values and features of the wolrd<br />
Challenge 1: We can only understand the conflict by closely looking at the forces and the context – Heidegger – all requirements are situated – you can only understand a design situation when you are in the situation<br />
Challenge 2: All requirements are related. Alexander – interpret the world as a system of connected forces./values/requirements<br />
Challenge 3: Whenever we improve a system we change the network of interacting forces/values Rittel and Webber – wicked problems, Schon: reflection in action
</p>
<p>
An example pattern – student managed schedule<br />
Context – supervisor and student agree topic, student starts<br />
Problem – force students are independently managing their time, counterforce they aren’t good at doing it.<br />
Additional forces – discrepancy bet plan and reality, p<br />
Values: establishing trust, embrace failure, embrace change etc<br />
Solutions – social – student creates schedule etc<br />
Related to design-based research – design interventions and test them in our teaching
</p>
<p>
Summary<br />
Pattern writing helps to reflect on values and forces<br />
Patterns for Pattern Scouts help in the analysis process<br />
Patterns can be descriptive, visionary, both<br />
Validation still required but not trivial – how to validate design, how to validate creativity
</p>
<p>
<b>Cognitive learning efficiency through the use of design patterns in teaching Gwen Kolfschoten et al<br />
</b>Can we find evidence for the effect of design patterns in learning, beyond direct efficiency?<br />
Cognitve load theory – working memory and long-term memory information storage in schemas, automation of schemas, chunking information you can store more in your working memory<br />
Experts vs. novices – larger schema, automated schema, better classified and more accessible schema schema are inter-related based on solution principle than domain, pattern recognition
</p>
<p>
Proposition<br />
Design patterns constitute design efficiency for novices<br />
Design patterns do not constitute design efficiency for experts<br />
The use of design patterns in learning to design will increase the quality of schema build in memory and this improve quality and efficiency of learning the domain and the possibilities with respect to design
</p>
<p>
<br />
<b>Conclusions</b>
</p>
<p>
Design patterns are efficient in design; are only useful when no other schema are constructed yet (novice) experts first need to build new schema to be able to use them effectively, the structure of the patterns offers a basis for building higher quality schema than a generic bottom up learnin<br />

Outlined some of her research background 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Original worked with Ben de Boulay<br />
	O’Shea, Scanlon and O’Malley work on mediated eye contact and its role in establishing collaboration in solving problems of running in the rain, successful collaboration being evidente in discourse patterns (eg finishing each others sentences)</li>
	<li>Mobile learning 0 Sharples, Vavoula, McAndrews conversational processes of becoming informed about each others practice</li>
</ul>
<p>
Used the analogy of the emergence of the paperback bok as an example of technology innovation
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Paperback book as a technology</li>
	<li>Changed size, access, costs what didn’t device functionality, skills caused a revolution in public reading habit</li>
	<li>Ubiquity – everyone has a connection</li>
	<li>Ambience – everyeone carries a connection</li>
	<li>Flow</li>
	<li>Connection</li>
	<li>Semantic web, The grid – massive amount of power, ubiquity – devices permantely available, </li>
	<li>Implications – the compliant learner is long dead , but what if the client wants something that doesn’t support learning?, what if the context of learning is disturbed transient or fleeting?</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Learning context of the future<br />
</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Increased network coverage, non—compliant learners, networks that understand data, that can reconfigure and repair themselves, return of the intelligent machine???</li>
	<li>Are we good at guiding teachnology development for learning? </li>
	<li>Computers as participants in a more cybernetic perspective –what would a framework for telling a computer what to do would look like</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>A theory of mobile learning</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The process of coming to know across diff contexts</li>
	<li>Conversation is the driving process of learning  it is the means by which we negotiate differences, understand each others experiences and form transiently stable interpretations</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Conversation and context <br />
</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pask’s 1976 conversation theory, Laurillard, 2002</li>
	<li>Vygitskian views of intrasubjectivity and intersubjectivity</li>
	<li>Engestrom’s extended activity theory frameowkr</li>
	<li>Subject – learner, obkect – knowledge ad sils</li>
	<li>Contolr –social rules, context – community, communication  conversation and division of labour, signs – learningresources</li>
	<li>Take two different views of the same situation – from the learner perspective (semiotic layer) and the technological perspective (tool view)</li>
	<li>Continual dynamic between the semiotic and technological </li>
	<li>Dialectical process of appropriation can be mapped – Waycott 2004</li>
	<li>Creation of meaning is in the exchange between participants in the conversation </li>
	<li>Continual co-evolution of tools and users</li>
</ul>
<p>
Grand challenge for computing research in learning for life<br />
We need more comprehensive theories of learning in the digital world
</p>
<p>
We need interdisciplinary effort<br />
Need to understand more how technologies and users co-evolve<br />
A society which is mobile which is full of channels for the distribution of a change occurring anywhere, must see to it that its members are educated to personal initiative and adaptability. Otherwise, they will be overwhelmed by the changes in which they are caught and whose significance or connections they do not perceive. <br />

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
Angela reflected on some of the rhetoric around the knowledge society. She considered two inter-related aspects:<br />
•    Implications of employability<br />
•    Implications for education? 
</p>
<p>
She drew on work from Voogt and Pelgrum (2005) pedagogy in knowledge-based society.
</p>
<p>
<br />
She argued there is a change from pedagogy in an industrial society to pedagogy in the information society. 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Active learners (from activities prescribed by teacher to determined by the learner),</li>
	<li>Collaborative (individual to working in teams), </li>
	<li>Creative (reproductive learning to productive learning), </li>
	<li>Integrative (no link bet theory and practice to integrative approach),</li>
	<li>Evaluative (teacher-directed and summative to student-directed and diagnostic)</li>
</ol>
<p>
Potential of digital technologies to support learning show three powerful trends:<br />
1.    Interaction of people and technologies<br />
2.    Production (iteration?)<br />
3.    Feedback and play
</p>
<p>
From some of her research studies Angela summarised the following in terms of kids use of PDAs.
</p>
<p>
<i>High users<br />
</i>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Relish and enjoy use of the PDA, are proud of owning a PDA</li>
	<li>Are confident and active in developing their skills using the device</li>
	<li>Appreciate the potential of the device and seek to use it</li>
	<li>Explore what the device can do</li>
</ul>
<p>
<i>Low users</i>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Have basic level of skill and understanding of the PDA,</li>
	<li>Not pro-active, are happy to be dependent on others, </li>
	<li>Have inaccurate perceptions about provision, systems and what the PDA can do, </li>
	<li>Have little exposure to use in the classrom</li>
</ul>
<p>

              <title>Dominant discourses in TEL</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1279</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1279</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<ul>
	<li>Radical redesign of education is needed.</li>
	<li>TEL has been around for over 30 years now so why hasn’t it had a more profound impact</li>
</ul>
<p>
The stories we use have an impact on what we do and how we view the world – two dominant narratives – transformation and modernisation
</p>
<ol>
	<li>1.    Transformation – world changing radically, need to capitalise on the potential of technologies – individuals such as Gee, Hepell, Papert – research inspiration – work based, game based, informal learning. But critiques argue that how can we generalise from small/non-scalable examples, values aligned seen as aligned with economics rather than well being, the change everything argument doesn’t help with knowing what to do on Monday, an outsider discourse to education.</li>
	<li>2.    Modernisation. Alternative is the modernisation discourse– Trojan mouse – new technologies powerful, but they can be harnessed, once we have everyone on board then we can look to transformation, educationalists tend to be the leaders of this approach. Critiques argue – it tends not to take account of the new models of education outside the formal context, focus on pedagogy and systems rather than curriculum as such inherently protective of status quo, might be building barriers to more substantial change as it reinforces existing practice.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If we start with a different narrative what would that mean? Expert professional capable of significant reflection, digital natives. Start to see the schools as the drivers of change rather than the recipients of change, so researchers role becomes one of empowerment. Researchers – empowering educators to critique and innovate. Responsive problem solving around specific issues, supporting reflection and knowledge sharing across diff sites.<br />

Part of <a href="/node/1271">Keri Facer's symposium</a> at CAL 09 on the Beyond current horizon's project. 
</p>
<p>
Looking at public and stakeholder engagement – large list from learners, teachers, parents, policy makers, employers, etc<br />
Importance of agency – multiple actors – ability to act in and on the world within multiple possible futures
</p>
<p>
Wider perspectives and insight – informed participation to increase insight and perspectives within VBCH
</p>
<p>
Futurelab approach – voice, participation, co-design/co-development
</p>
<p>
<br />
Growing engagement agenda – civic participation, active citizenship etc<br />
<br />
<b>Three principles<br />
</b>1.    Deliberative engagement <br />
2.    Normative/typical engagement<br />
3.    Communications/dissemination
</p>
<p>
<b>Approaches used<br />
</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Millionfutures.org.uk , 1539 entries from 100 different counties</li>
	<li>Series of questions about the future, including what are your hopes for the future, what do you want your community to be like, what are your biggest worries – etcPowerleague.org.uk How to educate league, what education for league</li>
	<li>Citizen panel – 10 questions sent to 1100 members of the public, 513 respondents</li>
	<li>Citizen council – senior reps from organisation set up to work for particular groups within society 1. Current values of education, 2. Prioritising emerging evidence from the 5 challenges, 3. Future aims of education.</li>
	<li>Stakeholder workshop and interviews with a wide range of participants</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Thinking critically about the future<br />
</b>1.    Questioning assumptions – expectation that things will remain/change<br />
2.    Qualifying conversations of the future with examples from the present<br />
3.    Frames of reference
</p>
<p>
Futures thinking provides an opportunity to be critical of current educational policy/practice<br />
Digital technology in education is still very contested – range of responses, from vital for future of education to concerns of technology overload and dehumanisation of education, emerging technologies were not mentioned at all<br />
A lot of the questions were about the values of education<br />

Discussion around the findings from the Futurelab <a href="http://www.beyondcurrenthorizons.org.uk/">'Beyond current horizons' (BCH)</a> programme.  
</p>
<p>
Exploring socio-technical change in the future through a broad range of future scenarios
</p>
<p>
Three main foci<br />
1.    Orientation towards the future<br />
2.    Orientation towards the technology<br />
3.    Orientation towards education
</p>
<p>
Adopted the foresight plus method<br />
Commission over 60 reviews, 15 events
</p>
<p>
Some of the outputs from the project are available from the <a href="http://www.beyondcurrenthorizons.org.uk/findings/research-challenges/longlist-challenge-papers/">Beyond current horizon's website </a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.beyondcurrenthorizons.org.uk/programme/research-challenges/">5 areas</a> of interest: 
</p>
<p>
1.    Lifecourse and developments, <br />
2.    Citizenship, identities and communities, <br />
3.    Knowledge, creativity and communication, <br />
4.    Working and employment, <br />
5.    Public/private/third sector
</p>
<p>
Brennan 2006 – unless we believe that education can contribute in some way to a different future for the society as much as for individuals – then the prophet of education is already a false once
</p>
<p>
Often visioning for the future is often technologically determinist and rhetorical – Glough, 1990
</p>
<p>
<b>Richard Sandford - Future studies<br />
</b>
</p>
<p>
Talked about some of the methodolical approaches adopted. 
</p>
<p>
Sources of futre thinking:
</p>
<p>
Government – UK foresight, <br />
Academics – Wells, Bell, Slaughter, Inaytullah
</p>
<p>
Thinking about the future in a structured way<br />
Modelling – useful for making causal links and alternative directions visible, quality of data and accuracy of causal relationships crucial, many approaches include morphological analysis – www.swemorph.com, systems dynamics and causal loop diagrams, gaming (from Nash, not Warcraft)
</p>
<p>
<b>Carey Jewitt – investigating possible futures for education<br />
</b>Wide range of topic areas, 20 reviews commissioned, 1 consultative event<br />
<a href="http://www.beyondcurrenthorizons.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/bch_challenge_paper_democracies_carey_jewitt2.pdf">Report</a> 
</p>
<p>
Approach – finding productive starting points, untangling technologies, practices and purposes, interrupting and unsettling narratives, disrupting binaries, what it – making new connections<br />
<br />
Three review topics  - participation and networks, mobile personalised and portable, forms of literacy
</p>
<p>
Across these a range of cross-cutting themes emerged – such as authorship and ownership, production of knowledge, the nature of collaboration, changing practices, accessing information, networking, customizing, diversity of locations, changing learning cycles. What are the implications of these for education – changing goals, roles etc. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Challenges<br />
</i>Role of evidence, role of imagination, avoiding binary oppositions, sameness as default, engaging with change, holding uncertainty, factoring in a world we might not want, where to place technology, prioritizing, simplifying complexity.<br />

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
Dave focused on findings from a Future lab Project – ‘Beyond current horizons’. He was involved in a working group with Claire O’Malley and Josie Taylor. 
</p>
<p>
Their work focused on identifying future trends in particular developments in computing bioscience and maths that might interact with social science in the next 15 years.
</p>
<p>
Three way interaction triangle: 1) focus of research in the labs, 2) Societal demands and 3) policy makers<br />
Dave then moved on to outline 8 trends that are likely to have a profound impact on society. He presented a vision of the near future that was fantastical, science fiction in real life.
</p>
<p>
<b>8 social trends</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>1.    Moore’s Law, 1968, logarithmic scale, relative cost per unit, cost of computing halves once every two years. </li>
	<li>2.    Sixe of computers have continued to decrease  - from mainframes, to mini-computers, to PCs, to laptops, distributed LANS, the internet, etc. Once every ten years there has been a major shift in the computing industry. The next big thing is Data-center computing. blade servers – a laptop with no cloth on – a mother board and memory, can fit 50 machines in something the size of a wardrobe. 200, 000 machines in a shed. On the demand computing, utility computer, sun N-1. Utilise these computers together. On demand – real time English speech to text to Japanese – allocates a set of computers to the call. Economies of scale can the economics of doing high speed computing – everyone has access to this, like a utility – pay for duration of use. Doesn’t cost that much money, based on the marginal cost of the computing. Cloud computing data centers. Google took the patent for Sun– they have now built five or six of these data centers. The big switch – Nicholas Carr. Move to centralised remotely accessed data centers. The world will have access to high performance computing at virtual zero cost. The computers out there in the cloud. Animoto – founded by five people, upload photos plus some music. The animoto software produces a video of this in time to the music. They rented space on amazon. Were using ca. 50 blade servers a day, then suddenly up to 3750 in three working days. Signing up 25000 new customers an hour. Ubiquitous amorphous computation. A memory device about the size of a grain of rise with a built in antenna, could be embedded ina sheet of paper, 10 megabits per second data transit rate – 10 times faster than Bluetooth, storage capacity range 256kbits to 4mbits could store a very short video clip, several images or dozes of pages of text. Computer devices in every type of artefacts</li>
	<li>3.    Next really small thing – Quantum Computing . Moore’s law is about it hit a brick wall by 2012 printed circuitry will be so small that quantum mechanical phenomena will begin to interface with desired properties. STM image shows chemically self assembled nanowires that are just 2 nanometers (ie 6 atoms) wide. The human brain amazing from an engineering perspective – could construct a big data centre equivalent to the power of the brain. Move to biological computer rather than silicon based. Dr. Klaus-Peter Zauner – Southampton University. A walking robot controlled by a living biological cell. </li>
	<li>4.    Psyco-pharmacology. Take someone not very bright give them some drugs increases their intelligence level. Brain science, addiction and drugs. Use of cognitively enhancing drugs. People in the future may supplement their intelligence with drugs. Will it eventually normalise? In the 80s thought inappropriate to use calculators now standard, move to open book exams. Ben Goldacre – Scientist writing in the Guardian, use of omega 3 and brain functioning. Also move towards bionic enhancers, already available for hearing, the bionic eye will be available soon. www,emotive.com. Prof Hugh Herr, MIT, www.ai.mit.edu.people/hherr/hher.html lost both his legs, focus on body-machine interfaces and the development of intelligent prosthetics. Technologies to augment our sensory or physical states. </li>
	<li>5.    Externalisation of cognition – memories of life. Alan Dix. 2004 could store a continuous record of a life on a grain of sand. Our capacity for storing data has become so large – it has raised a whole load of new questions. </li>
	<li>6.    Artificial Intelligence. AI is hard. We can do things very well – like big blue beating a human chess player. Dream of building humanoid robots, but still in its infancy. Domestic robots are here – iRobot, 4 million sold, roomba - autonomous vacuum cleaner. www.irobot.com, Packbots – used in the army. Amazon mechnicam turk – can sign up to this and recognise a bunch of images. Easy for humans, hard for computers.</li>
	<li>7.    Three-D printers in the future. This will change material science. Will enable you to put internal structures into materials and hence more closely mimic natural biology, such as use of honey comb structures. Can move to printing plastic electronics. </li>
	<li>8.    Cell broadband engine processor – inside a gaming device. ICT Systems of Systems (SoS) complexity is increasing exponentially. Our management capability is not keeping up. So we are moving towards constructing systems that we no longer understand or can manage. Sometime in the near future we will reach a socioeconomic criticality. www.Iscits.org We need to understand better systems level thinking. </li>
</ol>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Final thought – perhaps we shouldn’t just have a focus on developing technologies for learning, but we also need to ensure we give learners a grounding in basic science and argumentation. <br />

              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://paul-gagnon.com/">Paul Gagnon </a>is based at Nanyang Technological University Singapore</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>His talk focussed on the roll out of LAMS at his university. He began by referencing the</p>
<p>delay in take up of technologies - for exampel ca. 10 years for take up of Powerpoint</p>
<p></p>
<p>Importance of regonising good teaching and how we can support it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Building blocks<br />
</em></p>
<p>David Merrill's instructional model (engage - curiosity, context, challenge and control,</p>
<p>activate, demonstate, apply, integrate), using that as a way of framing for professors</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ron Oliver's learning triumvirate - learning activities, learning support, learning resources</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reflects research findings - cognitive neuroscience (learning begins with attention, and</p>
<p>neural plasticity - for example book Larry Squire and Charles Squire - </p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Molecules-Larry-R-Squire/dp/0716760371">Memory: From mind to molecules</a>)</p>
<p>and cognitive psychology (how and why we learn)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Challenges</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Framework<br />
</em></p>
<p>Budget, hiring staff, professor buy in (what exists already, whats in it for me,</p>
<p>how do we know it will work?), developing professor orientation package,</p>
<p>choosing the instructional strategy, framing the pedagogical model (sequed into the</p>
<p>interactive, began with monolithic), developing the</p>
<p>productiion process (record,, chunk lectures into 10-15 mins, inserted into</p>
<p>LAMS using pre-post activities, populated the course site,</p>
<p>building the support systems for REASCD model (video index, syllabus template),</p>
<p>choosing the delivery model (70% self--directed, 30% synchronous support),</p>
<p>achieving buy in (piloted model, professor support, students, administrative), </p>
<p>maintaining buy in (invoked champions, no recognition of hours of teaching online as </p>
<p>real teaching, marketed results to senior management, encouraging the creation of </p>
<p>non-formal collaborative learning activities)</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Benefits</em></p>
<p>invites innovation</p>
<p>Opens education</p>
<p>Frees up professors time for research</p>
<p>Establishes an easily understoon framework</p>
<p>Encourages learner independence and student centric learning</p>
<p>Enables us to provide for learning style differences</p>
<p>Facilitates establishing of global classrooms</p>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/582</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/582</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Eva was talking about her use of LAMS&nbsp;for tracking student behaviour</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Good teaching?<br />
</em>Active and participatory learning desing<br />
A challenge on traditional choke and talk<br />
<br />
What students say and what they do are very different things<br />
<br />
<em>Structured controversy approach to triggering student interest</em><br />
Pros and cons arguments<br />
Understanding values positions<br />
Use contemporary real like problems<br />
Developing students problem solving skills <br />
and reflective abilities<br />
<br />
<em>Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation</em><br />
Demand effort and engagement with the learning content<br />
Option against a reward structure<br />
<br />
<em>SimEx1 - a simulation exercise</em><br />
Imagine u are the head of steering committee framing code of ethics for teaching.</p>
<p>Preparing for next meeting and have open a mind map page and</p>
<p>drawn three circles for the main concept. Skim Australia 2020 report and</p>
<p>note shared values and then list your values</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Students evaluation<br />
</em></p>
<p>Students said: If you want me to do LAMS you need to make it assessed</p>
<p>Series of simuation exercises over 7 weeks, </p>
<p>student participation dramatically decreased week by week</p>
<p>Quality of contribution more simple statements, </p>
<p>than inquiry based arguement orevaluative position taking</p>
<p>Even if students engae with the learning material, </p>
<p>the engagement is most often shallow rather than deep</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Implications<br />
</em></p>
<p>There is a need for a change in practice</p>
<p>Need to better understand the barriers to deep engagement</p>
<p>Structured approach to generic skills building needed</p>
<p>Great need for monitoring student engagement levels with non-assessed learning tasks</p>

Nagoya Bunri Univerisity is first LAMS user for education in Japan
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use of LAMS to design and deliver a colllaborative learning activity. </li>
	<li>10 students over three weeks.</li>
	<li>The course was a basic seminar course for computer/information ethics study</li>
	<li>LAMS was used to research and disucss on computer crimes.</li>
	<li>3 sequences 1. file sharing software (Winny), 2. electronic bulletin board, 3. hazardous sites</li>
	<li>All students worked together on each actiivity at the same time.</li>
	<li>Learning process: web search, exchange info, exchange opinions</li>
	<li>Gates were allocated after every activity and the teacher controled the sequence flow.</li>
	<li>90% of students were positive about using LAMS in terms of its usability, interest</li>
	<li>and comprehension.</li>
	<li>In future they may allow students to go freely to the next step</li>
	<li>The teacher intervened in the discussion with the students</li>

TRAC software development project support system <br />
Use of the wiki majority posting messages or exchanging files, only one group</p>
<p>used it as a web 2.0 collaborative tool<br />
Issues in terms of the degree to which students see the value of collaboration</p>
<p>in their learning<br />
Building on notion of affordances Gibson (79) Norman (88)<br />
&quot;Possibilities of actions between an organism and the environment -</p>
<p>application of this to use of web 2.0 in a learning context&quot;</p>
<p>Five levels of engagement seen in initial results:<br />
1. no affordances use<br />
2. communication affordances<br />
3. file sharing<br />
4. extended communication and file sharing<br />
5. combined above with affordance related to resource aggregation and personalisation</p>
<p></p>
<p>Plan to do a series of case studies to capture detailed understanding of </p>
<p>how students collaborative or not with web 2.0</p>]]></description>

<p>Gen Y students who are comfortable self publishers, letting them use LAMS as a tool for them.</p>
<p>The value of being able to preview sequences even for experienced teachers.</p>
<p>Working with trainee student teachers, number of aspirations:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Help student teachers develop their thinking with tools and how to use LAMS</li>
    <li>and to build confidence and attitude towards technologies.</li>
    <li>Use LAMS as a key immersion tool &ndash; design, create, implement and evaluate an</li>
    <li>online course</li>
    <li>LAMS as a vehicle to think about elearning</li>
    <li>Develop insights into learning designs</li>
    <li>Develop teaching strategies</li>
    <li>Develop insights into learning spaces</li>
    <li>Develop skills for evaluating their task (eg listening to children)</li>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Focus of the LDSE project is</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Need to understand how to foster collaborative learning among teachers as learners about e-learning</li>
    <li>Teachers need to be more like researchers</li>
    <li>They lack the tools and means to do it, to build on each others work, redesign, experiment, share, reflect and collaborative</li>
    <li></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> User requirements elicited around 6 areas</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><em>Planning</em> &ndash; align components of LD within and between diff levels of course, module etc</li>
    <li><em>Decision-making </em>&ndash; review implications of a decision for other parts of the process &amp; revise</li>
    <li><em>Progressive innovation</em> &ndash; link to relevant advice etc</li>
    <li><em>Analysis </em>&ndash; inspect/edit explicit models of internal relations (allocation of time), compare different models</li>
    <li><em>Collaboration </em>&ndash; share/discus designs, learn from each other &amp; build on each others ideas</li>
    <li><em>Administration</em> &ndash; allocate lecturer&rsquo;s time, learner&rsquo;s time, estimate costs, publish schedules, provide document for audit and validation</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Designing and integrating ICT enhanced learning and teaching</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous process modes and frameworks developed</p>
<p>to scaffold the process of designing and/or adapting curricula</p>
<p>to exploit the under utilised potential of ICT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Issues</em></p>
<ol>
    <li>Pragmatic issues</li>
    <li>Design models&nbsp; are too mechanical</li>
    <li>Gap between teachers hopes and educational outcomes (Goodyear)</li>
    <li>Design quality varies</li>
    <li>There is still a tendency for technology to drive</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The ICTELT process model</em></p>
<p>It has an iteractive structure that remains flexible enough for practitioners to</p>
<p>blend the approach of their choice while also encouraging the alignment of pedagogical</p>
<p>perspectives and practice. The guided questions and scaffolding are designed to form a basis</p>
<p>for collaborative discussion of design choices, ICT tool selection, and the complexity</p>
<p>of incorporating a range of pedagogical apraohces with a variety of tools.</p>

<p>Web 2.0 will not solve all our educational needs, no tool will, its all in the use.</p>

    <li>Facts are constructs</li>
