              <description><![CDATA[<p>Project Title &ndash; <strong><em>IncludingEverybody; A project .</em></strong></p> 

<p> A knowledge sharing series of How To guides to aid the production of accessible e-learning. </p>

<p> ‘… the future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed’ (Gibson, 2018). </p>

<p> Developments in technology are evolving rapidly and increase the means to include a diverse range of people who would not traditionally have had access to knowledge capital. Moreover, developments in mainstream consumer technologies have reduced the gap between what was specialized assistive technologies and mainstream off-the-shelf products with built-in inclusive design (James & Draffan, 2018). These technologies could benefit many, if they have digital access, are aware of them, and have the digital literacies to utilise them (McGovern, 2018). </p>

<p>The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN General Assembly, 2007) promotes, ‘the design, development, production and distribution of accessible information.’ This knowledge sharing project is prompted by a noted lack of awareness. Firstly, the World Health Organisation points out that, 
“unless professionals and people with disabilities are aware of their (assistive devices) existence, they will not benefit from them, so information sharing and awareness is vital”  (2011, p. 188) </p>
<p>
Critically engaging with the actual steps involved in  reducing exclusion is significant to addressing the reality that meeting the learning needs of some  may create barriers for others (Griful-Freixenet, et al., 2017).  
Doing this also important for people who experience exclusion from mismatched human interactions, from a temporary injury or context, or from a situation (Microsoft, 2016). Potentially us all, in fact.  </p>

<p>The IncludingEverybody project will create and disseminate video tutorials of the step-by-step process involved in creating accessible and inclusive digital artefacts in popular medias. An associated blog will provide the same information in textual and liner form, offering a different but equivalent representation of the same information. The blog will also function as a live e-curation resource with hyperlinks and multimedia resources embedded, a reference list, and a comments section to allow interaction and user generated content. Each shared artefact will carry a CC-BY-SA licence with attribution to IncludingEveryone@hotmail.com.</p>

<p>The first phase of the IncludingEveryone project and conference presentation focuses on what content creators need to know about inclusive design and accessibility in various medias. This is an important area as knowing ‘how to’ increase usability and accessibility of digital resources may have a significant impact on how effectively they convey the intended information.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>In this presentation I will argue that if higher education is to be successfully opened up to disabled students, higher education institutions and personnel need to open up to the &lsquo;acceptibility of otherness&rdquo;. I will exemplify and justify my argument by focusing on three phenomena that present significant barriers to such acceptance: labelling; ableism and invisibility.</p>]]></description>

<p>National student data has shown a range of attainment gaps for specific groups across Higher Education, specifically for: students from low socio-economic groups, students from black and minority ethnic groups, and students with disabilities (HEFCE, 2015). Consequently, the Higher Education Funding Council for England are funding 17 projects under the Catalyst programme to help address these inequalities. Building on prior experience, The Open University is leading a project with colleagues from the University of Leeds and Plymouth University, to evaluate and promote inclusive educational practices within the STEM disciplines. <br /> <br />Integrating accessibility within teaching and learning requires universities to embed and sustain module design and delivery practices that consider the diverse needs of all students. As more of our teaching and learning is being mediated through technologies, this brings opportunities as well as potential pitfalls, when it comes to inclusive education. Digital access to learning resources introduces opportunities for the use of assistive technologies and alternate formats that enhance the accessibility of learning resources for students with disabilities, but care needs to be taken to ensure the pace of innovation and interaction matches that of accessibility and inclusion. <br /> <br />Across the STEM disciplines there are particular challenges associated with fieldwork, labwork and notations. However, with changes to the Disabled Students Allowance Scheme, universities are increasingly responsible to ensure that the education they provide is accessible and inclusive. Within this presentation we&rsquo;ll consider the role of the OpenTEL Research Area in inclusive education at the OU; we&rsquo;ll describe some of the processes and approaches used in OU modules, and we&rsquo;ll discuss how case studies and recommendations on inclusive practices might be produced and shared across the STEM disciplines. <br /> <br />HEFCE (2015).

              <title>What are the expectations of disabled learners when participating in a MOOC?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10487</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/fi364.html" target="_blank">Francisco Iniesto</a>, <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/pm526.html" target="_blank">Patrick McAndrew</a>, <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/sm577.html" target="_blank">Shailey Minocha</a> and <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/tc6295.html" target="_blank">Tim Coughlan</a></p>
<p>Open education can provide opportunities at scale for lifelong learning amongst currently underserved populations, such as those with disabilities. In comparison to other online learning opportunities MOOCs have potentially beneficial characteristics such as: open access within a structured learning framework, low cost of learning, flexibility to allow individual planning in terms of the learner&rsquo;s time and preferred pace and place, opportunities for social learning, as well as scope to gain knowledge. <br />Despite this potential suitability as an approach to support disabled learners, there is limited research to understand accessibility and MOOCs, and on the expectations of disabled MOOC learners. This presentation outlines a preliminary study to analyse existing pre- and post-study survey data from MOOCs offered by the Open University on the FutureLearn platform, to understand the expectations of disabled learners participating in MOOCs. The quantitative study reported in this presentation is a part of a wider research programme to investigate the current accessibility of MOOCs, the processes through which this accessibility is achieved, and the potential use of data to improve MOOC accessibility. This study aims to understand the current expectations of disabled learners when taking part in MOOCs. <br />Limitations to this analysis are that it was undertaken with a small number of MOOC presentations, and that a simple disability marker may not reflect diversity within the population. It should not be assumed that these results generalise to the whole of the disabled learner population, or that this population is homogenous in nature. Nevertheless, some preliminary findings and future work can be drawn for further investigation.</p>

<p>Abstract:MOOCs have become an accepted way to make learning opportunities available at large scale and low cost to the learner. However, only if these are made accessible will they be able to offer flexibility of learning and benefits to all, irrespective of disability. Experience in providing accessible online learning at distance universities suggests that this can be best achieved through understanding different roles and the options in planning for adjustments to be made. To effectively apply similar approaches to MOOCs, it is necessary to understand the various viewpoints and roles of stakeholders and how these impact on accessibility. This includes educators who create materials and facilitate learning, and technologists who develop and maintain platforms. We report the results from a study involving semi-structured interviews to investigate the perceptions and accessibility-related processes of technical specialists, course teams, accessibility specialists, educational content specialists and MOOC researchers focused on three main topics: <br />&bull; Data availability and knowledge about disabled learners. <br />&bull; Accessibility and daily work, in dealing with course providers and the platform. <br />&bull; MOOCs and adaptation, how to show the information to the learner. <br />An inductive approach for coding the interviews has been followed using transcripts of the interviews; the results show that there is a lack of data collection on disability in eLearning, either by building profiles or during registration processes, they show awareness that MOOCs can be valuable for disabled learners, and indicate that legislation acts as a driver for accessibility. However, our investigations suggest limited progress to date in either producing universally accessible MOOCs, or tailoring MOOCs to meet the needs of individual disabled learners.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/gh6896.html" target="_blank">Garron Hillaire</a>, <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/fi364.html" target="_blank">Francisco Iniesto</a> and <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/bcr58.html" target="_blank">Bart Rienties</a></p>
<p>The evolution of open education on the internet is enabling thousands of people around the world to follow different educational initiatives. A basic characteristic of MOOCs, independently of its type, is the high degree of interactivity that facilitates and reinforces the bidirectional communication between the learners and the mediators. Therefore, the teachers and moderators inside the MOOCs act like community managers. As the learning is learner-centered, it requires a greater commitment from the learner into self-learning, deep research aptitude and analysis, reflexive capacity along with a high component of personal autonomy. An effective open e-learning environment should consider each learner&rsquo;s abilities, learning goals, where learning takes place, and which specific devices the learner uses; when it comes to using screen reader technologies students already make personalized choices in terms of which synthetic voice they use to hear to course material. The main driving force behind this investigation is to determine if the emotional expression of a synthetic voice influences the performance of learners. This presentation will outline the results of measuring the emotional expression in three MOOCs when samples of the course text are read through text-to-speech. The text was inspected by raters for emotional content. There is likely reason to begin examining what implication are when the emotion prediction of the text-to-speech disagrees with the human raters as well as pursuing more intentional emotional expression based on emotional detection in text. There are implications as the accessibility technologies could potentially be undermining the intent of course designer&rsquo;s deliberate decisions to use emotional expression in text. The effects on learning are as yet unknown, but there is a potential for dynamic personalization with synthetic voices to provide an accessible alternative that could potentially be superior to the single voice of an instructor.</p>]]></description>

              <title>WED: How open is the digital environment for disabled students in higher education? (Jennie Augustyniak)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9546</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9546</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>One perspective: Increasingly students in higher education (HE) study in a digital environment, using a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). In open education, most learning materials, teaching, and library services are delivered online. Both are enabling. Additionally, many students use assistive technologies to support their access and engagement with study. &lsquo;Digital&rsquo; and &lsquo;open&rsquo; are used interchangeably and considered widely as inherently enabling. Similarly, &lsquo;access&rsquo; and &lsquo;accessibility&rsquo; are substituted often and there is general expectation they lead to effective outcomes.</p>
<p>Another perspective: The situation for disabled students is not that simple &ndash; the pathway to &lsquo;open&rsquo; (inclusion) is not necessarily digital, and a digital environment can be a barrier. Similarly, there is not a causal link between &lsquo;access&rsquo; and &lsquo;use&rsquo; for disabled students and assistive technologies. The interaction of disabled students with digital learning and teaching raises unexpected complexities.</p>
<p>The presentation: looks at an increase in reported difficulties for disabled students following the implementation of a VLE. The large UK university provided offline digital alternatives, but received requests for an &lsquo;individual reasonable adjustment&rsquo; to address the increase in screen time required. Two problems had arisen &ndash; a digital barrier following the implementation of a VLE and an apparent lack of take up by disabled students of the alternative technologies that the university anticipated would remove that barrier. And a third &ndash; the adjustment most requested was for the student to move offline and revert to paper-based learning. Whilst this may be acceptable, in that the university responded as requested, there was concern it was not the most effective or sustainable solution.</p>
<p>The issues were complex and had many stakeholders so were explored through a workshop, supported by a learning activity, which was informed by student consultation. Seven issues were addressed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are the adjustment requests well informed?</li>
<li>Does the adjustment enable access to online learning?</li>
<li>Does the adjustment enable disabled students make the most effective use of online learning?</li>
<li>Do disabled students miss out on the rich experience of the VLE?</li>
<li>Are disabled students hindered in the opportunity to become &lsquo;digital scholars&rsquo;?</li>
<li>Do disabled students value the adjustment made (does it meet their expectations)?</li>
<li>Are disabled students empowered in their use and adoption of technologies?</li>
</ol>
<p>The presentation will share more of this story and illustrate it with case studies. Participants will discover more about the learning activity, which was used to bring stakeholders to a level of understanding prior to the workshop. It will conclude with the outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student consultation on individual reasonable adjustments</li>
<li>Improved view of disabled students&rsquo; needs for access to and effective use of online learning.</li>
<li>Improved view of disabled students&rsquo; use and adoption of technology and the support required.</li>
<li>Updated process for making and handling responsive adjustments.</li>
<li>Better informed operational practice in supporting disabled students.</li>
<li>Assistive technologies and adjustments as exemplars and normalised to support learning styles, preferences, and students who are not permitted to study online.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conference participants can try the pre-workshop learning activity and the student consultation questions before the presentation.</p>]]></description>

              <title>SAT: A Flipped Classroom on Flipped Classrooms (Maxine Armstrong)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9531</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9531</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>So you currently teach healthcare practitioners within higher education and you are wondering should you be flipping your teaching? But you are unsure about how to do it, what is involved and even what exactly is flipped learning.</p>
<p>Essentially, a flipped classroom is where the homework component comes before the class or lecture, but it encompasses a number of different approaches (Educause, 2012, p.1). Flipped classrooms are not new, but as a learning model it has become more widespread in recent years, initially within the school sector, but also in higher further education, due to the proliferation of digital media (JISC, 2015).&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the conference I will discuss how a learning activity is being implemented that uses a flipped learning approach to inform and promote discussion on the phenomenon of flipped classrooms. The learning activity provides online multimedia resources prior to attending at a workshop, and is aimed at educators of healthcare practitioners. However, the learning activity has been informed by research from different disciplines, so that it can be more widely applied.</p>
<p>Although the focus of the presentation will be on the online resources, their impact on the workshop will also be discussed as they are intrinsically linked. An explanation of how the tasks map to the learning objectives will be provided.</p>
<p>The online resources for the learning activity include a variety of digital media. After a brief introductory video the participants are asked to complete a short anonymous survey using Google Form, to gauge their attitudes to flipped classrooms before they review the remaining content. This survey is anonymous and the results and comments will be used within the workshop to promote discussion. The survey will be made available before the conference so that it can be used in the presentation to demonstrate the range of concerns and issues of interests to conference attendees.</p>
<p>There will be an overview of some of the short five-minute videos that introduce each issue, within the presentation. The videos are deliberately bite-sized so that they can become an online repository for participants to review after the workshop. The issues will cover different factors that influence flipped classrooms, such as, the pedagogical advantages and challenges, digital media&rsquo;s influence on learning design, procurement of hardware and software applications, legal and copyright requirements and adhesion to institutional policies. Technical development will also be considered, for both academic and support staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally a planning template, based on an example by Gilroy, et al. (2015, p.11), will be demonstrated that the workshop participants can use to design how they would flip their own teaching. These plans will be an opportunity for the workshop participants to discuss and reflect on their understanding of flipped classrooms and how they can apply their new knowledge in practice.</p>
<p>There is still uncertainty and confusion within the educational community over exactly what flipped classrooms are and whether they can they make a significant difference to student learning, therefore I am hoping for a lively discussion after my presentation.</p>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9343</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9343</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm very happy to announce that we have released Open Media Player (formerly called OU Media Player), as a free/open source project. It has been our intention for a while to make the code open source, and we were finally able to plan in the time to make it happen.</p>
<p class="figure center"><a href="http://iet-ou.github.io/open-media-player/"><img src="http://iet-ou.github.io/open-media-player/assets/images/omp-example.png" alt="Open Media Player" /></a></p>
<h2>Why open source?</h2>
<p>We decided to open source because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Media Player aspires to the highest levels of accessibility, while being a mainstream player - a fairly unique proposition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We adopt a service-based approach, where the player is kept separate from the audio/video files, and the web sites it is embedded in. This aids maintenance, feature roll-out and is again a unique selling point;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help drive innovation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Principle - it fits in with the Open University's mission - open to people, places and ideas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educational - help others learn from our best-practices and our mistakes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We've done a lot of work to make the Player straightforward to install, and hopefully understand. Installation via <a title="Open Media Player on Packagist" href="https://packagist.org/packages/iet-ou/open-media-player">Composer</a> is as simple as copying and pasting this at a terminal:</p>
<pre>    composer create-project iet-ou/open-media-player --no-dev -sdev --prefer-dist
</pre>
<p>Some of the highlights of version 2 of Open Media Player:</p>
<ul>
<li>New embeddable, themed YouTube player</li>
<li>Configurable site layout and authentication</li>
<li><a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> adopted, code-base re-factored into sub-packages</li>
<li>Upgraded to <a href="http://mediaelementjs.com/">MediaElement.js</a> 2.17.0</li>
<li>Improved player user-interface in high-contrast (ignore colours) mode</li>
</ul>
<p>And, <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/open-media-player/wiki/Releases#2x">lots more</a>!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

              <title>WED: To what extent do MOOCs contribute to a  narrative of development as freedom? (Tim Seal)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8869</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8869</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>[DRAFT abstract - comments please]</h2>
<p>The uptake of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) within the HE sector has increased exponentially in the last 2 years with a belief that it will be of benefit to the provision of education in an ever expanding population (Trucano, 2013). With the majority of MOOCs coming from and being aimed at the global north (ICDE, 2013), how are MOOCs contextualised by providers for local context, what impact does this have on their applicability to the global context, and how does OER and openness support this contextualisation? &nbsp;One commonly heard line of rhetoric in respect to MOOCs is that they largely benefit those already engaged in their own education, rather than those excluded from other forms of education. Some studies (Christensen et al, 2013) finding over 80% of participants having post-secondary qualifications and almost 50% reporting post graduate qualifications. Understanding the mechanisms by which a MOOC is delivered can support the engagement of participants, or act as an additional barrier, particularly in development contexts, is essential to the ability of MOOC providers in ensuring equitable access and support for students&rsquo; learning.</p>
<p>Set within the context of Nobel economist Amartya Sen&rsquo;s (1999) ideas of development in &lsquo;expand[ing] people&rsquo;s substantive freedoms through the removal of &ldquo;unfreedoms&rdquo;: poverty, limited economic opportunity, inadequate education and access to knowledge, deficient health care, and oppression&rsquo; (p. 1).&nbsp; This presentation seeks to identify the ways in which MOOCs and by association other forms of openness either add or remove barriers to engagement in education in relation to the removal of unfreedoms, providing an understanding of the openness of MOOCs and the extent to which MOOCs as tool contribute to a narrative of development as freedom.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>In order to continue to develop the best possible Media Player for <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">The Open University</a>, we lay down some guiding principles, and notes on how the current player seeks to meet those principles.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://mediaplayer.open.ac.uk/">OU Media Player</a> should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Attain and exceed the highest standards for accessibility to those with disabilities.</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of <a title="Open University accessibility standard" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/about/web-standards/standards/accessibility">the OU</a>, <a title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, W3C Recommendation 11 December 2008" href="http://w3.org/TR/WCAG20">WCAG 2.0</a> and <a title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0, W3C Recommendation 20 March 2014" href="http://w3.org/TR/wai-aria">WAI-ARIA</a> standards and guidelines (W3C),</li>
<li>User and expert testing by IET of early prototypes for new functionality, and of the Player, with time planned in to implement fixes;</li>
<li>HTML5 player based on the third-party, open-source <a href="http://mediaelementjs.com">MediaElement.js</a> libraries, with Javascript plugins to replace and extend functionality;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be usable by the mainstream as well as those with disabilities;</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>User and expert testing by <a title="Institute of Educational Technology" href="http://iet.open.ac.uk/">IET</a> of early prototypes for new functionality, and of the Player, with time planned in to implement fixes;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Represent the OU appropriately. Carry the correct branding.</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>LTS designs visual theme(s) for the Player that are both accessible and usable, and that fit in with The Open University's overall <a title="Open University brand" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/about/web-standards/standards/design-standards/brand-guidelines">brand</a> and <a title="Open University mission" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/about/main/mission">values</a>;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be usable on mobiles and tablets.</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML5 player based on MediaElement.js;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be simple for authors to embed the Player in content;</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of the <a title="oEmbed specification" href="http://oembed.com/">oEmbed</a> specification;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be embeddable in a variety of platforms, (both OU-branded &ndash; OU VLE, <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/">OpenLearn</a>, Study at OU, OU Drupal etc, and non-OU branded sites);</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of a service-based approach;</li>
<li>Use of platform-specific plugins, for example, the oEmbed plugin for Drupal;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be simple to deploy new features.</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platform specific themes and an update process which conforms to IT change request process.</li>
<li>Issues and changes logged and tracked via LTS Redmine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track usage patterns, to help improve the Player and inform other University activity.</p>
<p>The current implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of Google Analytics for the <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/">Podcast</a> Player variant;</li>
<li>Tracking of play, pause and completion events;</li>
<li>Planned: add a feedback form.</li>

              <title>OU Media Player June 2014 release (blog)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8785</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8785</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://freear.org.uk/content/ou-media-player-june-2014-release">Original post</a>.</p>
<p>I'm happy to be reporting on a new release of the <a href="http://mediaplayer.open.edu">OU Media Player</a> that happened in mid-June. This release fixed a number of bugs, including one relating to Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8, and another involved fixing security warnings for non-secure audio/video media files when the Player is embedded on a site via HTTPS.</p>
<p>There were also a couple of enhancements. One entails hiding the title panel on pages that are Open University branded. This has proved to be a stumbling block in some deployments, as the titles are not always meaningful to the public (they may be used internally to distinguish tracks), and it looks odd to have multiple copies the OU's shield logo.</p>
<p>Another feature we added was Google Analytics for the legacy Open2.net media embedded in <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn">OpenLearn</a>. This is feature isn't visible to the end-user. However, it is important so that we can track and report on usage. Based on this, I can already report that the Player is currently embedded in something like 2000 places and receives approaching 4000 plays per month.</p>
<p>Analytics tracks some "events" for the Player, currently, "play", "pause" and the audio/video track is "ended", . <a href="https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/master/src/js/mep-feature-googleanalytics.js">GitHub: ../mediaelement ../mep-feature-googleanalytics.js</a>. We're interested in doing more with the Player analytics, so please watch this space.</p>

<h2>What is Accessify Wiki?</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is a Wiki where you can write accessibility and usability fixes;</li>
<li>It is an open community, where you can take action to improve the Web for all;</li>
<li>It is a place to collaborate and serve the needs of individuals;</li>
<li>It is a way to deliver unobtrusive accessibility fixes via Javascript to the end user;</li>
<li>It is a means to harness the power of HTML5, WAI-ARIA and the modern Web;</li>
<li>It allows site owners to get a head-start with accessibility.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What it isn't</h2>
<ul>
<li>Accessify Wiki is not panacea -- it is not a way to fix all accessibility problems;</li>
<li>It is not a long-term solution to accessibility;</li>
<li>It is not a way to fix embedded Flash, PDFs, Java, or HTML5 Canvas-heavy web applications;</li>
<li>It does not let businesses off the hook -- businesses and site owners have a responsibility to test and improve their site's accessibility.</li>
</ul>

              <title>Anna&#39;s design narrative - Presenting at an online webinar</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8304</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8304</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>I undertake research in the area of Open Educational Resources (OER) and need to be able to share project findings in an engaging way, both face-to-face and online.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>This activity was part of the <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/">Open Education Week</a> which took place from 11-15 March 2013 online and in locally hosted events around the world which were freely available to anyone with Internet access. The purpose of Open Education Week is to raise awareness of the open education movement and opportunities it creates in teaching and learning worldwide. I was invited to contribute to one of the webinars because of my work on the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/actoer.referata.com">ACTOER </a>(Accessibility Challenges and Techniques for Open Educational Resources) project.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>I was asked to contribute to a webinar "Designing OERs with Diversity in Mind" with two other co-presenters. Our success would be measured by whether we managed to attract any participants on the day and engage them in dialogue about OERs and accessibility; further measure would also be the number of downloads of the webinar slides from Slideshare where they would be posted.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>1. I was first contacted three months prior to the event by the organiser who wanted to find out about my interest and availability.</p>
<p>2. Once myself and two co-presenters were onboard, we had to agree on a time and date for the webinar as well as for a rehearsal- this proved to be somewhat challenging as we had to choose a time that would accommodate three different time zones: UK (GMT), Canada (Toronto GMT-4) and USA (California GMT-7). In the end, we picked 4 p.m. UK time which was 12:00 p.m. in Toronto and 9:00 a.m. in California</p>
<p>3. Three weeks prior to the event we developed and shared our slides via email.</p>
<p>4. One week before the event we had a "dry run" of the webinar so that on the day we would be familiar with the Blackboard Collaborate platform. This gave us a chance to talk about the running order, any changes to the slides and sort out technical glitches. The meeting was useful because it allowed us to coordinate the content of the three presentations and make sure that they are connected and flow quite well.</p>
<p>5. The actual webinar took one hour and seven participants&nbsp; took part in the online session.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The session was recorded and the recording is now available from the Open Education website. The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/UnaDaly/designing-oer-with-diversity-in-mind">slides </a>were posted on Slideshare and attracted over 2000 views.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>Personally, the key challenge was the lack of immediate feedback from the participants - when delivering my presentation, it felt as if I was talking into a void as I missed out on verbal/non-verbal cues from other people in the session. The lack of feedback was quite unnerving as I could only guess whether people were engaging or not, for all I knew, they could be asleep at their computers or mindlessly surfing the Internet; however judging by the questions typed in the chat box they seemed to be listening. I enjoyed participating in the back channel and the chance to share my expertise by posting links to projects with resources that the participants were interested in.</p>
<p>I was initially disappointed that only seven participants "showed up" as the session took up so much of my time and effort to prepare but was consoled by the fact that the outreach was much wider thanks to Slideshare. At the same time, the low turnout at the online session doesn&rsquo;t come as a surprise, I was planning myself to participate in other Open Education Week events but ended up not being able to attend anything; while the online events were easily accessible they still required carving out "real time" which was a challenge.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Amanda Everitt’s design narrative: raising awareness between deaf and hearing students</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8261</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8261</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I worked as a Participation Officer for deaf young people and my role was to engage with this audience and find out their interests, thought and their obstacles through fun and interactive activities, and to use this as a vehicle to influence organisational change from a child-centred perspective.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>This 1 hour long activity took place within a school classroom with 5 deaf and 5 hearing students aged 11-18. All the participants knew of each other having seen each other around school, however only two were friends. Students were initially awkward with one other there being a wide range of ages and communication factors present such as students who signed, students who spoke but still needed communication assistance to understand full instructions. The presenter was deaf, and relied on the British Sign Language interpreter to translate the comments of the hearing students, and the BSL interpreter was also on hand to translate the comments of the deaf students to the hearing students. To encourage full disclosure, no other classroom teacher was present. The classroom was of a good size, however tables had to be adjusted from rows to a horseshoe shape so that the deaf students could see and lip-read the hearing students better. Students had access to felt pens and coloured post-it notes so that thoughts and comments could be jotted down. All the students were interested in contributing to improve communication and awareness between deaf and hearing people within the school.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Developing a new resource pack containing films and lesson plans to educate hearing students about deaf students and how to communicate better with them. The measure of success was getting positive feedback on how the students wanted the films and resources to look, and to see improvement in awareness and communication within this group of students to be passed on to other students within the school.</p>

</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Objectives were met and interesting thoughts and comments were gained from the students to influence the creation and design of the resources.</p>
<p>The group dynamics were interesting as there was such a wide age range, older students talked more than the younger students and the younger students had to be encouraged to share their thoughts. It might have been better to have a separate session focusing on the look, feel and style of the resources, audio and subtitle access.<br /> However access to the students was limited. <br /> <br /> Due to limited time, evaluation of the session in the form of a short questionnaire was sent to the teacher to do with the students, and questions included if the students had talked to each other after the event, and if they had shared some tips from the session with their classmates.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Further sessions were held with deaf and hearing students separately, however it would have been beneficial if several sessions were held with the same group together and separately so as to glean more articulate thoughts and suggestions as deaf students may have been reluctant to share communication difficulties with hearing students.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Use WAI-ARIA landmark roles in new &amp; existing development projects</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7953</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7953</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published <a href="http://w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0</a>&nbsp;as a "Candidate Recommendation" in January 2011.</p>
<p>This defines "roles" and in particular landmark roles. Landmark roles complement (or replace) the idea of a "skip" link -- they inform assistive technologies like screen readers that parts of Web page are "navigation", the main content, complementary information (think, a news feed in a side block), and so on. The AT can then announce the landmark to the end-user, for example when the whole page is read aloud by a screen reader, or when a page outline is displayed.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest that they should be adopted for all new and existing Web development projects, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are widely understood by screen readers, including JAWS, <a href="http://www.nvda-project.org/">NVDA</a> and Window-Eyes;</li>
<li>They are HTML attributes not elements, so older browsers silently ignore them;</li>
<li>And, therefore they are low-risk;</li>
<li>They can be used with HTML 4, XHTML 1/1.1 and HTML5.</li>
</ol>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#landmark_roles">landmark roles</a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>application</li>
<li>banner</li>
<li>complementary</li>
<li>contentinfo</li>
<li>form</li>
<li>main</li>
<li>navigation</li>
<li>search</li>
</ul>
<p>I've used landmark roles on recent projects including <a href="http://track.olnet.org/">Track OER</a> and the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/webstandards/v3.0/">OUICE</a>-based site theme for the <a href="http://mediaplayer.open.edu/">OU Media Player</a>. You can <a title="View source in Firefox and Chrome.." href="view-source:http://mediaplayer.open.edu#line108">view source</a> to search for them.</p>
<h3>WAI-ARIA roles in HTML5</h3>
<p>If you choose to use the new <a href="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html">HTML5 'sectional' elements</a> use <a href="http://w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_HTML5_nav_element#Example:The_.3Cnav.3E_element">the WAI-ARIA role too</a> -- that is [nav role=navigation] ... [/nav]. There is more consistent support for WAI-ARIA roles among assistive technology than there is for the sectional elements.</p>
<p>There are some example code snippets and useful links below.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Like most I'm very short of time so this is a very brief summary for my learning objectives for this OLDS MOOC. I hope this appears where I hope it will. I 'baled out' of the intro video when the technical problems appeared.</p>
<p>1. To 'get the feel' of MOOCs. I've watched from afar in one. This time to get 'hands dirty'.</p>
<p>2. To promote the accessibility and inclusion agenda into the MOOC environment. Online and Open reaches out to those who might not be able to access courses for financial, chronological or geographic reasons, but Open isn't Open if those with disabilities are not empowered to participate on the same terms. I want to promote appropriate resoures from the JISC environment where appropriate.</p>
<p>3. To discover a network which can assist me with the Digital Literacies in the Disciplines programme we are developing in the Higher Education Academy. I am seeking contacts for 'students as partners' to surface discipline issues -opportunities and challenges. In effect, to extend and sustain the JISC DL work further into the HEA community through pragmatic and effective action (it does not have to be efficient, just get something useful done).</p>
<p>I will have to do this in short bites - no big missives to follow.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Bob Ridge-Stearn: My dream: Quality Assurance for Online Courses.</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7095</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7095</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>My situation (context).</h2>
<p>I manage an e-learning department in a UK university.&nbsp; We offer blended lerning and fully online courses.&nbsp; Courses are designed by academics who are expert in their fields but not necessarily experts at designing (or teaching on) online courses.</p>
<p>I do not want to design a course on this MOOC but by participating I want to synthesis my ideas about Quality Assurance.</p>
<p>Over the last few months I have been reading many QA checklists that are avaialbel online and thinking about how they might be applied.&nbsp; I curate a ScoopIt site on the subject <a href="http://www.scoop.it/t/quality-assurance-in-online-courses/" target="_blank">http://www.scoop.it/t/quality-assurance-in-online-courses/</a> &nbsp;and through that found David Jones blog in which he argues against trying to police courses (<a href="http://davidtjones.wordpress.com/2012/09/29/compliance-cultures-and-transforming-the-quality-of-e-learning/" target="_blank">http://davidtjones.wordpress.com/2012/09/29/compliance-cultures-and-transforming-the-quality-of-e-learning/</a>).&nbsp; This set me back a little as I was leaning towards having a Quality Checklist against which all our tutors could check their courses.</p>
<p>I have just completed Oxford Brookes online course in course design&nbsp; which focussed on Learning Design (activity design) and met there a number of design benchmarks/matrices/checklists that can be used to help design something from the beginning. In my job too we have used Leicester's CArpe Diem model to design activities.</p>
<p>So there are guides to use to design and to check designs.&nbsp; I've got one on my desk at work that's 70 pages long and another that's a single sheet of paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I find is that academically-focussed advice concentrates on learning theory but largely ignores usability/accessibility issues while technically-focussed advice ignores pedagogy.</p>
<p>So I'm here to see how this is dealt with in this course and to ponder over the design of this course itself. I'm not going to design a course but I may end up with a useable checklist for my tutors.</p>
<h2>The change I would like to see (challenge)</h2>
<p>I would like to have a strategy to work with academic tutors running online courses at my university that will improve and enrich their courses. This may or not be a Quality Checklist.</p>
<h2>How you might go about bringing that change</h2>
<p>This I do not know yet.&nbsp; I have been pondering it for some time.</p>]]></description>

              <title>OU embed proposal (blog)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6684</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6684</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I've proposed a mini-project here, for IET to host an experimental embedding service on behalf of The Open University. This will serve a similar purpose to Embed.ly (<a href="http://api.embed.ly/">api.embed.ly</a>) and Oohembed (<a href="http://oohembed.com/">oohembed.com</a>), and act as a proxy on behalf of other embed or service providers, for example, YouTube, <a title="Learning Activity Management System" href="http://wiki.lamsfoundation.org/display/lamsdocs/About+LAMS#AboutLAMS-whatIs">LAMS</a>, Prezi and Google Docs forms.</p>
<p>The embedding service will provide an oEmbed interface (<a title="The specification" href="http://oembed.com/">oembed.com</a>), compatible with Wordpress 2.9+, jQuery, Drupal and other software. It will provide embeds:</p>
<ol>
<li>That are accessible to those with disabilities,</li>
<li>That are usable on mobiles and tablet devices, eg. iPad,</li>
<li>On behalf of niche services, eg. LAMS,</li>
<li>That incorporate analytics/ tracking, eg. Google Analytics, Piwik.</li>
</ol>
<p>The four points above are what will differentiate the service from Embed.ly and Oohembed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed version 1 services: YouTube, LAMS, Prezi, Google Docs forms (priorities for OULDI).</li>
<li>Likely version 2 services: <a href="http://www.mathtran.org/">Mathtran.org (OU)</a>, <a href="http://cohere.open.ac.uk/">Cohere.open.ac.uk (OU)</a>, <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">MIT Scratch</a>.</li>
<li>Relates to: this project will build on my prototype at <a href="http://maltwiki.org/">Maltwiki.org</a>, and work through <a href="http://olnet.org/node/142">OLnet</a>. It relates to <a title="Open University Learning Design Initiative" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/OULDI/">OULDI</a>/Cloudworks, and the <a href="http://freear.org.uk/content/ou-media-player-project">OU media player project</a>.</li>
<li>Use: I envisage that the service will be used by OU and third-party blogs and web sites. I will be proposing a <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> filter plugin for oEmbed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A note on terms and conditions</p>
<p>There will be terms and conditions that state that the OU makes no claims on the intellectual property of service providers like YouTube and Prezi or their contributors. We simply provide a conduit, and act on behalf of the service providers. They should also state that we do NOT store content or software (eg. Flash) from the service providers, except where the content is released under a permissive license (eg. LAMS sequences are Creative Commons licensed, so we may cache copies of LAMS SVG files).</p>
<p>More soon! Feedback welcome.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Tony <a href="http://blog.ouseful.info/2011/02/06/the-most-accessible-media-player-on-the-web/">Hirst has just blogged</a> about the Office for Disability Issues new accessible media player AKA the "Most Accessible Media Player on the Web". Both he and <a href="http://technocrapy.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/are-waterfalls-agile/">Will Woods</a> have alluded to work that The Open University is undertaking. I thought I'd fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>The OU is at the start of a 6 month development to create a multimedia player that (we hope):</p>
<ol>
<li>Will be an "attractive" player that the average designer/ blogger would be happy to use on their site. </li>
<li>Can be used in a variety of contexts - our Moodle-based virtual learning environment, OpenLearn, OU-Drupal sites, blogs, Cloudworks... </li>
<li>Will deliver content mostly from the OU podcast site in the contexts mentioned above. </li>
<li>Will be accessible to users with disabilities - both in terms of control, and display of alternatives like transcripts and captions. </li>
<li>Usable on a variety of devices, including mobiles and tablets. </li>
<li>Will be delivered in a maintainable way. </li>
</ol>
<p>Taking points 1 and 2 together, my personal mantra is "<em>If its accessible, but not attractive then we haven't succeeded</em>". So we are talking unobtrusive accessibility.</p>
<p>Taking the final point regarding delivery. The main method for embedding the player, will be using a REST-ful web service, based on the <a href="http://oembed.com/">oEmbed specification</a>. This service is available for many providers, including YouTube, Flickr, Slideshare, Vimeo... See the <a href="http://oohembed.com/">oohEmbed</a> and <a href="http://api.embed.ly/">Embedly</a> sites. This will be transparent to the end-user and the author of content. An author on a Wordpress blog will merely type something like:</p>
<pre> [embed] <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/pod/mst209-fun-of-the-fair#079b8e506c">http://podcast.open.ac.uk/pod/mst209-fun-of-the-fair#079b8e506c</a> [/embed]
</pre>
<p>The blog software will handle the rest. oEmbed is used or consumed by various software/sites, including <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds">Wordpress 2.9 onwards</a>, the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/noradio/status/24790949420">new Twitter</a>, Ars Technica, StatusNet, and our own Cloudworks/ <a title="Cloudworks open-sourced" href="http://getcloudengine.org//wiki/oEmbed">CloudEngine</a>. Many multimedia providers can be plugged in with little effort, a great benefit, so authors will be able to embed from YouTube, Flickr and OU-podcast in the same way. The promotion of a service-based approach does not preclude bloggers from using conventional embed codes/snippets.</p>
<p>The player itself will probably be Flash-based on desktops, and will fallback to HTML5 for tablets and mobiles. This is dictated by the encoding infrastructure on the podcast site, and the current state of the various video and audio codecs.</p>
<p>The controls/ buttons for the player will be HTML and Javascript-based, not Flash-based. This follows examples like Chris Heilmann's <a href="http://icant.co.uk/easy-youtube/?http://youtube.com/watch?v=uBdwM7oQivk">Easy YouTube player</a>, and builds on my own <a href="http://maltwiki.org/">MALT Wiki prototype</a> (MALT Wiki is used by Cloudworks, and is oEmbed-based).</p>
<p>We will be using third-party Flash and Javascript components where possible, and implementing the player and web service.</p>
<p>As to the evaluations that we have done. Back in March 2009, I evaluated players including YouTube, Easy YouTube, jwPlayer, NCAM's ccPlayer and Flowplayer. See <a href="http://slideshare.net/nfreear/malt-wiki-techshare2009/18">slide 18 of this presentation</a> and <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AgJMkdi3MO4HdFNDdElzUUhMejAzaWZoMFJ0emw3a0E&hl=en_GB&single=true&gid=1&output=html">this spreadsheet</a>. I tested with screen readers (JAWS, and <a href="http://nvda-project.org/">NVDA</a>), and also compared APIs for the players (how "scriptable" they were), licenses and so on.</p>
<p>As part of the current player project I wrote a design brief with screen shots of various existing players outside and inside the OU. This included YouTube, EasyYouTube and the <a href="http://www.officefordisability.gov.uk/inclusive-communications/channels/odi-accessible-media-player.php">ODI media player</a> - a late addition. It was not an evaluation per se. It instead presented what was out there - we may want to use some features, we may not.</p>
<p>In the current project plan, we have built in accessibility testing, using expert evaluation. And we hope to do testing with real users too, using the <a href="http://jennielee.open.ac.uk/labs/">Jennie Lee laboratories</a>.</p>
<p>I'll conclude by saying that we hope the player will be accessible and will meet the needs of authors/ bloggers and end users. I don't think we will claim to be "the most accessible player on the Web". After all that sets you up for a world of criticism!</p>
<p>Feedback and ideas are as ever welcome.</p>]]></description>

              <title>OU Media Player - consistent, accessible HTML5 multimedia?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6470</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6470</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Proposal version 2</p>
<p>I suggest that the presentation will fit with point 6A of the call - "How to make specific technology accessible, such as: Videos in Flash and HTML 5" (http://a11yldn.org.uk/2012/07/a11yldn12-call-for-contribution.html)</p>
<h2>OU Media Player - consistent, accessible HTML5 multimedia?</h2>
<p>The Open University uses a wide variety of audio and video players embedded across a range of web sites and applications, for example it's student-facing virtual learning environment (VLE), open educational resources published on OpenLearn (<a href="http://open.edu/openlearn/">www.open.edu/openlearn</a>), the course prospectus, OU Podcasts (<a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/">podcast.open.ac.uk</a>) and so on. Each of these is integrated independently, and has a different look and feel, branding and level of accessibility for those with disabilities. Furthermore, the distributed nature of the web sites and embeds means that they are a challenge to upgrade.</p>
<p>Faced with these challenges, the OU Media Player project set out to find a means to deliver a consistent player experience across the University's web sites. The outcome is an online player which is built on and extends an open source third-party HTML5 media library. It employs a service-based approach to embedding, the oEmbed specification and iframes. And it features keyboard accessibility, support for mobiles, transcripts, captions and popout player functionality.</p>
<p>The presentation will explore the challenges and constraints that the project has faced, the development and testing process, and the progress to date. The OU Media Player project will be set in the context of the University's Securing Greater Accessibility (SeGA) initiative.</p>
<p>There will be an opportunity to discuss the potential impact of the project on the wider community, including possible open source contributions.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Its been a long time since I've blogged about the <a href="http://freear.org.uk/content/ou-media-player-project">OU Media Player project</a>. So what has been going on?  I thought I'd take a brief look back, then look forward...</p>
<h3>Last spring - 2011</h3>
<p>Last spring and summer we developed an embeddable player based on the <a href="http://flowplayer.org/">open-source Flowplayer Flash-based toolkit</a>. Two designers form Learning and Teaching Solutions here at The Open University, David Winter and Peter Devine created to bold and attractive designs or themes.</p>
<p>The 2011 player hit many of the original aims of the project, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li> Developed for a number of contexts, with different requirements - OUVLE, OpenLearn, public sites with OU-Podcast media assets, </li>
<li> Accessible, including to screen reader and keyboard users - we ran two rounds of user-testing (I should explore whether these reports can be published), </li>
<li> Easily embeddable via oEmbed, and delivered in a maintainable way. </li>
</ul>
<p>However, it also fell down on a number of points:</p>
<ul>
<li> The implementation of the designs contained a number of CSS alignment bugs, which proved hard to solve, </li>
<li>The bold, 'big' nature of the themes took some people by surprise. There are some VLE pages which contain a large number of audio players (the design team had not realised this - preparation and communication is key!),  and the design didn't work in this context, </li>
<li> There wasn't full screen functionality, due to a combination of a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8309086/calling-as3-fullscreen-with-javascript">a Flash security restriction</a>,  and Flowplayer's implementation, </li>
<li> There remained some bugs on mobile/tablet devices, chiefly Android, </li>
</ul>
<p>The first two points proved decisive, and the player was not launched for the VLE or other sites in summer 2011. I and my colleagues moved on to other projects.</p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>On reflection, there were several lessons to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li> The VLE variant was added to the project after initial requirements gathering, and some of the issues around multiple audio players on VLE pages weren't picked up, </li>
<li> Developing a common player with different variants (VLE, podcast/public, OpenLearn) added to the complexity, </li>
<li> We had not talked to key stakeholders at critical points in the design phase, </li>
</ul>
<p>Happily though this isn't the end of the story...</p>
<h3>Phase 2 - 2012</h3>
<p>In December 2011 we developed a phase 2 deployment plan, which put in more skaffolding:</p>
<ul>
<li> Defined development and consultation phases, </li>
<li> A date for sign-off of the design by key stakeholders, </li>
<li> Better defined and closer collaboration, particularly with LTS, </li>
<li> More testing, </li>
<li> A steering group, </li>
<li> Roll-out to the VLE in June 2012, </li>
<li> Roll-out to other OU sites starting shortly after. </li>
</ul>
<p>We have a challenging timetable given our other commitments, but we are keeping to schedule. Watch this space!</p>
<h3>Technical review and tasks</h3>
<p>We are working through a number of technical development tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. We reviewed our use of Flowplayer, and after consultation and based on a tip from my colleague Guy Carberry, we are moving to Mediaelement.js. This has a number of benefits: </li>
<li>**  It is a HTML5-based solution, so is more future-proof. Flash is not a 'second-class' citizen though, </li>
<li>**  There is a fullscreen solution, including for Flash - yay! </li>
<li>**  It is more accessible than some of the HTML5 media libraries that I've explored, though there are issues, </li>
<li>**  It is modular and very easy to extend, so accessibility problems can be fixed. And it is open-source and actively developed, </li>
<li>**  Better support for mobiles and tablets, </li>
<li>**  It requires either jQuery or Ender. We don't really want a jQuery-based solution, as our VLE is Moodle-based, uses YUI, and research indicates that a   <a title="Search: 'How many users view Yahoo! pages with a full cache'" href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/04/performance-research-part-2/">surprisingly high proportion of users may view pages with an empty cache</a>.  Ender is a smaller, modular solution when compared to the monolithic jQuery (Ender support is currently less mature), </li>
<li>**  Also on the performance front, Mediaelement implements a build and minification process, and it is structured with this in mind, </li>
<li>**  The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14g0Qbh5CB8YhQWSQ-0MyBN4aumKbmRYJ2NLO3auC8QI/edit">consultation notes are on Google Docs</a>. </li>
<li>2. We are working to so that no variants of the player (VLE, OU-podcast..) require direct database access. For the OU-podcast variant,  we are building on work by LTS colleague Jamie Daniels from last summer, to implement a loosely-coupled feed-based access.  In time, we can publish documentation for the RSS extensions that the player requires. </li>
<li>3. Re-structuring the code base so that it will be easier to support and maintain.  Mediaelement.js will be defined as an 'engine' for the player (Flowplayer will be retained as a legacy engine).  Themes will use an engine, and there will be 'engines' and 'themes directories. </li>
<li>4. Implementation of the new design as a theme. AS we did last summer, we are using sprites to reduce HTTP requests.  We've been quite impressed with the <a href="http://spritegen.website-performance.org/">online CSS Sprite Generator</a>.</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The university has a long history of evaluating its courses and technology.&nbsp; The Jennie Lee Labs provide excellent facilities for conducting usability and accessibility evaluations with students face-to-face, but as our students are studying at a distance, and the majority do not live within easy travelling distance of the Walton Hall campus, it would be useful to be able to also conduct evaluations at a distance.&nbsp; This project is investigating a range of software solutions and evaluating their suitability for conducting remote evaluations.&nbsp; At this Technology Coffee Morning we will report on our findings.<br /><br />See my accessibility bookmarks at: <a title="http://delicious.com/tags/ChetzColwell" href="http://delicious.com/tags/ChetzColwell">http://delicious.com/tags/ChetzColwell</a></p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello Cloudworkers</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are interested in video/media in education we invite you to join <strong>ViTAL: video in education</strong>, a new Special Interest Group (SIG) of <a href="https://www.outlook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=262ecb912f2a4d67b1068a017dca640e&URL=http://www.alt.ac.uk/sigs.html" target="_blank"> ALT</a> and <a href="https://www.outlook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=262ecb912f2a4d67b1068a017dca640e&URL=http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/detail/ourwork/learningandtech/aboutsectornetworksandsigs" target="_blank"> HEA</a>.</p>
<p>ViTAL  aims to address the growing interest we see at DIVERSE and other forums  in the use of digital video and media especially in tertiary education  in the UK and beyond.</p>
<p>You can get involved in the SIG directly via our Ning site (<a href="https://www.outlook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=262ecb912f2a4d67b1068a017dca640e&URL=http://vital-sig.ning.com" target="_blank">http://vital-sig.ning.com</a>).   This is the platform for discussion, and sharing ideas and thoughts  about the various issues surrounding the use of video within education,  such as pedagogical/ technical/ legal issues and accessibility.</p>
<p>We also plan to run a number of videoconference discussions over the next few months and a live event in London next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These will only be accessible via the Ning site.</p>
<p>ViTAL therefore invites you to join our online community and contribute to the current discussion topics and/or create your own  topics.</p>
<p>The SIG also runs a wiki (<a href="https://www.outlook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=262ecb912f2a4d67b1068a017dca640e&URL=http://alt-vie-sig.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank">http://alt-vie-sig.wikispaces.com/</a>)  and this will be used to publish articles which have come out of discussion. We&rsquo;d really like to update and republish the Click and Go video article from a few years ago <a href="https://www.outlook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=262ecb912f2a4d67b1068a017dca640e&URL=http://www.scribd.com/doc/24123319/Video-Streaming-a-guide-for-educational-development" target="_blank"> http://www.scribd.com/doc/24123319/Video-Streaming-a-guide-for-educational-development</a>, but we can only do this with your help.</p>
<p>We  value your expertise and experience and hope you will be able to  contribute your ideas and feedback. We look forward to seeing  you online.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>John Conway, Imperial College London</p>
<p>Phil Tubman, Lancaster University</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Ted Page, Director, PWS</p>
<p>The 'Solving pdf accessibility' workshop is aimed at content authors and editors but will also appeal to managers and others responsible for accessibility compliance. It will also provide useful guidance to those responsible for procuring annual reports/glossy brochures etc from external designers/typesetters as well as to those needing to produce quick, easy, cheap and accessible forms.</p>
<p>This session will include discussion of many simple techniques that delegates will be able to put to use straight away as well as relating those techniques to compliance with WCAG 2.0.</p>
<p>Ted Page is a director of PWS web editorial services. He is a former BBC web producer and member of the Corporation's web accessibility working group. He now regularly trains BBC departments, public sector bodies, graphic design companies/typesetters, charities and others in accessible PDF production techniques.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Chair: Julie Howell, Associate, Headstar<br />Rachel Sefton Smith, Quality and Accessibility Manager, Brightwave<br />John Sewell, Trustee, Rix Centre&nbsp;<br />Andy Tasker, Managing Director, Concept Live</p>
<p>Increasingly, education, learning and training at all levels, from school work to workplace training and higher education, makes use of digital technologies such as electronic text-books, websites and e-learning modules as part of the course materials. This raises important accessibility issues, which become issues of access to learning itself by people with disabilities.</p>
<p>In this workshop our speakers will look at some case studies in this area, including the development of accessible e-learning software and the development of 'e-portfolios' for learners with special needs, and discuss the general issues raised and the implications for learners of all ages.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Chair - Nigel Lewis, Chief Executive, AbilityNet&nbsp;<br />Dr Jean Irvine OBE, Commissioner, Equality and Human Rights Commission</p>
<p>Our high-level panel will discuss why organisations - public, private and third sector - should bother with accessibility for their employees and the clients that they serve. The panellists will consider areas such as return on investment, the social justification, your legal obligations and the benefits for organisations that take accessibility seriously.</p>
<p>So whether you think accessibility is not important to your organisation, just starting out or are well on the way, we will aim to offer practical and pragmatic reasons for adopting and embedding accessibility into your organisation.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm happy to say that there is now an alpha web service to look at,</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_jU8d1WdVVKA/SrEV8UrJtrI/AAAAAAAAAzo/TgZZHzuvJ0Q/Brian_Mcallister_OLnet_1253115046712.png" alt="Screenshot of the new MALT player, showing an OLnet video" /></p>
<p>This demonstrates some of the key features:</p>
<ol>
<li>A small collection of captioned video - dialogues can be styled to indicate the speaker, for example by aligning and colouring the captions.</li>
<li>Transcripts where captions are not available.</li>
<li>An accessible Flash media player - currently only for captioned video.</li>
<li>A multi-lingual user interface - <a hreflang="fr" href="http://maltwiki.org/frame?lang=fr&url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=VesKht_8HCo">French (hover on the buttons)</a>.</li>
<li>Full integration with oEmbed, so that a blogger or content creator need only write,
<pre>   
  &lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
  &lt;script src="http://maltwiki.org/scripts/jquery.oembed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;a class="embed" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=VesKht_8HCo"&gt;Roadtrip nation&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
- this is converted by the blog software and the MALT Wiki web service into the necessary embed code. This same syntax can be used to embed Slideshare presentations, Flickr photos and so on.</li>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1670</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[Nick Freear described an approach to making video more accessible through captioning of video. This can appear to be a solved problem with youtube supporting the use of captions (but only added by the author and not accessible), the OU producing transcripts - but not captions, a range of accessible players - but none doing the whole job. Nick's suggested way forward is collective approach demonstrated through dotSUB a site where anyone can add their own captions and multiple captions are possible.

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
The fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) project is the Australian government's response to the national broadband network (NBN) tender. The tender ended with no winner as prime minister Kevin Rudd announced the FTTH project, which will be run by a company made up of a partnership between the government and the private sector. It is of interest to the education sector since many education tools are reliant on web 2.0 technology and broadband accessibility.
