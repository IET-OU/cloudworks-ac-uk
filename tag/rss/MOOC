<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Project Title &ndash; <strong><em>Designing a mini-MOOC for Assessor Training on the verification systems in Further Education&rsquo;.</em></strong></p>
<p>MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have been well established in Higher Education (HE) and for many studies this has been the primary focus (Andreatos, 2015; Evans et al., 2016).</p>
<p>However, few studies have empirically examined the influence of MOOCs in an organisational setting and more research is required to explore how MOOCs affect employee learning and development in the workplace (Dodson et al., 2015; Egloffstein and Ifenthaler, 2017).</p>
<p>With this notion research has shown the transformation of MOOC initiatives progressively moving towards the more corporate training and development sectors (Savino, 2014). According to Savino (2014) corporate leaders and training professionals have become aware how MOOCs can <em>&lsquo;supplement and support corporate training&rsquo;</em> (Savino, 2014, p. 59). Drawing on the study conducted by Savino (2014) the paper examines how MOOCs are used in both HE and corporate training and learning.&nbsp; Further prompting the idea that this method could be used in training employees (Weiss, 2013), I have taken these viewpoints to further add support to my rationale in conducting this activity and the impetus on staff development.</p>
<p>The H818 Online conference theme will focus on innovation and the scope of my idea will discuss the viability of using mini-MOOCs for training and professional development purposes.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to design a mini-MOOC to train assessors on the verification systems used in the context of a Further Education setting. The intention of bridging the skills gap in staff and promoting further development for staff to eventually become internal verifiers for the school.&nbsp; The demonstration will involve discussing elements of layout and themes from an adapted MOOC idea to create a multimedia presentation using Adobe Spark to create slides of my proposed mini-MOOC design. Furthermore, uploading the video presentation to a YouTube platform. There is scope to use Canvas which builds on the idea of teaching and learning with its &lsquo;intuitive&rsquo; interface which increases its adoption and appeal to any developer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically, it has shown that expensive, offsite training had proved ineffective, due to the lack of external support given by some awarding bodies. As Lead Internal Verifier for my centre and providing face to face training, this also presented itself with many challenges.&nbsp; For example, poor staff turnout to the sessions due to work commitments, collaboration not effectively used and some staff reluctant to share ideas.&nbsp; Therefore, due to time and staff commitment issues, looking at openness through the lens of innovation can potentially help to deliver a more innovative form of training and worth exploring.</p>
<p>Training materials will be resourced from the awarding body amalgamated with my own resources to provide the project materials in my design.&nbsp; It is likely that I will be faced with several pedagogical challenges, such as the reluctance for participants to share more openly.&nbsp; Therefore, further research into using situated &lsquo;Design Patterns&rsquo; is paramount to seek possible solutions to such issues (Liyanagunawardena et al., 2015).</p>

<p>Learner motivation is a primary driver of behavior in MOOCs or any other educational settings. In our previously studied MOOCs, nearly all learners have exhibited strong intrinsic motivation, as they generally were specifically interested in learning the course content itself, independent of external benefits. While demographics are frequently collected to better understand learners, an alternative measure of motivation is necessary to adequately discern between individual learners. One potentially promising measure of motivation for MOOC learners is the Expectancy-Value-Cost (EVC) Scale, which is intended to measure learners&rsquo; beliefs about their abilities to be successful in a course, the value of that course, and the costs of achieving success in that course. Previous applications of the EVC instrument have been conducted with children and adolescents in face-to-face learning contexts, but these constructs may be particularly relevant for MOOC learners with more pressing needs and constraints. We examined the psychometric properties of the EVC scale in the older, more diverse population of our advanced technological MOOCs (n = 407). Specifically, we studied learners in two MOOCs offered through the edX platform: Principles of Electronic Biosensors and Nanophotonic Modeling. This research applied several psychometric analyses, including exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, invariance analysis, and item response theory, using learner responses to EVC items on the pre-course surveys. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis results indicate that the factor structure found in previously studied populations for the EVC instrument is maintained for our MOOC learners. At the same time, measurement invariance analyses suggest that the interpretation of each factor may vary slightly across different subpopulations. Further, the item response theory analyses suggest that some items provide stronger information about the EVC scale for MOOC learners than other items. Our results are expected to guide modifications to this scale in order to improve weak or inconsistent item functioning for use in future MOOCs.</p>]]></description>

<p><br />As research on MOOCs continues to mature, findings are indicating MOOCs as deepening rather than widening access to education. Further, research on MOOCs is largely concentrated in the West, with over 90% of MOOC research emerging from North America, Europe and Oceania (Veletsianos and Shepherdson 2016). This indicates a need for further research on MOOC learners and their perspectives from non-Western contexts. <br /> <br />This presentation will share results from a study on Indian learners' demographics and experiences on two MOOC platforms - FutureLearn (UK) and NPTEL (India), using results from a survey of 2500 learners, with follow-up interviews with 30 learners. The study found significant differences in demographic profiles and motivations of learners between the two platforms, while interviews revealed unique methods in which MOOCs were used, as well as the technical and contextual challenges that learners faced, and how they overcame these challenges to make the most of the resources of the MOOC. <br /> <br />Finally, this presentation will provide a holistic look at how MOOCs are being used in the Indian context by varied groups of learners, followed by a discussion of the potential role MOOCs can play in improving higher education in India.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Investigating Dialogic Learning and Teaching in MOOCs: An Applied Linguistics Approach</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10493</link>

<p>Dialogic learning and teaching has been promoted in recent years as an effective instruction method in both classrooms and online discussion (Mercer, 2013; Coffin, 2013). However, most research on MOOC discussions (Wise et al., 2016; Kellogg et al., 2014) has used content analysis or topic modelling to analyze discussion postings, and focused mainly on learners&rsquo; network. This research has provided a categorical view on individual discussion postings, despite the fact that dialogues (or discussions) transverse multiple postings. <br />To investigate the dialogic nature within a conversation, assuming that a conversation is initiated by a post and comprises all the replies received, learners&rsquo; comments in each step of a FutureLearn course were classified into five types based on conversational structures. This classification revealed whether an initiator or a replying learner repeatedly come back to a conversation or whether a conversation consisted of replies all contributed by unique learners. <br />This preliminary analysis led to research questions on how learners&rsquo; and educators&rsquo; language may invite more replies or shut off continuing dialogues, how learners rebut and engage in repeated turn-takings within a single conversation, and how learners address their target reply amid a long list of replies(polylogues). Addressing these questions will provide concrete and more nuanced suggestions for both learners and educators on how best to write their comments in discussion. To achieve this goal, an applied linguistic approach that incorporates systemic functional linguistic, conversation analysis and corpus analysis will be utilized to reveal useful linguistic devices and lexical bundles in asynchronous discussion. Elements of argumentation genre and sociocultural theory may also be used to zone in on dialogic learning. Similar approach may also be applied to learning objects and discussion prompts to understand the best practice of learning designs. This research will have implication in dialogic learning literature, which has been mainly on classroom learning so far.</p>

              <title>What are the expectations of disabled learners when participating in a MOOC?</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/fi364.html" target="_blank">Francisco Iniesto</a>, <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/pm526.html" target="_blank">Patrick McAndrew</a>, <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/sm577.html" target="_blank">Shailey Minocha</a> and <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/view/person/tc6295.html" target="_blank">Tim Coughlan</a></p>
<p>Open education can provide opportunities at scale for lifelong learning amongst currently underserved populations, such as those with disabilities. In comparison to other online learning opportunities MOOCs have potentially beneficial characteristics such as: open access within a structured learning framework, low cost of learning, flexibility to allow individual planning in terms of the learner&rsquo;s time and preferred pace and place, opportunities for social learning, as well as scope to gain knowledge. <br />Despite this potential suitability as an approach to support disabled learners, there is limited research to understand accessibility and MOOCs, and on the expectations of disabled MOOC learners. This presentation outlines a preliminary study to analyse existing pre- and post-study survey data from MOOCs offered by the Open University on the FutureLearn platform, to understand the expectations of disabled learners participating in MOOCs. The quantitative study reported in this presentation is a part of a wider research programme to investigate the current accessibility of MOOCs, the processes through which this accessibility is achieved, and the potential use of data to improve MOOC accessibility. This study aims to understand the current expectations of disabled learners when taking part in MOOCs. <br />Limitations to this analysis are that it was undertaken with a small number of MOOC presentations, and that a simple disability marker may not reflect diversity within the population. It should not be assumed that these results generalise to the whole of the disabled learner population, or that this population is homogenous in nature. Nevertheless, some preliminary findings and future work can be drawn for further investigation.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Audrey Watters; Class Central; Steve Parkinson; Donald Clark]</em></p>
<p>US researchers looking at MOOC enrolments, engagement, persistence and completion report counterintuitive findings that may help us better understand <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/journal_of_higher_education/v087/87.2.evans.html">the drop-out problem</a>. &nbsp;Having analysed 2.1m students&rsquo; participation in 2,900 lectures from 44 (mostly STEM) Coursera MOOCs, their key findings were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students who signed up 1-3 weeks before the course started demonstrated highest levels of persistence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strongest predictor of course completion was the student&rsquo;s willingness to take a pre-survey (12 percentage points more likely to complete)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students with Gmail or .edu email addresses showed worse persistence than students with other email addresses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Videos posted earlier in the week were more likely to be watched than those posted later in the week (although length of video seemed to have no impact on viewing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emails from instructors to students about new course material were ineffective in getting students to watch more</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some students were also asked which of three tracks they intended to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quantitative track (with weekly quizzes and maths based problems)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qualitative track (weekly quizzes and a final project)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auditing (watch the videos but not expected to complete assignments)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Quantitative were 20 percentage point more likely to complete than auditors, and qualitative were nearly 10 percentage points more likely to earn a certificate relative to auditors (and more likely to watch additional videos).</p>
<p>Researchers can now access anonymised <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/03/02/instructure-opens-up-canvas-network-data.aspx">learning data from 238 MOOCs</a> hosted on the Canvas Network. &nbsp;Canvas has taken the initiative to support research on online course design, large-scale informal learning and more, making data available from more than 325,000 aggregate records for MOOCs run from Jan 14 to Sep 15.</p>
<p>Hats off to George Veletsianos and Peter Shepherdson for their <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2448/3655">Systematic Analysis and Synthesis of the Empirical MOOC Literature Published in 2013&ndash;2015</a>, published in IRRODL.&nbsp; Among their findings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Researchers favour a quantitative approach, preferring to collect data via surveys and automated methods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some qualitative/interpretive research was evident (e.g. interviews, observations) but it was often basic and very much in the minority</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is only limited research on instructor-related topics (e.g. motivations, perceptions) or learner sub-populations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than 80% of papers are published by individuals based in North America and Europe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearly half of all MOOC papers are cited zero times</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Coursera is piloting <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/coursera-mentor-guided-courses/">Mentor-Guided Courses</a> where, for $248, you will be able to work with a professional who is current in the industry.&nbsp; Students who sign up get 1:1 project feedback, email/forum support and access to live weekly office hours.&nbsp; There are currently ten mentor-guided courses, each is 3&ndash;4 weeks long and has 50 slots for mentor/mentee guidance.</p>
<p>The proceedings of last month&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293884848_Proceedings_of_the_European_Stakeholder_Summit_on_experiences_and_best_practices_in_and_around_MOOCs_EMOOCS_2016">European Stakeholder Summit on experiences and best practices in and around MOOCs</a> have just been published, containing 44 papers (279pp) covering MOOC pedagogies, management and support; and MOOC learners, expectations and behaviours.</p>
<p>Learning World compares <a href="http://www.euronews.com/2016/03/04/moocs-vital-tools-that-are-shaping-the-future-of-education-or-over-hyped-online/">the MOOC situation in China and the UK</a>, examining how learners are engaging with successful courses and why just a small fraction of these are providing enough inspiration, information and motivation for students to see them through to the end.&nbsp; Donald Clark shunned the allure of China and focussed instead on <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/7-ways-to-design-sticky-moocs.html">Derby</a>, discussing seven ways on which designers made their dementia MOOC more &lsquo;sticky&rsquo;, thus upping persistence and yielding completion rates of around 35%.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t worry if you can&rsquo;t achieve persistence &ndash; Donald contends that <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/moocs-course-completion-is-wrong-measure.html">completion is the wrong measure anyway</a>: &ldquo;775 learners [of the Dementia MOOC] were asked whether they expected to fully engage with the course, 477 said yes but 258 stated that they did not intend to complete. &nbsp;This showed that people come to MOOCs with different intentions.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; The Guardian; University World News]</em></p>
<p>The OU&rsquo;s latest accounts show that it ran up a &pound;7.2m deficit in 2014-15 (2012-14: &pound;16.9m).&nbsp; This was described as &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; but &ldquo;not entirely unexpected&rdquo; as the total number of <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/open-university-posts-ps7m-loss-student-numbers-slump">students signed up for OU courses fell</a> by 13,449 (7.2%) year-on-year, to 173,889.&nbsp; This represents a fall of a third from a high of 260,119 six years earlier.&nbsp; But is there any good news?&nbsp; The OU predicts surpluses this year and next, and PA Consulting&rsquo;s Mike Boxall believes the gradual erosion of the three-year residential degree as the dominant model of higher education could &ldquo;play to [the OU&rsquo;s] strengths&rdquo;, but warned that the university&rsquo;s progress in this area was &ldquo;not very visible yet&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Despite the OU&rsquo;s woes, data from Hesa shows that HE providers in England spent a combined &pound;25.9bn and took in a total of &pound;27.7bn for a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/03/tuition-fees-england-universities-surplus-balance">&pound;1.8bn surplus for 2014-15</a> &ndash; well above the &pound;1.1bn recorded each year in 2013-14 and 2012-13.&nbsp; Fattest of the fat cats were Oxford, with a surplus of &pound;191m, Imperial (&pound;143m) and Liverpool (&pound;65m).</p>
<p>A letter signed by 103 UK vice-chancellors and published in the Sunday Times just after the Cameron/EU agreement last month <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160222154614771">argues firmly for Britain to remain in the EU</a>.&nbsp; It cites easier access to collaborative research partnerships and research funding, plus employment of European academic expertise in UK HEIs as compelling reasons to retain membership.&nbsp; UUK&rsquo;s Dame Julia Goodfellow said, &ldquo;Outside the EU, we risk cutting ourselves off from unique support and networks and undermining the UK&rsquo;s position as a global leader in science and innovation&rdquo;.&nbsp; Universities for Europe calculates that students from other EU countries generate around &pound;2.27 billion for the UK economy and support 19,000 British jobs.&nbsp; Horst Hippler, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/brexit-would-be-catastrophe-he-europe-warn-germans">president of the German Rectors&rsquo; Conference</a> (equivalent to UUK), told THE, &ldquo;To have Britain no longer belonging to the EU would be a disaster for international research in Europe.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Prof Philippe Moreillon, vice-rector of research and international relations at University of Lausanne warns that <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160301160004464">Swiss HE and research suffered</a> following its referendum which supported restrictions on free movement of people from other EU countries, with Swiss universities finding themselves &ldquo;kicked out&rdquo; of EU collaborative partnerships such as Erasmus and the incoming Horizon 2020 research programme.</p>
<p>In just four years, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160302191444908">the number of Indian students at UK HEIs has halved</a>, from 40,000 to 19,500.&nbsp; By contrast the number of Indians studying in the US has risen by 29% since 2010 and increases are also being seen in Canada, Australia, Germany and France.&nbsp; Only two UK universities, Edinburgh and Aston, seem to be bucking the trend.</p>

<p>From last month&rsquo;s IRRODL, <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2342/3647">should instructors require discussion in online courses?</a>&nbsp; One instructor taught the same online course for three consecutive semesters using three different conditions: no online discussion; discussion without instructor participation; and discussion with active instructor participation.&nbsp; For the three components of <em>Community of Inquiry</em> (Arbaugh et al, 2008), no significant differences were found between the three conditions in respect of cognitive presence or teaching presence, but there was a significant difference in social presence for the two discussion groups.&nbsp; However, no significant differences were found between conditions in terms of time spent in the VLE, course satisfaction or student achievement.</p>

<p>And then along came <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> &ndash; an online communication platform launched two years ago which now has more than 2.3m users logging 100m collective hours on the platform per month.&nbsp; It facilitates an online version of watercooler conversations, enabling people to trade information and chat informally with colleagues.&nbsp; It allows for threads, private groups, direct messages, file uploads, commenting, integration with common social media tools and syncing across devices.&nbsp; Might it be the game changer that online education has been waiting for?&nbsp; Read how +Acumen runs <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-03-04-could-slack-be-the-next-online-learning-platform?utm_content=buffer33495&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">successful online seminars</a> with it.</p>

<p><strong>Spritz </strong></p>
<p><em>[Jonathan Darch]</em></p>
<p>I first mentioned the <a href="http://spritzinc.com/">Spritz</a> speed-reading tool in Mar 14, but had my doubts as to whether a relentless torrent of text was compatible with meaningful HE study. However, forum comments suggest at least one OU computing student is using it successfully.</p>

<p><strong>New Learning Analytics Book</strong></p>
<p><em>[Fridolin Wild]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.springer.com/in/book/9783319287898">Learning Analytics in R with SNA, LSA, and MPIA</a> introduces Meaningful Purposive Interaction Analysis (MPIA) theory, which combines social network analysis (SNA) with latent semantic analysis (LSA) to help create and analyse a meaningful learning landscape from the digital traces left by a learning community in the co-construction of knowledge.&nbsp; The book provides comprehensive package-by-package application examples and code samples that will allow the reader to progress to using and building analytics to guide students and support decision-making in learning.</p>

<p><strong>3D Printing Project Transforms Public Library</strong></p>
<p><em>[Liz Mallett]</em></p>
<p>Croatia&rsquo;s Rijeka City Library has attempted to reverse 25 years of industrial decline by creating a lively community &lsquo;maker space&rsquo; equipped with technology for <a href="http://www.eifl.net/news/3d-printing-project-transforms-public-library-citys-premier-maker-space">3D printing</a> and computer coding, including 3D printers, laptops, design software and Raspberry Pi mini-computers. &nbsp;The library&rsquo;s 3D printing demonstrations reached 800 children and over 1,500 adults and inspired three more local organizations to install 3D printers and start designing and printing objects. &nbsp;Librarians also teamed with doctors and engineers to 3D print the prototype of an artificial limb for a patient with severe leg injuries.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[Peter Horrocks; The Independent; THE; Wonkhe; The Telegraph]</em></p>
<p>Government figures published at the end of last month, based on a survey of 90,000 organisations, show so-called <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/employers-facing-talent-poverty-as-skills-shortages-rise-130-in-four-years">skills shortage vacancies</a> now make up nearly a quarter of all job openings, having risen by 130% from 91,000 in 2011 to 209,000 in 2015.</p>
<p>The Government's HE spokesperson in the House of Lords, Baroness Evans said last month during a lengthy House of Lords debate that &ldquo;<a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/ouintra/story.aspx?id=29761">adult education and lifelong learning have a vital role in strengthening the UK's economy</a>&rdquo; and Baroness Shirley Williams said &ldquo;[the OU] enables people for the first time, all their lives long, to gain more education, understanding and wisdom&rdquo;.&nbsp; Following the distribution of OU briefing materials, cross-party Peers urged the Government to continue to focus on part-time HE in England and to create Individual Learning Accounts, relax ELQ restrictions and promote credit transfer.

<p>Perhaps one reason for Person&rsquo;s decline in UK vocational students is explained by last month&rsquo;s damning Ofsted report on its apprenticeship provision which found <a href="http://feweek.co.uk/2016/01/27/pearson-hit-with-inadequate-ofsted-report/">&ldquo;no key strengths&rdquo;</a>.&nbsp; The company provides apprenticeships for around 80 members of staff through its subcontractor Pearson TQ but inspectors report that, &ldquo;Too many apprentices drop out of learning or do not make sufficient progress to complete their programmes within the agreed timescale&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Pearson has notified its approx 110 customers of <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/learningstudio-openclass-end-life-pearson-getting-lms-market/">LearningStudio</a> that it will be shut down as a standalone LMS over the next 2-3 years.&nbsp; This comes on the back of an announcement last Sep that its OpenClass system will no longer be available as of Jan 18.&nbsp; A notice on the OpenClass front page proclaims, &ldquo;While the LMS will endure as an important piece of academic infrastructure, we believe our learning applications and services are truly &lsquo;where the learning happens&rsquo;. &nbsp;In short, withdrawing from the crowded LMS market allows us to concentrate on areas where we can make the biggest measurable impact on student learning outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was announced last week that the <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/3879416-apollo-education-groups-fire-sale">Apollo Education Group has successfully negotiated a $1.1bn sale</a> of itself to the Vistria Group, which is affiliated with Apollo Global Management, and the private investment firm Najafi Companies.&nbsp; The deal is expected to be concluded by Aug 2016.</p>
<p>Beijing-based TAL Education Group has invested an undisclosed amount in adaptive learning provider <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-01-24-tal-education-group-invests-in-knewton-to-integrate-adaptive-learning-engine-with-online-tutoring">Knewton</a> with the aim of integrating Knewton's adaptive learning engine into TAL's online tutoring platform, allowing TAL to develop proprietary digital adaptive content.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking Online Education in the United States</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>The 13<sup>th</sup> and last <a href="http://onlinelearningconsortium.org/read/online-report-card-tracking-online-education-united-states-2015/">Babson survey of US online education</a> has just been published.&nbsp; Key findings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(Unlike the UK) a year‐to‐year 3.9% increase in the number of distance education students (2014: +3.7%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28% of students (5.8m) now take at least one distance education course, and 2.9m of these are taking all of their courses at a distance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>71.4% of academic leaders rate the learning outcomes in online education as the&nbsp; same or superior to those in face‐to‐face instruction; however, only 29.1% report that their faculty accept the &ldquo;value and legitimacy&nbsp; of online education&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proportion of senior academic leaders saying that online learning is critical to their long‐ term strategy fell from 70.8% last year to 63.3% this year</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the greatest endorsement for online education is the fact that this will be the last such Babson report because the medium is now accepted as business-as-usual.</p>

<p><strong>From Bricks to Clicks</strong></p>
<p><em>[Doug Clow]</em></p>
<p>A new report from the Higher Education Commission, <a href="http://www.policyconnect.org.uk/hec/research/report-bricks-clicks-potential-data-and-analytics-higher-education">From Bricks to Clicks - The Potential of Data and Analytics in Higher Education</a>, examines data collection, learning analytics and the current barriers to implementing better data management and data analytics across UK HEIs.&nbsp; The Commission finds that UK institutions are currently not making the most of the opportunities in this area, concluding that the UK needs to do more to catch up with the US and Australia.&nbsp; The OU&rsquo;s Prof John Domingue can not only see huge potential for tracking student progress and providing study advice but he believes that once students paying thousands of pounds in fees realise the possibilities for their learning, they will start demanding it.</p>

<p><strong>Turnitin Launches Revision Assistant</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>Turnitin has launched <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/21/turnitin-expanding-beyond-plagiarism-detection-launches-revision-assistant">Revision Assistant</a> &ndash; an online writing tool that uses machine learning to tutor students as they draft their essays, giving them feedback in four areas: language, focus, organization and evidence.&nbsp; The tool marks the start of a &ldquo;realignment&rdquo; of Tunitin&rsquo;s offering and is based on a product from LightSide Labs, which it bought in 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Distractions</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed; Jisc]</em></p>
<p>Last month&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/26/study-use-devices-class-nonclass-purposes-rise">Digital Distractions in the Classroom</a> report found that students waste about one-fifth of class time on laptops, smartphones and tablets, even though they admit such behaviour can harm their grades.&nbsp; Students are distracted by texting, emailing and using social media on average 11.43 times in class during a typical day.&nbsp; About 63% of surveyed students said they did this to stay connected, but an equally large share of students said they are attempting to fight boredom. &nbsp;Students also overwhelmingly support using devices in the classroom, with about 90% of respondents saying devices should not be banned.</p>
<p>However, data from digital marketing agency Greenlight suggests that 24% of Brits now think that too much time on social media or digital devices negatively impacted their performance at work.&nbsp; Some 6% intend to use apps less, 5% will reduce the size of their social media networks and <a href="http://www.information-age.com/technology/mobile-and-networking/123460811/1-4-british-consumers-want-digital-detox-2016?utm_content=bufferffc57&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">3% are considering taking a full &lsquo;digital detox&rsquo; break</a> where the use of technology is banned.</p>

<p><strong>The Future is &lsquo;Detachable&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p><em>[Business Insider]</em></p>
<p>New Year, new hype.&nbsp; Lenovo has a cunning plan to deal with the continuing decline in PC sales.&nbsp; The company is betting on a new technology trend it calls <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/lenovos-executives-are-betting-big-that-detachables-will-be-the-next-giant-tech-trend-2016-1?r=US&IR=T">detachables</a>, and is making products it calls &ldquo;2-in-1&rdquo; and &ldquo;4-in-1&rdquo; solutions.&nbsp; Instead of having to buy both a tablet and a computer, for example, their products allow users to convert one product into many.&nbsp; Fun facts: the hinge on the new Yoga 900 Laptop is made from more than 800 parts and allows the device to operate in laptop, tablet, tent or stand mode.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Are Paper Books Really Disappearing?</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>BBC Future plots the fortunes of e-books, widely thought to have started when Peter James published his novel &lsquo;Host&rsquo; on two floppy disks in 1993, and wonders if printed books are, &ldquo;destined to eventually join the ranks of clay tablets, scrolls and typewritten pages, to be displayed in collectors&rsquo; glass cases with other curious items of the distant past?&rdquo;&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the conclusion is that it&rsquo;s not that simple because we see that different people engage with different forms of content in different ways.&nbsp; One suggestion is that a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160124-are-paper-books-really-disappearing">bi-literate society</a> will pervade, which values both the digital and printed word according to circumstances.</p>
<p>A separate BBC report notes that the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35441832#?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">use of e-books in UK schools is lower and more sporadic than in the US.</a>&nbsp;However, a recent National Literacy Trust project found that e-book use accelerated reading performance, slightly more so for boys and particularly in the case of &ldquo;reluctant readers&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>GitHub Classroom </strong></p>
<p><em>[Kristoff van Leeuwen]</em></p>
<p>GitHub is essentially a massive repository of code, best known and used by programmers.&nbsp; However, the organisation has now opened an education programme, <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">Classroom for GitHub</a>, which &ldquo;automates repository creation and access control, making it easy to distribute starter code and collect assignments on GitHub&rdquo;.&nbsp; This not only streamlines the process of managing users&rsquo; code but also means they are learning within the environment in which they will eventually work.</p>

<p>OpenLearn has topped an international <a href="http://www.mooclab.club/categories/league-tables.169/">open courseware provider league table</a> compiled by MoocLab.&nbsp; The table measures various aspects of open courseware providers including number of courses offered, partner institutions, social tools and features and interface usability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New York-based <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-01-26-panopen-launches-oer-platform-to-reduce-textbook-costs">panOpen has announced a learning platform exclusively based on OERs</a>. &nbsp;The company is running nearly 100 pilots with US colleges and universities, and its platform lets faculty curate and customise peer-reviewed content for free, while students pay $25 per course to access the materials.</p>
<p>According to Rice University, <a href="http://news.rice.edu/2016/01/20/openstax-already-saved-students-39-million-this-academic-year/">free textbooks from OpenStax</a> &ldquo;are now in use at one-in-five degree-granting US colleges and universities and have already saved college students $39m in the 2015-16 academic year&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Computers Widen Testing Gaps in Writing</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>In 2012, the US Dept of Education gave laptops to 10,000 fourth-graders for two 30-minute writing assignments, but a recent report compared those 2012s results with the same tests conducted in 2010 using pencil and paper.&nbsp; Whilst the top 20% of students scored better on the computer, the lowest 20% fared worse because they were less likely to have access to a computer and the Internet at home.&nbsp; There are now concerns about the <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-01-12-federal-study-finds-computers-widen-testing-gaps-in-writing?utm_content=buffer76266&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">impact on America's standardized testing</a> which, in 2015, was conducted on computers in more than half of US states.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Response Systems and Student Engagement</strong></p>

<p>Prof Stephanie Blackmon writes about her experiences of introducing a mobile personal response system, <a href="http://er.educause.edu/articles/2016/1/personal-response-systems-and-student-engagement">Poll Everywhere</a>, to allow students to report anonymously on their learning experiences.&nbsp; She initially found that students would express feelings and concerns via the poll that they had declined to raise face-to-face but, as they saw her responding to these in class, they became more open in expressing themselves.&nbsp; The tool also created opportunities for some simple but timely formative assessment.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; Stephen Downes; Audrey Watters; MIT, Fortune]</em></p>
<p>Six universities &ndash; Delft University of Technology; Swiss Federal Institute of Technology; the Australian National University; the University of Queensland; the University of British Columbia; and Boston University &ndash; are seeking to establish a new alliance in which each organisation&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/moocs-international-credit-transfer-system-edges-closer">MOOCs are formally accredited by partner institutions</a> in a scheme similar to the European Credit Transfer System.</p>
<p>According to Class Central, <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/moocs-2015-stats">more people signed up for MOOCs in 2015 than did so in the previous three years</a> and more than 500 organisations now offer 4,200 courses to which 35m students have signed up.&nbsp; Coursera remains the largest provider, accounting for around 50% of all MOOC students, followed by edX with FutureLearn in third (275% growth last year).&nbsp; However, when measured by course numbers, Canvas.net (291 courses) knocked FutureLearn into fourth place (239).&nbsp; Business &amp; management tops the list of course titles (705) followed by science (477) and social sciences (453).&nbsp; Computer science (410) and programming (313) have been split this year but, had that not been the case, they would have claimed the top spot.</p>
<p>Coursera has published its <a href="https://blog.coursera.org/post/135791038302/the-most-popular-courses-of-2015">top ten most popular MOOCs of 2015</a>, the top three being:</p>

<p>Udacity has announced a new programme that <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/With-New-Promise-by-Udacity/234911">guarantees its graduates will land a job in their field within six months of completion</a> &ndash; or their money back.&nbsp; However, enrolees are advised to read the small print: the offer only applies to its most marketable topics (machine-learning engineer, Android developer, iOS developer and senior web developer); students must fully complete their course; and they must pay an extra $100 a month for that peace of mind (a total of $299 for each month of course &ndash; typically six to eight months x 10 hours per week).</p>
<p>MOOCs were supposed to help democratise access to education but there has been plenty of evidence and news items to suggest this is generally not the case.&nbsp; Now researchers from MIT and Harvard have investigated <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2015/how-socioeconomic-status-impacts-online-learning-1217">the effects of socioeconomic status on online learning</a>.&nbsp; Using demographic data from 68 HarvardX and MITx MOOCs, they found a correlation between three indicators &ndash; parental educational attainment, neighbourhood average educational attainment and neighbourhood median income &ndash; and performance and course completion, especially among younger students.&nbsp; Those enrolling in HarvardX and MITx on edX live in neighbourhoods where the median income is 38% higher than typical the US norm. &nbsp;And among teenagers who register for a HarvardX course, those with a college-educated parent are twice as likely to complete their course compared to students whose parents did not complete college.</p>
<p>Fortune reports on how an early move into <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/12/22/wharton-online-learning/">MOOCs made Wharton a major player in online education</a>.&nbsp; Most Wharton learners are aged 25 to 44, have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher, are employed full time and, since 2012, some 2.7m have enrolled in Wharton&rsquo;s 18 Coursera MOOCs and the school has awarded 54,000 x $95 verified certificates.&nbsp; Since last April they have also awarded 32,000 verified certificates in Specialization courses, adding to the estimated $5m MOOCs will generate for the School in 2015. &nbsp;Wharton expects to double that in 2016 as it launches at least two dozen new online offerings, including its first three SPOCs on the EdX platform.</p>
<p>Gilly Salmon and chums examined <a href="http://www.researchinlearningtechnology.net/index.php/rlt/article/view/28507">the use of social media (Facebook and Twitter) by participants in a MOOC</a> developed to enable educators to learn about the Carpe Diem learning design process.&nbsp; Based on interviews with 29 participants, 31% used Facebook in connection with the course, 3% used Twitter and 14% used both, but 41% did not use social media at all because, &ldquo;First, they did not believe that there was any learning value in using social media sites, and that it was a waste of their time. &nbsp;Second, they found the social media landscape too confusing and intimidating. &nbsp;Third, they did not want to blur what they perceived as the social-professional divide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coursera reveals some interesting (but brief) <a href="https://tech.coursera.org/blog/2016/01/10/scaling-content-production/">under-the-bonnet details of its MOOC platform and content editor</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; UWN; Wonkhe; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>New data from HESA show that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35312229">part-time student numbers have hit a new low</a>, with the number of first-year students studying part time in 2014-15 falling by 6% on the previous year, and by 38% in five years &ndash; from more than 428,000 in 2010-11 to below 266,000 last year.&nbsp; The NUS blames much of the decline on government cuts to student funding, claiming, &ldquo;Their commitment to social mobility and widening participation is only at surface level, and they do not realise that part-time education is essential to this agenda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An investigation by The Times found that the UK is suffering a <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20160108183149801">cheating epidemic</a> with almost 50,000 students caught in the past three years and students from outside of the EU more than four times as likely to cheat in exams and coursework.&nbsp; For example, at London&rsquo;s Queen Mary University, 75% of those found to have plagiarised were from overseas with a third from China; and at Sheffield, three in four cheats came from overseas, although they made up only 18% of the student body.&nbsp; The article also reports a growth in essay mills, particularly based in India.</p>
<p>Jackie Njoroge writes about the need for better business intelligence and improved competitive insights in UK HE, given the growing importance of efficiency and greater student choice.&nbsp; She has been part of the HESA/Jisc Business Intelligence project which was responsible for the rollout of <a href="http://wonkhe.com/blogs/with-big-data-comes-big-responsibility/">Heidi Plus</a> which will make it possible for decision makers at all levels of an organisation to more easily access, analyse, understand and act on business.&nbsp; However she warns that &ldquo;with big data comes big responsibility&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The UK has the greatest number of institutions in the <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/200-most-international-universities-world-2016">2016 Times Higher Education list of the 200 most international universities</a> in the world with 64 HEIs, although only one &ndash; Imperial &ndash; makes the top ten.&nbsp; The list is headed by Qatar University.</p>
<p>The universities of Leeds, Sheffield and York have jointly launched the <a href="http://universitybusiness.co.uk/Article/new-digital-publishing-platform-for-he">White Rose University Press</a> (WRUP) which will publish peer-reviewed academic papers, books, textbooks, and conference literature from across the academic community both in the UK and internationally.&nbsp; Online access to all the published material will be free to all readers.</p>

<p><strong>What Next for US For-Profit HE?</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; Tony Bates; Phil Hill; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>The Chronicle reports that, at the height of their growth, for-profit colleges enrolled 1 in 12 students at US degree-granting institutions.&nbsp; But those days are over and <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/For-Profit-Colleges-May-Be/234808/?key=FDRAVdqtk3RswdiVh3rC189aM4gXxXgxf1qK1BqNVqFtTFZjblNycWxEQXlCLUYycG85TTNKV0VXRDhobWJvdWR1ZVhtNDNDYnVj">enrolments at for-profit colleges have fallen by 26% since 2009</a> compared with a 9% overall decline in US postsecondary enrolment.&nbsp; Some private providers have folded (e.g. Corinthian) while many others have experienced significant shrinkage: Apollo Education Group (owners of the University of Phoenix) has seen its corporate value decline from $10bn in 2009 to under $800m today, and a look at Phoenix enrolments shows the extent of its downsizing.&nbsp; However, writer Goldie Blumenstyk thinks all is not lost and that there are already signs of providers reinventing themselves, their offerings and their financial models.</p>
<p>CNBC profiles <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/15/a-controversial-education-model-us-is-exporting-to-the-world.html">Laureate Education</a>, the world's largest for-profit HE company by enrolment (~1m students), noting that 84% of its revenue comes from outside the US, thus avoiding intense US government scrutiny.&nbsp; The company notes the demand for low-cost HE far outstrips the supply in such places as Latin America, where HE has traditionally been the purview of Catholic colleges and state-run universities which, although cheap or free, have only limited student places.&nbsp; Critics say Laureate puts too much emphasis on marketing, advertising, executive salaries and recruitment of students and too little on quality education.&nbsp; For example, after it took over Centro Universitario in 2010, the school's quality ranking among small colleges in Brazil plunged from 41<sup>st</sup> place to No 132.</p>
<p>Tony Bates discusses data from WCET that shows <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2016/01/04/in-the-usa-fully-online-enrollments-continue-to-grow-in-2014/">US distance education enrolments continuing to grow</a> slowly but steadily.&nbsp; But a breakdown by provider confirms the Phoenix situation described above: private non-profit enrolments grew by 22% from 2012-14, public by 9%, but private for-profit declined by 11%.</p>
<p>However, the New York Times reports that <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/parent-company-of-university-of-phoenix-could-be-sold-to-owner-of-mcgraw-hill-ed/">Apollo Education Group (Phoenix) is in &ldquo;advanced talks&rdquo; to be purchased</a> by Apollo Global Management, a NY private-equity firm, (similar name, different company), owner of McGraw-Hill Education.&nbsp; NYT believes the deal could be worth about $1bn and an agreement could be reached in the next few weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Dropout and Completion in HE in Europe</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>The EU reports on <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/education/library/study/2015/dropout-completion-he_en.pdf">Dropout and Completion in Higher Education in Europe</a>, beginning by noting an EU-wide lack of consistent data, indicators, organisational measures and definition of study success.&nbsp; Despite this, England appears to perform well: of the 35 counties studied, it is one of 16 who regard study success as &ldquo;very high or high on the agenda&rdquo;; it tops retention rates (93% in 2012/13 (Table 4.4)) and is close to the top of completion rates (85.6% for 2011/12 beginners (Table 4.3)).&nbsp; England is also one of four countries singled out as having &ldquo;good national approaches&rdquo; (p66).&nbsp; There are no specific data for part-time students for any country but numerous references to diminished completion and study success.</p>

<p><strong>The Three Laws of eLearning Failure</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Short and sweet descriptions of his <a href="http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/1848/marc-my-words-the-three-laws-of-elearning-failure/pageall">three laws of e-learning failure</a> from Marc Rosenberg, but so very true:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Great e-Learning technology combined with bad content results in more efficiently delivered bad content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When great e-Learning comes up against a lousy learning culture, the culture wins every time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>e-Learning that is compensation for bad documentation, tools, processes, or management will ultimately prove to be a waste of time and money.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>[EURODL]</em></p>
<p>A new IET paper presents the results of a <a href="http://www.eurodl.org/?p=current&article=707">survey of more than 3,000 OER users</a> of three repositories: OpenLearn, iTunesU and Saylor Academy. &nbsp;In addition to demographic data, they report on patterns of use, user profiles, attitudes towards OER, types of materials used and popularity of different subjects. &nbsp;The researchers found that, on the whole, learners were highly positive about their use of OER, their experiences were fairly consistent and they believe they will continue to use them.&nbsp; However, when asked whether their informal studies would now make formal study more likely, some degree of polarization was observed for iTunes and Saylor students (Table 2) but OpenLearners were much more inclined towards future formal study.&nbsp; The authors note that this may be explained by, &ldquo;the existence of planned pathways between OpenLearn content and degree level content provided by The Open University (UK) which are intended to facilitate the transition from non-formal to formal study&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Should Students Be Partners In Curriculum Design?</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>Chris Havergal examines <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/should-students-be-partners-in-curriculum-design">the role of students in pedagogical design decisions</a>.&nbsp; For example, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Bryn Mawr and Haverford colleges have involved about 250 academics and 200 student consultants since 2007.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most people who come into the programme think: &lsquo;What could a student teach me about teaching, and particularly a student outside my subject area?&rsquo;&rdquo; says director, Alison Cook-Sather. &ldquo;They also feel vulnerable that people will be watching them and judging them. [But] what happens for 99 per cent of the people who participate is that they realise it isn&rsquo;t about expertise in a subject area: it is about understanding how the student experiences pedagogy, curriculum and assessment in the class.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Bloom Revisited</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes;</em> <em>TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Bloom&rsquo;s (1956) Taxonomy might be regarded by many as a bit old hat and &lsquo;instructional&rsquo;, but it does offer a useful sanity check for authors and designers of teaching, learning and assessment to consider whether they&rsquo;re pitching things at an appropriate cognitive level.&nbsp; Anderson &amp; Krathwohl&rsquo;s 2001 revised taxonomy improved matters by swapping Bloom&rsquo;s levels 5 and 6 and introducing more friendly action verbs, then I discovered Andrew Churches&rsquo; <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/8000050/Blooms-Digital-Taxonomy-v2-12">Bloom&rsquo;s Digital Taxonomy</a> which links the categories and activities to social media and a variety of digital tools/techniques.&nbsp; And finally, via Stephen Downes, comes Eric Sheninger&rsquo;s new <a href="http://esheninger.blogspot.ca/2015/12/improving-instruction-in-digital-world.html">Rigor and Relevance Framework</a>, which he describes as, &ldquo;an action &shy;oriented continuum that describes putting knowledge to use&rdquo;.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t change the world but it&rsquo;s another useful perspective and, as with the Digital Taxonomy, it helpfully relates the action verbs to relevant learning technologies.</p>
<p>TechCrunch also looks at Bloom&rsquo;s more recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/09/how-startups-are-solving-a-decades-old-problem-in-education/?ncid=tcdaily#.vlxkaj:jmQu">Two Sigma research</a> which showed that students receiving 121 tuition using mastery learning techniques performed an average of two standard deviations better than students who learned via traditional classroom methods.&nbsp; Bloom himself concluded that this is, &ldquo;too costly for most societies to bear on a large scale&rdquo;, but Roshan Choxi considers how educational technology might help to provide or support a similar &lsquo;online mentorship&rsquo; approach.</p>

              <title>MON: Can MOOCs propel the OER agenda for educators in South Africa? (John Kerr)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9508</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9508</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can MOOCs propel the OER agenda for educators in South Africa?</strong></p>
<p>This project focuses on the amalgamation of the two entities &ndash; MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses) and OERs (Open Educational Resources) &ndash; to ascertain if a symbiotic relationship could organically occur between the two. The aim is the impact that the globalised distribution of free, high quality educational technology resources - blended into MOOC pedagogy - can have a direct impact on teachers of technology in South Africa to locate suitable OERs and understand how to adapt them to their cultural sensitivities; a common issue with global north materials (Waliji, 2014).</p>
<p>Wright (2014) identifies the top five barriers to education across the World as: Power, Internet connectivity, Training, Value teachers and Sustainability. Education in South Africa suffers these barriers which directly impact on learning and teaching; more specifically, how to locate and use OERs (de los Arcos <em>et al, </em>2014). However, as Waliji (2014) identifies OER initiatives in the south are increasing as hardware, access to digital tool and connectivity grows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the distribution of open material as MOOCs &ndash; adopting cMOOC pedagogy of connectivism &ndash; this project aims to break down some of these barriers and increase access to South African educationalists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;MOOCs have proven to be a truly disruptive innovation for Higher Education. They continue to increase exponentially in numbers year on year, with more than 400 institutions globally delivering free courses to a registered cohort of 18million students across all major MOOC providers (Class-Central, 2014). In contrast, OERs have been on institutional agendas for the last decade but haven&rsquo;t yet made a comparable impact. However, things are changing. Weller (2013) notes the blurring of MOOCs and OERs and Abeywardena (2014) emphasises that OERs are not as of yet a significant part of the movement of open education. De los Arcos <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->et al</em> (2014) OER Research Hub Evidence Report on OER adoption highlights that 79.5% of educators use OERs to gain new ideas and that 27.5% agree that OER use results in better test scores. However, only 12.4% educators publish OERs under a Creative Commons license and that sourcing OERs is the biggest barriers to their use. This project aims to provide a solution to this problem with the outlined context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly to the OER movement in Scotland being guided by the Open Scotland Declaration, Africa has OER Africa; a movement which supports institutions locate and find OERs (OER Africa, 2013). Recently, the United States the Federal Government released support for OERs to provide equitable access to quality education, OER creation, adoption and sharing (openscot.net). All three movements follow on from the 2012 Paris OER Declaration which designated that &ndash;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&ldquo;Teaching, learning and research materials in any medium&hellip;that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open licence that permits no-cost access, use, adoption and redistribution by others&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>This project will also consider key benefits and potential risks to institutions and their staff while outlining potential enhancements to the wider community, and the socioeconomical benefits this approach could bring.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; The Ed Techie; IRRODL; Kellogg; Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>EdSurge considers the future for edX, which has been less commercial/industry-facing than rivals Coursera and Udacity.&nbsp; The provider has over 90 partner institutions, with close to a third now approaching the end of their three-year contracts, and CEO Anant Agawal is conscious of the costs of producing and supporting MOOCs.&nbsp; He wants <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-11-23-edx-buckles-down-to-offer-credit-for-moocs">edX 2.0</a> to mark a &ldquo;transition from a &lsquo;curiosity&rsquo; platform to an essential pathway for learners in their education&rdquo;.&nbsp; Hence the article describes plans for a Global Freshman Academy, Alternative Credit Project and a now Micromasters.</p>
<p>Martin Weller predicts that <a href="http://blog.edtechie.net/mooc/2016-the-year-of-mooc-hard-questions/">2016 will be (another) year of the MOOC</a>, but that some hard questions will need answering.&nbsp; He suggests five areas will lead to &ldquo;an investment rethink&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MOOC education won&rsquo;t be as cheap for learners as envisaged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Producing MOOCs is expensive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOOCs are usually not effective recruitment avenues for universities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MOOCs are not democratising education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enrolments for repeat presentations will drop after the initial burst of enthusiasts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One problem with session based MOOCs can be gaining access to materials during the &lsquo;closed&rsquo; period (and sometimes not knowing when or if a course would be offered again).&nbsp; Class Central reports that 55% of all courses listed on its aggregator site do not have an upcoming start date and that around 300 Coursera and 180 edX <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/mooc-trends-2015-rise-self-paced-courses/">MOOCs are now on-demand/self-paced</a>.&nbsp; However, students report that deadlines are a motivating factor and that forums and peer grading/commentary often do not work well with self-pacing.</p>
<p>IRRODL Vol 16 (6) is a special issue offering a European perspective of <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/issue/view/72">the past, present, and future state of MOOCs</a>.&nbsp; Among the papers is <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2185/3552">Theories and Applications of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs): The Case for Hybrid Design</a> (Anders, 2015) which presents a meta-analysis of the research literature into MOOC pedagogies (nicely summarised in Table 1).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an interesting theoretical perspective and the different hybrid design approaches all have their merits, but I&rsquo;m not convinced that many current x-MOOCs are primarily as devoid of social learning as Anders suggests.</p>
<p>Researchers at Northwestern University investigated the impact of <a href="http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/a-gentle-nudge-can-increase-participation-in-moocs">encouraging interaction and collaboration amongst MOOC students</a>.&nbsp; They sent a survey at the beginning of the second week to all participants, asking for feedback on the first week&rsquo;s material.&nbsp; Those who responded were divided into two groups, one of which received an email reminding them to contribute to the course discussion board.&nbsp; This simple nudge increased visits to the board by 26.5%, increased posts by nearly 97% and made those students about 13% more likely to complete the following week&rsquo;s quiz.&nbsp; In a second experiment, the researchers invited some participants to take part in online one-on-one discussions about the course material.&nbsp; Although only 7% of students took up this invitation, they were 10% more likely to complete their weekly quiz and their scores increased by between 2 and 10% in subsequent weeks.</p>
<p>Chairman Mao: &ldquo;a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary strategist and theorist&rdquo;?&nbsp; Discuss.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/11/17/edx-mooc-courts-questions-about-censorship-and-academic-freedom">Some Coursera MOOCs on Chinese history are raising eyebrows</a>, particularly in the US.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s propaganda,&rdquo; said US Naval Academy&rsquo;s Prof Maochun Yu, who believes the course is &ldquo;part of a larger campaign to export a way of Chinese governance &hellip; China wants to be part of the world, but it doesn&rsquo;t want to be part of a world where Western democracy and capitalism dominate.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, voice of reason Stephen Downes counters that there&rsquo;s rarely such thing as neutral course and that &ldquo;The existence of the perspective itself is valuable&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Peter Horrocks; The Independent; Pete Mitton; EdSurge; Campus Technology; Phil Hill]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.thisweekbangalore.com/manipal-global-signs-mou-with-open-university-uk/">OU and India&rsquo;s Manipal Global Education Services</a> last week signed a Memorandum of Understanding which will allow collaboration between Manipal ProLearn &ndash; the certification arm of MaGE &ndash; and other parts of the Manipal Education Group and the OU in the areas of content and technology between the two market leaders in education.&nbsp; &ldquo;This partnership will explore and collaborate to support the development of innovative programmes, focused on equipping students with the skills they need to succeed in the workplace,&rdquo; said a joint statement released by MaGE and the OU&rsquo;s Peter Horrocks.</p>
<p>Another month, another <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/pearson-did-things-by-the-textbook-but-the-customers-had-ripped-it-up-a6750856.html">all-is-not-well-at-Pearson</a> story.&nbsp; The Independent reports on life for the publisher after offloading the Economist and FT &ndash; and why its rosy future in the US education and testing market is looking more than a little rocky.&nbsp; The Telegraph takes a similar view, noting that competitor John Wiley has just cut its revenue forecasts amid a greater than expected <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/12042418/Pearson-is-a-lesson-in-how-tough-the-education-sector-really-is.html">slowdown in sales of print textbooks</a> &ndash; proving how tough the US education sector is at the moment. And that might explain further news that Pearson is contemplating a sale of its 47% stake in <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-11-30-is-penguin-random-house-next-on-pearson-s-chopping-block?mc_uid=68b7301145e46b82b5e216c5e1c1580a&utm_source=EdsurgeLive&utm_campaign=16bd2ecda1-2015-11-25-EdSurge+Newsletter+Ver+251&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0f1ec25b60-16bd2ecda1-292151429">Penguin Random House</a>.</p>
<p>itslearning has acquired Scandinavian-based LMS Fronter from Pearson, making the combined company the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/itslearning-acquires-fronter--becomes-europes-largest-provider-of-digital-learning-platforms-544750922.html">largest provider of learning management systems in Europe</a>.</p>
<p>The University of Phoenix is reported to be moving away from its home grown adaptive learning platform, &ldquo;Classroom&rdquo; to the cloud-based <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/exclusive-university-phoenix-moving-homegrown-platform-blackboard-learn-ultra/">Blackboard Learn Ultra</a>.&nbsp; Key factors in that decision were the functionality and user experience of Ultra plus a strong desire to invest more in learning analytics &ndash; at both an aggregate (course/group) and predictive (individual) level.</p>
<p>Blackboard has acquired <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/12/01/blackboard-acquires-predictive-analytics-company-blue-canary.aspx">Blue Canary</a>, a higher education predictive analytics company that focusses on student retention.&nbsp; The move marks Blackboard's latest investment in learning analytics and student success, having acquired X-Ray Analytics earlier this year.</p>
<p>UK and Estonia-based <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-11-17-lingvist-scores-8-million-to-help-people-learn-new-languages-in-200-hours">Lingvist</a> has raised &pound;5m in funding to further develop and promote its free French and English language learning tool which claims to teach words and expressions based on how often they are used.&nbsp; This accelerates the learning process meaning that, after 200 hours, users should be able to have casual conversations and watch movies in a foreign language.</p>
<p>London-based <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-11-17-bridgeu-raises-2-5m-seed-round?mc_uid=68b7301145e46b82b5e216c5e1c1580a&utm_source=EdsurgeLive&utm_campaign=0a7067966f-2015-11-11-EdSurge+Newsletter+Ver+249&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0f1ec25b60-0a7067966f-292151429">BridgeU</a> has raised around &pound;2m in funding to build its platform that helps students manage university applications and university administrators manage student performance data.&nbsp; The company expects to reach 15,000 students by the end of this year.</p>

<p><strong>Universities Have Limited Impact on Students&rsquo; Soft Skills Development</strong></p>
<p>[THE]</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-engagement-survey-universities-have-limited-impact-students-soft-skill-development">HEA&rsquo;s UK Engagement Survey</a> of more than 24,000 undergraduates reports little significant improvement in &ldquo;soft&rdquo; skills such as creativity and citizenship over the course of their university careers.&nbsp; Eighty-three per cent reported a very high or reasonable amount of development in critical and analytical thinking skills, and half reported strong development in becoming an independent learner.&nbsp; However, only about a quarter perceived a very high level of benefit to softer skills such as citizenship, innovation and developing personal values, and there were similar responses for employability skills and the ability to analyse numerical and statistical information.</p>
<p>And a new Jisc report, <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/unlocking-the-digital-potential-of-graduates-02-dec-2015">Technology for Employability: Study into the role of technology in developing student employability</a>, also confirms that universities miss vital opportunities to equip students with the digital skills they need in the modern workplace. &nbsp;The authors suggest institutions can better prepare for supporting good practices in technology for employability in five key ways (Sect 9):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Embedding and aligning technology for employability into polices, plans and processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professional development of staff in relation to employability and technology for employability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology tools, resources, infrastructure and support for employability and student-centred flexible curricula</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving communication and collaboration to drive change in technology for employability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QA and continuous improvement through employability data monitoring, analytics and review</p>

<p><strong>Deloitte No Longer Wants to Know Where Its Applicants Went to College</strong></p>
<p><em>[LinkedIn]</em></p>
<p><a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/diversity/2015/one-of-britains-largest-companies-no-longer-wants-to-know-where-its-applicants-went-to-college">Deloitte</a> no longer wants its recruiters and hiring managers to know where its applicants went to college, school or university, and so has introduced &ldquo;school and university-blind interviewing&rdquo;.&nbsp; The company has teamed up with the UK-based consulting company Rare to incorporate a new screening process called &ldquo;contextualisation&rdquo; that uses an algorithm to judge an applicant&rsquo;s performance in the context in which they achieved it.&nbsp; For example, it will highlight someone who did well at school or university, despite perhaps being the first in their family to go to a university or qualifying for free meals at the university because of low income.&nbsp; This allows recruiters to, &ldquo;look for potential, instead of always focusing on past performance&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Growth of European University Mergers</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>Since 2000, the number of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34902884#?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">European university mergers</a> increased substantially and almost 100 mergers have taken place, according to a report by the European University Association.&nbsp; France currently tops the mergers list, with 15 since 2002, followed by the UK and Belgium with 10 each.&nbsp; Apart from economies of scale, mergers are also a good way of promoting institutions up the world university rankings.&nbsp; The European University Association has produced an <a href="http://www.university-mergers.eu/">interactive map</a> with all the details.</p>

<p><strong>Horizon Scanning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; Will Woods; TechCrunch; Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>The 2016 NMC/EDUCAUSE Horizon Project HE expert panel has just selected the six key trends (e.g. measuring learning), six significant challenges (e.g. balancing our connected and unconnected lives) and six important developments in ed-tech (e.g. learning analytics &amp; adaptive learning) that will be featured in next February&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nmc.org/nmc-horizon-news/submit-your-projects-2016-nmc-horizon-higher-ed">NMC Horizon Report</a>.&nbsp; Now NMC is interested in learning about any kind of research, pilot programs, innovative projects, or faculty work happening at your institution or organization in any of the areas identified, ideally by 4 Jan 16.</p>
<p>Also just out is the OU/SRI <a href="http://proxima.iet.open.ac.uk/public/innovating_pedagogy_2015.pdf">Innovating Pedagogy 2015 Report</a> and, although this has a pedagogic focus rather than the technology drivers of NMC, there are many areas of overlap such as: <em>Blending Formal &amp; Informal Learning &ndash; Crossover Learning &ndash; Incidental Learning;</em> and <em>Learning Analytics &amp; Adaptive Learning &ndash; Adaptive Teaching &ndash; Analytics of Emotions.</em>&nbsp; Also interesting is the ebb and flow of the themes in Innovating Pedagogy over its four-year life (p7), with <em>Extension</em> and <em>Personalisation</em> trending this year while <em>Scale</em> has cooled.</p>
<p>There are also some remarkably close overlaps between some of Innovating Pedagogy&rsquo;s themes and those envisaged by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/28/how-education-will-be-smarter-less-intrusive-and-able-to-respond-to-how-you-feel/">Pearson&rsquo;s Amar Kumar</a>, who believes we are, &ldquo;on the verge of a tide of smarter innovation&rdquo; that will include technology that learns from learners, adapts to how students feel and provides invisible, less intrusive assessment.</p>
<p>But Joshua Kim is sceptical about edtech, &ldquo;we constantly hear about as &lsquo;imminent&rsquo;, but that always seem to fail to arrive&rdquo;.&nbsp; He lists <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/11-edtech-advances-will-not-happen-2020">11 edtech advances that will not happen by 2020</a>, such as a portfolio system that everyone will use, a mobile learning platform that will displace the browser based LMS, instructor accessible analytics that will enable data driven teaching and a learning object repository that is actually used.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oecd.org/education/education-at-a-glance-19991487.htm">Education at a Glance 2015: OECD Indicators</a> claims to be &ldquo;the authoritative source for accurate information on the state of education around the world&rdquo; (all 568 pages of it).&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s report finds that, across OECD nations, over 80% of tertiary-educated adults are employed, compared with over 70% of people with upper secondary or post-secondary non-tertiary education, and less than 60% of adults without upper secondary education.&nbsp; Tertiary-educated adults also earn about 60% more, on average, than adults with upper secondary as their highest level of educational attainment.&nbsp; However, countries are spending less on education and the teaching population is aging.&nbsp; The report confirms that England has the highest university tuition fees and that the <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015/united-kingdom_eag-2015-85-en#page1">entry rate into tertiary education in the UK</a> is 58% compared to an OECD average of 67%, but the UK has the highest proportion of tertiary graduates in the field of sciences among all OECD countries.</p>

<p><strong>The Shape of International Education to 2025</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>A British Council report, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/india-will-have-the-largest-student-population-by-2025-study-predicts">The Shape of International Education to 2025</a>, predicts that India will have the largest 18-22 population in 10 years (119 million), followed by China despite its population in this age group declining by roughly 35m to 80m.&nbsp; Nigeria is forecast to see the highest increase in this youth population, up from 7.4m to an estimated 23m in 2025.&nbsp; Sri Lanka is expected to see the highest annual percentage growth in household income over the next decade (5.8% per annum), with China in fourth place (5.1 per cent), although the British Council predicts that China will continue to be the top supplier of international students globally by 2025, followed by India, Nigeria, Germany and Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p><strong>Education 2030 Incheon Declaration and Framework for Action</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>UNESCO&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/ED_new/pdf/FFA-ENG-27Oct15.pdf">Education 2030</a> paper affirms that education is, &ldquo;a fundamental human right and a basis for guaranteeing the realization of other rights. &nbsp;It is essential for peace, tolerance, human fulfilment and sustainable development.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s full of similarly worthy words but it presents a comprehensive plan, targets and plentiful references to inclusion, opportunities, quality, implementation, the role of government, OERs, funding and more.</p>

<p><strong>Gender Gaps Wider in Print than Digital Reading </strong></p>
<p><em>[OECD]</em></p>
<p>Also from OECD&rsquo;s Education at a Glance: reading tests of 15-year-olds showed that <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2015/11/digital_reading_gender_gaps.html">girls outperformed boys</a> by an average of 38 points on a paper-based reading test (about a year's worth of formal schooling) although this lead dropped to 26 points for the equivalent computer-based test.&nbsp; The researchers note, &ldquo;The more frequently students play one-player video games and collaborative online games, which boys tend to play more than girls, the worse their relative performance on paper-based tests. Frequent video gaming appears to "crowd out" other activities, such as doing homework regularly, that help students to acquire reading and mathematics skills.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Digital Revolution in HE Has Already Happened. &nbsp;No One Noticed</strong></p>
<p><em>[Giles Clark; Will Woods]</em></p>
<p>Clay Shirky examines <a href="https://medium.com/@cshirky/the-digital-revolution-in-higher-education-has-already-happened-no-one-noticed-78ec0fec16c7#.pya7col85">the growth of online components in US HE</a> &ndash; &ldquo;More than 95% of colleges and universities with over five thousand students offer online classes [&hellip;] online education has stopped being &lsquo;The Future&rsquo; and has become a perfectly routine way to learn.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also looks at the demographics of US HE, the haves vs the have-nots and the factors that heighten the risks of dropout.&nbsp; He concludes, &ldquo;Given the lousy fit between institutional assumptions and the actual lives of most students, we should applaud their inventiveness in using digital options to make college work for them. &nbsp;But we should also recognize our complicity in creating a system that works so badly in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>The 2015 Survey of Faculty Attitudes on Technology</strong></p>
<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>Inside Higher Ed regularly surveys key US HE professionals on a range of topics.&nbsp; Outcomes of their 2015 <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/survey/partial-credit-2015-survey-faculty-attitudes-technology">Survey of Faculty Attitudes on Technology</a> included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The gap between administrators and faculty members widens as instructors &ndash; including those who have taught online &ndash; become more negative about the quality of online education compared to F2F</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faculty members are sceptical about new academic programmes that combine F2F instruction with MOOCs, fearing the model threatens traditional faculty roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of faculty members believe detection software can stop students from plagiarizing, but less than one-quarter believe students have a full understanding of what plagiarism actually is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrators and faculty members overwhelmingly say textbooks and other course materials are too expensive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A majority of faculty members are concerned about attacks on scholars for their comments on social media and feel that institutions must do more to encourage civil discourse online</p>
</li>

<p><strong>HEA THE Supplement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><em>[HEA]</em></p>

<p><strong>How Online College Classes Adversely Affect Student Performance</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; The Conversation]</em></p>
<p>Researchers from Stanford and Harvard examined data from DeVry University to investigate <a href="http://cepa.stanford.edu/content/changing-distributions-how-online-college-classes-alter-student-and-professor-performance#.Vif-lrB2lFs.twitter">the effects of online HE courses on student performance</a>.&nbsp; The average DeVry student takes two-thirds of their courses online and the study covers 230,000 students across an average of 10 courses each over four years.&nbsp; The authors found that, on average, online course-taking reduced student learning by one-third to one-quarter of a standard deviation compared to conventional F2F classes. &nbsp;They also claim that taking a course online also reduces student learning in future courses and persistence in college.&nbsp; They speculate that this may be partly attributable to higher levels of procrastination by online students, particularly those who are lower-performing.</p>
<p>Perhaps <a href="http://www.psmag.com/nature-and-technology/theres-no-substitute-for-in-person-lectures">video lectures</a> are the answer?&nbsp; Not according to researchers from the University of British Columbia, who found that students (<em>N=</em>276) who watched a videotaped lecture recalled less of the material, and felt less engaged in the subject, than they did after sitting through a similar live lesson.&nbsp; However, this was not due to inattentiveness because students in a control group reported roughly equal amounts of mind-wandering during the two lessons.&nbsp; For students watching the video lecture, &ldquo;memory declined as mind-wandering increased&rdquo; but this was not true of the students watching the lecture live, suggesting that memory &ldquo;is more sensitive to shifts in attention when the material is delivered online.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Australian researchers believe online courses <em>can</em> work if designed in the right way, finding that students who have access to <a href="https://theconversation.com/online-learning-can-work-if-universities-just-rethink-the-design-of-their-courses-50848">better designed, and more personalised, courses</a> tend to have higher engagement and better outcomes.&nbsp; For example, a 2013 study of 1,200 engineering students showed that the introduction of measures including staff development, adaptive online tutorials and a community portal reduced failure rates from 31% to 7% between 2007 and 2011.&nbsp; Adaptive tutorials also improved student performance on a medical degree course by 56% on standard exam scores.</p>

<p><strong>Jisc Teams with ProQuest for Custom eBooks</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jisc]</em></p>
<p>Jisc has teamed with ProQuest to create <a href="http://www.researchinformation.info/news/news_story.php?news_id=2026">a custom ebooks collection</a> that provides key texts for FE institutions across the UK.&nbsp; The move expands the relationship between ProQuest and Jisc which already provides access to more than 400 ebooks to 400 colleges across the UK.&nbsp; The new special collection of 73 titles has been created using content from such publishers as Hodder Education, Bloomsbury, Taylor &amp; Francis, and Pearson.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; BBC; WonkHE; The Telegraph; University World News]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://intranet.open.ac.uk/ouintra/story.aspx?id=29527">The OU has re-joined University Alliance</a> to strengthen our partnerships in the HE sector. Part-time study at university level has been hit by recent changes to the way higher education is funded - particularly in England - with a 41% decline in the number of part-time undergraduates over the last five years. However 90% of the UK's current workforce will still be in work in the next decade, and it is predicted that over the next 30 years, there will be 13 million vacancies, but only 7 million school leavers to fill them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34658018#?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">It&rsquo;s the finance, stupid!</a> is a collection of essays on the decline of part-time higher education and what to do about it.&nbsp; Published by Hepi and supported by the OU, writers include the OU&rsquo;s Peter Horrocks and John Butcher, Birkbeck&rsquo;s Claire Callender and ten others.&nbsp; Reflecting on the fact that students starting part-time study fell from 258,885 to 116,025 between 2010/11 and 2014/15, Hepi says two-thirds of would-be part-timers now do not qualify for tuition fee loans because they would have to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>aiming for a qualification that is not equivalent to or at a lower level than the qualification they already hold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>studying for at least 25% of a full-time course</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>following a full course for a specified qualification rather than individual modules&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also published today is a detailed paper from Bright Blue, <a href="http://wonkhe.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BBLJ3877_Going_Parttime_09.11.15.pdf">Going Part-time</a>, which explores the possible causes of the decline in PT enrolments.&nbsp; This includes a poll of 1,567 English adults who had considered but ultimately not pursued part-time HE in the past five years. &nbsp;When these &lsquo;considerers&rsquo; were asked the main reason for not pursuing their interest in part-time HE, cost emerged as the major factor (Charts 5.1, 5.2 &amp; 5.3).</p>
<p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies reports that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11987142/Ethnic-minorities-more-likely-to-go-to-university-than-white-working-class-British-children.html">white British children are now the least likely of any ethnic group to go to university</a>.&nbsp; Their five-year research found that every ethnic minority &ndash; including groups that had underperformed academically like Black Caribbeans &ndash; are more likely to go to university than white British children.&nbsp; It also revealed that within social class, poor white British children are substantially behind each ethnic minority group and even wealthy white British children are behind most ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Theresa May is planning to <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/theresa-may-plans-on-making-universities-ensure-overseas-graduates-leave-uk">make universities responsible for ensuring that overseas graduates leave the country</a> once their courses are finished.&nbsp; It is thought that the Home Office intends to use data from new checks on those exiting the country as the basis to force universities to take more responsibility for ensuring that graduates from outside the EU do not overstay their visas.&nbsp; Ms May wrote in a newspaper article earlier this year that the &ldquo;gap between the number of non-EU students coming to this country and departing each year is 96,000&rdquo;.&nbsp; Sanctions for universities with high rates of &lsquo;overstayers&rsquo; could potentially include the removal of their right to recruit more non-EU students.</p>
<p>An analysis of the top performers in the <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20151029192346710">European Union&rsquo;s Horizon 2020 programme</a> has looked at 4,190 projects and 7,804 organisations that have been awarded H2020 grants, finding that the UK has strengthened its position, along with the Netherlands and Ireland, compared with the Seventh Framework Programme.&nbsp; UCL tops the list of EC contributions (&euro;49.9m), followed by Cambridge (&euro;44.6m), Imperial (&euro;43.8m) and Oxford (&euro;40.7m).</p>

<p><strong>Edtech UK</strong></p>
<p><em>[Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>Edtech UK launched last month &ndash;&nbsp; a new strategic body set up to help accelerate the growth of the UK&rsquo;s education technology sector in Britain and globally. &nbsp;It aims to serve as a &ldquo;front door&rdquo; for industry, investment and government and a convening voice for all of the education and learning technology sector.&nbsp; I hope the site improves because I entered the &ldquo;front door&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t find very much inside, not even a link to their first major report, <a href="http://www.ednfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/EdtechUK_LP_report.pdf">Edtech: London Capital of Learning Technology</a> (tracked down via Google).&nbsp; I also can&rsquo;t help wondering how those major ed-tech players based outside the capital (Thames Valley, East Midlands, Oxford, Cambridge, Brighton, Sheffield and elsewhere) will feel about such a London-centric initial focus.</p>

<p><strong>Edtech&rsquo;s Next Big Disruption is The Degree</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; The Age]</em></p>
<p>Aaron Skonnard believes that, by 2020, &ldquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/29/edtechs-next-big-disruption-is-the-college-degree/?ncid=tcdaily#.vlxkaj:Qqov">the traditional degree will have made room on its pedestal for a new array of modern credentials</a> that are currently gaining mainstream traction as viable measures of learning, ability and accomplishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; He believes the drivers are the rising costs of education coupled with an ongoing need to keep knowledge and skills updated in response to changing technologies and a much more volatile employment market, citing the rise of MOOC-based nanodegrees as evidence.</p>
<p>Linda Kristjanson also does some crystal ball gazing, noting that &ldquo;students are demanding to learn in a way that makes sense to them, which can be very different from the way that students have been taught for decades.&rdquo;&nbsp; She agrees that there will be an increasing focus on work-relevant knowledge and skills, and suggests that &ldquo;As content has become ubiquitous and knowledge more accessible, <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/digital-disruption-and-academia-are-we-ready-for-uberversities-in-10-years-20150930-gjxvor.html#ixzz3od6g0700">the skill of the modern academic has shifted</a> away from being an imparter of knowledge to being an integrator of knowledge, creating more personalised conditions that help students learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>US Technology Device Ownership: 2015</strong></p>
<p><em>[Pew; EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>Latest research from Pew shows that <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/technology-device-ownership-2015/">92% of US adults own a mobile phone</a> (98% of 18-29s), of which almost three quarters are smartphones, and 45% own a tablet (50% of 18-29s).&nbsp; These are the only device types to show growth over the past year, with PCs, laptops, games consoles, MP3 players and (particularly) e-Readers all in decline.</p>
<p>In parallel with this comes <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/uploads/research/census_executivesummary.pdf?utm_source=EdsurgeLive&utm_campaign=ca531c3c78-Innovate+247&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0f1ec25b60-ca531c3c78-292151429">The Common Sense Census</a> which investigated media use by US tweens (8-12) and teens (13-19).&nbsp; On any given day, US teens average about nine hours (8:56) of entertainment media use, excluding time spent at school or for homework, with Tweens slightly lower at 5:55.&nbsp; Watching TV and listening to music remain the most popular media activities but there can be notable differences within and across groups with boys, for example, averaging 56m a day playing video games compared to just 7m by girls.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, multitasking dominates, with two thirds believing that watching TV, texting and using social media whilst doing homework does not impair the quality of their work.</p>

<p><strong>Online Cheating is Now Big Business</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Atlantic]</em></p>
<p>Despite some recent technological solutions, the potential for <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/11/cheating-through-online-courses/413770/">cheating in online education</a> remains high.&nbsp; Derek Newton investigates what&rsquo;s going on and what some leading providers are doing to try and combat fraud.&nbsp; He contacted a company called No Need to Study and received an offer to take an online English Literature class at Columbia University on his behalf, with a guaranteed B grade or better for a fee of $1,225.15.&nbsp; One satisfied customer was Muhammad, who had tried taking an online maths course but &ldquo;the quizzes were just way to difficult&rdquo;.&nbsp; He paid No Need to Study and &ldquo;They absolutely killed my final math and app classes with a 90 percent, and I can definitely tell you I never got a 90 percent before on anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Online-only K-12 Schools Show Poor Performance</strong></p>
<p><em>[Hechinger Report]</em></p>
<p>Seventeen US states allow Charter Schools which provide <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/online-only-schools-show-dismal-performance-what-can-be-done/">K-12 education entirely online</a>.&nbsp; However, a new study by Stanford and others has found that online schoolchildren tend to perform much worse than those in an equivalent F2F institution.&nbsp; For example, some online students showed academic results in maths equivalent to having skipped 180 days of school (almost a full year) whilst in reading, the deficiency was the equivalent of 72 days of school.&nbsp; Whilst there may be some benefits for learners in remote locations, the report concludes that &ldquo;Academic benefits from online charter schools are currently the exception rather than the rule&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, the authors note that online-only schools tend to assign an average of 30 students per teacher as opposed to 20 in traditional public schools, meaning that not all of the problems may stem from online-ness.</p>

<p>Sad to hear of <a href="http://blog.learnlets.com/?p=4617">the death of Jay Cross</a> earlier this month.&nbsp; The number of online tributes show that he will be greatly missed.&nbsp; [Clark Quinn]</p>

<p>The deadline for 2016 Oxford applications passed last month, but what about those bizarre interview questions that candidates mighty have to face?&nbsp; In an attempt to dispel some of the myths, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34505485">Oxford has published some example questions</a> and explained what they are trying to achieve by asking them: &ldquo;They are an academic conversation in a subject area between tutors and candidate, similar to the undergraduate tutorials which current Oxford students attend every week &hellip; We are not interested in catching students out.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; HBR; EdSurge; NBC; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Researchers at Carnegie Mellon investigated student behaviour and outcomes on an &lsquo;Introduction to Psychology as a Science&rsquo; Coursera MOOC, comparing those who took it as a traditional MOOC, spending most of their time watching video lectures, with those who combined the MOOC and interactive materials produced by Carnegie Mellon&rsquo;s Open Learning Initiative.&nbsp; <a href="http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2730000/2724681/p111-koedinger.pdf?ip=137.108.145.25&id=2724681&acc=OA&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35.4D4702B0C3E38B35.4D4702B0C3E38B35.B0DA6BDBC96C38D3&CFID=721783522&CFTOKEN=70750076&__acm__=1444911542_af1dea884e2e2e63cf4e3e83aa419e06">Learning Is Not a Spectator Sport: Doing Is Better Than Watching for Learning From a MOOC</a> reports that those in the MOOC-only course scored an average of 57% on the final exam (<em>N=</em>215) whereas those in the combined course averaged 66% (<em>N=</em>939). &nbsp;And when students in the combined course completed an interactive activity, they learned six times as much as those who only read the material or watched a video. &nbsp;&ldquo;When one is watching a lecture or reading material, there&rsquo;s an illusion of learning,&rdquo; says Prof Ken Koedinger.&nbsp; The additional &ldquo;Learn by Doing&rdquo; interactive activities support student outcome achievement by providing feedback targeted to diagnose misconceptions plus robust hints to support students.</p>
<p>A report published in the Harvard Business Review draws on <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/09/whos-benefiting-from-moocs-and-why">a survey of 52,000 Coursera students</a> to look at their motivations and what kinds of educational and career results they are seeing.&nbsp; The report sorted students into two categories and the results are somewhat horoscope-like: of those who described themselves as career builders, 87% reported &ldquo;career benefits&rdquo; from their courses; and of those described as education seekers, 88% reported general educational benefits.&nbsp; When pressed for more tangible benefits, the figures were lower, at 33% (e.g. found a new job) and 18% (e.g. gained essential knowledge for my field of study) respectively.</p>
<p>MIT has announced a pilot project in which students will be able to take a semester of free online courses in one of MIT's graduate programs and then, if they pay a "modest fee" of about $1,500 and pass an exam, they will earn a <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/freshman-year/free-online-classes-mit-can-now-count-toward-degree-n440851?cid=sm_tw"><em>MicroMaster's</em> credential</a>.&nbsp; That cost includes $150 for each of the five (&lsquo;free&rsquo;) online classes, plus up to $800 to take the exam, with the MicroMasters being equivalent to half of the university's one-year master's degree program in supply chain management.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-09-21-udacity-sets-up-first-overseas-shop-in-india?utm_campaign=ccaaa92fe7-Innovate+241&utm_medium=email&utm_source=EdsurgeLive&utm_term=0_0f1ec25b60-ccaaa92fe7-292151429">Udacity is expanding into India</a>, a country it believes &ldquo;has the potential to have the #1 developer population by 2018.&rdquo;&nbsp; The company will offer 1,000 full scholarships to its Nanodegree program in Android development, courtesy of Google and Tata Trusts.&nbsp; Standard tuition for any of the seven Nanodegrees will run 9,800 rupees (approximately &pound;100) per month, with a 50% rebate after completion.&nbsp; Each program, on average, takes six to nine months to complete.</p>
<p>Jonathan Moules interviewed <a href="http://video.ft.com/4507861269001/How-to-make-free-Moocs-sustainable/companies">FutureLearn&rsquo;s Simon Nelson</a> for FT.com last month.&nbsp; He raises many of the standard MOOC questions &ndash; breadth of access, dropout rates, financial sustainability &ndash; and receives a bunch of convincing answers.&nbsp; <a href="http://etcjournal.com/2015/09/29/moocs-a-toolbox-for-course-designers/">Jim Shimabukuro</a> adds his generally positive commentary on the etc site, concluding: &ldquo;From the standpoint of course designers, MOOCs are a liberating force, adding options to their palette that they couldn&rsquo;t imagine just a few years ago ... and in the coming months and years we&rsquo;re going to see the more progressive leaders flashing the green light, lighting the way to a new era in which course designers, inspired by MOOCs, will be serving up a wide range of courses for an ever-widening spectrum of students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Coursera <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-08-25-coursera-charts-course-for-international-expansion-with-49-5m-in-series-c-funding">claimed 15 million registered users</a> in August, edX announced passing the <a href="https://twitter.com/edxonline/status/631844606964035588" target="_blank">5 million student mark</a> and Udacity&rsquo;s Sebastian Thrun said the company serves &ldquo;<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/technology-quarterly/21662654-sebastian-thrun-pioneer-googles-autonomous-cars-wants-teach-people-how" target="_blank">some 4 [million] registered users worldwide</a>, and about 60,000 working on nanodegrees at anyone one time&rdquo;.&nbsp; He also added that more than 60% of Udacity students complete their courses.</p>
<p>Canadian non-profit Onlea claims to be &ldquo;<a href="http://onlea.org/">the world's first MOOC production company</a>&rdquo;, with a mission to produce, &ldquo;mindful online learning crafted with scholarship, creativity and quality.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[UUK; THE; The Economist; BBC; Out-Law; The Scotsman]</em></p>
<p>Baroness Sharp writes on the UUK blog of her frustrations over <a href="http://blog.universitiesuk.ac.uk/2015/10/09/the-government-needs-to-support-part-time-study/">lack of government support for part-time study in HE</a>. &nbsp;&ldquo;Whereas we have seen applications from 18-year-olds hold up in spite of the introduction of &pound;9k fees, there has been a huge fall in the numbers of part-time students: 143,000 fewer entrants to part-time undergraduate study in 2013&ndash;14 compared to 2010&ndash;11.&rdquo;&nbsp; More recent figures for 2014&ndash;15 show a further fall, bringing the total to 55% on 2010&ndash;11 numbers. &nbsp;She concludes: &ldquo;It is all so nonsensical. &nbsp;Here is a government that says it is intent on tackling low productivity and skills shortages, and yet is blocking one of the obvious routes to help ease the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A survey by Hefce found that only <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/only-one-in-four-new-degree-courses-attracts-enough-students-study-suggests">28% of new university programmes attracted enough students to be sustainable</a>.&nbsp; However, this is a big step forward compared with an older analysis of 2005-08 UCAS data that showed just one in 10 new single-subject degree courses managed to recruit at least 10 to 15 students (researchers at the time suggested that 15 to 30 was probably the minimum viable figure).</p>
<p>The Economist reports that <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21670045-scrapping-tuition-fees-has-helped-rich-students-expense-poor-ones-costly-promise">the abolition of tuition fees in Scotland has done little to widen access</a> to HE. &nbsp;The proportion of students from state schools entering Scotland&rsquo;s elite universities has fallen since 2011 and although the proportion from non-professional backgrounds has risen by 0.2 percentage points (to 26.8%), the equivalent rise in England was 2.2 percentage points (to 33.1%).</p>
<p>The chairman and governing board of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-34474169#?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">Glasgow Clyde College</a> have been removed by the Scottish government.&nbsp; Education Secretary Angela Constance said the outgoing board had "failed to discharge its duties on a number of counts".&nbsp; These included "breaching clear rules on expenditure limits, allowing its relationship with student representatives to break down, and failing to investigate governance concerns raised by the principal before her suspension".</p>
<p><a href="http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2015/september/uk-signs-universities-joint-research-agreement-with-china/">UK universities will work with organisations in China on joint academic research</a> and new institutions under an agreement between the UK and Chinese governments.&nbsp; A total of 23 education agreements were signed at the 8<sup>th</sup> UK-China Education Summit last month, which will see UK universities and organisations working with partners in China on higher, vocational, school and sports education. &nbsp;And seven <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/scots-universities-forge-new-links-in-brazil-1-3893075#axzz3oLgKYv5q">Scottish universities are in discussions with 20 Brazilian universities</a> and government agencies to try to develop new research partnerships between the two nations, focusing on areas of shared research interest such as environmental management, air and water pollution, agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries and geology.</p>

<p>The University of Exeter has announced an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34412637#?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">&ldquo;international partnership&rdquo; with Pearson</a> to develop online masters' degrees &ldquo;in a variety of subjects&rdquo;, starting in Sep 2016.&nbsp; Pearson already helps run more than 70 online degrees at Arizona State University.&nbsp; The new courses will include weekly interactive online teaching sessions delivered from university faculties.&nbsp; Exeter described the OU as &ldquo;terrific&rdquo; but said the new courses would explore &ldquo;some of the really exciting work and discovery that's happening at Exeter&rdquo; as well as taking it &ldquo;to as many people as possible around the globe&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1561149/pearson-snaps-up-uk-citizenship-test-provider">Pearson hopes to buy the e-assessments division of LearnDirect</a>, which oversees the UK's national citizenship test and Driver &amp; Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) testing (thought to be the largest online assessment contract in Europe).&nbsp; This will be the company&rsquo;s first deal since selling the Financial Times and The Economist for more than &pound;1bn and it accelerates Pearson's reshaping into an education and training-focused company, building on its global operations across school, higher education and job-related testing.&nbsp; However, it appears that the <a href="http://www.lse.co.uk/AllNews.asp?code=wmqo52jk&headline=UK_Regulator_To_Look_Into_Pearson_Acquisition_Of_Learndirect_Business">Competition and Markets Authority</a> is looking into the deal.</p>
<p>The Japan Times reports that <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/09/25/national/new-reforms-threaten-future-of-japanese-language-study-in-england/#.VhzucNKFOCh">plans by Pearson to scrap A and A-S levels in Japanese</a> could threaten the future of Japanese language study in England. &nbsp;Over 3,500 people have signed a petition calling for the exam to be retained, arguing that removing the only qualification in Japanese for 16- to 18-year-olds is likely to reduce the incentive for younger students to take up the language in the first place.&nbsp; Discussions are ongoing with the Department for Education to find a way to save the qualification.</p>
<p>At last, Rupert Murdoch has found a buyer for his failed education venture, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/joel-klein-is-buying-rupert-murdochs-failed-education-biz#.wsMk51Bl9">Amplify</a>.&nbsp; The company fired about 500 of its 1,200 staff and the following day he sold it to a management team that includes Amplify&rsquo;s CEO, Joel Klein.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/the-worlds-largest-for-profit-college-is-going-public#.qx70vE5Yrp">Laureate Education</a>, the world&rsquo;s largest for-profit college company, filed for an Initial Public Offering last month.&nbsp; More than 1 million students are currently enrolled in schools owned by Laureate &ndash; four times as many students as were enrolled at the for-profit giant University of Phoenix in 2014.&nbsp; However, the company posted a net loss of $169m in 2015, and has $4.7bn in debts, compared to assets of $8bn.</p>
<p>The US Department of Defense has barred the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/university-of-phoenix-barred-from-military-bases-1444369975?mod=djemalertNEWS">University of Phoenix</a> from recruiting on military bases and preventing troops from using federal money for classes.</p>

<p><strong>The Effect of Subject and Student Characteristics in Degree Outcomes</strong></p>
<p><em>[Hefce]</em></p>
<p>Hefce&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/year/2015/201521/">Differences in degree outcomes: The effect of subject and student characteristics</a> report is well worth some examination.&nbsp; Building on data collected since 2010, highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A wide variation in pass rates across subject areas.&nbsp; E.g. 90% of medicine and dentistry graduates achieved either a first or upper second but, if only firsts are considered, mathematical science graduates are the most successful, at 35%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An average of 75% of full-time graduates gained a first or upper second compared with just 57% of part timers.&nbsp; The researchers attribute four percentage points of this gap to factors such as entry qualifications, but cannot explain the remaining 14 percentage point difference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>64% of mature graduates gain a first or upper second compared with 75% of young graduates.&nbsp; However, if mitigating factors such as entry qualifications are taken into account, mature graduates outperform youngsters by seven percentage points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Males, non-whites, students with disabilities and those from independent schools tend to achieve lower degree outcomes</p>

<p><strong>OU and British Council to Teach Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon</strong></p>
<p><em>[Ben Clifton; Stephen Downes; NYT]</em></p>
<p>The OU is set to team up with The British Council to <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=29403">teach English, French and German language skills to approximately 3,000 displaced Syrian refugees</a> who have temporarily settled in Jordan and Lebanon.&nbsp; Around 300 of the highest achieving students will be able to progress to OU accredited online degree courses and there will also be opportunities for at least 400 to continue their studies by taking a short online course on FutureLearn.&nbsp; Syrian refugees now represent an almost 10% increase in the Jordanian population of six million and, in Lebanon, this figure is around 20%.</p>
<p>Berlin-based <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/online-university-for-refugees_5612c9e7e4b0dd85030cdefa">Kiron University</a> has partnered with more than 20 others throughout the world to offer a free, three-year program that will grant students an internationally accredited degree.&nbsp; More than 15,000 potential students have already approached the school and, in order to offset the costs, Kiron is crowdfunding scholarships and has so far raised over $170,000 from 950 contributors.</p>
<p>And a New York Times visualisation shows <a href="http://www.martingrandjean.ch/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Refugees-select.png">the source and destination of the 14.4 million refugees</a> registered by UNHCR who fled their country in 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Students, Computers and Learning: Making the Connection</strong></p>
<p><em>[OECD; ALT]</em></p>
<p>OECD&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.oecd.org/fr/publications/students-computers-and-learning-9789264239555-en.htm">Students, Computers and Learning: Making the Connection</a> examines how students&rsquo; access to and use of ICT has evolved in recent years, and explores how education systems and schools are integrating ICT into students&rsquo; learning experiences.&nbsp; However, considering there are nearly 200 pages of detailed OECD data, the concluding implications are fairly underwhelming: we should teach and invest in digital foundation skills; raise awareness of the possible harmful aspects of internet use; train teachers and develop coherent plans for using ICT in the classroom; and learn from past experience when making future investments in technology.</p>
<p>A research study report from Prospects College of Advanced Technology (PROCAT), <a href="http://procatdigital.co.uk/resources/PROCAT Student Focus Groups Report.pdf">Technology Solutions for Further Education Learning</a>, investigated students&rsquo; access to and use of technology, as well as student expectations of the college in helping them gain skills, experiences and attributes in the use of technology.&nbsp; Top of their wants/expectations were robust wi-fi, availability of devices (laptops were preferred over tablets because of their keyboards) or the ability to use their own, and access to printers.&nbsp; Some 97% owned a smartphone, 82% a laptop and 69% a tablet.</p>

<p><strong>Transforming Education for the Next Generation</strong></p>
<p><em>[Intel]</em></p>
<p>Intel&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/education/solutions/next-generation.html">Practical Guide to Learning and Teaching with Technology</a> aims to share insights, perspectives, and practical strategies from education leaders and visionaries around the world, with tips, tactics, and case studies drawn from Intel&rsquo;s work with teachers, education systems, and governments in over 100 countries.&nbsp; Amongst its conclusions: &ldquo;We [need to] create non-punitive cultures that value the learnings from - and can move on from - mistakes. &nbsp;If we&rsquo;re not making mistakes, we&rsquo;re not innovating. &nbsp;We need to make it safe to acknowledge what we don&rsquo;t know, living up to our promise to be and to support one another as lifelong learners.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Student Video Presentations Build Community in an Online Course</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>One of the positive features of Robert Talbert&rsquo;s face-to-face calculus course was student presentations of their work followed afterwards by a whole-class discussion. &nbsp;But when the course shifted online, his solution was to <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/how-student-video-presentations-can-build-community-in-an-online-course/57435">get students to create videos of themselves</a> and post them to YouTube.&nbsp; Each student was tasked with selecting two problems from a list and preparing a video (max 6 min for both) within a week.&nbsp; It was also a requirement that the student&rsquo;s face, voice and handwriting had to be present in the video all at the same time, at all times (i.e. typically an upper body shot of the student presenting at a whiteboard).&nbsp; The initiative has proved successful and Talbert concludes, &ldquo;Possibly the most important thing is that they added a large dose of humanity to the [distance] student experience. &nbsp;Students got to see and hear each other, and suddenly the idea of &lsquo;classmates&rsquo;, even &lsquo;class&rsquo; itself, was no longer an abstraction.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Future is Virtual?</strong></p>
<p><em>[JISC; Google; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Matt Ramirez reports on the Jisc Blog on five emerging trends for innovative tech in FE and HE, claiming that <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/blog/five-emerging-trends-for-innovative-tech-in-education-25-sep-2015">augmented and virtual reality</a> (AR/VR) are becoming firmly accepted by the education sector for adding value to learning experiences.&nbsp; His post includes links to some useful tools and exemplars.</p>
<p>But might the costs of kit make VR too expensive?&nbsp; Google killed that myth with its under-&pound;10 <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/get/cardboard/">Google Cardboard</a>, designed to turn your smartphone into VR googles, although you couldn&rsquo;t exactly describe it as a stylish solution.&nbsp; There are also rumours of a similar device from <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/microsoft-cardboard-vr-headset">Microsoft</a>.&nbsp; But now comes the new $99 <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/24/gear-vr-for-all">Samsung Gear VR</a>, made by Oculus and compatible with the whole 2015 line of Samsung Smartphones including the Note 5, S6, S6 Edge, and S6 Edge+ when it ships next month.&nbsp; There will also be a new Gear VR Gamepad, featuring an Xbox-style dual-stick design.</p>

<p><strong>New Consumer Protection Measures</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>New UK consumer protection measures came into force in the Consumer Rights Act on 1 Oct.&nbsp; Entitlement to a full refund on faulty goods now lasts for 30 days after the purchase (rather than the previous "reasonable time").&nbsp; There is also <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34403005">new protection for buyers of online digital content</a>, with entitlement to a replacement if downloads do not work (but not a refund) and providers liable to pay compensation for virus removal if infection was due to the download.&nbsp; The act also opens the door for class action law suits where claims for compensation can be made on behalf of a group of people.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; Audrey Watters; Stephen Downes; Campus Technology; Jisc]</em></p>
<p>Commentators have been promising/threatening that MOOCs will disrupt HE almost since they first emerged, but might <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/08/05/how-nanodegrees-are-disrupting-higher-education.aspx">nanodegrees</a> actually make this happen?&nbsp; Udacity has trademarked the nanodegree and it so far has six running, including the much heralded Android Developer course, created in close cooperation with Google, for which learners pay $200/month but with a 50% refund if they complete within 12 months.&nbsp; Earlier this year, Coursera announced a similar initiative &ndash; microdegrees &ndash; in partnership with Google, Instagram and others.&nbsp; That combination of affordable, certified, vocationally relevant content, developed with and supported by industry, could be the game changer.&nbsp; According to the University of Wisconsin&rsquo;s chancellor, Cathy Sandeen, &ldquo;A growing number of industries are open to the idea of employing people with portfolio backgrounds &ndash; that is, people without four-year degrees who have done different things and can show you what they've done&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Coursera has launched a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/gsi">Global Skills Initiative</a> aimed at bringing top companies &ndash; including Cisco, Microsoft and UBS &ndash; and universities together to produce online courses in fields like data science, computer programming, and finance.&nbsp; Companies will contribute funding for production costs in addition to applied projects, guest lectures, case studies, and other materials that incorporate industry expertise into the course content, with the ultimate aim of developing learners in job-relevant skills.</p>
<p>Zaid Ali Alsagoff has published a blueprint for <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cQ7rXmFI4kOHrkiv5-j6bf1l8oxy5wWR-RWde8wWcQ/edit">NOOCs (Nano Open Online Courses)</a> which he hopes to launch next month.&nbsp; Each NOOC will be just a few hours in duration, which means &ldquo;Instead of having to do the whole course, I can now focus on the juice (I want), get assessed, and be certified (or Badged) on it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sound plausible, although Stephen Downes wonders whether it really constitutes a networked &lsquo;course&rsquo; or is simply &ldquo;another way to present content?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec Couros and Katia Hildebrandt describe and discuss <a href="http://educationaltechnology.ca/couros/2603">a framework for teaching open courses</a>. &nbsp;They identify seven elements of course design they have used in their own open courses before suggesting possible strategies for building a framework for open courses that might lead to more positive student involvement.&nbsp; The first of these is the semi-structured course environment, described by Douglas Thomas and John Seely Brown thus: &ldquo;The new culture of learning actually comprises two elements. The first is a massive information network that provides almost unlimited and resources to learn about anything. &nbsp;The second is a bounded and structured environment that allows unlimited agency to build and experiment with things within those boundaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As of last week, Coursera&rsquo;s &ldquo;Verified Certificates&rdquo; will be renamed <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/125545067462/coursera-update-a-new-name-for-verified">&ldquo;Course Certificates&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside 45 universities and 19 other organizations, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/08/04/futurelearn-mooc-platform-adds-5-new-universities.aspx">FutureLearn</a> has added Durham, Manchester, the University of Madrid, the University of New South Wales and Japan&rsquo;s Keio University to its stable.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian; Peter Horrocks; The Telegraph; BBC]</em></p>
<p>The Independent Commission on Fees said raising the cost of undergraduate tuition to &pound;9,000 a year has led to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/30/tuition-fees-report-fall-mature-part-time-students-threatens-social-mobility?CMP=share_btn_tw">&ldquo;a significant and sustained fall in part-time students and mature students&rdquo;</a>.&nbsp; The commission called for the House of Commons Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee to urgently investigate the reasons for the severe decline, concluding: &ldquo;This is a failure which threatens both social mobility and economic performance.&rdquo;&nbsp; It also expressed concern about the effectiveness of university recruitment strategies, especially among disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>The Telegraph considers whether a combination of high fees and the demise of maintenance grants mean that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/11790571/Will-UK-students-look-to-free-online-higher-education.html?utm_content=buffer2843f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">more UK students will turn to free online higher education</a>?&nbsp; James Connington considers <a href="http://uopeople.edu/">University of the People</a> as one potential source.&nbsp; UoP has relationships with NYU, Yale, the UN, Microsoft and Hewlett Packard.&nbsp; Courses are tuition free and the only costs are a $50 application fee plus $100 per exam taken.</p>
<p>Over half the prisons inspected by Ofsted in 2013‑14 were judged as requiring improvement, or were <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/aug/04/michael-gove-prison-education-justice-secretary-jail">inadequate for learning and skills</a>. &nbsp;In those prisons, inspectors found &ldquo;education and training had little impact on supporting prisoners&rsquo; progression to employment or training after release&rdquo;.&nbsp; The majority of prisoner degrees were paid for by grants from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills until 2010, since when the number of prisoners doing OU degrees has dropped from 1,722, to 1,079.</p>
<p>A new report from the National Audit Office warns that there has been a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33595027">&ldquo;rapid decline&rdquo; in the finances of the FE sector</a> in England, with almost half of FE colleges in deficit in 2013-14 and 29 being reported as having &ldquo;poor financial health&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, a spokesman for DBIS claimed that there will be &ldquo;up to an additional &pound;25m this financial year to help support the creation of three million apprenticeships by 2020&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Coventry-based RDI (part of Capella Education) has become <a href="http://www.rdi.co.uk/online-distance-learning-provider-rdi-has-achieved-university-title/">Arden University</a>, having been accredited by DBIS, making it the only specialist distance learning university to launch in the UK since the OU was established.&nbsp; Around two-thirds of RDI&rsquo;s current students are based overseas and 90% studying whilst in employment.&nbsp; As well as developing its own programmes through Arden University, RDI will also continue to offer distance learning courses from its UK university partners, Anglia Ruskin, Bradford and Sunderland.</p>

<p>OU Students are going to have their progress monitored from 2015-16 by a new program, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33675471">OU Analyse</a>, which will track students' paths through courses and engagement with online learning modules.&nbsp; It uses a variety of data sets held by the OU and assesses the likelihood of a student submitting their next assignment by using information gathered from four different algorithms.&nbsp; The OU has taken steps to ensure that students' privacy is not compromised by the scheme &ndash; putting in place an ethics policy, agreed in consultation with a student committee, to protect their data.</p>

<p><strong>White House: Innovation in Higher Education</strong></p>
<p><em>[George Siemens]</em></p>
<p>George Siemens was one of the great and the good invited to a closed-doors White House meeting last month to discuss <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2015/08/03/white-house-innovation-in-higher-education/">quality and innovation in HE</a>.&nbsp; Whilst respecting confidentialities, he posts 12 observations representing his personal reactions to the conversation, including&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Higher education generally has no clue about what&rsquo;s brewing in the marketplace as a whole&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows &hellip; what the university will look like in the future&rdquo;, but expect more (not less), different, and with greater corporate input</p>

<p><strong>Higher Education : Access Denied</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>I read all of Stephen Downes&rsquo; OLWeekly emails and have to be quite selective about what I include here for fear of being swamped.&nbsp; But this item &ndash; <a href="http://www.downes.ca/post/64221">referring to a blog post by Graham Brown-Martin</a> &ndash; I include verbatim because (for me) it just seemed to say all the right things:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a small thing, but illustrative: the correct expression is "struck a chord", not "struck a cord".&nbsp; Why does that even matter?&nbsp; The former shows that you understand what the words mean, while the latter shows that you are parroting by rote.&nbsp; And this - not "a vested interest in maintaining an intellectual hegemony" - is what the three or four years of an undergraduate education is intended to produce.&nbsp; These minor differences in expression and presentation (citing people by their first name, use of generalizations like, "no interest in transformation", out-of-place employment of clich&eacute;s like "wax lyrical") are very obvious to a person with a formal education and invisible to a person without one.&nbsp; The result is the difference between learning on one's own, and learning through immersion in a knowing community, the difference between remembering what words mean and being able to speak a language.&nbsp; I have nothing but sympathy for Graham Brown-Martin, but it's hard, especially if it wasn't part of your early life, and you can't learn to speak a language by reading books.&nbsp; This - and not just a bunch of stuff to remember - is what needs to be produced by online learning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Apple Dominance (gasp)</strong></p>
<p><em>[Bloomberg; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>US retailers sold $375 million of watches in June 2015, 11% less than a year ago, according to data from NPD.&nbsp; The market for watches that cost less than $1,000 is most at risk, with consumers in that price range indicating they&rsquo;re the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-07/apple-helps-push-u-s-watch-sales-to-biggest-drop-in-seven-years">most likely to buy an Apple Watch</a>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Apple Watch is going to gain a significant amount of penetration,&rdquo; said NPD&rsquo;s Fred Levin, &ldquo;The first couple of years will be difficult for watches in fashion categories.&rdquo;&nbsp; Apple has not revealed sales figures but analysts suggest the company may have sold at least 1.9 million watches, assuming an average selling price of $499.</p>

<p><strong>And Finally&hellip;</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>We would probably all agree that rich use of language leads to better society and learning, but Stephen Downes writes &ndash; &ldquo;We certainly need language of some sort in order to create models and representations. &nbsp;But to my mind, that's not how we learn. &nbsp;Consider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVaITA7eBZE">this case from the BBC demonstrating a crow undertaking a complex eight-stage task</a>. &nbsp;Crows caw, but they don't have a language. &nbsp;This is the sort of behaviour that any learning theory needs to explain. &nbsp;It's not enough to theorize how <em>humans</em> learn. &nbsp;We need to know how <em>learning happens</em>, no matter where it occurs.&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; Inside Higher Ed; Audrey Watters; eCampus News; NYT; eLearning Industry]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/as-coursera-evolves-colleges-stay-on-and-investors-buy-in/57267">Coursera has announced a further $60m of venture capital investment</a> that it proposes to use to expand further outside the US and to experiment with new offerings such as its mini-degrees that have good &ldquo;product-market fit&rdquo; and thus generate revenue.&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s not all about professional development: &ldquo;About half our content is career oriented and half isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said CEO Richard Levin. &ldquo;One of the things we&rsquo;re thinking about would be premium content on top of [the free materials] in liberal-arts courses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Predating this announcement was news that <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/128115772357/30-new-business-computer-science-and-data">Coursera is launching 30+ new Specializations</a> this month in business, computer science, and data science. Each Specialization culminates in a hands-on Capstone Project which learners can add to their professional portfolios and CV.&nbsp; Industry partners include market leaders like Google, Qualcomm, Yahoo, IBM and Amazon.</p>
<p>The Texas State University System has announced a <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/09/11/texas-state-promotes-free-frosh-mooc-year">Freshman Year for Free</a> programme which allows students to earn a full year of credit via edX MOOCs. &nbsp;The only costs to students would be to take and pass either Advanced Placement or College Level Examination Program tests after completing the various MOOCs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New York Times reports on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/nyregion/online-summer-courses-attracting-college-bound-high-schoolers.html?_r=1">growing numbers of high school students taking MOOCs</a> (although the examples they cite are highly driven individuals), both to enhance subject knowledge and differentiate them from other college applicants.&nbsp; Admissions officers agree that more MOOCs are being included on applications, but that they tend to regard them as &lsquo;extracurricular&rsquo; because there remains low confidence of their content and quality.</p>
<p>Researchers from Harvard and MIT have analysed 115 MOOCs and discovered a <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/08/26/harvard-mit-researchers-find-mooc-learners-using-multiple-accounts-cheat">new form of cheating</a>, involving the creation of multiple accounts to allow correct-answer-harvesting, that they claim poses a &ldquo;serious threat to the trustworthiness of MOOC certification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Learning has launched a <a href="http://www.mooc4dev.org/">MOOC Development portal</a>, powered by the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur&rsquo;s mooKIT.&nbsp; Interested partner institutions can use the portal to create and offer their own MOOC which is mobile phone-, Twitter- and Facebook-friendly, with up to 10,000 registrations per course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a while since we&rsquo;ve had a new MOOC acronym so, courtesy of McGill University and edX, we bring you the world's first <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/group-mooc-set-to-ignite-global-social-change-523422031.html">GROOC</a> (MOOC for groups).&nbsp; <em>Social Learning for Social Impact</em> is co-created by management guru Henry Mintzberg and it aims to &ldquo;inspire social change through global collaboration of like-minded people&rdquo;.&nbsp; So, a c-MOOC then.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; BBC; Channel 4; The Guardian; Donald Clark]</em></p>
<p>A CIPD report, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20150820150823679">Over-Qualification and Skills Mismatch in the Graduate Labour Market</a>, finds that the increasing number of graduates in the UK labour market has significantly outstripped the creation of high-skilled jobs and is leading to negative consequences, with 58.8% of graduates currently in non-graduate jobs. &nbsp;However, Universities UK responded saying the skills provided by HE, such as the ability to think critically, are lifelong and increasingly in demand.&nbsp; The Association of Graduate Recruiters predicted an 11.9% rise in vacancies this year, following an increase of 4.3% last year.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34026051">Student Loans Company</a>, in the three years from 2010, loans and grants given to foreign students at alternative providers, which receive no direct state funding, increased from &pound;50m to &pound;675m. &nbsp;Payments were suspended by DBIS in 2013 as it was feared the system was being abused and, when 11,000 applications were reviewed, it was found that 992 people had been given money before stricter checks were put in place. &nbsp;A total of &pound;5.4m was wrongly paid and, of &pound;2.45m in the hands of individual students from 23 countries, including a large number from Romania, the SLC said it had been able to recover &pound;278,427 so far.</p>
<p>In a letter to the Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond writes: &ldquo;From a foreign policy point of view, Britain's role as a world class destination for international students is a highly significant element of our soft power offer. &nbsp;It's an issue that's consistently raised with me by our foreign counterparts.&rdquo;&nbsp; He joins the Chancellor and the Business Secretary in <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/philip-hammond-student-migration-target-risks-uk-reputation">calling for student figures to be stripped out of the target to reduce net migration</a> from its current 330,000 to less than 100,000 by the next general election. &nbsp;The latest data shows that in the year to the end of March the number of overseas students coming to the UK for more than a year rose from 176,000 to 188,000, with around three quarters from outside the EU.</p>
<p>Jo Johnson believes teaching has been neglected in the pursuit of brand reputation via international rankings in parts of the UK&rsquo;s HE system, and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-34197403">the patchiness of teaching quality</a> is damaging the reputation of UK universities.</p>
<p>The Guardian&rsquo;s Nick Hillman does not agree with George Osborne&rsquo;s claim that &pound;9,000 fees are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-george-osbornes-summer-budget-2015-speech">&ldquo;a triumph of progressive reform&rdquo;</a> and is calling for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/08/part-time-student-numbers-undergraduates">greater lobbying against the collapse in part-time student numbers</a>.&nbsp; He refers to an unpublished DBIS survey carried out earlier this year in which university staff admitted part-time students were seen as a lower priority than &ldquo;full-time and international students who brought in more revenue&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Donald Clark looks at <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/7-things-corbyn-wants-in-education.html">ten Corbyn education policies</a> which he believes make good sense.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Hirst; Audrey Watters; Inside Higher Ed; EdSurge]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://keypathedu.com/en-uk/">Keypath Education</a> appointed Rajay Naik as CEO (Europe) in June following his five years at The Open University and the company has now launched its European operation. &nbsp;Keypath researches, designs, launches, markets and delivers online degree programmes for its university partners in the UK, United States and Australia. &nbsp;Naik believes, &ldquo;The global ambition of our universities continues to expand, and they appreciate the constraints of conventional campuses.&nbsp; Higher quality online degree programmes allow universities to innovate, students to have more choice and our sector and economy to prosper.&rdquo;&nbsp; Keypath has stated that its sole focus until 2017 will be the launching of online degrees and the company expects their investment in British education will rise to many millions of pounds by 2016/2017.</p>
<p>Having sold the FT and its stake in The Economist, <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/21/432719104/how-will-pearson-spend-2-billion-more-on-education">Pearson</a> is sitting on around $2bn of loose change.&nbsp; Anya Kamenetz considers how it might spend this nest egg, and also what it needs to do to turnaround some of the negative perceptions of its brand, particularly in the US where its presence (monopoly?) in the standardised testing marketplace has led to almost monthly <a href="http://www.postbulletin.com/news/local/vendor-takes-pay-cut-over-minnesota-student-testing-glitches/article_823283b4-b8a0-5563-88cc-6def60fcd1d9.html">bad news stories</a>.&nbsp; She wonders whether a lack of significant competition lies at the heart of the problem.</p>
<p>&hellip;Not to worry, strong competition may soon be coming from McGraw-Hill Education if plans for a <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-09-04-mcgraw-hill-education-eyes-6-billion-ipo?utm_content=bufferf08d7&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">$6bn initial public offering</a> come to fruition.</p>
<p>Graham Holdings has sold its <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/09/08/purchase-kaplan-campuses-finalized">Kaplan Higher Education campuses</a> to Education Corporation of America.&nbsp; For-profit chain ECA has purchased all 38 Kaplan campuses and related assets, although Kaplan will continue to operate Kaplan University and eight professional schools.</p>
<p>Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Cengage have filed a lawsuit in the US against textbook importer Information Recyclers which accuses its three owners of <a href="http://the-digital-reader.com/2015/08/13/cengage-mcgraw-hill-and-pearson-file-suit-against-textbook-importer/">importing and selling pirated counterfeit copies of textbooks</a> whose copyrights belong to the three publishers.</p>
<p>TES, one of Britain's largest education resource companies, boasts more than 800,000 resources and 7.3m registered teacher-users in Britain, Australia and other countries in Europe and Asia.&nbsp; Now the company aims to offer up materials from educators around the globe on their new marketplace for resources, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-08-20-tes-online-marketplace-for-teacher-materials-opens">TES.com</a>, the US version of which opened last month. &nbsp;Whereas materials used to be free, teachers can now offer their resources for sale and, in the UK, these now account for about 50% of downloads, with TES taking a 20% fee from sellers.</p>
<p>After seven years and $105 million in venture funding, <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-08-28-finally-knewton-opens-adaptive-learning-platform-to-teachers-and-learners?utm_campaign=18eff420d7-Innovate+238&utm_medium=email&utm_source=EdsurgeLive&utm_term=0_0f1ec25b60-18eff420d7-292151429">Knewton</a> has finally opened up its adaptive learning platform to teachers, students and parents. It claims the free platform has over 100,000 pieces of content and multiple-choice questions for K-12 maths, English, science and history.&nbsp; Adaptive learning algorithms can deliver different sequences of learning materials and assessments based on how students progress.</p>
<p>Now pay attention.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-08-20-the-unwinding-begins-amplify-sells-computer-science-mooc">News Corp</a> is trying to sell its Amplify education business.&nbsp; Amplify had a computer science MOOC arm (AmplifyMOOC) which has now evolved into <a href="https://edhesive.com/">edhesive</a> (&ldquo;online learning that sticks&rdquo;)(groan) and that has been sold to an undisclosed buyer for an undisclosed amount.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2015/08/07/who-are-your-online-students/#sthash.GOKzAWIP.JksXOpMq.dpuf">Online college students 2015: Comprehensive data on demands and preferences</a> reports on a survey of 1,500 US students who were recently enrolled, currently enrolled or planning to enrol in the next 12 months in either a fully online undergraduate or graduate degree program or a fully online certificate or licensure program.&nbsp; Key findings from its 53 pages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Competition for online students is increasing and they expect policies and processes tailored to their needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online students have a wide range of needs and backgrounds.&nbsp; About half would attend a hybrid or low-residency option if their program was not available fully online, but 30% would look elsewhere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main motivation for online students is to improve their work prospects and so courses must prepare them for and connect them to the world of work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Half of online students live within 50 miles of their campus, so a strong local brand is critical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost matters, with 45% of respondents selecting the most inexpensive institution.&nbsp; Among 23 potential marketing messages, the most appealing were found to be &ldquo;Affordable tuition&rdquo; and &ldquo;Free textbooks&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Use of Different Media in e-Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Donald Clark]</em></p>
<p>A bit like Tony Bates, Donald Clark seems to have become a more prolific writer, blogger, tweeter, etc, since he stopped having a regular day job.&nbsp; In separate posts, here are his design thoughts on the use of the following media in e-learning: <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.gr/2015/08/10-bloody-good-reasons-for-using-much.html">text</a> (and <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/10-top-online-learning-writing-rules.html">how best to write it</a>); <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.gr/2015/09/10-rules-most-often-broken-to-avoid-bad.html">graphics</a>; <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.gr/2015/09/10-essential-rules-on-use-of-animation.html">animation</a>; <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.gr/2015/09/10-sound-pieces-of-advice-on-use-of.html">audio</a>; and talking-head <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.gr/2015/09/10-rules-on-using-much-maligned-talking.html">video</a>.</p>

<p><strong>QA and Internationalisation Top Priorities for European Universities</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>A new report from the European University Association (EUA), <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/European-Universities-Make/232625/?cid=gn&utm_source=gn&utm_medium=en">Trends 2015: Learning and teaching in European universities</a>, is the result of responses from 451 universities from 46 countries.&nbsp; Compared to the previous report five years ago, it shows how institutions in different countries have faced up to the economic crisis, changing demographic trends and other major political and social challenges &ndash; with quality assurance and internationalisation emerging as the top priorities across Europe.&nbsp; The EU is the geographical target for 73% of European universities, with Asia (48%) gaining in importance whilst non-EU Eastern Europe and North America are losing ground.&nbsp; Interest in the EU is the lowest in Ireland (29%) and Great Britain (33%).</p>

<p><strong>Expect Learning to Become More Digital</strong></p>
<p><em>[Fox; SchoolGuide; THE]</em></p>
<p>Two classic examples of publishers asking the right questions to the right people and getting the right answers&hellip;</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2015/08/20/mcgraw-hill-education-ceo-expect-learning-to-become-more-digital/">McGraw-Hill Education</a>, not only is the learning environment of today very different compared to two or three decades ago (gasp), but it&rsquo;s going to get more digital.&nbsp; The company sold more software-based text in HE last year than physical textbooks, and both educators (75% of 171 surveyed) and students (55% of 1000 surveyed) want and expect more of it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.ischoolguide.com/articles/23131/20150821/vitalsource-technologies-survey-students-digital-interactive-homework.htm">VitalSource</a> found that 61% (of 500) students want more digitally-interactive homework.&nbsp; Between 2011 and 2015, the number of students who use digital technology to read course materials rose from 63% to 87% and 74% feel they could get even better grades if their professors used even more tech in the classroom.</p>
<p>But what they don&rsquo;t report is that <a href="http://thejournal.com/articles/2015/08/31/survey-87-percent-of-parents-are-concerned-about-student-data-security.aspx">87% of US parents are concerned about student data security</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Martin Dougiamas and Changes to the Moodle Community</strong></p>
<p><em>[e-Literate]</em></p>
<p>Phil Hill recently interviewed <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/interview-with-martin-dougiamas-on-changes-to-moodle-community-this-year/">Moodle founder, Martin Dougiamas</a>.&nbsp; There was quite a focus on Moodle&rsquo;s relationship with the commercial sector so it may be reassuring to many that MD does not regard Blackboard&rsquo;s recent acquisitions as having a huge impact.&nbsp; &ldquo;Moodle&rsquo;s mission is not changing at all, we are just expanding and improving how we do things in response to a shifting ed-tech world.&rdquo;&nbsp; He notes that around 40% of the thousands of clients using Moodle Partners are using Moodle for company training but adds, &ldquo;we see our mission as being servants to the community of teachers and learners who need Moodle and quality open source free software. &nbsp;Our core duty is to give away the software we develop.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Exploring Engaged Student Learning on an OU Module </strong></p>
<p><em>[HEA]</em></p>
<p>Richard Jones (an OU lecturer in English Literature) writes on the HEA site about his involvement in a project looking at <a href="https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/blog/understanding-click-exploring-engaged-student-learning-open-university-module">Engaged Student Learning</a>. &nbsp;It involved the coordination of several practitioner inquiries into the experience of students studying a first-year undergraduate module. &nbsp;The project ended with a conference in which participants were able to share their findings alongside statistical data gathered from students&rsquo; use of the module website.</p>

<p><strong>The Educator&rsquo;s Guide to Social Media</strong></p>
<p><em>[ConnectSafely]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.connectsafely.org/wp-content/uploads/eduguide.pdf">The Educator&rsquo;s Guide to Social Media</a> covers the sort of ground you might expect: digital literacy, available tools, pedagogy, working and sharing online, privacy, inappropriate content/comments, etc.&nbsp; It seems to be aimed more at the high school age group but there&rsquo;s some useful content and links, particularly if you&rsquo;re relatively new to this field.</p>
<p>And Hootsuite provides a very useful list of <a href="http://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-tools-for-social-media-managers/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=engage&utm_campaign=pro_act_2_7&mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvarKde/hmjTEU5z17+UuX6Wxh5Z41El3fuXBP2XqjvpVQcBqMLHORw8FHZNpywVWM8TIKNAXt9pkMQzmAGk=">10 essential tools for social media managers</a> to plan and track their social media presence and effects.</p>

<p><strong>Deceptive Publishing</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Rick Anderson is concerned about commercial publishers who provide <a href="http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/08/17/deceptive-publishing-why-we-need-a-blacklist-and-some-suggestions-on-how-to-do-it-right/">&lsquo;Gold&rsquo; open access journals that may scam authors</a> or institutions into paying publication fees.&nbsp; He suggests a blacklist might be used to flag four types of predatory journals: phony journals, such as promotional sock-puppets; pseudo-scholarly journals, which don't do proper peer review and editing; false flag journals, which fool people into thinking they are submitting to legitimate journals; and Masqueraders, which pretend to have an association with a prestigious institution.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Top Tools for Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jane Hart]</em></p>
<p>Jane Hart is busy compiling her annual Top 100 Tools for Learning survey but, as a taster, she presents the thoughts of 15 Bloggers and their individual <a href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/blog/2015/08/27/15-bloggers/">top 10 tools for learning</a>.&nbsp; There are some old favourites such as Twitter, Yammer and Wordpress but plenty of more niche choices such as PowToon, Mentimeter, Ominigraffe and Overcast.&nbsp; Notable is the fact that there is no overall leader &ndash; each person&rsquo;s preferences differ, reflecting both the diversity of tools available and the differing interests and needs of the users.</p>

<p><strong>New Apple Products</strong></p>
<p><em>[Engadget]</em></p>
<p>New office buildings don&rsquo;t come cheap, so it would be really helpful for Apple if you could see your way clear to buying a new iPhone or two to help keep the wolf from the door.&nbsp; Pre-orders are open (and breaking all previous records) and here are the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/09/09/iphone-6s-ipad-pro-apple-tv-uk/">UK products and prices</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, you might want to create your own &ndash; in which case you can arm yourself with its Photosphere app and Ricoh&rsquo;s new <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/google-street-view-gets-app-camera-360-degree-photos/?mbid=social_twitter">Theta S digital camera</a>.&nbsp; It captures 360˚ footage at the touch of a button and can store about an hour&rsquo;s worth (at 1080p) on its 8GB of internal storage.</p>

<p>Kadenze is a new MOOC provider that has created <a href="http://www.educationdive.com/news/arts-education-goes-mooc/400913/">a digital platform designed for arts courses</a>.&nbsp; They have already teamed up with programs at 18 institutions, including Stanford and Princeton, and the aim is to embrace high production values and provide a &ldquo;multimedia rich&rdquo; service that allows students to create online portfolios, upload music files and scanned art, watch videos, and participate in discussion forums.&nbsp; There are 4 initial courses, with another 18 planned, on subjects including music, art history, and technology. &nbsp;Whilst enrolment and viewing will be free, students will be charged $7 to submit assignments and receive grades and feedback.&nbsp; Credit-bearing courses come more expensive at $300, $600, or $900.</p>
<p>OpenClassrooms has partnered with IESA Multim&eacute;dia to launch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/07/openclassrooms-launches-first-mooc-based-bachelor-degree-recognized-by-french-state/#.fcbm4v:dXgY">the first State-recognized bachelor degree in France that relies exclusively on MOOCs</a>.&nbsp; There are three learning paths &ndash;in engineering, design and digital marketing &ndash; and students will have to complete all the courses and required projects in order to get their degree, which will normally take a year.&nbsp; The degree is the same the conventional one offered by IESA, apart from the absence of a physical teacher and students, but the MOOCs include a weekly video-chat with a mentor to discuss problems and maintain motivation.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC Research</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; Campus Technology; Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>A survey of more than 4,500 MOOC students found that <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/students-in-free-courses-study-but-not-as-much-as-most-students-do/56935">more than 55% said they studied two to five hours per week</a>, with 22% spending 6-10 hours.&nbsp; This compares healthily with a recent survey of US first-year residential college students which found that about 43% spent more than six hours per week studying.&nbsp; The data show that students do not dedicate one particular time of the week to complete their MOOCs: &ldquo;People who are spending a fair amount of time on them are fitting it into their schedules in a very flexible way, not in a rigid way&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Kalyan Veeramachaneni, a researcher at MIT has developed <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/07/01/mit-researchers-develop-model-to-predict-mooc-dropouts.aspx?m=2">a model to predict when students may be about to drop out of a MOOC</a>, based on analysis of key variables such as amount of time spent per correct homework item and amount of time spent on learning resources such as video lectures.&nbsp; He cites the proportion of time that students spend on the course that falls on the weekend as being important because it is &ldquo;a proxy for how busy they are. &nbsp;And that put together with the other variables should tell you that the student has a strong motivation to do the work but is getting busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new survey by <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/07/06/survey-moocs-supplement-traditional-higher-ed.aspx?m=2">Duke University</a> of 9,000 students on 13 of their Coursera MOOCs focused particularly on those aged &lt;18 or &gt;65, or with no easy access to higher education.&nbsp; Researchers found that students in the younger group often took MOOCs in topics not taught in their schools or to explore different disciplines to help weigh academic and career choices; those in the over-65 group took MOOCs for lifelong learning, to keep their minds active and to mentor younger students in their own professional field.&nbsp; Those with limited access to HE chose MOOCs because they were available despite their financial or mobility limitations.</p>
<p>Researchers from Humboldt and MIT examined <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2015/07/08/mit-and-german-research-on-the-appalling-use-of-video-in-xmoocs/">the use of video in xMOOCs</a>, finding that in many MOOCs it is the primary medium for content, &ldquo;often separated by assessment questions&rdquo;.&nbsp; Two genres tended to be most used &ndash; the talking head or lecture, and screen capture with commentary &ndash; but the authors caution that it can be expensive and &ldquo;there is often not enough consideration given to whether or not video is the right medium to accomplish a MOOC&rsquo;s pedagogical goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjet.2015.46.issue-3/issuetoc">special issue of BJET</a> (Vol 46, 3) looks at MOOCs: &lsquo;disrupting&rsquo; teaching and learning practices in higher education.&nbsp; Fifteen papers consider aspects such as retention, media coverage, use of social media, assessment and learner characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian; THE; BBC; Mail Online; University World News]</em></p>
<p>George Osborne announced <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jul/08/maintenance-grants-scrapped-and-tuition-fees-to-increase-your-reaction-budget-2015">two major changes to UK HE in the budget</a>.&nbsp; Student maintenance grants will be replaced with loans from 2016-17, but with an increased maximum of &pound;8,200pa.&nbsp; Those HEIs that can demonstrate excellent teaching via the proposed Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) will be able to increase tuition fees in line with inflation from 2017-18.&nbsp; Both of these measures should make the OU a more attractive proposition.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.universitiesuk.ac.uk/2015/07/09/ou-head-are-more-students-from-poorer-backgrounds-going-to-university/">Peter Horrocks refutes George Osborne&rsquo;s budget claims</a> that a &ldquo;record number&rdquo; of students from low income backgrounds are going to university, and that the rise in tuition fees has not deterred people from applying &ndash; but Peter&rsquo;s evidence suggests that the Chancellor (or his civil servants) was being creative with the data.&nbsp; So 1-0 to the OU.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s just hope George&rsquo;s gang don&rsquo;t get us at playtime&hellip;</p>
<p>In a survey carried out last month by ComRes, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/mps-concerned-decline-part-time-study-survey-finds">73% of MPs say they are concerned by the decline in the number of students in part-time Higher Education</a>. &nbsp;Almost 200,000 fewer students were studying part-time in England last year compared to 2009/10 &ndash; a drop of 41%.&nbsp; Addressing a reception at the Houses of Parliament, Peter Horrocks called on policy-makers to address the decline: &ldquo;This Government has talked much about supporting those who work hard.&nbsp; Right now there is a golden opportunity for ministers to deliver on this by realising the kind of social and economic benefits part-time study creates.&nbsp; While it is encouraging to see MPs sharing our concern over the challenges facing our sector, now is the time to turn this into action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are similar funding concerns in the FE sector, with King&rsquo;s College&rsquo;s Prof Alison Wolf warning that Britain&rsquo;s supply of skilled workers may &ldquo;vanish into history&rdquo; if forthcoming FE budget cuts and relaxation of university student numbers caps are allowed to continue.&nbsp; Her new report, <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/publications/Issuesandideas-alison-wolf-digital.pdf">Heading for the precipice: Can further and higher education funding policies be sustained?</a> Concludes, &ldquo;In post-19 education, we are producing vanishingly small numbers of higher technician-level qualifications, while massively increasing the output of generalist bachelors degrees and low-level vocational qualifications&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33166429">(OIA) ruled on 2,175 complaints</a>, ruling in favour of 500 students and with 200 of these awarded payouts amounting to &pound;400,000.&nbsp; Disputes over academic issues such as degree classification or marks for work formed 61% of complaints.&nbsp; The OIA found that 59% of complaints were unjustified, 14% ineligible for OIA intervention, while 5% were withdrawn.</p>
<p>The UK is one of the top destinations for international students, attracting around 12.6% of the global market, but numbers from some sources such as India have been dropping and almost 24% of complaints received by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator last year were from international students.&nbsp; The Guardian warns that (shock) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jul/03/universities-dont-understand-how-international-students-learn">not all international students are the same</a>, not all stereotypical views (e.g. Asian students aren&rsquo;t critical thinkers) are accurate, and simply mixing them with English students to help them adjust doesn&rsquo;t work very well.</p>
<p>The Mail reveals that around half of UK universities (including 12 Russell Group) <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3137842/British-universities-allow-foreign-students-use-dictionaries-exams.html#ixzz3ej1iq7Xr">let foreign students use dictionaries in exams</a> in order to allow &ldquo;a level playing field&rdquo; for students from outside Britain.</p>
<p>A PA Consulting Group survey of 160 HE leaders has concluded that <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20150619112717179">UK universities are falling behind in educational innovation</a> and &ldquo;risk losing their world-leading reputation&rdquo;, whereas global competitors were &ldquo;innovating in response to student demands for more flexible and cheaper study options, new technologies that challenge traditional teaching methods and competition from new providers&rdquo;.&nbsp; Some 70% of VCs expect provision in the 2030s &ldquo;to remain focused around three-year campus-based study&rdquo; and nearly half thought it unlikely there would be a &ldquo;substantial shift towards alternative models of work-based study or towards online learning through alternative providers&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Apollo Education has had yet another poor quarter (to 31 May), with net revenue dropping by $113m and <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/U-of-Phoenix-Looks-to-Shrink/231247/">University of Phoenix student enrolments down</a> from nearly 241,900 a year ago to 206,900.&nbsp; Apollo laid off an additional 600 people last month, mostly enrolment counsellors but, in the finest spirit of you&rsquo;ve-got-to-speculate-to-accumulate, the company has bought a controlling interest in the Iron Yard, a &lsquo;coding boot camp&rsquo; that offers non-degree training.</p>
<p>Amplify, Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s education company, will stop selling the ruggedized tablet computers that were once a central part of the company&rsquo;s plan to shake up education.&nbsp; Despite an almost <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/news-corps-education-company-will-stop-making-tablets#.ihb3yV08K">$1bn investment by News Corp</a>, Amplify has struggled to gain a foothold in the education marketplace.</p>

<p><em>[Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>Interesting <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/06/19/essay-possibility-american-undergraduates-enrolling-britain">US perspective on studying for a degree in the UK</a>.&nbsp; Whilst we agonise over here about high fees, contact hours, teaching quality, etc, the view from across the pond is much more positive: &ldquo;Annual tuition for British undergraduate degrees averages well below the expense of well-considered private colleges in the US and about the same as that of an out-of-state public flagship university. &nbsp;By only taking three years to complete, however, British degrees stand in striking contrast to American four-year degrees that confront students and their families in the United States with severe, lingering financial challenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Professor Says Facebook Can Help Informal Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>Research shows that informal conversations with friends can facilitate learning, but very little has been studied about their online equivalents such as Facebook. &nbsp;Now researchers from Michigan State University have <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/professor-says-facebook-can-help-informal-learning/57059">studied students using a Facebook application about climate change</a> called Hot Dish which allows them to post articles and add comments.&nbsp; Of the 346 people in the group, only about 30 started their own comment threads or participated regularly, suggesting that those who benefited from the discussion were already very interested in the topic.&nbsp; Prof Christine Greenhow commented, &ldquo;We did see argumentation, we did see that debate was on-topic and on-task &hellip; It wasn&rsquo;t purely social, it wasn&rsquo;t off-topic.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Learning Experience Design</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Agonising over labels can be fraught with inconsequentiality, but the HE sector has never been completely happy with the (elsewhere) ubiquitous title of &lsquo;instructional designer&rsquo;, I presume because of its training connotations.&nbsp; So here&rsquo;s a suggestion from Connie Malamed that we move to a new name: <a href="https://christytucker.wordpress.com/2015/06/30/learning-experience-design-a-better-title-than-instructional-design/">Learning Experience (LX) Designer</a> because, &ldquo;Calling ourselves Learning Experience Designers acknowledges that we design, enable or facilitate experiences rather than courses.&nbsp; This gives us a broad license to empower people with the tools and information they need to do their jobs, regardless of the chosen format.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; Stephen Downes; EdSurge; eCampus News; World Bank; Forbes]</em></p>
<p>Google announced at last month&rsquo;s I/O conference that it will be designing curriculum for Nanodegree courses offered by Udacity, the first being a program in Android development.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-05-31-google-teams-with-udacity-to-offer-nanodegrees?utm_campaign=4d006060ef-Innovate+225-HIREEDU&utm_medium=email&utm_source=EdsurgeLive&utm_term=0_0f1ec25b60-4d006060ef-292151429">Android Nanodegree</a> will comprise six courses and is expected to take nine to 12 months to complete.&nbsp; It costs $200 per month, and top 50 students will be invited for a three-day career summit at Google's headquarters.</p>
<p>Matt Crosslin considers whether <a href="http://www.edugeekjournal.com/2015/05/25/what-if-the-problem-isnt-with-moocs-but-something-else/">MOOC retention problems relate to student motivation</a>.&nbsp; He notes that much of education relies on motivation that is predominantly extrinsic in nature (grades, credits, fees, gold stars, etc) whereas MOOCs tend to rely much more on intrinsic motivation.&nbsp; In other words, &ldquo;What if MOOCs are just a mirror that shows us the sociocultural problems we don&rsquo;t want to deal with in our system?&nbsp; What if the problem is not with the learners, but the way they have been programmed through the years?&nbsp; You can say MOOCs are failing because they lack sufficient &lsquo;student motivation&rsquo;, but what if it was actually the case that society has been failing for decades and MOOCs are just exposing this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Canadian researchers are digging beyond the headlines and analytics to discover much more about <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher-ed-beta/invisible-learners-taking-moocs">MOOC learners and learning experiences</a>.&nbsp; Through a series of interviews (70 so far), three initial findings have emerged that contradict the initial hope that MOOCs can help anyone, anywhere, anytime learners.&nbsp; Firstly, MOOC learners possess sophisticated study skills (e.g. note taking, investigating new or unfamiliar subject matter).&nbsp; A significant proportion also either live flexible lives that enable them to participate, or appear to be exceptional in their abilities to create time to study.&nbsp; Finally, many say that learning experiences are deeply emotional, with the potential to offer not just pleasure and appreciation but occasional anxiety and embarrassment as well.&nbsp; They believe these findings call into question, &ldquo;whether open courses, in their current form, are the democratizing forces they are sometimes depicted to be &ndash; and even whether &lsquo;educating a billion&rsquo; with MOOCs is a laudable goal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>EdCast has announced a new social media platform that allows people to post mini-MOOCs, or video snippets of educational content plus short text comments. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.ecampusnews.com/technologies/edcasting-edcast-mooc-989/">EdCasting</a> is a less formal version of online courses, and is akin to tweeting, &ldquo;with the difference being that each post is based on a video or link that can be described without being limited to 140 characters&rdquo;; however, there is no &lsquo;re-tweeting&rsquo;, meaning that content will not get diluted.&nbsp; The launch platform includes 10 channels ranging from entrepreneurship, architecture, robotics, technology, and health, filled with insights from over 100 &ldquo;globally renowned experts and influencers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With a population of 1.4bn, it&rsquo;s not surprising that the <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/education/moocs-china-are-growing">Chinese online education market</a> increased by 700% between 2013 and 2014 (compared to 9% in the US).&nbsp; Part of this growth includes MOOCs, and one of the Chinese government&rsquo;s goals is to train 13 million K-12 teachers on education technology skills in the next five years through MOOCs.</p>
<p>A new survey, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2015/06/10/moocs-emerge-as-disruptors-to-corporate-learning/">Leveraging MOOCs and Open Learning Assets in The Workplace</a>, sought the opinions of 222 heads of HR, Corporate Learning and Talent Management on the benefits and barriers, and the long term impact of MOOCs on corporate learning.&nbsp; Key findings are that MOOCs are seen as innovative and attractive (to staff and externals) but many companies want to go further and curate a wider range of open learning assets.&nbsp; Barriers to developing MOOCs include budget, technical and security issues, a lack of MOOC design skills among corporate learning professionals, and resistance amongst in-house L&amp;D professionals.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of Udemy&rsquo;s seven million students come from outside the US but the company has just raised $65 million in new funding to further expand its global presence.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-06-02-udemy-raises-65m-in-quest-to-grow-online-learning-marketplace-across-the-world">Udemy</a> currently offers 30,000 courses and those taught by its top 10 instructors generated $17 million in revenues, with between 25-97% of course fees distributed back to instructors.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coursetalk.com/">CourseTalk</a> site lets users find, rate and comment on MOOCs, and more than 74,000 user ratings for over 7,500 courses from 46 providers have now been analysed in <a href="https://d3q6qq2zt8nhwv.cloudfront.net/s/coursetalk/pdf/newco/What Reviews Divulge About Online Education.891195873352.pdf">What Reviews Divulge About Online Education</a>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not big on detail but the findings on pp3-9 give a succinct overview of what users are saying.&nbsp; To summarise: low rated courses (1-3 stars) are confusing, boring, outdated (or wrong) and predominantly free; whereas those scoring 4-5 stars are easy to navigate and digest, fun and interactive, flexible and charge a moderate cost.&nbsp; On average, paid courses were rated 1.4 stars higher than free courses.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/daphne-koller-on-the-future-of-online-education-1433532321">Daphne Koller</a>, &ldquo;If you put an instructor to sleep 300 years ago and woke him up in a classroom today, he&rsquo;ll say, Oh, I know exactly where I am&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; The Guardian; University World News]</em></p>
<p>A Channel 4 Dispatches investigation<strong> tonight at 8:00</strong> describes how <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/15/cheating-rife-in-uk-education-system-dispatches-investigation-shows">shady practices and in some cases outright fraud are woven into the fabric of UK education</a>.&nbsp; This includes, over the past four years, more than 58,000 undergraduates have been investigated by their universities for plagiarism, of whom 40,000 were disciplined, 12,000 had marks deducted and 400 were expelled or excluded from HE.</p>
<p>Some 46% of UK academics said they have been pressurised to mark students&rsquo; work generously, according to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/may/18/academics-under-pressure-to-bump-up-student-grades-guardian-survey-shows">a Guardian survey of university staff</a>, while 43% said they did not feel supported in their job and 37% did not believe teaching was valued by their institution.&nbsp; Nearly a third (31%) of women said they were worried that taking maternity leave would jeopardise their career progression and, among Russell Group staff members, 32% lacked faith in their vice-chancellor.</p>
<p>New Universities and Science Minister, Jo Johnson, is behind a crackdown on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33062052">190 bogus universities that are known to be offering fake degree certificates</a> in order to, &ldquo;protect the reputation of the UK as a provider of high-quality education&rdquo;. &nbsp;After a BBC investigation last year found fake University of Kent degree certificates on sale online for &pound;500, Radio Kent discovered a website in China selling degree certificates from dozens of UK universities and, in the first quarter of 2015 alone, Higher Education Degree Datacheck (HEDD) added 42 bogus institutions to their database.</p>
<p>The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills faces cuts of &pound;450m, with the Treasury saying that this will include <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33014472">&ldquo;savings in higher education and further education budgets&rdquo;</a>, but the Department for Education has indicated that this will include savings based on underspends in existing budgets, rather than cuts.&nbsp; The savings in education spending were announced by the Treasury as part of a &pound;4.5bn package to reduce public debt.</p>
<p>A new report from PwC, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20150521093111718">London Calling: International students&rsquo; contribution to Britain&rsquo;s economic growth</a>, estimates that international students in London are contributing &pound;1.32bn on fees to the UK economy, &pound;1.36bn on living costs and a further &pound;121m from visiting friends and families.&nbsp; London has &ldquo;more world-class universities than any other city in the world&rdquo; and as the &ldquo;most popular city in the world for international students&rdquo;, hosts 40,000 from continental Europe and 67,000 from the rest of the world.&nbsp; More than one in five of the 310,000 international students in the UK studies at a London university and 18% of students in London are international, representing 39% of the total fee income of London&rsquo;s universities and supporting an estimated 70,000 jobs in the capital.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial News</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Independent; FT; Audrey Watters; EdSurge; VentureBeat]</em></p>
<p>Aberdeen University is to become <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/aberdeen-university-becomes-first-uk-higher-education-institution-to-open-a-campus-in-south-korea-10256853.html">the first British HEI to open a campus in South Korea</a>, co-funded by the South Korean government and specialising in teaching engineering relating to the off-shore oil and gas industries. &nbsp;British universities and colleges have set up a number of overseas campuses, such as a Lancaster University in Ghana, Nottingham University in Malaysia and Leeds Metropolitan in India.</p>

<p>British investment company Sandbox Partners has bought <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2015/05/british_investor_buys_family_education_network_pearsons_edu-tainment_platform.html">Pearson's Family Education Network</a>, a platform designed to provide engaging learning activities for parents, teachers and students through games, activities, stories, homework help, and other resources.&nbsp; One of the most popular features is Poptropica &ndash; a virtual world that draws 3.2m monthly unique users in 200 different countries.</p>

<p>The EU has opened an official <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/11/european-commission-launches-formal-antitrust-investigation-into-amazons-ebooks-business/">antitrust investigation into Amazon</a> to determine if the company is abusing its power to distribute electronic books.&nbsp; The investigation will focus on Amazon&rsquo;s contracts that obligate publishers to tell the company if someone else is offering a better deal on electronic books.&nbsp; The EU worries this may be hampering competition and reducing consumer choice.</p>

<p><strong>KPCB Internet Trends Report 2015</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Kleiner Perkins partner <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends">Mary Meeker&rsquo;s annual Internet Trends Report</a> (196 slides) is always a feast of facts and figures.&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s begins with a story of reach, with 2.8bn global internet users (39% of the world population) and 5.2bn mobile phone users (73%) &ndash; and with the greatest annual growth currently in India (web +33%, smartphones +55%).&nbsp; Worldwide desktop traffic has peaked, but there is big growth in mobile data. &nbsp;Consumer use of technology is solid but &ldquo;government, health care, and education have the longest way to go&rdquo;.&nbsp; And &ldquo;six of the top 10 mobile apps globally are messaging apps ... messaging apps could evolve into the central hubs for communications&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>UNESCO Framework for Action </strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>UNESCO has released a proposed set of 42 &ldquo;thematic indicators&rdquo; to monitor global education progress and equity.&nbsp; Almost 200 organizations and individuals from 67 countries participated in a public consultation from Nov 14 to Jan 15, leading to the publication of <a href="http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/tag-proposed-thematic-indicators-post2015-education-agenda.pdf">Education 2030</a>.&nbsp; Indicators relate to: inequalities in education systems; education relating to global citizenship, HIV, sexuality and human rights; availability of ICT in schools; provision for people with disabilities; physical safety; and the effects of conflict and displaced populations.</p>

<p><strong>The Human Capital Report 2015</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>The World Economic Forum&rsquo;s <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Human_Capital_Report_2015.pdf">Human Capital Report 2015</a> investigates how countries are developing and deploying their people, evaluating the levels of education, skills and employment available in five age groups across 124 countries.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s rich in detail (319pp) but thin on humanism, with terms such as &lsquo;human capital&rsquo; and &lsquo;talent&rsquo; abounding.&nbsp; The model behind their Human Capital Index (p4) is also interesting, especially as I note that global workplace learning apparently ceases at age 54.&nbsp; Top countries?&nbsp; Finland, Norway and Switzerland, with Australia at 13, the US at 17 and the UK at 19.</p>

<p><strong>Students 'Cannot Multi-Task With Mobiles And Study'</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; The Guardian; The Telegraph]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33047927">Mobile Phones in the Classroom: Examining the Effects of Texting, Twitter, and Message Content on Student Learning</a> reports on a series of tests conducted with 145 undergraduates to investigate how well they coped with multiple tasks such as watching a lecture on a video and then taking notes and answering questions, while facing a series of interruptions on their internet-connected mobile phones.&nbsp; Perhaps not surprisingly, the researchers found that those sending and receiving messages while studying scored lower test results and were less effective at tasks such as note taking.&nbsp; They described an effect where students are, &ldquo;physically present, yet mentally preoccupied by non-course-related material on their mobile devices.&rdquo;&nbsp; Last month, an LSE study found that schools in four English cities which <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/may/16/schools-mobile-phones-academic-results">banned phones saw test scores increased</a> by more than 6%.</p>
<p>But research from Miami University suggests <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11660908/Tweeting-could-help-children-focus-in-class-study-says.html">using phones in class could actually be beneficial</a>, provided students stay on topic.&nbsp; Students used mobile devices to respond to messages that were relevant to classroom material, revealing a direct relationship between note taking and engaging in social media discussions: &ldquo;Even if students are responding to messages from others, if that activity is related to class content, those students will take better-quality notes than students responding to unrelated content.&rdquo;&nbsp; Researchers believe this is because, &ldquo;the related content allows students to engage in behaviours similar to note-taking: focusing on the material at hand, processing that material to determine key parts, and recording the important information.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Learning and Teaching in European Universities</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>The European University Association (EUA&rsquo;s) <a href="http://eua.be/Libraries/Publications_homepage_list/EUA_Trends_2015_web.sflb.ashx">Trends 2015: Learning and Teaching in European Universities</a> is a mid-2010s survey of trends in European HEIs, based on a questionnaire to which 451 HEIs from 46 countries responded.&nbsp; The result is a detailed (133pp) PDF which covers a number of elements including a section (4.3) devoted to e-learning and its impact.&nbsp; From this we learn that the most important objective is to &ldquo;provide a more flexible learning offer, leaving it to the student to decide whether they learn on or off campus&rdquo; (24%).&nbsp; Only 16% of respondents offered institution-wide online courses, while 38% offered them in some faculties; 20% did not offer online courses.&nbsp; MOOCs are currently only offered by 5% of respondents but this genre attracted the greatest &ldquo;Not yet, but we are planning to&rdquo; score of 24%.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware Update</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; TechCrunch; Matthew Moran; BBC]</em></p>
<p>Analysts IDC expect <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/06/01/report-cellular-connected-tablets-gaining-popularity-while-overall-tablet-market-declines.aspx">worldwide shipments of tablets</a>, e-readers and two-in-ones (laptops that can convert to tablets) to decline by 3.8% in 2015 although, within that declining market, the percentage of cellular-connected devices is expected to grow compared to WiFi only devices.&nbsp; Sales of small-screen tablets (currently 64% of the tablet market) are also expected to decline as a result of the growing popularity of phablets.</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/05/27/report-chromebook-shipments-to-grow-27-percent-in-2015.aspx">Chromebook sales</a> in 2015 will improve by 27% over 2014 shipments to hit 7.3 million, according to forecast from Gartner. &nbsp;Most sales of the devices tend to be in North America (84% in 2014) and about two thirds are destined for educational use.</p>
<p>Ofcom reports that <a href="http://media.ofcom.org.uk/news/2015/five-years-of-tablets/">54% of UK households now have a tablet</a>, up from just 2% in 2011. &nbsp;This proportion rises to 64% among people aged 35-54 and a further 21% of households currently without a tablet said they were likely to get one within the next 12 months.&nbsp; Many households own multiple tablets, with 34% of kids aged 5-15 having their own device and 11% of 3-4 year olds now have their own tablet to keep them entertained.</p>
<p>The UN&rsquo;s International Telecommunication Union (ITU) predicts that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32884867">3.2bn people will be online by the end of this year</a> &ndash; nearly half the world&rsquo;s population of 7.2bn &ndash; and about 2bn of those will be in the developing world.&nbsp; There will also be more than 7bn mobile device subscriptions, with 78% the US and Europe already using mobile broadband, although that falls to an average of just 17.4% in Africa.</p>

<p><strong>The Oligopoly of Academic Publishers in the Digital Era</strong></p>
<p><em>[PLOS]</em></p>
<p>An analysis of 45 million documents indexed in the Web of Science over the period 1973-2013 shows that in both natural/medical sciences and social sciences/humanities, Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor &amp; Francis increased their share of the published output, especially since the advent of the digital era (mid-90s). &nbsp;The <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502">top five most prolific scientific publishers</a> combined account for more than 50% of all papers published in 2013, with social sciences papers having the highest level of concentration (70% from the top five publishers) while the humanities have remained relatively independent (20% from top five publishers). &nbsp;The paper also examined turnover and profits, both of which continue to head northwards.</p>

<p><strong>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Developer Portal</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt has introduced the <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/05/21/houghton-mifflin-harcourt-adds-new-developer-portal.aspx">HMH Developer Portal</a>, a new online interface where developers, designers and educators can access the company's APIs to create new learning applications and integrate them with HMH applications. &nbsp;HMH's Identity, Assignment and Document resources are currently available through the API, and the company will expose additional resources throughout 2015, &ldquo;to provide greater opportunities for interoperability and ultimately an elegant, streamlined user experience for our customers&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/moky-invisible-touchpad-keyboard#/story">Moky</a> is a [prototype] Bluetooth pantograph keyboard with built in gesture-supporting touchpad functionality in the area above the keys.&nbsp; Embedded Infrared laser sensors create a field over the entire keyboard that responds to swipe, scroll, pinch, drag, click and tap.&nbsp; Shipping is expected around Oct and the device supports Windows, Mac and Android.&nbsp; It will work as a keyboard only with iOS because iOS doesn&rsquo;t currently include mouse input.</p>

<p><strong>Should Actors Replace Academics as &ldquo;On-Camera Talent&rdquo;? </strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, not all academics make natural film stars.&nbsp; But does the authenticity of having the module chair or main author in a video outweigh any thespian deficiencies they may have?&nbsp; <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/05/13/when-actors-replace-instructors-as-on-camera-talent.aspx">A recent trial by Purdue University</a> saw an end to 30-40 min filmed lectures, replaced by sub-7-minute clips using a pair of actors in a studio setting.&nbsp; Scripts were read from autocue and a subject expert was on hand to catch any errors or mispronunciations.&nbsp; Feedback from the Purdue trial supported the use of actors: &ldquo;We love our instructor, but we love what she does in the course content. &nbsp;Go with the actors because we love to watch them&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Windows 10 Coming Next Month </strong></p>

<li>
<p>Word, Excel and PowerPoint built in</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Copyright Changes Afoot?</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian]</em></p>
<p>Current <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jun/09/call-to-unlock-a-treasure-chest-of-hidden-research-data">copyright legislation limits the amount of data that researchers can &ldquo;mine&rdquo;</a> &ndash; using a computer to scan for facts and data within thousands of relevant articles to discover connections &shy;&shy;&ndash; because the process requires the mining program to download and copy content first before scanning it.&nbsp; Not surprisingly publishers are resisting any changes to laws in case content is used under the pretence of text mining but then re-published and charged for elsewhere.&nbsp; However, the EU is consulting this summer with a view to updating its 2001 copyright laws to better suit the digital age, thus giving researchers greater access to published work.</p>
<p>But every day, millions of Europeans may be unwittingly breaking copyright law. &nbsp;Due to an obscure rule known as <a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org.uk/2015/06/uk-at-risk-of-losing-freedom-of-panorama/">Freedom of Panorama</a>, those innocent snapshots of modern buildings you&rsquo;ve taken in countries such as France and Belgium are breaches of copyright. &nbsp;While the UK does have this freedom, we may be at risk of losing it in the ongoing copyright reform negotiations taking place in the European Parliament.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; BBC; EdSurge; Audrey Watters;</em> <em>Stephen Downes; The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>THE asked 27 FutureLearn universities about <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/moocs-fluctuating-rates-in-online-investment/2019816.article">the cost per course of their FL MOOCs</a>.&nbsp; Based on information on 20 courses from nine institutions the average cost, including staffing, was &pound;29,356 &ndash; broadly in keeping with the &ldquo;around &pound;30,000&rdquo; predicted by Martin Bean two years ago.&nbsp; However, while Loughborough says that it has produced two courses for about &pound;10,000 each, Dundee has allocated &pound;130,000 to a programme that has so far produced one course.&nbsp; Edinburgh said that its three FL MOOCs cost &pound;150,000 &ndash; similar to its costs for the Coursera platform.&nbsp; The OU was one of seven institutions that declined to provide details.</p>
<p>FutureLearn says it has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-32721056">370,000 students enrolled for a British Council MOOC</a> preparing for an English language test.&nbsp; The six-week course, Understanding IELTS: Techniques for English Language Tests, has students from 153 countries, with the biggest number from the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.&nbsp; It prepares students for the IELTS exam, taken 2.2 million times last year, which is used by employers and professional bodies to measure English language skills.&nbsp; The course is free, but students can pay &pound;29 for a &ldquo;statement of participation&rdquo;, showing that they have followed the course.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t beat thinking big.&nbsp; edX made its MOOC code open source in 2013 and so far over 70 organisations have taken up <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-04-16-how-open-edx-plans-to-reach-1-billion-learners">Open edX</a> across the K-12, HE, professional development and corporate training sectors.&nbsp; This EdSurge piece gives some brief examples, along with news that edX hopes the initiative will reach one billion learners within 10 years.&nbsp; The Open edX feature roadmap includes delivering content in smaller chunks, more effective use of mobile apps, and promoting greater student contribution and engagement.</p>
<p>edX has partnered with Arizona State University to offer the <a href="https://www.edx.org/gfa">Global Freshman Academy</a> which allows first year students to take a series of MOOCs, pay only when they pass each one, and earn credits equivalent to one year of general education.&nbsp; Sounds good?&nbsp; Not according to Stephen Downes (and many, many others): &ldquo;Remember, courses are typically 3- or 6-credits. So you could end up paying $600 or $1200 for a course. That's not 'open' the way I define 'open'.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard Patterson investigated <a href="http://www.human.cornell.edu/pam/academics/phd/upload/PattersonJMP11_18.pdf">the effects of study distractions on 657 Stanford MOOC students</a>.&nbsp; He tested three software tools including (1) a commitment device that allowed students to set time limits on distracting Internet activities, (2) a reminder tool triggered by time spent on distracting websites, and (3) a focusing tool that allowed students to block distracting sites when they go to the course website. &nbsp;Relative to a control group, he found students using the commitment device (1) spent 24% more time working on the course, receive course grades that were 0.29 SD higher, and were 40% more likely to complete the course. &nbsp;However, tools (2) and (3) yielded no significant difference to online student performance.</p>
<p>The University of Illinois has launched a low-cost online &ldquo;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/U-of-Illinois-to-Offer-a/229921">iMBA</a>&rdquo; in partnership with Coursera.&nbsp; Anyone would be able to view the course materials at no charge, but those who wanted the degree would have to go through the university&rsquo;s admissions process and pay about $1,000 per course.&nbsp; Enrolees would get greater support from faculty members, access to online discussions with other enrolled students, and could complete the entire degree for about $20,000 &ndash; far less than the $50k for the on-campus version or the $100k for the university&rsquo;s executive MBA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lecture videos are a central feature in the student learning experience in nearly all MOOCs,&rdquo; advises the MITx Office of Digital Learning, but Lorena Barba <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-05-11-why-my-mooc-is-not-built-on-video">included only one video in her Numerical Methods MOOC</a>.&nbsp; Admittedly this was partly due to financial constraints, but also because she is not convinced there is strong enough evidence to support its effectiveness as a teaching medium, despite its popularity (well, for at least <a href="https://www.edx.org/blog/optimal-video-length-student-engagement">the first 6 mins</a>) with students.&nbsp; She cites Derek Muller&rsquo;s investigation into the <a href="http://youtu.be/eVtCO84MDj8">effectiveness (or not) of physics videos</a>, which suggests many students do not pay full attention because they believe they already understand the topic, hence they don&rsquo;t absorb the very explanation that would have reversed any misconceptions that have.</p>
<p>And, in the finest spirit of openness, the University of Nottingham has trademarked &ldquo;<a href="http://uk.trademarkdirect.co.uk/nooc-nottingham-open-online-course-3020920">NOOC</a>&rdquo; (Nottingham Open Online Course).</p>

<p><strong>Media Usage by Traditional vs Non-Traditional Students</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/issue/view/68">latest issue of IRRODL (Vol 16, No 2)</a> contains a number of articles relevant to OU teaching and learning, but a paper comparing <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/download/1979/3316">media usage by traditional vs non-traditional students</a> was particularly apposite, given that the (German) authors define NTS as (i) enrolling into HE through unconventional means, (ii) not fulfilling typical HE entrance requirements, and (iii) studying part-time and distance learning.&nbsp; The authors found:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High penetration of digital/online devices, especially mobile for both student types</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much greater acceptance of a wider range of media, tools and services by NTS (Tables 2 &amp; 4)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NTS have a greater need for flexible study due to their work and family responsibilities and so have higher expectations of the range of digital/virtual teaching-learning methods used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The university&rsquo;s internal media offerings (e.g. VLE) are used more intensively than external media, tools, and services</p>

<p><strong>The Future (And Status) of Online Education</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; The Chronicle; EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>The University of California&rsquo;s all-digital &ldquo;campus&rdquo; was going to revolutionise HE by providing courses online for students shut out of the system&rsquo;s brick-and-mortar classrooms at a time of high demand but falling budgets.&nbsp; But three years later, the Online Instruction Pilot Project has become <a href="http://hechingerreport.org/californias-multi-million-dollar-online-education-flop-is-another-blow-for-moocs/">a $7 million example of the ineffectiveness of using MOOCs</a> and other forms of online learning to widen access to college degrees.&nbsp; Costs would be partially offset by allowing non-UC students to enrol (for $1k&ndash;$2k per course) but, in the two years from Spring 2012-14, only 250 non-UC students finished a class.&nbsp; &ldquo;We spent a lot of money and got extremely little in return,&rdquo; said Prof Jose Wudka, who previously chaired UC&rsquo;s Committee on Educational Policy of the Academic Senate.</p>
<p>But over at Stanford, everything&rsquo;s looking rosy.&nbsp; In a presentation entitled <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/05/04/stanford-prez-sees-distinct-role-for-online-ed-in-future.aspx">Technology in Teaching and Learning</a>, President John Hennessy said he expects technology to facilitate virtual team meetings to enable delivery of smaller group and project-based classes online; he foresees a day when online grading will be good enough to assess short-answer questions and, eventually, complex problems; and he predicts that online analytics will deliver real-time learning measurement with the reuse of materials leading to more engaging and compelling online learning.&nbsp; He believes MOOCs may be useful in certain circumstances but will not replace structured education: &ldquo;We've learned that MOOCs are not the answer, at least not the only answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arizona State University sees other benefits of <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/04/14/online-degrees-show-net-positive-campus-impact.aspx">high-quality online college degree programs</a>, particularly for older students who don&rsquo;t want the full on-campus experience (or costs).&nbsp; ASU&rsquo;s online program currently has more than 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled, according to a university spokeswoman, and the most recent retention rates are 87% for undergraduate students and 92% for graduate students &ndash; although the University believes that up to three-quarters of current undergraduate courses could be delivered online, saving costs and reducing their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>So if all this technology&rsquo;s so good, why do <a href="https://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2015/04/26/lessons-learned-from-a-chalkboard-slow-and-steady-technology-integration-bradley-emerling/">75% of Japanese classrooms still use chalkboards</a>?</p>
<p>Pearson&rsquo;s Bradley Emerling, visited seventeen K-12 classrooms, all of which were equipped with a large chalkboard, with few computers, projectors, smartboards or tablets in evidence.&nbsp; He writes, &ldquo;It turns out Japanese educators possess a unique technical vocabulary for describing chalkboard teaching practices, called <em>bansho</em> (board-writing) and <em>bansho-keikaku</em> (board-writing planning). &nbsp;Like many instructional practices in Japan, bansho has been studied and refined over a period of years through use of Japanese lesson study (<em>jugyō kenkyū</em>).&rdquo;&nbsp; He wonders, given the plethora of expensive devices and applications we use in the west, why educators don&rsquo;t treat these, &ldquo;as critical topics for collaborative inquiry, develop plans for using them in the classroom, articulate hypotheses for how they will create specific learning opportunities, implement, observe and collect data on the results&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Making more Effective Lecture Notes</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS]</em></p>
<p>It is widely acknowledged that <a href="http://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/05/most-students-struggle-to-take.html">taking notes can help understanding and recall</a>, but can we make that process even more efficient?&nbsp; Bui and McDaniel (2015) asked 144 undergrads to take notes while they listened to a 12-minute technical lecture.&nbsp; One group used note paper containing a lecture outline, with headings and subheadings of the material. The second group were provided with illustrative diagrams showing the key components of a system, with labels explaining how the different parts interact.&nbsp; A control group were simply given a blank piece of note paper.&nbsp; Students who received a lecture outline performed better at free recall than the control participants and took more comprehensive notes but, when asked specific questions, the lecture outlines only appeared to help high-ability students.&nbsp; In contrast, both high and low-ability students who received annotated diagrams performed better at free recall and at answering specific questions than the controls.&nbsp; Further analysis showed that the students given an annotated diagram not only took fewer notes than the others, but those notes contained a higher proportion of references to cause-and-effect dynamics, suggesting the diagram helped students to focus on extracting the most important information for understanding the lecture topic.</p>

<p>US company FreedomPop is to extend its <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32704051">free mobile data, voice and text</a> offering to the UK from July, after its equivalent US service attracted more than half a million users.&nbsp; FreedomPop will offer Sim cards that offer 200MB of data, 200 texts and 200 minutes of voice calls per month using the cellular network at no cost.&nbsp; The firm, which is backed by Skype founder Niklas Zennstom, says it will make money by selling extra services.&nbsp; These include the ability to roll over unused data to the next month, anonymous browsing to protect online privacy, and the ability to add a second phone number from more than 60 countries so that friends and family outside the UK can call at local rates.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Gill Smith; Grainne Conole; Campus Technology; edX; Stephen Downes; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>The US Dept of Justice has announced a <a href="http://www.educationdive.com/news/edx-reaches-deal-with-justice-dept/383257/">settlement with edX over the accessibility of its services</a>.&nbsp; The MOOC provider will modify its website, platform, and mobile applications to allow students who are blind, deaf, or otherwise disabled to participate, bringing it in line with the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>Research by Toven-Lindsey et al explores <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz8cVS8LoO7ON3dBOEM5bzM0eEU/view">the range of pedagogical tools used in 24 MOOCs</a>, finding that the range of pedagogical practices currently used tends toward an objectivist-individual approach, with some efforts to incorporate more constructivist and group-oriented approaches. &nbsp;The paper challenges educators to strive for more creative and empowering forms of open online learning.</p>
<p>MIT and Harvard University have just published a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2587984_code2293023.pdf?abstractid=2586847&mirid=1">37-page draft report</a> that summarises findings from two years of hosting 68 MOOCs for 1.7 million participants who logged 10 million "participant hours" of activity.&nbsp; Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Participation in a second presentation was around 43% lower than the first but there was no significant decrease in a third presentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>57% of registrants intended to earn a certificate (and a further 8% of the remainder ultimately did)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computer Science courses had average participation numbers almost four times higher than other subjects (68,000 vs 19,000) but lower certification rates</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A recent <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/enrollment-mitx-moocs-are-we-educating-educators">Educase paper</a> identified that a large proportion of edX learners were themselves teachers.&nbsp; Now a blog post by the same authors discusses whether <a href="https://www.edx.org/blog/are-we-missing-opportunities-engage#.VSPpe9J0xEY">opportunities are being missed to engage teachers with MOOCs</a>.&nbsp; Some 28% of edX survey respondents identified themselves as past or present teachers, 54% were interested in accreditation opportunities and more than 70% desired greater access to MITx materials for use in their own courses.&nbsp; Now the authors suggest this presents some opportunities for MOOC providers, such as offering professional development for teachers, providing tools that allow teachers to tailor MOOC content into &ldquo;personal online courses&rdquo;, and providing profiling facilities so experienced teachers could identify themselves and be paired with novices to promote greater dialogue and learning.</p>
<p>A recent paper by Joksimovic et al, <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/273755322_What_do_cMOOC_participants_talk_about_in_Social_Media_A_Topic_Analysis_of_Discourse_in_a_cMOOC">What do cMOOC participants talk about in Social Media? A Topic Analysis of Discourse in a cMOOC</a>, examines how social media platforms (blogs, Twitter, and Facebook) affect the learning processes shape learners' interests and the topics to which they devote a significant attention. &nbsp;The findings indicate that learners tend to focus on several prominent topics that emerge very quickly in the course and they tend to maintain that focus, regardless of readings suggested by the instructor, and the affordances of different social media mean that different tools are used to discuss different topics.</p>
<p>And a paper in this month&rsquo;s BJET, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjet.12277/abstract">What public media reveals about MOOCs: A systematic analysis of news reports</a>, finds that coverage of MOOCs in public media is rapidly decreasing.&nbsp; By mid- 2014, it had decreased by almost 50% from the highest activity during 2013 and, while the majority of discussions during 2012-13 were focused on MOOC providers, partnerships and investments, the more recent focus has shifted towards the position of MOOCs in the global educational landscape and the use of data and analytics.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; Gill Marshall; BBC; University World News]</em></p>
<p>A new HEFCE report, <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/HEFCE,2014/Content/Pubs/2015/201507/HEFCE2015_07.pdf">Financial health of the higher education sector</a>, shows there to be &ldquo;significant variations in the financial performance of individual institutions across the sector&rdquo;, with two institutions seeing their income fall by more than 10% in in 2013-14, while four saw growth of more than 15% (Fig 1).&nbsp; Staff costs rose by an average of 3.4%, but with variations from -11% to +14% (Fig 4).&nbsp; In a bid to attract students, institutions are borrowing to invest, with a sector total of &pound;6.7bn (26% of total income), but with one institution peaking at 93% (Fig 11).&nbsp; The report warns that, &ldquo;Without increased surpluses and continued government support, there is a risk that the sector will be unable to deliver the scale of investment required to meet student demands, build capacity and &hellip; remain internationally competitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Jeremy Clayton, director of knowledge and innovation strategy at the Dept for Business, Innovation and Skills, warns that universities are viewed by &ldquo;politicians from across the political spectrum&rdquo; as <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/universities-worse-than-bankers/2019426.article">overstaffed and largely untouched by public spending reductions</a>, despite having achieved efficiency savings worth &pound;1 billion over the past three years.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/uclan-sets-aside-28m-to-cover-losses-at-overseas-campuses/2019181.article">University of Central Lancashire</a> has put aside &pound;2.8 million to guard against further losses on its overseas campuses as its Cyprus branch lost more money and drew criticism from the UN Secretary-General.&nbsp; The campus recorded a loss of &pound;1.4 million in 2013-14, blamed on &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; recruitment which UCLan says has now improved.&nbsp; Plans for a Sri Lanka campus have been shelved and a deal for another planned campus in Thailand had previously collapsed before building started.</p>
<p>The Association of Colleges says that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-32017137">190,000 adult education places will go next year</a> and adult education in England &ldquo;will not exist by 2020&rdquo; if government cuts continue.&nbsp; Funding is being cut by 24% and courses for health, public services and care, and ICT could be hardest hit as the government prioritises apprenticeships and subjects such as English and maths.</p>
<p>Concerns about plagiarism in a 2013 <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-32034849">University of Buckingham law module</a> should have triggered a formal process says the QAA.&nbsp; Instead, academics reduced students' marks for &ldquo;poor academic performance&rdquo; because they interpreted the problem as poor referencing rather than plagiarism.&nbsp; The university subsequently referred to some sections in essays as having been &ldquo;lifted&rdquo; but decided the first year students had not yet been subject to rigorous training on avoiding plagiarism and so had not committed any deliberate action to deceive.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s first <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=201503271940068">Research Centre for Global Higher Education</a> is being established by the UCL Institute of Education in partnership with Lancaster University and the University of Sheffield. Co-funded by HEFCE, the centre will open in October 2015.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2015/04/02/jones-international-university-to-close.html">Jones International University</a>, an online, for-profit institution based in Colorado, has announced plans to shut down following a 55% drop in enrolment between 2011 and the end of 2014, leaving JIU with about 2,000 students.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Technology For Employability</strong></p>
<p><em>[Rebecca Galley]</em></p>
<p>The Jisc cross-sector <a href="http://employabilityproject.jiscinvolve.org/wp/">Technology for employability</a> study is currently about half-way to completion and three key themes are emerging:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Institutions are on various points of the continuum towards student employability &ldquo;maturity&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology is under exploited</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is insufficient engagement and partnership working with employers</p>

<p>Tony Bates seems to have done more work and made more online postings since he retired than ever before.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been releasing chunks of his new online book,<a href="http://opentextbc.ca/teachinginadigitalage/">Teaching in a Digital Age</a>, for comment as they&rsquo;ve been drafted over the past year or so.&nbsp; Now the whole thing (502pp) is complete and available for free.&nbsp; Tony&rsquo;s foreword says that &ldquo;The book examines the underlying principles that guide effective teaching in an age when everyone, and in particular the students we are teaching, are using technology.&rdquo; &nbsp;The twelve chapters cover issues such as the nature of knowledge, F2F and online methods of teaching, technology and different media, and quality.&nbsp; Stephen Downes&rsquo; assessment: &ldquo;This is a monumental accomplishment and I have no doubt that Bates will receive wide praise for his efforts over the last year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But according to <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/free-not-future-digital-content-education/">Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</a>&rsquo;s Chief Content Officer, writing in Wired, &ldquo;If we do not get educational content right, students are less likely to gain the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in college and careers.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, a clear message &ndash; it&rsquo;s very important that we pay money to educational publishers in order to learn well from &lsquo;quality&rsquo; content.&nbsp; But, as Stephen Downes observes, &ldquo;&hellip;in fact, almost any content will do if learners are motivated, and no content will do if learners are not motivated.&nbsp; And the reason why free can work and is working is that it's created by and for people who are motivated.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Learning for Life</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>According to a new report, <a href="http://tytonpartners.com/tyton-wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Learning-for-Life_The-Oppty-for-Tech-to-Transform-Adult-Education_March-20151.pdf">Learning for Life: The Opportunity for Technology to Transform Adult Education</a>, there are 36 million US adults who lack basic skills (1 in 6 maintains low literacy skills and nearly 1 in 3 has low numeracy skills) and yet the adult education system serves only about 11% of them. &nbsp;There is enthusiasm for using technology and participants have good access to modern devices and the internet, so the report (Part 1 of 2) calls for greater exploitation of ICT.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After making a b**** outta their enemies, the king&rsquo;s fresh generals Macbeth and Banquo hit up three witches who start laying down some cold prophecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, it&rsquo;s a hit with many students and also some teachers, and the YouTube channel currently has over 400,000 subscribers.&nbsp; According to the site&rsquo;s cofounder, Jacob Salamon, &ldquo;Thug Notes originally started off as an idea and a joke&hellip; &nbsp;We never really expected to enter this whole world of education; that wasn&rsquo;t the initial intention. &nbsp;But we began to see that this is working in classrooms. &nbsp;Teachers are using it; students are using it. &nbsp;Millennials are falling in love with reading again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if you tend towards the more academic end of the literary spectrum, a feature on The Week site provides descriptions and video exemplars of what <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/545166/what-english-shakespeare-beowulf-king-arthur-actually-sounded-like">the English of Shakespeare, Beowulf, and King Arthur</a> actually sounded like.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; OERU; ClassCentral; EdSurge; Gill Smith&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]</em></p>
<p>Coursera announced last month that it had teamed up with more than half a dozen companies (including Google, Instagram and Shazam) that will help create capstone projects for its course series.&nbsp; Nineteen colleges now work with <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/meet-the-new-self-appointed-mooc-accreditors-google-and-instagram/55807">Coursera to offer what amount to microdegrees</a> (&lsquo;Specialisations&rsquo;) that require students to take a series of MOOCs and then finish a hands-on capstone project.&nbsp; This approach has proved an effective way to bring in revenue, as students end up paying around $500 in fees to get a certificate proving they passed the &lsquo;free&rsquo; courses.&nbsp; This strategy has already worked well for Udacity, which has bypassed universities and works only with industry to develop its courses and nanodegrees.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re discovering that there are a huge number of willing and eager lifelong learners that are underserved by higher education,&rdquo; says founder, Sebastian Thrun. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting to the point where we&rsquo;ll be profitable as a company.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/03/10/edx-and-microsoft-launch-it-development-moocs.aspx">Microsoft and edX</a> have partnered to launch IT development courses that will be taught by Microsoft experts.&nbsp; The courses focus on core development skills for cloud and mobile technologies, and feature interactive coding, assessments and exercises. &nbsp;Courses start at the end of March and students can enrol for free or obtain a verified certificate for a fee.</p>
<p>The OU has launched a range of free <a href="http://oeru.org/news/the-open-university-launches-badged-open-courses/">Badged Open Courses</a> (BOCs) which will differ from MOOCs because they are perpetual, enabling students to return to them at any time to refresh their knowledge, unlike MOOCs which tend to have set start and finish dates.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/futurelearn-breaks-1-million-learner-milestone/">FutureLearn</a> announced last month that it has reached 1 million learners from over 190 countries, becoming a top-five MOOC provider in a little over a year.&nbsp; FL now offers 220+ courses from 44 partner universities and institutions, mostly in the UK but also including Scandinavia, Australia, New Zealand, China, and Korea.&nbsp; Last week, FL announced nine new university partners including their first in Colombia, France, Spain and Switzerland.&nbsp; Other interesting snippets: the most popular course is &lsquo;Exploring English language and culture&rsquo; (120k learners); one video in that course has over 17,000 comments on its page; and around 25% of FL access is now from tablets and smartphones.</p>
<p>It remains the case that a great many MOOC students are educationally advantaged.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/11/8014563/bill-gates-education-future-of-online-courses-third-world">Bill Gates</a>, in his capacity as guest editor at The Verge, explores why MOOCs need to change to help students who don't have developed literacy skills, easy access to internet, or face gender prejudice.&nbsp; To be honest, the video is slick but relatively lightweight, whereas the accompanying article from Adi Robertson is much more comprehensive and wide ranging.</p>
<p>In a brief but interesting post, Austin Tate provides demographic and activity data for participants in the <a href="http://blog.inf.ed.ac.uk/atate/2015/03/03/coursera-ai-planning-mooc-statistics-2015/">2015 Edinburgh/Coursera AI Planning MOOC</a> that completed this month.</p>

<p><em>[The Guardian; University World News; The Independent]</em></p>
<p>British sixth-formers leaving school this summer will be able to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/feb/17/european-universities-to-be-part-of-ucas-admissions">apply to some continental European universities through the UK admissions system</a> for the first time, after UCAS reversed its opposition to the scheme, providing those universities meet equivalent quality standards to the UK.&nbsp; High standards of teaching (often in English) and lower fees make studying for a degree in Europe an attractive option for many UK students, although only about 30,000 left Britain this year to study.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20150219113033746">UCL is closing its School of Energy and Resources in Adelaide</a>, opened five years ago with funding of A$4.5m from the South Australian government and A$10m from oil and gas producer, Santos.&nbsp; The School has around 20 staff and 100 local and foreign MSc students. &nbsp;UCL says it will honour its commitment to those students.</p>
<p>Plans for the UK&rsquo;s first newly built university for three decades have been unveiled. &nbsp;The private but not-for-profit <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/new-university-aims-to-attract-women-into-engineering-10086189.html">New Model in Technology and Engineering</a> (NMITE) aims to attract 5,000 students when it is fully operational, and to be the first UK HEI to achieve equal numbers of men and women among both lecturers and students.&nbsp; Based in Hereford, NMITE is backed by the universities of Bristol and Warwick and aims to recruit an initial 300 students to start their courses in Sep 17.</p>

<p>Fresh questions have been raised about the government&rsquo;s drive to boost private providers after it emerged that the biggest, <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/private-colleges-visa-licence-suspended-as-bis-and-qaa-launch-inquiries/2018746.article">St Patrick&rsquo;s College</a>, is under investigation by DBIS, the QAA and the Home Office.&nbsp; St Patrick&rsquo;s students received &pound;95.7m of funding in 2013-14, but the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge, said the report showed that the government proceeded &ldquo;without sufficient regulation in place to protect public money&rdquo; and ignored &ldquo;repeated warnings&rdquo; on the risks.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/12/elsevier-acquires-newsflo/">Elsevier</a> has bought London startup Newsflo, a bespoke media monitoring service that tracks over 55,000 English-speaking media sources from around 20 countries, enabling academics to get &lsquo;impact&rsquo; analytics for their published research.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-02-12-blackboard-flirts-with-buying-pearson-s-powerschool">Blackboard</a> is reported to be in final talks to purchase PowerSchool &ndash; a popular student information system that serves more than 13 million learners in the US and 65 other countries &ndash; from Pearson.&nbsp; When Jay Bhatt took over as Blackboard CEO in 2012, he signalled an intention to overhaul its product, brand and strategy, particularly in the K-12 market.&nbsp; Blackboard has snapped up eight companies since Jan 2014.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2015-02-24-chegg-chucks-textbooks-business-goes-all-in-on-digital">Chegg</a> has reached a multi-year agreement to allow Ingram to take over its textbook rental operations starting on 1 May. Students will still be able to rent textbooks from Chegg, which will take a 20% commission from each rental.&nbsp; Print textbooks raked in $213 million for Chegg last year, but maintaining these operations has been costly and the company's net loss increased from $55.8m in 2013 to $64.7m last year.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.2elearning.com/latest-news/item/55890-new-corporate-training-partnership-is-formed">Financial Times and Madrid's IE Business School</a> have entered into a joint venture aimed at corporate executives looking to expand their education.&nbsp; The program includes offline and online learning classes and courses that draw upon FT news and analysis. &nbsp;According to Reuters, &ldquo;several business schools across the world, including the Yale School of Management and Antai Business School in China, are taking part in the corporate learning program.&rdquo;</p>

<p>German media group <a href="http://www.euronews.com/business-newswires/2949868-bertelsmann-makes-move-to-build-global-university-data-network/">Bertelsmann</a> is taking a controlling stake in US-based Alliant International University as the first step in a plan to build a global network of universities to share research and data.&nbsp; The company has made education its top investment priority and has vowed to achieve &euro;1bn in worldwide revenue this year.</p>

<p><strong>&lsquo;World's Largest University&rsquo; is Scamming Students</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>A <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Worlds-Largest-University/190337">global network of fraudulent online universities</a>, leading back to a &ldquo;Middle East Office of Academic Regulation &amp; Examination&rdquo;, has been uncovered by journalists.&nbsp; The universities in the network, which typically say they are based in the United States, actively encourage students from the Arab world to enrol by offering what appear to be generous scholarships after just a few minutes of exchanging instant messages online. &nbsp;But that financial aid is conditional on students paying the rest of their fees immediately.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>The End of College</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Washington Post]</em></p>
<p>Kevin Carey, director of the Education Policy Programme at the New America Foundation, suggests that HE is becoming increasingly unaffordable and unattainable and so is on the verge of a transformation that could change the role universities play in our society.&nbsp; In his new book, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/one-vision-of-tomorrows-college-cheap-and-you-get-an-education-not-a-degree/2015/02/11/7b2ed78c-8617-11e4-9534-f79a23c40e6c_story.html">The End of College: Creating the Future of Learning and the University of Everywhere</a>, he sets out his vision for a digital, online future, with little bricks-and-mortar overhead, where students are taught in ways tailored to their individual needs, resulting in &ldquo;an education, not a degree&rdquo;.&nbsp; Nice idea but I remain sceptical.&nbsp; Carey states that &ldquo;MIT is already moving in this direction&rdquo;, but there is no sign that MIT has any plans to close its campus.&nbsp; It is true that MOOCs (etc) have been a great success, but mainly as supplements to HE or to provide short bursts of education for specific groups.&nbsp; Employers are not educators, most want a credential they understand &ndash; and that credential is the degree.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Crowdsourced Outlines Improve Learning from Videos</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Even though video is generally accepted to be one of the more engaging forms of learning content, we cannot assume that time-poor students will devour every clip from beginning to end.&nbsp; Researchers from MIT and Harvard are using <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/02/12/research-outlines-improve-learning-from-videos.aspx">crowd-sourced conceptual outlines</a> that work as navigation tools, so that those who are already familiar with some of a video's content can skip ahead, while others can backtrack to revisit content as required.&nbsp; According to co-author Juho Kim, &ldquo;It's really hard to find the exact spots that you want to watch.&nbsp; You end up scrubbing on the timeline carefully and looking at thumbnails.&nbsp; And with educational videos, especially, it's really hard, because it's not that visually dynamic.&nbsp; So we thought that having this semantic information about the video really helps.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>[Stephen Downes; The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>Sadler (1998) defined formative assessment as that which is intended to accelerate learning and improve performance through the providing of feedback.&nbsp; But how important is the medium by which feedback is provided?&nbsp; Researchers at the University of Louisiana compared the effects of <a href="http://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/ij-sotl/vol9/iss1/7/">handwritten versus electronic textual feedback</a> and found that, whereas students who preferred or received handwritten feedback recall more of that feedback (quantity), those who actually received electronic feedback recall the comments more accurately (quality).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Australia&rsquo;s Monash University, education lecturers Michael Henderson and Michael Phillips have been providing <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/could-video-feedback-replace-the-red-pen">video feedback</a> &ndash; typically 5 mins, unscripted, unedited &ndash; for about five years.&nbsp; Not only does this take them less time to create than handwritten notes but 126 of their students reported that, &ldquo;&hellip;they felt the feedback to be &lsquo;real,&rsquo; &lsquo;honest,&rsquo; and &lsquo;authentic&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; They also found it to be clearer than written notes, notwithstanding the lack of editorial polish.</p>

<p><strong>Targeting Deeper Learning with Micro-Credentials</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>I used to think that <a href="http://exchange.ac.uk/learning-and-teaching-theory-guide/deep-and-surface-approaches-learning.html">deep learning</a> was at the opposite(and preferable) end of the spectrum to surface learning (Biggs, 1999; Marton &amp; S&auml;lj&ouml;, 1996) but I blinked and now it&rsquo;s been redefined.&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.digitalpromise.org/page/-/dpdocuments/microcredentials/mc_deeperlearning.pdf">Developing a System of Micro-credentials: Supporting Deeper Learning in the Classroom</a>, &ldquo;Deeper Learning is an umbrella term for the skills, understandings, and mind sets students must possess to succeed in today&rsquo;s jobs and civic life.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s organised into 6 categories of activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Master core academic content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think critically and solve complex problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work collaboratively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicate effectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn how to learn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop academic mindsets</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;and these are then divided into 40 micro-credentials (e.g. Resolving conflicts).&nbsp; Looks useful, and quite an overlap with the <a href="https://usergeneratededucation.wordpress.com/2013/05/22/the-other-21st-century-skills/">21st Century Skills</a> retweeted a couple of weeks ago by Belinda.</p>
<p>So how can education systems help teachers engage in practices and behaviours that promote deeper learning? &nbsp;The <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/learning_deeply/2015/02/how_to_teach_for_deeper_learning_an_international_survey_provides_insights.html">Teaching and Learning International Survey</a> (TALIS) from OECD surveyed over 100,000 teachers and principals from 34 countries regarding their teaching and the conditions in which they work. &nbsp;The site contains a nice (but unattributed) graph showing how worker tasks are now much more non-routine, analytical and interpersonal than was the case 50 years ago.&nbsp; Findings from the survey showed that opportunities to share and learn from colleagues can help create the conditions for the innovative and effective teaching that provides the deeper learning today's students need. &nbsp;Among the key findings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More than 94% of teachers agreed that their role was to facilitate students' own inquiry and yet teaching practices that foster deeper learning are relatively rare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborative teacher professional learning supports instructional practices that promote&nbsp; deeper learning for students and fosters a positive climate and ongoing teacher learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time, resources and funding all matter &ndash; and OECD data show that the high-performing education systems have invested carefully in teaching quality</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>US Universities Should Follow the UK in Promoting Soft Skills</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>Kevin Kruger reports widespread concerns in the US that <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/comment/opinion/blog-why-us-universities-should-follow-uk-in-promoting-students-soft-skills/2019081.article">graduates are not well enough prepared for the world of work</a>: &ldquo;Only about a quarter of employers surveyed believe recent graduates are well prepared in critical thinking and analytic reasoning, written and oral communication, complex problem solving, innovation and creativity, and applying knowledge and skills to real-world settings.&rdquo;&nbsp; He cites comparative success in the UK, &ldquo;&hellip;where the <a href="http://www.hear.ac.uk/home">Higher Education Achievement Report</a> has been adopted by 27 institutions.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Story of Now</strong></p>
<p><em>[Jacob Niedzwiecki; Catherine Chambers]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/taster/projects/story-of-now/try">The Story of Now</a> is a BBC beta service that offers (according to the Idris Elba intro) &ldquo;a voyage of wonder and discovery&rdquo;.&nbsp; What that means in plain English is video-rich coverage of a number of philosophical and scientific topics led by engaging, expert presenters, with plentiful links to related stories on the site and external resources from TED, the British Museum, YouTube and elsewhere.&nbsp; Well worth a wander.</p>

<p><strong>Designing for Accessibility </strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; UserFocus]</em></p>
<p>The UK-based <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/color-blind-accessible-figures/59189">Colour Blind Awareness</a> organisation launched a campaign last month to raise awareness amongst educators of colour blindness. &nbsp;The most common congenital forms of colour blindness are deuteranopia and protanopia, both of which affect our ability to distinguish between red and green, whereas tritanopia causes difficulty in distinguishing between blue and yellow. Natalie Houston gives some examples and offers advice and some useful links to help designers.</p>
<p>A case study from the BBC&rsquo;s Henny Swan looks at the problems one screen reader user had with the iPlayer, and how this led the Beeb to reconsider the particular needs of different user types when <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/02/23/bbc-iplayer-accessibility-case-study/">designing the new iPlayer</a>.&nbsp; She suggests ten UX design guidelines based on four key design principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Give users choice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put users in control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design with familiarity in mind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritise features that add value</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hardware Roundup</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; Campus Technology; BBC]</em></p>
<p>Data from Strategy Analytics shows Android now accounting for over 80% of all smartphones shipped globally.&nbsp; However, when it comes to actually making money the position is almost reversed &ndash; with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/26/apple-eating-all-the-profits">Apple taking 89% of all smartphone profits</a> ($18.8bn) in Q4 last year.&nbsp; This left Android suppliers sharing the remaining 11% ($2.4bn), although it is estimated that Samsung took around half of this.</p>
<p>Figures from Gartner confirm that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/03/led-by-iphone-6-apple-passed-samsung-in-q4-smartphone-sales-1-9b-mobiles-sold-overall-in-2014/#1KgXag:e9vn">global smartphone sales broke the 1bn barrier</a> last year (1.2bn from a total of 1.9bn mobile phones), but Samsung&rsquo;s previous dominance slipped in Q4 with iPhone 6 sales pushing Apple into first place with a 20.4% market share (74.8m iPhones).</p>
<p>In case you blinked, Tim Cook formally launched the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-31794823">Apple Watch</a> last week.&nbsp; Yours from 24 Apr, with UK prices starting at &pound;299 for a 38mm (1.5&rdquo;) screen, aluminium case, plastic strap model.&nbsp; Battery life is around 18 hours, but it will continue to display the time for around 72 hours if all other functions are switched off.&nbsp; TechCrunch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/09/the-apple-watch-compared-to-the-competition/">compares it to the competition</a>.</p>
<p>&hellip;or for less than &pound;30 some nice people in China will sell you an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-31832108">Android-based iWatch</a> that looks remarkably like the real thing.</p>
<p>Gartner predicts <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/02/26/wearable-market-outlook.aspx">&ldquo;strong growth&rdquo; in wearables</a> this year, with smartwatches, fitness bands and other trackers selling nearly 70 million units, or 38% more than in 2013. &nbsp;Other analysts are predicting smartwatch sales alone rising from 3.3m (2014) to anything between 8m and 60m this year, led of course by the Apple Watch effect.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s not forget that 14.8m iPads were sold in the first nine months after its launch &ndash; more than double Wall Street's most optimistic estimate.</p>
<p>Phorm will provide a <a href="https://www.getphorm.com/">tactile keyboard for iPads</a> to make typing more accurate.&nbsp; But this is not some cheapo sticky overlay &ndash; their $99 microfluidic panel generates physical keys from a flat surface on demand (and without batteries), giving a smooth, unbroken surface for general touch-based interaction and a physical keyboard when needed.</p>

<p><strong>HTTP/2 Comes a Step Closer</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>HTTP/2 will be with us very soon according to the chair of the HTTP working group.&nbsp; HTTP powers the Web by defining how hypertext is to be formatted and transmitted and how web servers and browsers should respond to those commands.&nbsp; Currently, HTTP/1.1 is most commonly used, but <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-webs-about-to-get-faster.aspx?m=2">HTTP/2</a> will speed up loading of web pages by transporting data between browser and server.&nbsp; The new protocol is backward-compatible with older versions and, importantly, it will speed up activities by carrying more data in a single pass with each request to load the requested Web site. &nbsp;This is especially important for smart phone access, which now accounts for about a third of all Web access.</p>

<p><strong>Educational Technology Usage</strong></p>
<p><em>[McGraw-Hill; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>McGraw-Hill&rsquo;s second annual survey of 1,700 US students, <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/report-new-mcgraw-hill-education-research-finds-more-than-80-percent-of-students-use-mobile-technology-to-study-300047130.html">The Impact of Technology on College Student Study Habits</a>, found that 81% now use mobile devices to study (up 40% over last year).&nbsp; Some 77% said study technology has positively impacted on their grades, 62% feel better prepared for classes and 48% said technology saves them study time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/03/10/survey-half-of-faculty-have-used-digital-coursware-but-cost-time-remain-obstacles.aspx">Faculty Perspectives on Courseware</a> from Tyton Partners, 60% of (2,700) faculty members say they are being encouraged to use digital courseware and 54% did so in the 2013-2014 academic year. &nbsp;However, only 30% had been trained and only 15% were incentivized to use digital courseware, with greater institutional prioritisation being given to research in their field over spending time on using new tools.&nbsp; Respondents liked functionality relating to assessment and grading but were dissatisfied with difficulties in customisation and lack of interoperability with existing systems.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Badges Survey</strong></p>
<p><em>[Totara]</em></p>
<p>Extreme Networks has conducted a worldwide survey into <a href="http://www.totaralms.com/blog/survey-shows-growth-open-badges">adoption of digital badges</a> in education and industry.&nbsp; Based on over 1900 responses, they found that 38% of those surveyed currently use or plan to use badges, 81% of those who are using badges plan to maintain or increase usage and 61% believe badges will someday replace, or be combined with, formal qualifications.&nbsp; The top three reasons for adopting badges were motivation (45%), display achievement (44%) and recognition of specific knowledge/skills.</p>

<p><strong>It Took the Telephone 75 Years to do What Angry Birds Did in 35 Days</strong></p>
<p><em>[WSJ]</em></p>
<p>Predicting the future of technology and innovation has become a minefield.&nbsp; Just think of all those things that have come out of the blue in the past few years, some of which are still around and some of which disappeared just as quickly without trace.&nbsp; The Oxford Martin School and Citi have just released <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/03/13/it-took-the-telephone-75-years-to-do-what-angry-birds-did-in-35-days-but-what-does-that-mean/">Technology at Work: The Future of Innovation and Employment</a> which includes an examination of how quickly emerging technologies have spread.&nbsp; The authors note that it took the telephone around 75 years to reach 50 million users, TV 13 years, the internet 4 years and Angry Birds just 35 days.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on&hellip;&nbsp; The Psychology of Social Networkers </strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS; Science Direct; APA; The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to make presumptions about social media users, but to what extend are these borne out by evidence?&nbsp; Research suggests that Facebook users tend to be &ldquo;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211000379">more extraverted and narcissistic, but less conscientious and socially lonely, than nonusers</a>&rdquo;, but there is also evidence that <a href="http://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/02/student-narcissists-prefer-twitter-more.html">narcissism is age-related</a>, with student narcissists preferring Twitter, while more mature narcissists prefer FB.&nbsp; Separate research reported that &ldquo;higher degrees of narcissism led to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214000600">deeper self-disclosures and more self-promotional content</a> within these messages. [And] users with higher need to belong disclosed more intimate information&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Further research suggests that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211002020">personality was a more important factor than gender and FB experience</a>, with high scorers in neuroticism spending more time on FB, although extraverts were found to have more friends on the network than introverts.&nbsp; However, people who said they used FB as an informational tool (rather than socialising) tended to score higher on neuroticism, sociability, extraversion and openness, but lower on conscientiousness and &ldquo;need for cognition&rdquo;.&nbsp; The same study also found that higher scorers in sociability, neuroticism and extraversion preferred FB, while people who scored higher in "need for cognition" preferred Twitter.&nbsp; There is also evidence that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563212003317">anxiousness</a> (as well as alcohol and drug use) predicts more emotional attachment to Facebook.</p>
<p>And what of academic performance?&nbsp; An analysis of nearly 4,000 US students found that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211001932">the more they used Facebook to socialise, the poorer their grades tended to be</a>, although using the site to collect and share information was actually associated with <em>better</em> grades.&nbsp; However, an earlier longitudinal study found <a href="http://www.firstmonday.dk/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2498">no evidence for a link between FB use and poorer grades</a>; if anything there were signs of the opposite pattern.</p>
<p>Research published last month suggests that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0193397314001257">students may learn to regulate their use of Facebook</a>, both as a distraction from coursework and in their free time, as they progress through university.&nbsp; The study of 1,649 US students showed that seniors spent significantly less time on Facebook and spent significantly less time multitasking with Facebook than newer students.&nbsp; Time spent on Facebook was significantly negatively predictive of grades for freshmen but not for other students.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seniors were less likely to post status updates than freshmen and sophomores, comment on content less than the other class ranks, use Facebook chat less than freshmen and sophomores, post photos less than juniors, tag photos less than freshmen and juniors, and view videos less than all the other class ranks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a 2011 study of about 300 college students, researchers from Cornell found that students who were asked to look at their own Facebook page for just three minutes showed <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~telecom/people/faculty/gonzaamy/Gonzales-11-Mirror-FB- wall.pdf">a boost in self-esteem</a> compared with control groups who either looked in a mirror or simply sat in a room for three minutes.&nbsp; They speculate that we might get that ego lift because we self-select the information we include in our Facebook profiles and posts &ndash; and so looking at our favourite flattering photos and witty or erudite comments reinforces the version of ourselves we want to be.</p>
<p>Building on the ubiquity of Twitter, The Chronicle&rsquo;s Adeline Koh posts on her experiences of getting students to <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/live-tweeting-assignments-to-use-or-not-to-use/58949?cid=gn&utm_source=gn&utm_medium=en">live tweet whilst watching films</a> (feature films, documentaries or recorded lectures).&nbsp; The assignment does not require that students follow one another to read their tweets, they simply need to use public accounts and make sure each tweet contains the event hashtag.&nbsp; She has tried this both in a classroom and remotely, and she reports that, &ldquo;Every single time this activity has massively increased student engagement and learning&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>[The Guardian; THE, The Independent; University World News]</em></p>
<p>Latest figures from HESA show the number of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/15/part-time-university-students-numbers-fall?CMP=share_btn_tw">UK part-time students fell by 7%</a> in 2013-14 compared with the previous year, with the worst-case market &ndash; foundation degrees &ndash; falling by 18% to just 24,000.&nbsp; The figures underscored earlier research suggesting that part-time student numbers have fallen sharply since 2010-11, when fees rose to a maximum of &pound;9,000 a year for full-time study.&nbsp; &ldquo;These figures confirm another reduction in the number of part-time students, and should be a significant concern for policymakers and the higher education sector as a whole,&rdquo; said Les Ebdon, director of the Office of Fair Access to Higher Education.&nbsp; Over the same period, full-time student numbers rose by 2%.</p>
<p>According to new data from UCAS, the latest <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/student-admissions-bounce-back-after-2012-slump/2018225.article">rise in student admissions</a> in this academic year takes the total up by almost 14,000 (3.2%) to 447,450, meaning that nearly all universities in England have bounced back from the &pound;9k fees admissions slump, which saw core intakes shrink in some cases by 20%.</p>
<p>But not everyone wants to go to university for their degree.&nbsp; There was an 11.8% in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/thousands-of-students-shun-universities-in-favour-of-studying-for-their-degrees-at-local-further-education-colleges-10016084.html">undergraduates joining FE colleges</a> in the two years to 2012-13, helped in part by the relaxation in recruitment curbs.&nbsp; The Association of Colleges estimates that there are around 115,000 students currently studying for degrees at FE colleges.</p>
<p>Analysis by UCAS shows that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/record-numbers-of-women-going-to-university-according-to-ucas-9993201.html">a record number of women started university courses</a> last Sep, but they are still avoiding science, IT and engineering courses.&nbsp; The biggest gap between the sexes were in education, with 85% per cent of acceptances being women, and &ldquo;subjects allied to medicine&rdquo;, i.e. nursing (81%).&nbsp; In contrast, 87% of computer science undergrads were men, as were 85% of engineering students.&nbsp; In a dubious pre-election comment, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said &ldquo;&hellip;if you didn&rsquo;t know what you wanted to do, then the arts and humanities were what you chose to do because they were useful for all kinds of jobs.&nbsp; Of course, we now know nothing could be further from the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Colquhoun suggests that honours degrees aren't well suited to all students and that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/feb/03/honours-degrees-arent-for-all-some-unis-should-only-teach-two-year-courses">some universities should focus on two-year ordinary degrees</a>, similar to those offered by US liberal arts colleges, and these should be less specialist than what is now offered.&nbsp; Some institutions should specialise in teaching such degrees, others should become predominantly postgraduate institutions and have the time, money and expertise to do proper advanced teaching.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Sunday Times last month, shadow HE spokesman Liam Byrne said the present university funding system was unsustainable: &ldquo;We want to bring the cost down, but this has to be funded. &nbsp;The right long-term shift is to a <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=2015012010053921">graduate tax</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, more recent speculation suggests that Labour may commit to a Robbins- or Dearing-style major review of HE and a <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/uuk-warning-over-6000-fees/2018347.article">cut in maximum tuition fees from &pound;9k to &pound;6k</a>, described by UUK as ignoring the &ldquo;legitimate concerns of vice-chancellors&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Overseas fee-paying students at the University of the West of Scotland could benefit from a proposed initiative to <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/university-students-who-fail-should-get-refund.117233988">have their costs waived if they fail to graduate</a>.&nbsp; UWS says it has broken ranks with other institutions to ensure it remains attractive in an increasingly competitive global market.&nbsp; If the scheme is approved, UWS would become the first institution in the UK to offer students a refund for failing to complete their courses.</p>

<p>Latest data from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech showed that, in the key Christmas sales quarter of Q4 2014, Apple sold more iPhones in the US than all of the various Android OEMs put together (for the first time since Q4 2012) &ndash; but only by a margin of 0.1%.&nbsp; However, picture across the UK was quite different, with Android smartphone sales taking 51% of the market (down 8% compared to Q4 2013), followed by iOS at 42% (up 13%) and Windows at 7% (down 3%).&nbsp; <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/04/apples-iphone-overtakes-android-in-us-sales-for-the-first-time-since-2012/?ncid=tcdaily">Apple&rsquo;s 13% UK growth</a> was the largest for any individual nation, with the iPhone 6 accounting for 20% of all smartphone sales (and the Galaxy S5 a distant second with 8%).</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Audrey Watters; TechCrunch; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>EdSurge reports on <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-12-26-moocs-in-2014-breaking-down-the-numbers">MOOC stats for 2014</a>, highlights of which are that, by mid-2015, over 400 universities are expected to have delivered 2400+ courses to around 17 million students.&nbsp; Coursera still offers the lion&rsquo;s share of courses (36%) but this has fallen from around 50% in 2013 as new providers emerge &ndash; including FutureLearn, in 5<sup>th</sup> place with 4.7% of courses and around 800,000 students.&nbsp; And what courses do people want?&nbsp; The top 20 search terms suggests: python, healthcare, java, finance, android, English, statistics, marketing, music, writing, psychology, accounting, design, Spanish, programming, law, photography, big data and history.&nbsp; The article also reports on four notable trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each of the Big 3 MOOC providers have introduced their own credentials (Udacity&rsquo;s Nanodegrees, Coursera&rsquo;s Specializations and edX&rsquo;s Xseries)</li>
<li>Open edX has quickly become the de facto platform for organisations and groups who are looking to host their own MOOCs</li>
<li>There is a move towards self-paced &lsquo;always on&rsquo; availability rather than fixed start/finish dates (but with the challenge of providing the social interaction and/or assistance that many MOOC-takers expect)</li>
<li>Production quality is improving, with many universities setting up centralised production studios to support academics creating MOOCs</li>
</ul>
<p>Coursera has revamped its <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/104696446187/have-a-business-idea-get-funded-with-coursera">Developing Innovative Ideas: The First Step in Entrepreneurship</a> &lsquo;Specializations&rsquo; MOOC.&nbsp; Learners completing three 4-week courses will then be able to take part in a final project, creating a business plan and pitch deck to woo investors.&nbsp; Those deemed to have a compelling product idea will be invited to interview for a 500 Startups (a Silicon Valley investment fund and business accelerator) cohort.</p>
<p>A new partnership between Amazon Web Services and edX sees the former <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/23/amazon-web-services-will-give-you-1000-in-credit-for-completing-these-edx-courses/?ncid=tcdaily">offering students $1,000 in credit</a> for completing one of two MITx courses on entrepreneurship.&nbsp; The credit can be spent on processor time and/or storage in Amazon&rsquo;s cloud.&nbsp; Recipients can also get credit for instructor-led training and web classes on using AWS, free premium support and &ldquo;office hours&rdquo; with Amazon specialists to help newbies set up their app or service for Amazon&rsquo;s instances.</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/01/12/coursera-expands-presence-in-china.aspx">Coursera is moving into China</a>, thanks to a new partnership with Hujiang which will see English language Coursera MOOCs hosted on the Hujiang education platform, giving Chinese users access to course materials, class activities and discussions in a familiar learning environment.&nbsp; Additional services will be available to help users' pronunciation, grammar and translation.&nbsp; Future plans include launching courses in Hujiang from popular Coursera instructors, as well as incorporating educational resources from Hujiang into the Coursera platform.</p>
<p>Berkeley is teaming with private partner Databricks to launch a <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/12/02/berkeley-launches-big-data-moocs.aspx">new edX MOOC focused on big data analysis</a> using the open source Apache Spark data processing engine.&nbsp; The first five-week course, Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark, will cover the application of data science techniques using parallel programming for big and small data, and will start on 23 Feb.</p>

<p><strong>UK HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; Independent]</em></p>
<p>The UK's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30711724">first private medical school</a> has just opened at the University of Buckingham, with an initial intake of 67 students paying annual tuition fees of &pound;36,000.&nbsp; Contrary to expectations, 60% of applicants are from the UK, reflecting the fact that conventional medical courses are consistently over-subscribed.&nbsp; The course will last four and a half years (with a total cost of more than &pound;162,000) and will include a mix of clinical and biomedical science teaching, working with the Milton Keynes Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. &nbsp;COO, Prof John Clapham says he has been &ldquo;absolutely staggered&rdquo; by the initial interest and that demand was even higher for next year's entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new report by High Fliers Research claims the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30745839">UK graduate employment market</a> is at its most buoyant for 10 years.&nbsp; Key to success is undertaking work placements at the firm in question, with a third of jobs expected to be offered to graduates who have managed to do this.&nbsp; Conversely, those with no work experience are unlikely to be successful applicants and have &ldquo;little or no chance&rdquo; of receiving a job offer through graduate programmes, half of the recruiters said.</p>
<p>A request from HEPI for universities to provide details of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/top-universities-refuse-to-reveal-how-they-are-spending-tuition-fees-9958264.html">how they spend tuition fees</a> was met with a deafening silence from the majority, including almost all the of the country&rsquo;s most select universities.&nbsp; However, HEPI Director Nick Hillman &ndash; an adviser to the former Universities Minister David Willetts &ndash; said he believed they would be unable to convince MPs in future to lift the &pound;9,000-a-year cap on fees unless they were more open about their financing.</p>

<p><em>[IRRODL]</em></p>
<p>A paper in last month&rsquo;s IRRODL presents the results of a three-year study of 553 <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1748/3123">students&rsquo; level of satisfaction with online learning</a> at one US university. &nbsp;Responses were consistent throughout the eight academic terms, showing no significant differences in the level of satisfaction according to gender, age, or level of study. &nbsp;Overall, students rated their online instruction as moderately satisfactory, with hybrid or partially online courses rated as somewhat more satisfactory than fully online courses. &nbsp;&ldquo;Convenience&rdquo; was the most cited reason for satisfaction and &ldquo;lack of interaction&rdquo; (including lack of communication with the instructor and classmates) was the most cited reason for dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>According to Prof Sanjay Sarma, MIT&rsquo;s director of digital learning, educators should stop relying on one-hour lessons and opt instead for <a href="https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6455175">10-minute video lessons</a> to capture the &ldquo;wandering minds&rdquo; of their students.&nbsp; &ldquo;The way we teach today is based on lectures, which is still a factory-style system,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;[Young people] spend hours each week consuming 10- or 20-minute titbits about physics and history or whatever on YouTube or Khan Academy&hellip; It&rsquo;s not &lsquo;maybe this will be the future&rsquo; &ndash; it is the future. &nbsp;We just need to recognise it.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, not everyone agrees.&nbsp; Miles Berry, principal lecturer in computing education at the University of Roehampton, said that in-depth learning still had a place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Academic and professional success requires the ability to concentrate for extended periods of time and the mastery of complex ideas and arguments.&nbsp; Good schools do all they can to help their pupils develop a love of learning, whether it&rsquo;s online, from books or face-to-face.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Emerging Technologies and the Workplace </strong></p>
<p><em>[Cisco; Bentley University]</em></p>
<p>Cisco&rsquo;s 2014 <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise/connected-world-technology-report/cisco-2014-connected-world-technology-report.pdf">Connected World Technology Report</a> is based on recent surveys of 1,388 Gen Y (millennial) professionals (aged 18-30) and 1,524 Gen X professionals (aged 31-50) from 15 countries.&nbsp; Its 147 pages provide a detailed insight into attitudes to work, expectations of the workplace and preferences/use of technologies,.&nbsp; Even the <a href="http://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1528226">summary</a> is extensive, so here&rsquo;s a summary of that summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 40% of Gen X and Gen Y professionals consider themselves to be &ldquo;Supertaskers&rdquo; (able to do more than two things effectively at once)</li>
<li>60% of Gen X professionals think that Gen Y employees are able to perform tasks faster than older employees using mobile devices and apps</li>
<li>Gen X professionals are considered easier to manage than their younger counterparts; the greatest challenge when managing Gen Y employees is their &ldquo;I want it now&rdquo; ambition</li>
<li>More than half of Gen X and Gen Y professionals consider themselves accessible for work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week</li>
<li>Around half of professionals wish to work anywhere at any time.&nbsp; Most are not prepared to sacrifice salary for this but they believe organisations that offer it have a competitive advantage</li>
<li>If forced to choose, the majority of Gen Xs and Gen Ys would pick their smartphone over their television and 1 in 5 would rather be robbed of their wallet than their smartphone</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar research by Bentley University into <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/BentleyU/preparedu-the-millennial-mind-goes-to-work-41415813">millennial workplace preferences</a> tells us that, as you read this in Jan 15, one in three US employees will be a millennial.&nbsp; They are part of the always-on generation, with 77% preferring flexible working and 89% regularly checking work emails outside work; but they are not exclusively digital, with 51% preferring to communicate with others face-to-face at work.&nbsp; Nor are they job hoppers we might imagine: 80% expect to work for four or fewer organisations during their career and 16% hope to stay in their current job for life.&nbsp; But 35% admit to having a poor work ethic and 66% believe limiting social media usage at work would make workers more productive.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Aids Learning?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Faculty Focus]</em></p>
<p>As learning designers, we often assume we should be making learning as clear and painless as possible for our busy students.&nbsp; But Daniel Lemire suggests the opposite can be much more effective, and we should encourage learners to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek the most difficult problems</li>
<li>Reflect on what you have supposedly learned</li>
<li>Avoid learning from a single source</li>
</ul>
<p>He believes that, &ldquo;When studying, many people do not want to mix topics &lsquo;so as not to get confused&rsquo;. &nbsp;So if they need to learn to apply one particular idea, they study to the exclusion of everything else.&rdquo;&nbsp; The structure of most books and course materials (and lectures) supports this but students are often quite passive and are learning at a fairly surface level.&nbsp; He suggests <a href="http://lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/12/30/how-to-learn-efficiently/">interleaved practice</a> (intentionally mixing up topics) is more effective, even though it may feel harder and confusing (&ldquo;If some learning activity feels easy, it means that it is too easy&rdquo;).&nbsp; This approach also better mirrors real life and the workplace because &ldquo;Interleaved practice is exactly what a real project forces you to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s another counterintuitive one: John Orlando suggests that <a href="http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/educational-assessment/praise-undermining-student-motivation/">too much praise</a> could be undermining student motivation and self-esteem.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing Can Aid Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS]</em></p>
<p>Two experiments reported in Contemporary Educational Psychology showed benefits gained by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X14000496">students who were asked to make drawings</a> (using a template) whilst assimilating new textual information about the biology of influenza.&nbsp; In experiment 1 (<em>N=</em>48), those who drew scored 61% on a multi-choice comprehension test, vs 44% for a control group.&nbsp; In experiment 2 (<em>N=</em>164), the scores were 63% vs 52%.&nbsp; Experiment 2 also included two other groups: one received pre-drawn images along with the text, yielding a mean post-test score of 53%; the other also received pre-drawn images and were asked to create their own (51%).&nbsp; These latter two conditions thus showed no notable gains over plain text, but the benefits of drawing over just reading were significant in both experiments.&nbsp; The researchers believe this &ldquo;&hellip;encourages learners to engage in generative cognitive processing during learning such as organising the relevant information into a coherent structure, and integrating it with relevant prior knowledge from long-term memory.&rdquo; &nbsp;However, they acknowledge that the study material involved a causal chain of events and so it is not clear if drawing could also help people learn other kinds of content.</p>

<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Higher education researchers Eduventures predict that US online learning will grow in 2015 (but only modestly); more colleges and universities will test out competency-based assessment; and education technology will continue to expand as an industry, driven by investment capital. &nbsp;Eduventures expects just <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/01/07/2015-predictions-competency-based-ed-to-grow-debt-could-topple-some-schools.aspx">2% growth in online degree programmes</a>, dampened in part by the &ldquo;uncertainty and indecision&rdquo; of adult learners, and the number of new colleges entering the online market is expected to grow &ldquo;very little, if at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The company also noted that low interest rates are causing institutions to borrow more against the expectation that revenue from tuition, endowments, etc, will cover these debts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rating agencies, however, are not being fooled. &nbsp;Between 2009 and 2013, the number of credit rating downgrades at colleges rated by Moody's Investment Services outpaced upgrades by nearly five to one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A study of 420,000 undergraduates and graduate students enrolled in STEM classes in the US and Canada found <a href="http://blog.piazza.com/stem-confidence-gap/">notable differences in male and female behaviour in online forums</a>.&nbsp; Whilst most students enrolled in classes that use online discussion tools <em>do</em> participate, women ask 23% more questions than do their male peers, but they answer 18% fewer.&nbsp; When women do answer, they are more likely than men to answer anonymously (39% vs 28%).&nbsp; At the &lsquo;top&rsquo; STEM universities (Berkeley, Stanford, Harvard and MIT) the male:female gap was greater than the institutional average.&nbsp; However, gender differences varied greatly by subject.&nbsp; While male computer science students answer 37% more questions than women, the difference is only 7% in humanities subjects and, in business and social sciences, women actually answer more questions than men (11% and 5%).</p>

              <title>WED: To what extent do MOOCs contribute to a  narrative of development as freedom? (Tim Seal)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8869</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>[DRAFT abstract - comments please]</h2>
<p>The uptake of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) within the HE sector has increased exponentially in the last 2 years with a belief that it will be of benefit to the provision of education in an ever expanding population (Trucano, 2013). With the majority of MOOCs coming from and being aimed at the global north (ICDE, 2013), how are MOOCs contextualised by providers for local context, what impact does this have on their applicability to the global context, and how does OER and openness support this contextualisation? &nbsp;One commonly heard line of rhetoric in respect to MOOCs is that they largely benefit those already engaged in their own education, rather than those excluded from other forms of education. Some studies (Christensen et al, 2013) finding over 80% of participants having post-secondary qualifications and almost 50% reporting post graduate qualifications. Understanding the mechanisms by which a MOOC is delivered can support the engagement of participants, or act as an additional barrier, particularly in development contexts, is essential to the ability of MOOC providers in ensuring equitable access and support for students&rsquo; learning.</p>
<p>Set within the context of Nobel economist Amartya Sen&rsquo;s (1999) ideas of development in &lsquo;expand[ing] people&rsquo;s substantive freedoms through the removal of &ldquo;unfreedoms&rdquo;: poverty, limited economic opportunity, inadequate education and access to knowledge, deficient health care, and oppression&rsquo; (p. 1).&nbsp; This presentation seeks to identify the ways in which MOOCs and by association other forms of openness either add or remove barriers to engagement in education in relation to the removal of unfreedoms, providing an understanding of the openness of MOOCs and the extent to which MOOCs as tool contribute to a narrative of development as freedom.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; The Chronicle; Audrey Watters; EdSurge; University World News; Michel Wermelinger; IRRODL; Grainne Conole; Huff Post]</em></p>
<p>Yousef et al presented an excellent paper, <a href="https://oerknowledgecloud.org/sites/oerknowledgecloud.org/files/MOOCs - A Review of the State-of-the-Art.pdf">MOOCs: a Review of the State of the Art</a>, at CSEDU 2014.&nbsp; This was not the usual facts-and-figures look at MOOC students and their activities (welcome as those are) but a comprehensive analysis 84 peer reviewed papers generated over the past 5 years and a template analysis that categorised the research into 7 dimensions: MOOC concept, design, learning theories, case studies, business models, target groups, and assessment.&nbsp; They conclude that, far from being as radical as we have been led to believe, most MOOC implementations, &ldquo;still follow a top-down, controlled, teacher-centered, and centralized learning model.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prof Yoonil Auh, from South Korea&rsquo;s Kyung Hee University, also thinks that current MOOCs are a top-down way of achieving &ldquo;a one-way transfer of knowledge from the West to the rest&rdquo;.&nbsp; Now here comes <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20141105144147849">Collaborative MOOC 2.0</a>, wherein, &ldquo;Content will not have to be taken in a specific order but would be more like cafeteria-style modules that can be customised; only those modules taken that are needed for their community [sic].&rdquo;&nbsp; Auh also believes that, &ldquo;MOOC 2.0 technology is such that students can actually learn from each other and the MOOC is the facilitator.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that what c-MOOCs have been doing since 2008?</p>
<p>Maria Konnikova&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/moocs-failure-solutions">Will MOOCs be Flukes?</a> begins with a look back at the original aspirations of the OU to bring education to &ldquo;the tired, the poor, the huddled masses&rdquo;.&nbsp; MOOCs appeared to set off along a similar road but have somehow ended up driving through mainly white, middle class, well-educated neighbourhoods &ndash; and with most of the travellers alighting before reaching the final destination.&nbsp; She suggests we might learn some useful lessons from control theory &ndash; adjusting the content, sequence and break points according to past performance and other metrics.&nbsp; We should also not allow our concerns over dropouts to limit when and how much we test students which, if done well, invariably leads to more effective learning &ndash; a view shared in a separate Huff Post article by Jonathan Lash, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-lash/testblind-and-rigorous_b_6134924.html">Test-blind and rigorous</a>.</p>
<p>November&rsquo;s IRRODL contains a paper examining the <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1842/3065">employer potential of MOOCs</a>, based on a survey of 103 employers about their awareness of MOOCs (31% had heard of them) and their receptivity to using MOOCs in recruiting, hiring, and professional development. &nbsp;Once they understood what MOOCs were, 59% were receptive to using MOOCs for recruiting purposes, partly because of their subject matter (especially for software/technical skills) but also because they demonstrated attributes such as drive, motivation, time-management and willingness to self-develop (see also Donald Clark&rsquo;s similar comments about distance learning degrees from the <a href="http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/7-traits-of-online-graduates-that-trump.html">University of Herts</a>). &nbsp;Still more (83%) were using or would consider using MOOCs for professional development because they provide a convenient way to take a &ldquo;refresher course&rdquo; or &ldquo;stay up to date&rdquo; in their field, and also &ldquo;to take what they want&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In Jan of this year, Coursera launched its <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/coursera-expands-its-mooc-certificate-program/54915">Specializations certification programme</a> for students who pass multiple MOOCs.&nbsp; It has now announced an expansion of that programme &ndash; which requires learners to take Coursera&rsquo;s fee-based &ldquo;Signature Track&rdquo; courses &ndash; by adding 18 new Specializations.&nbsp; These are mostly practical, in-demand fields like project management, cloud computing, and data mining, and students who complete the sequences can expect to pay $100 to $300, depending on the number of courses.</p>
<p>In addition to Specializations, Dhawal Shah walks us through <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-10-15-how-does-coursera-make-money">how Coursera makes money</a>, starting with Career Services (Dec 12) which failed to take off with potential employers.&nbsp; Then came Signature Track (Jan 13) which generated $1m+ in its first nine months through students paying $30-100 for verified certification, and which he now estimates is raising around $1m per month.&nbsp; Finally, he looks at corporate collaborations, sponsorships, employee training and capstone projects &ndash; although the facts and figures relating to these are much less transparent.</p>
<p>Coursera is also exploring the possibility of offering online discussions with the university professors who teach its MOOCs. &nbsp;According to CEO Rick Levin, &ldquo;Down the road, we&rsquo;ll probably go to a premium layer that you could pay for that would give you <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/king-free-online-courses-may-soon-add-videochats-professors/">live interaction with a professor by video</a> or something like that &ndash; a seminar within a MOOC&rdquo;.</p>
<p>edX is hosting a free <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/free-online-ap-courses-debut-on-edx-web-site/2014/10/20/6b16c204-5883-11e4-b812-38518ae74c67_story.html">Advanced Placement course</a> in biology from Rice University &ndash; the first edX MOOC advertised as an AP course for high school students.&nbsp; Further AP courses are planned, with physics from Boston University, mechanics from MIT and electricity &amp; magnetism from Georgetown University all starting early in the new year.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://project.europeanmoocs.eu/moocs/">European Multiple MOOC Aggregator</a> (EMMA) is an EU-funded site that aims to provide a system for the delivery of MOOCs in multiple languages from different European universities &ldquo;to help preserve Europe&rsquo;s rich cultural, educational and linguistic heritage and to promote real cross-cultural and multi-lingual learning.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are 12 initial partners, including open universities from Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal.&nbsp; Although there are not many MOOCs available yet, of the ten I found, four related to eLearning and its design.</p>
<p>Katy Jordan has complied an impressive list of <a href="http://www.katyjordan.com/moocliterature/">MOOC research</a> dating back to 2009.&nbsp; There are still one or two technical limitations and it will rely on some community input, but it looks like a really useful resource.</p>
<p>Since its launch a year ago, Berlin-based MOOC provider <a href="https://iversity.org/pages/financing-round-in-the-millions">iversity</a> has attracted nearly 700,000 enrolments in 51 online courses, cooperated with more than 30 partners (mainly European universities) and attracted &euro;5m in venture capital investment.</p>
<p><a href="http://firstyear.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a> is also a year old and they&rsquo;ve published some key facts-and-figures in a nifty scrolling graphic.&nbsp; This tells us there are 133 course titles available from 44 partners, the most populous of which had 121,965 enrolees.&nbsp; There are over 650,000 registered FL users who&rsquo;ve signed up to 1.4m courses.&nbsp; And they&rsquo;ve cracked retention (22%).&nbsp; By counting it differently.</p>

<p><strong>Martin Bean Warns Universities Over Digital &lsquo;Irrelevance&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>In his final public speech as OU VC, Martin Bean warned those in the sector that, &ldquo;in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/bean-warns-universities-over-digital-irrelevance/2016842.article">students are demanding new, more engaging ways of teaching and learning</a>&rdquo;, and he cited some examples of retailers who ultimately suffered from failing to keep pace with evolving expectations.&nbsp; He also commented on the phenomenal pace of societal and technological change, noting that, &ldquo;If education doesn&rsquo;t keep up with this changing environment &hellip; we risk the sector becoming irrelevant and even irresponsible.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Third of FE Colleges Offering Degrees Fail Inspection</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; THE]</em></p>
<p>More than <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29649172">200 FE colleges now provide HE courses</a>, often with fees of &pound;7,500 or less.&nbsp; However, during recent inspections of 45 of these by the Quality Assurance Agency, 14 were classed as "requires improvement to meet expectations" or "does not meet expectations".</p>
<p>And writing in THE, Chris Rust questions <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/feature-are-uk-degree-standards-comparable/2016838.article">whether degree standards are compatible across all UK institutions</a>, claiming that, without a system for sharing assessment practice, it&rsquo;s nonsense to assume that a 2:1 is the same everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>Uncontrolled Expansion: How Private Colleges Grew</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>THE reports that new universities minister, Greg Clark, is being encouraged to welcome more private colleges into the sector, taking on the legacy left by David Willetts.&nbsp; Bypassing BPP and the University of Buckingham, the article takes a detailed look at the operation and funding of <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/uncontrolled-expansion-how-private-colleges-grew/2016579.article">Regent College</a>.&nbsp; For example, in 2013, Regent gained 70% of its students through one Romanian recruitment agent, whose Facebook page emphasised the availability of UK government grants and loans, urging students to &ldquo;share the good news with all your friends&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-million Pound Giving to Universities Increases </strong></p>
<p><em>[The Telegraph; BBC]</em></p>
<p>Figures from Coutts and the University of Kent show that, out of the ten largest donations made in the UK last year, 7 were received by HEIs, all worth at least &pound;30m.&nbsp; A total of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/11205282/Multi-million-pound-giving-to-universities-increases.html">33 universities received seven-figure donations</a> last year, and 11 institutions saw more than one donation of this size (e.g. 12 for Oxford and 7 for Cambridge).&nbsp; The largest single donation was a &pound;75m gift made to the University of Oxford from grant-making organisation, the McCall MacBain Foundation in Geneva.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29786836">a study of more than 2,300 billionaires</a> found that they were more likely to be graduates, a quarter have postgraduate degrees and more than 10% has a doctorate.&nbsp; In a listing of universities producing billionaires, elite US institutions take the top 9 places (headed by the U Penn, Harvard and Yale), followed by Mumbai in ninth and LSE in tenth &ndash; the only UK institution in the top 20. &nbsp;The most populous city for billionaires is New York, and more than 40% of billionaires in Europe live in just 10 cities, headed by Moscow and London.</p>

<p><strong>Plymouth Providing 30,000 e-Textbooks to Students </strong></p>

<p><strong>Mature Students: Lifelong Learning on Life Support?</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE]</em></p>
<p>In this THE article, Matthew Reisz talks to academics about their experiences of teaching older learners (they have life experience, broader knowledge, different perspectives and often have firmer political opinions), while Holly Else analyses the decline in the number of <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/mature-students-lifelong-learning-on-life-support/1/2016718.article">mature students</a>.&nbsp; At the OU, 90% of its 60,000 first-year undergraduates are aged 21 or over, but the UK as a whole has seen the number of mature students decline by about 150,000 since 2008/9 to about 290,000 in 2012/13, with the decrease being particularly acute in England.&nbsp; Birkbeck&rsquo;s Prof Claire Callender believes ELQ rules and part timers&rsquo; ineligibility for loans and maintenance grants to help with living costs have all contributed to this.</p>

<p><strong>Global Postgraduate Student Mobility Trends to 2024</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>A British Council report released last month, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20141009145454791">Postgraduate Student Mobility Trends to 2024</a>, estimates that India will have by far the most tertiary students in 2024 &ndash; 48 million against 37 million in China &ndash; but Chinese students are likely to be more mobile, with around 338,000 studying abroad compared to India&rsquo;s 209,000. &nbsp;America will continue to be the world&rsquo;s most popular student destination, with an increase of 154,000 students expected (to 407,000), followed by the UK with growth of 83,000 (to 241,000).&nbsp; According to the British Council&rsquo;s Zainab Malik, &ldquo;Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Pakistan will become key postgraduate markets by 2024, next to India and China&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Those predictions gained credibility this week with the release of figures from the US Council of Graduate Schools which showed that overall <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/files/2014/11/Intl_III_2014_report_final.pdf">international enrolment increased</a> by 8% this year.&nbsp; Enrolment by Indian students grew by 40% last year and 27% this year, but enrolment by Chinese students grew by just 5% last year (down from double digit growth in the past 7 years) and actually declined by 1% this year.&nbsp; Also notable was a 91% growth in enrolments in the US by Brazilian students.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Crowds: Learning and Social Media</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>A new e-book from Athabasca professors Jon Dron and Terry Anderson, <a href="http://news.athabascau.ca/au-press/teaching-crowds-book-online-learning/">Teaching Crowds: Learning and Social Media</a>, makes the case for an online learning model that places a high value on social media and the connections that technology can help to create.&nbsp; Teaching Crowds is about technologies that celebrate the creative partnering of human beings and harness the enormous amount of information on the web, and the authors argue that these technologies will soon challenge the traditional, institution-based approaches to education that we know so well.</p>

<p><strong>How Community Feedback Shapes User Behaviour</strong></p>
<p><em>[Andrew Cupples]</em></p>
<p>Interesting research from Stanford on <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/disqus-icwsm14.pdf">the effects of community feedback (comments, likes, etc) on web authors&rsquo; future behaviour</a>.&nbsp; By studying four large comment-based news communities, the researchers found that negative feedback leads to significant behavioural changes that are detrimental to the community in a number of respects.&nbsp; Firstly, authors of negatively-evaluated content actually go on to contribute more, but their future posts are perceived by the community to be of lower quality; these authors are also more likely to subsequently evaluate their fellow users negatively, percolating these effects through the community. &nbsp;In contrast, positive feedback neither encourages rewarded authors to write more, nor improves the quality of their posts.&nbsp; Finally, those authors that receive no community feedback are most likely to leave that community. &nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Technologies</em></p>
<ul>
<li>93% are using e-learning courses</li>
<li>86% are using live online learning such as virtual classrooms</li>
<li>80% are using an LMS/VLE</li>
<li>74% are using mobile devices for learning</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Content</em></p>
<ul>
<li>70% learn what they need to do their job from web searches</li>
<li>30% are creating micro-content (less than 10 minutes)</li>
<li>26% are investigating the use of MOOCs in corporate learning</li>
<li>14% encourage learners to share experiences and solve problems using online social media</li>
<li>12% have content curation strategies in place to help staff make sense of the resources available to them</li>

<p><strong>Skype Real Time Translation</strong></p>
<p><em>[Elliott Masie]</em></p>
<p>Microsoft Research demonstrated a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJIILew6l28">Skype speech to speech translator</a> at the recent WPC 2014 conference.&nbsp; The service combines speech-recognition, automatic-translation and machine-learning technologies to provide near real time translation, output in the form of synthetic audio and subtitles.&nbsp; The company hopes it will &ldquo;pave the way for a more personal and more human era of computing&rdquo; once it becomes widely available, and it is now offering a <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/skype-starts-offering-early-preview-translator-feature/">preview version</a>.&nbsp; The potential for some global learning scenarios surely makes this worthy of further investigation.</p>

<p>Latest Q3 figures from Gartner show that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/15/tablet-sales-growth-plummets-in-2014-as-android-smartphones-continue-to-soar-gartner/">tablet sales in 2014 will only see 11% growth</a> over last year, compared to growth of 55% the year before.&nbsp; This means around 229 million tablets are expected to ship in 2014, equivalent to 9.5% of overall worldwide device sales (phones, tablets, desktops) of 2.4 billion devices for the year.&nbsp; Around 51% of all devices sold this year have or will be running Android.</p>
<p>IDC reports that Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/07/mac-achieves-highest-u-s-pc-market-share-ever-in-q3-2014-according-to-idc/">Mac marketshare hit record highs</a> during Q3 2014, with shipments up by 12.9% from Q3 2013 to 2.34 million (13.4% market share).</p>
<p>Gartner predicts that worldwide shipments of <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/10/27/3d-printer-shipments-to-double-each-year-through-2018.aspx">3D printers</a> will more than double each year between now and 2018, when it projects sales of the devices to top 2.3 million.&nbsp; The rise will be fuelled by the increasing availability of good quality sub-$1000 models.</p>
<p>And a new study from ABI Research, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/10/27/report-wearable-interfaces-to-become-increasingly-sensor-based-over-next-5-years.aspx">Mobile Device User Interface Innovation</a>, suggests that mobile and wearable devices will start to rely less on screen-based user interfaces and increasingly on proximity sensors, voice, gesture, eye-tracking, GPS, GNSS and other input methods.&nbsp; Take a look at Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/#project">Project Tango</a> if you want to see where this might be taking us.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/14/the-pi-top-a-raspberry-pi-powered-laptop-is-hitting-the-crowdfunding-trail">Raspberry Pi-powered laptop</a> has exceeded its crowdfunding targets and should be available for $249 from around next May.&nbsp; But if you&rsquo;re in more of a hurry and love dangly wires, the new <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/10/pi-model-a-plus">Pi Model A+ board</a> is now available at just $20 &ndash; smaller, $5 cheaper and more energy-efficient than its predecessor.</p>

<p><strong>OER Use Growing</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>A Babson/Pearson survey of 2,144 faculty members found that around <a href="http://onlinelearningsurvey.com/oer.html">two-thirds say they are unaware of OERs</a>. However, more than 34% say they are regularly or occasionally using OERs as teaching resources, with images and video topping the list.&nbsp; Searching for OERs is easy or very easy (60%) although the absence of a single comprehensive catalogue of resources is seen as a barrier by more than half.</p>
<p><a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/44227">Leicester City Council</a> has become the first in the UK to authorise its 84 community schools to openly license their educational resources. &nbsp;The council is recommending that school staff use the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license to openly share materials created in the course of their work.</p>

<p><strong>US Universities Partner on iPad-Based Degree Programme</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Two US universities are partnering to provide an <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/10/20/universities-partner-on-ipad-based-degree-program.aspx?m=2">iPad-based degree programme</a> that will deliver a BSc in entrepreneurship in two and a half years.&nbsp; Florida&rsquo;s Lynn University describes its core curriculum model as &ldquo;challenge-based learning&rdquo; &ndash; focusing on using technology to apply course content to real-world problems, with over 70% of the school's 2,500 students required to use iPads.&nbsp; Colorado&rsquo;s Watson University uses intensive mentoring work to develop skills that emphasise &ldquo;empathy, creativity, resilience, grit, bootstrapping, team building and fundraising.&rdquo;&nbsp; The new course will require students to spend four semesters on campus at Watson and three summers engaged in Lynn's online programme</p>

<p><strong>If Learners Live Online, Teachers and Textbooks Must Follow Them</strong></p>
<p><em>[Pete Mitton]</em></p>
<p>The title seems to say it all, but David White&rsquo;s article in <a href="http://theconversation.com/if-learners-live-online-teachers-and-textbooks-must-follow-them-32478">The Conversation</a> also cautions that &lsquo;online&rsquo; is not the same as &lsquo;social&rsquo; and that, &ldquo;Irrespective of how digitally savvy they think they are, most people will spend the majority of their time browsing online content before walking away without leaving a social trace.&rdquo;&nbsp; He refers to the difference between <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/projects/visitorsandresidents.aspx">&lsquo;visitors&rsquo; and &lsquo;residents&rsquo;</a> &ndash; the subject of a JISC research project that can help universities explore the relationship between institutional and online cultures.</p>

<p><strong>Putin&rsquo;s Friend Profits in Purge of Schoolbooks</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>NYT reports that, when the Russian school year began a couple of months ago, the number of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/world/europe/putins-friend-profits-in-purge-of-schoolbooks.html">approved textbooks</a> for Russia&rsquo;s 43,000 schools and 14 million schoolchildren had been slashed by more than half due to a series of bureaucratic purges.&nbsp; However, it was notable that one company, Enlightenment (previously the sole provider of school textbooks under Soviet rule), seemed to have emerged unscathed.&nbsp; The fact that the company is chaired by Arkady Rotenberg, a judo sparring partner from Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s St Petersburg youth, must surely just be a coincidence?</p>

<p><strong>Focus on &hellip; Students and Technology</strong></p>
<p><em>[JISC; University World News; Business Insider; Campus Technology; Stephen Downes; BBC; Pete Mitton]</em></p>
<p>Exact definitions of Generation X (born around 1960-80) and Generation Y/Millennials (1980-2000), seem to vary &ndash; but we know they will have had differing exposure to and experiences of online technologies.&nbsp; However, there is increasing evidence that their attitudes, expectations and levels of competence do not necessarily accord with our assumptions that younger people will be happy for their higher education to be social, hi-tech and online.</p>
<p>JISC&rsquo;s Digital Student project has released <a href="http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5600/1/STUDENT_EXPECTATIONS_SCHOOLS.pdf">Incoming expectations of the digital environment formed at school</a>, which examines what students entering HE expect from digital technologies.&nbsp; There is no formal summary but a useful list can be found in the Appendix (p17) which tells us new starters&rsquo; expectation include: fast web access, BYOD, good quality digital information (VLE and elsewhere), knowledgeable staff and training in &lsquo;how to use the Web for learning&rsquo;.&nbsp; They would also appreciate video lecture capture but do not expect the institution to engage with them in Social Media.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.pearsoned.com/wp-content/uploads/Pearson-HE-Student-Mobile-Device-Survey-PUBLIC-Report-051614.pdf">Pearson Student Mobile Device Survey, 2014</a> questioned 1,200 US college students aged 18-30, finding that 35% believed they were &ldquo;among the first people to check out a new electronic device or gadget&rdquo;.&nbsp; Some 81% agreed that tablets will transform the way they learn in the future and 82% think tablets encourage students to buy e-books rather than print, but fewer (66%) thought tablets actually helped them learn more.&nbsp; However, only 33% used a tablet themselves for college work (29% of these had a separate keyboard) with laptops (89%) and smartphones (56%) proving more popular for study.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29567359">UK figures out today from OFCOM</a> find that three-quarters of 12 to 15-year-olds have three or more digital, media or communications devices of their own and that one in three children now has their own tablet while the proportion with a TV in their bedroom has dropped to 46% from 66% since 2009.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140811093736768">Students Online: Global trends 2014</a> gathered 2,000+ responses from 35 countries and these echoed the JISC findings that social media is relatively unpopular, despite the fact that so many universities are investing heavily in developing these channels.&nbsp; But as one UK respondent pointed out, students might increasingly use Twitter for &ldquo;quick queries&rdquo;, but often only because universities don&rsquo;t respond to e-mails fast enough.&nbsp; On which social networks were most popular, Facebook won hands down worldwide with all age groups, with LinkedIn as second choice.&nbsp; But Piper Jaffray sees it differently.&nbsp; Their survey of US 13-19 year-olds found that, between Spring 14 and Autumn 14, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/teens-say-facebook-is-officially-over-2014-10">Facebook use dropped</a> from 72% to 45%, although Instagram (owned by Facebook) showed an increase in use from 69% to 76%.&nbsp; Yet another perspective comes from Niche, which found that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/facebook-texting-teens-instagram-snapchat-most-popular-social-network/373043/">Facebook is alive and well</a> amongst the 7,000 teenagers it surveyed, but the real killer app is good old texting, used by 87% of teens each day.</p>
<p>A new report from Intel finds that Canadian post-secondary <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/08/11/survey-one-third-of-educational-time-spent-online.aspx">students spend one-third of all educational time online</a>, and that &ldquo;personal mobile technology in the classroom is having a major positive impact on engagement, empowerment and collaboration, and is helping students to overcome barriers imposed by increasingly large class sizes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The most commonly cited online educational activities were collaborating with peers (87%) and communicating with instructors or teaching assistants (86%), research (78%) and homework (52%).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Clay Shirky has had enough.&nbsp; Despite teaching the theory and practice of social media at NYU, he&rsquo;s just introduced a <a href="https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368">&lsquo;no devices&rsquo; rule during lectures</a> because he believes the distractions to learning have reached a tipping point.&nbsp; As he points out, &lsquo;<em>&ldquo;Your former lover tagged a photo you are in&rdquo; vs &ldquo;The Crimean War was the first conflict significantly affected by use of the telegraph.&rdquo; Spot the difference?</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Campus Technology; BBC; The Chronicle; MIT; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Irish-based Alison has launched <a href="http://alison.com/courses/Understanding-the-Ebola-Virus-and-How-You-Can-Avoid-It">Understanding the Ebola Virus and How You Can Avoid It</a>, available in English and French and accessible on a mobile phone.&nbsp; It is aimed at people living in regions affected by the virus and includes assessments on how the virus can be transmitted and treated.&nbsp; So far, more than 10,000 people have signed up.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29206086">Marks &amp; Spencer</a> is offering a Coursera MOOC on business innovation in partnership with Leeds University. &nbsp;It will use case studies, video from the company's archive and support from university academics to teach how &ldquo;creative concepts are balanced with commercial thinking&rdquo;.&nbsp; The course will include examples of business innovation relevant to the retailer, such as the introduction of chilled foods and the development of man-made fibres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Built by industry for industry&rdquo; <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-09-24-udacity-raises-fresh-35m-to-expand-the-university-of-silicon-valley">Udacity has raised $35 million</a> in new funding, bringing the total raised over three rounds to $58m.&nbsp; Backers this time include the usual mix of VCs but also German publisher Bertelsmann.&nbsp; Sebastian Thrun believes &ldquo;these alliances will help grow Udacity as the premier industry education institution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MIT and Harvard famously released their <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/09/17/edx-revisits-open-source-license-for-mooc-building-component.aspx">edX source code</a> under an open source licence but they&rsquo;ve now announced that having one single licence doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;fit all purposes&rdquo;.&nbsp; Currently, developers are free to remix the code as long as their finished products are open as well, but edX is now relicensing XBlock (an API used to create interactive components in MOOCs) under an Apache 2.0 licence which allows users to choose whether to share their creations or keep them private.</p>
<p>I mentioned last month the arrival of EdCast &ndash; a new MOOC service provider built on top of Open edX code &ndash; which currently has 39 universities signed up, including Columbia University and Trinity College Dublin.&nbsp; EdCast has now announced additional funding of $6m to help it create &ldquo;a whole new concept&rdquo; which it refers to as <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/09/22/edcast-lands-6m-to-build-out-the-first-multiversities/">Multiversities</a>.&nbsp; According to CEO and founder Karl Mehta, &ldquo;Universities have to collaborate with each other and can&rsquo;t be walled off&rdquo; because students will be able to select the curriculum, teachers, and resources they need from a variety of institutions.</p>
<p>MIT is launching a series of four six-week &ldquo;<a href="http://mitopencourseware.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/mitx-launches-education-technology-course-series/">EdTechX</a>&rdquo; MOOCs covering ed tech, game and simulation design, development and evaluation.&nbsp; Students who successfully complete all four courses can obtain a verified edX XSeries Certificate to demonstrate their achievement.</p>
<p>Following its recent announcement of MOOCs specifically geared to high school students around the world, edX has now announced <a href="https://www.edx.org/professional-education">edX professional education courses</a>.&nbsp; There is an initial offering of 5 courses from Rice, MIT and Delft, starting with Economics of Cybersecurity which runs from 20 Jan 15.&nbsp; edX is also starting to enable partners to host courses &ldquo;on a <a href="https://www.edx.org/blog/edx-now-offers-professional-education-0">white-labelled site</a>, branded by the institution and powered by edX.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The University System of Georgia has begun to <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/09/15/university-system-of-georgia-launches-mooc-to-imagine-higher-eds-future.aspx">&ldquo;Invent the Beyond&rdquo;</a> with a MOOC-like collaboration comprising three interactive sessions that will enable participants to visualise what learning models will look like in 15 years and explore the factors critical to the success of students, faculty and post-secondary institutions.</p>
<p>And a relatively small survey my QuestionPro suggests that 82% of Millennials think they could have <a href="http://research.questionpro.com/online-vs-traditional-education">skipped college and taken MOOCs instead</a>.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC Analysis</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; Tony Bates; Penn Gazette</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are many MOOCs <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-mooc-where-everybody-learned/54571">only fit for those who are already well educated</a>?&nbsp; MIT researchers analysed data from an edX course on Newtonian Mechanics and found that students who had spent significant time on the course showed evidence of learning no matter what their educational background.&nbsp; The MOOC students also learned at a similar rate to those MIT students who had taken the on-campus version of the course &ndash; which included study in small groups for four hours a week and regular access to their professors.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2014/09/15/what-ubc-has-learned-about-doing-moocs/">University of British Columbia</a> has analysed the first 5 courses in its MOOC Pilot. A total of 330,150 learners signed up, 164,935 (50%) of whom logged in at least once, 12,031 (3.6%) took a final exam and 8,174 (2.5%) earned course certificate.&nbsp; Based on the figures provided by UBC, Tony Bates estimates production costs at around $54,000 per MOOC, excluding faculty time and co-ordination support, but including academic assistance. &nbsp;A total of 305 videos were produced, with a combined duration of 65 hours, and over 1,000 quiz questions.</p>
<p>U Penn has been offering MOOCs through Coursera for around 2 years, with over 2m learners registering.&nbsp; A recent study analysed the movement of 1m online pupils through <a href="http://thepenngazette.com/course-evaluation-mooc-edition/">16 Penn courses</a>, finding that persistence is a rare commodity. &nbsp;Completion rates averaged 4% across all the courses, although those with lighter workloads fared better at around 6%.&nbsp; However, variables such as course length and the availability of &ldquo;live chat&rdquo; made no statistically significant difference to retention.</p>

<p><strong>OU is Third Most &lsquo;Searched For&rsquo; University Worldwide</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC]</em></p>
<p>Google has published the most popular searches worldwide for people looking for universities.&nbsp; The University of Phoenix tops the listing, followed by MIT, but with the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29240959">Open University</a> in third place &ndash; making it also the top European search destination.&nbsp; The four other UK institutions in the Top-20 are LSE (8), UCL (12), Oxford (13) and Cambridge (16).&nbsp; The data show that the internet is becoming increasingly important in help students choose institutions and courses, and that those offering MOOCs and other online materials are growing in popularity.</p>

<p><em>[HEA]</em></p>
<p>The HEA has just released the findings of its sixth annual <a href="https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/about/news/10082">Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey</a>, based on responses from 67,580 participants across 100 HEIs.&nbsp; They find that 83% were satisfied with the quality of their course, 88% believed staff were good at explaining things and were enthusiastic (90%), but only 67% felt there was sufficient contact time.&nbsp; Flexible delivery is an important aspect of course choice for 47% of part-time students compared to just 10% of full-time students.&nbsp; Part-time/distance students were less positive about resources and services than full-time campus students, although STEM students were the most positive on this scale.</p>

<p><strong>There&rsquo;s a Skills Gap, But Not With Me</strong></p>

<p>A British Chambers of Commerce survey of 3,000 firms found <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29454002">nine out of 10 thought school leavers were not ready for employment</a>, and more than half said it was the same with graduates. &nbsp;Three-quarters of the companies surveyed put the situation down to a lack of work experience, and more than 50% said young people did not have even basic skills such as communication. &nbsp;Paradoxically, the chambers called for universal work experience in all secondary schools, although half admitted they did not offer work experience placements themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware Update</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; BBC]</em></p>
<p>A new report from Gartner predicts that four out of every 10 devices worn on the wrist will be <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/09/17/report-40-percent-of-wristworn-devices-will-be-smartwatches-by-2016.aspx">smartwatches</a> by 2016. &nbsp;Just two companies offered such devices a year ago, but that has now risen to seven.&nbsp; And, whilst early products, such as the Sony SmartWatch and Samsung Gear generated little enthusiasm from consumers &ldquo;due to their unclear value proposition and flawed design&rdquo;, the new Apple Watch is expected to trigger much more interest and uptake when it launches next year, despite its premium pricing.</p>
<p>However, smartwatch growth may be at the expense of <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/09/30/ipad-declines-as-samsung-lenovo-tablets-push-forward.aspx">tablet sales</a>, which ABI Research reports will slow to a &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo; 2.5% for 2014 and fail to hit the 200 million unit milestone.&nbsp; iPad sales have fallen by13% so far this year, although Samsung's tablet shipments have increased by 26% in the first half of 2014.</p>
<p>The BBC reports on the development of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29163842">Qelasy: Africa's first educational tablet</a>.&nbsp; Led by Thierry N'Doufou, a 36-year-old entrepreneur, the concept was to transfer a country's entire education curriculum onto a digital format, along with sounds, animations and interactivity, thus killing off the satchel crammed with school books. &nbsp;The Ivorian government introduced the tablets to 5,000 students in public schools last month, while some private schools in both Ivory Coast and Morocco will be running pilot projects.&nbsp; There has also been interest from Ukraine, Macedonia, Senegal, Nigeria and France.</p>

<p><strong>User Experience Design Sprint </strong></p>
<p><em>[User Focus]</em></p>
<p>You may have recently seen trailers on the BBC promoting its new <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iwonder">iWonder</a> website, but how was it designed and developed?&nbsp; Dan Ramsden, a BBC User Experience Architect, blogs about how his team adapted an approach from Google and conducted a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/posts/Design-Sprints-UXD">five-day design sprint</a>, taking them through five design stages: understand (define the problem and desired output), diverge (generate lots of ideas), converge (filter and focus on best ones), prototype and test.</p>
<p>Still on the subject of design, Philip Hodgson describes <a href="http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/conducting-an-effective-stakeholder-interview.html">how to conduct effective stakeholder interviews</a>.&nbsp; Although his focus is on defining the user experience, his message translates fairly readily into learning design, particularly if we wish to avoid this scenario: &ldquo;design teams &hellip; often end up simply designing what they are asked to design, or rolling out the usual &lsquo;one-size fits all&rsquo;. &nbsp;Project requirements arrive by decree from on high and go unchallenged.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Focus on &hellip; e-Reading</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; The Chronicle; Campus Technology; Publishers Weekly]</em></p>
<p>Defining an accurate student position on learning from print vs screen is fraught with danger.&nbsp; For start, &lsquo;on-screen&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean now what it used to (i.e. probably a vertical 17&rdquo; monitor placed a couple of feet away on a desk), and many of the headline facts and figures for e-books refer more to sequential reading of fiction than studying from textbooks.&nbsp; OU surveys tell us that around 95% of our students, &ldquo;enjoy learning through reading printed text&rdquo; but only around 50% &ldquo;enjoy learning through reading text online&rdquo;.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t ask the question but presumably those figures relate to &lsquo;dense&rsquo; text rather than reading shorter activities, quiz questions, forum posts, etc.&nbsp; We might also presume that those who love print also benefit occasionally being able to search or copy/paste from electronic text (but may not necessarily regard this as &ldquo;enjoyable&rdquo;).&nbsp; So, what other relevant evidence is there to help us assess the situation?</p>
<p>Stavanger University&rsquo;s Anne Mangen conducted a study comparing reading an &lsquo;upsetting&rsquo; short story on paper and on iPad, in which she found that paper readers reported higher measures of empathy and immersion than iPad readers. &nbsp;In a more recent study, 25 participants read a 28-page story on a Kindle, and 25 read the same story in print.&nbsp; They were then tested on aspects of the story including objects, characters and settings, revealing that performance was largely similar, except when it came to the timing of events in the story.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Kindle readers performed significantly worse on the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/19/readers-absorb-less-kindles-paper-study-plot-ereader-digitisation">plot reconstruction</a> measure, ie, when they were asked to place 14 events in the correct order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prof Naomi Baron bemoans <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/How-E-Reading-Threatens/147661/">a growing reluctance on the part of students to read long-form text in any format</a>, suggesting that e-readers and tablets have made matters worse &ndash; they may be fine for novels, but not for text we intend to &ldquo;muse over or reread&rdquo;.&nbsp; She surveyed university students in the US, Germany and Japan, finding that, if cost was not a factor, &ldquo;If a text is long, 92 percent would choose hard copy. For shorter texts, it&rsquo;s a toss-up.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is also the attendant distraction factor, with 85% of US students indicating they were likely to multitask when reading on-screen, compared to just 26% while reading in print (and there is evidence that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254?np=y">multitasking</a> &ldquo;poses a significant distraction&rdquo; to academic performance).</p>

<p>Xconomy reports that educational publishers are moving much more into <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2014/08/04/as-book-prices-drop-big-publishers-push-into-software-and-edtech/">interactive e-books</a> as potential sources of profit and Pew Internet research tells us that 37% of US adults aged 18-29 <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/09/10/younger-americans-and-public-libraries/">have read an e-book in the past year</a>.&nbsp; In a recent survey of 500 US students sponsored by e-book supplier <a href="http://www.vitalsource.com/pressreleases/Pages/Fourth-Annual-Wakefield-Survey-Cites-Cost-of-College-Technology-Innovation-as-Top-Trends-in-Higher-Education.aspx">Vital Source</a>, 62% stated that they have used interactive textbooks with features such as video, audio and quizzes, and 67% say their professors frequently recommend they purchase the e-text versions of textbooks and other course materials.&nbsp; The top benefit (31% of students) is that these make lessons easier to understand; 23% say they help them complete assignments more quickly and 21% believe they help them stay more organized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Textbook price comparison site CampusBooks found that nearly half of the 1,072 US undergraduates they surveyed had been assigned an e-textbook for a course. &nbsp;However, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/08/25/facebook-still-lures-students-and-etextbooks-dont-make-them-uniformly-happy.aspx">only 44% were very or somewhat happy</a> using an e-book, with 39% very or somewhat unhappy. The researchers noted that reported dissatisfaction with e-books appears to rise as students progress through school but, despite this, adoption also increases &ndash; probably for financial reasons.&nbsp; The survey also asked how students take notes in class. Around 90% use paper and 35% use a laptop, but only 9% append the textbook itself, possibly mindful of the potential textbook resale market in the US.&nbsp; But Mueller &amp; Oppenheimer caution against taking notes on laptops because it <a href="http://adifference.blogspot.ca/2014/09/are-laptops-really-bad-for-learning.html">results in shallower processing</a> due to a tendency to transcribe verbatim, whereas those students who took notes longhand tend to process information and reframe it in their own words &ndash; leading to better performance in conceptual question tests.</p>
<p>And, in a <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/63225-college-students-prefer-a-mix-of-print-and-digital-textbooks.html#path/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/63225-college-students-prefer-a-mix-of-print-and-digital-textbooks.html">Hewlett Packard</a> online survey of 527 college students, 57% said they preferred print materials to e-books when studying.&nbsp; When citing reasons for their preference, 54% cited &ldquo;ease of use&rdquo; and 35% &ldquo;note-taking ability&rdquo; as a reason for preferring print.&nbsp; Only 6% favoured e-books for their note-taking ability and 5% for their interactivity (which, we&rsquo;re often led to believe, is the holy grail of e-book design).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, regardless of preferences and opinions, what about actual learning effectiveness?&nbsp; In a recent study, <a href="http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.libezproxy.open.ac.uk/eds/detail/detail?vid=5&sid=480ac1d9-99bb-4cda-b195-b72645f87007@sessionmgr110&hid=106&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#db=psyh&AN=2013-27035-011">Margolin et al (2013)</a> invited ninety participants read five factual and five fiction 500-word passages of text.&nbsp; Thirty read from A4 paper, 30 used a Kindle and 30 read PDFs on a PC.&nbsp; All scored around 75% in MCQ comprehension tests, regardless of medium/device.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>[THE; The Chronicle; Audrey Watters; The Boston Globe; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>Stanford&rsquo;s Prof John Mitchell welcomes the impact that MOOCs have had on the world of education over the past couple of years but he fears <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/moocs-are-free-but-for-how-much-longer/2015204.article">they may not remain free for too much longer</a>.&nbsp; This is for obvious economic reasons relating to the costs of development and support, but also for practical ones such as abating high drop-out rates.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the issues we have with MOOCs is that it can be very difficult to set up successful group projects when people keep leaving the course,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe if there&rsquo;s payment or an application process or courses targeted at a particular community we will have less attrition and more cohesion in the group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how confident can we be that students will pay even modest fees?&nbsp; Australia&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.afr.com/p/national/education/une_shuts_down_its_loss_making_moocs_ZQoeYL6tucYL6h5TJTAXBI">University of New England</a> (UNE) has shut down its pioneering pay-for MOOC because it could not make it pay.&nbsp; Whilst the basic online courses were free, students were required to pay A$495 to do an exam, A$35 an hour for a group tutorial and A$150 an hour for private tutoring.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a very good experiment for us but it was an experiment,&rdquo; said vice-chancellor, Prof Annabelle Duncan.&nbsp; &ldquo;While MOOCs will continue to be offered I am sure by some of the very big providers around the world it&rsquo;s not something that a university like UNE would go at alone,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Sebastian Thrun solved Udacity&rsquo;s economic conundrum by &lsquo;selling out&rsquo;, whereas Coursera remains largely free apart from the $50 Signature Track fee students can pay to take verified exams and earn a certificate of completion.&nbsp; However, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2014/08/20/courseras-new-goal-teaching-at-firms-such-as-mastercard/">Coursera is now also embarking on paid partnerships</a> with organisations such as MasterCard, AT&amp;T and Shell, as they seek content for employee training and development.&nbsp; At MasterCard, for example, a course on web applications has been offered to 2,500 employees, whilst a behavioural economics class taught by Duke professor Dan Ariely has been offered to 300 marketing staff.</p>
<p>An interesting new take on dropout rates comes from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/10/coursera-president-daphne-koller-2014-is-the-year-moocs-will-come-of-age/">Coursera&rsquo;s Daphne Koller</a>, who claims that, of the people who actually aim to finish the course, 70% do so.&nbsp; In an interview at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference earlier this month, she also flagged a move towards more self-directed learning, and classes that have less rigid (and distant) start dates &ndash; Coursera has found that if a course starts within a week of a student enrolling, engagement doubles. &nbsp;And how do employers regard MOOCs?&nbsp; Koller noted that around 70% of students with a Coursera credential list it on their LinkedIn profile, and she believes that around 60-70% of employers would look at the credential of an applicant favourably.</p>

<p><strong>Majority of Scottish Academics Set to Vote &lsquo;No&rsquo;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Labour Proposes Technical Universities</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; Stephen Downes; edsurge; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>Shadow universities minister Liam Byrne is calling for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-28952647">technical universities</a> to be created as part of a blueprint to reshape the HE system to support a hi-tech, high-income economy.&nbsp; These would offer more options for young people than traditional degree courses; they would operate in partnership with industry and would support local enterprise zones.&nbsp; &ldquo;We've got to build a bigger knowledge economy, home to better-paid jobs and open to anyone with talent, no matter whether they want an academic or a technical path in life,&rdquo; said Mr Byrne.&nbsp; He called for there to be a &ldquo;variety of ladders&rdquo; into HE, including &ldquo;learn-while-you-earn&rdquo; courses which would allow people to upgrade their skills while still working.</p>
<p>The need for such an approach is supported by evidence from the Manpower Group, whose <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/08/employers-arent-just-whining-the-skills-gap-is-real/">Talent Shortage Survey</a> surveyed 38,000 employers worldwide, finding that 35% reported difficulty in filling jobs due to lack of suitable and available talent.&nbsp; McKinsey estimates that the number of skillsets needed in the workforce increased from 178 in Sep 09 to 924 in Jun 12 and the US National Center for Education Statistics projects that by 2020, <a href="http://www.christenseninstitute.org/publications/hire/">42% of all college students will be 25 years of age or older</a> as more working adults seek to develop new skills for the rapidly emerging new technologies and jobs.</p>

<p>Whereas the Chronicle&rsquo;s <a href="http://chronicle.com/section/Almanac-of-Higher-Education/801">Almanac of Higher Education 2014</a> is hidden behind their paywall, OECD&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2014_eag-2014-en#page1">Education at a Glance 2014</a> allows you to amble through all 570 pages and wallow in 100,000 figures, 300 tables and 150 charts relating to school and adult education policies, participants, activities and outcomes across 44 OECD and partner countries (or you could trot through a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/OECDEDU/education-at-a-glance-2014-key-findings">55-slide summary</a>).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s almost impossible to summarise here, but things are getting better: almost 40% of 25-34 year-olds now have some form of tertiary education, over 80% of those are in employment, and they&rsquo;re earning more than those who are less well qualified.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s now.&nbsp; What will e-learning look like in <a href="http://www.2elearning.com/insights/item/55646-e-learning-five-years-from-now">five years&rsquo; time</a>?&nbsp; Adobe&rsquo;s Roy Chowdhury speculates that there will no longer be a distinction between e-learning and learning, although the &lsquo;e&rsquo; will enable much better (and routine) measuring and tracking of the effectiveness of learning.&nbsp; M-learning will grow as better, cheaper devices with bigger screens will enable students to undertake learning activities and consume content that goes way beyond checking timetables, results and forum posts &ndash; and that learning will be seamless as users move between devices and locations.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on &hellip; Video for learning</strong></p>
<p>In my 2010 EdD research, e-learning participants (<em>n</em>=80) expected video material to be more appealing and effective than audio or text, but these expectations were not borne out by their test scores or opinions afterwards.&nbsp; Video can be expensive, so why does it sometimes not deliver what we expect?&nbsp; Whilst there are many differences between MOOCs and full-fat higher education, it seems reasonable to assume that student attitudes to video content will be similar in both.&nbsp; The recent publication of an analysis of <a href="http://pgbovine.net/publications/edX-MOOC-video-production-and-engagement_LAS-2014.pdf">How Video Production Affects Student Engagement</a> is based on data from over 6.9 million video watching sessions across four edX courses.&nbsp; The researchers focused on just two genres: &lsquo;tutorials&rsquo; (e.g. some form of problem-solving walkthrough) and &lsquo;lectures&rsquo;, and they defined engagement in terms of (a) time spent watching and also (b) &ldquo;whether a student attempted the follow-up problem within 30 minutes after watching a video&rdquo;.&nbsp; Key findings and recommendations to emerge were as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>.&nbsp; Shorter clips are generally better.&nbsp; Student levels of engagement are greatest for videos up to 3 mins duration and drop sharply after 6 mins.</li>
<li><strong>Re-watching</strong>.&nbsp; Students are likely to watch less (2-3 mins) of a tutorial video but are much more likely to re-watch and jump to relevant parts of longer clips, so signposting (hyperlinks or visual cues such as captions) is important.&nbsp; Because lectures often tend to present more conceptual information, students are more likely to watch for longer but less likely to re-watch.</li>
<li><strong>Personal</strong>.&nbsp; Many F2F academics prefer to make classroom lecture videos but students prefer a more intimate head to camera format with eye contact, some personal stories and gentle humour.</li>
<li><strong>Tutorial style</strong>.&nbsp; Khan-style videos, with the instructor drawing on a tablet and narrating, were found to be more engaging than screencasts or narrated PowerPoints.&nbsp; If these latter genres must be used, they can be enhanced by occasionally editing-in head shots of the speaker.</li>
<li><strong>Speaking rate</strong>.&nbsp; A speaking rate of around 160wpm is traditionally recommended for lecturing but, for clips up to 6 mins, students were equally engaged by faster rates (conveying academic enthusiasm) and slower ones (often due to writing on the board).&nbsp; However, for longer clips, &gt;180wpm was preferred, and 160wpm was actually found to be the <em>least</em> engaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare this with a smaller EDUCAUSE study of <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/what-makes-online-instructional-video-compelling">What Makes an Online Instructional Video Compelling</a>, which found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average view duration was 4 mins</li>
<li>Videos were more likely to be watched if the topic related to an upcoming assessment</li>
<li>Conversational language was preferred, as was humour and drawing on past experiences</li>
<li>Content should exploit the medium of video, not just convey information students could read as text</li>
<li>Good quality production values (e.g. sound, lighting, framing and graphics) imply credible pedagogic content</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://jolt.merlot.org/vol10no2/draus_0614.pdf">Draus, Curran and Trempus</a> (2014) examined the impact of instructor-generated video on student satisfaction (by survey), engagement (by forum posts) and performance (by scores and persistence) &ndash; having previously received feedback that bi-weekly narrated PowerPoints were "brief," "dry," and "not very helpful".&nbsp; Their pattern of a video course introduction, weekly video lectures, video discussions, and video advice on assignments and specific topics collectively resulted in a high degree of perceived value from students, grades increased by 3.2% and increases in the number and length of student discussion postings.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; TechCrunch; Campus Technology; The Chronicle; Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>Analysis by TechNavio, <a href="http://www.sandlerresearch.org/global-massive-open-online-courses-market-2014-2018.html">The Global Massive Open Online Courses Market 2014-2018</a> forecasts the global MOOC market will grow at a CAGR of 56.6% over the next five years.&nbsp; The report discusses the market segmentation based on student demographics and course preferences, as well as the market landscape and its growth prospects in the coming years. &nbsp;It also discusses key vendors and unpicks the revenue generation models they have adopted.</p>
<p>Google is offering a free course on Udacity &ndash; <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.ca/2014/07/learn-to-think-like-android-developer.html">Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals</a>.&nbsp; It aims to provide those with some basic programming knowledge with everything they need to learn how to make an Android app step-by-step, through a mixture of course materials, videos, quizzes and forums.&nbsp; The basics are available for free, whereas those subscribing at $150/month get additional support, projects and certification.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is expected to launch an <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/07/16/edx-partners-with-saudi-arabia-on-mooc-portal-women-youth-disabled-and-rural-citizens.aspx">edX Arab portal</a> next month that should, &ldquo;bridge the gap between education and employment&rdquo; across the region by providing women, youth, disabled people and those in rural communities with access to, &ldquo;courses licensed from edX university members and translated into Arabic, as well as original courses developed exclusively for Arabic-speaking students&rdquo;.&nbsp; The multi-year collaboration will also provide support to Saudi instructors and include &ldquo;a research component focused on learning through innovative technologies and R&amp;D,&rdquo; according to edX.</p>
<p>Speaking at last month&rsquo;s CT Conference, edX CEO, Anant Agarwal, said <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/07/31/edx-ceo-it-is-pathetic-that-the-education-system-has-not-changed-in-hundreds-of-years.aspx">it was &ldquo;pathetic&rdquo; that classrooms today still look like they did decades ago</a>.&nbsp; Despite oft-discussed issues such as retention rates, he firmly believed in the success and future potential of MOOCs, stating that edX offers, &ldquo;a federated, decentralized approach to spread education around the world&rdquo;.&nbsp; He also noted that the 155,000 students who participated in the first edX course on circuits and electronics exceeded the total number of alumni of MIT in history, and that the 7,200 who passed the course are more than the total number of students he will ever teach in his career at MIT.</p>
<p>The Chronicle reports on how a Coursera MOOC, &ldquo;Foundations of Teaching and Learning&rdquo;, has achieved success in <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/can-you-really-teach-a-mooc-in-a-refugee-camp/54191">teaching refugees near the Kenya-Somalia border</a>.&nbsp; Some adaptations were required &ndash; such as downloading lecture videos and quizzes to a USB drive &ndash; and the 2 students were closely supported by the University of Geneva&rsquo;s Prof Barbara Moser-Mercer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Meeting Coursera&rsquo;s requirements for a certificate made things harder, with the students taking quizzes that were monitored via webcam &ndash; a &ldquo;hugely complicated&rdquo; undertaking under the circumstances. &nbsp;There were cultural and linguistic challenges too, especially when it came to peer grading. &nbsp;Ms. Moser-Mercer texted back and forth with the students, but she said she was careful not to provide more help than she was allowed to under Coursera&rsquo;s honour code.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial News</strong></p>
<p><em>[nprEd;</em> <em>EdSurge]</em></p>
<p>Last month the US Dept of Education announced <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/07/16/331700270/students-react-to-the-closure-of-a-giant-for-profit-college">a review of how federal student aid is administered</a> for University of Phoenix&rsquo;s 200,000+ students.&nbsp; In June, the department halted funding to another big for-profit, Corinthian, leading it to announce plans to sell or close all of its campuses.&nbsp; Enrolment at US for-profit colleges quadrupled between 2000 and 2010, peaking at 1.7 million (about 1 in 10 college students) but the sector has been plagued by repeated allegations of financial mismanagement, fraud and abuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-25/pearson-first-half-sales-drop-6-5-percent-on-strength-of-pound.html">Pearson will be cutting about 4,000 jobs</a> over two years (around 10% of its workforce) after first-half revenue dropped to &pound;2.05bn from &pound;2.19bn a year earlier, in line with the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg, as the strength of the pound reduced revenue converted from US dollars and other currencies.&nbsp; The cuts will be partly offset by the creation of 1,800 jobs in the two-year period as the company expands digital and emerging-market operations.</p>
<p>Canadian e-learning giant <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-08-13-desire2learn-s-85-million-deal">Desire2Learn</a> has raised $85m in funding after what the company calls &ldquo;a year of record growth in the higher education, K-12 and corporate markets.&rdquo; &nbsp;CEO John Baker says the company currently serves 1,100 institutions and 15 million learners &ndash; up from 850 and 10 million, respectively, at this time last year. &nbsp;The company also recently opened offices in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Focusing on Specific Dropouts Can Help Raise Completion Rates</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>College <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/A-Focus-on-Specific-Dropouts/147955">dropouts</a> who came close to graduating but didn&rsquo;t quite finish could be a key target for HEIs, according to a report by the US National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.&nbsp; Instead of focusing only on helping new students succeed, colleges should also be targeting those who intended to earn degrees and finished at least two years of study before falling off track, it says.&nbsp; Chasing down former students can be expensive and time-consuming, but some may be relatively close to their final degree.</p>

<p><strong>Duke Offers e- and Audio-books</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>

<p><strong>Visualising the Internet</strong></p>
<p><em>[Go-Gulf; Social Times; TechCrunch; Campus Technology; Penny Stocks]</em></p>
<p>So, who&rsquo;s doing what on the internet, and how much are they doing it?</p>
<p>Firstly, Go-Gulf shows us <a href="http://www.go-gulf.ae/blog/what-people-share-on-social-networks/">what people share on social networks</a>.&nbsp; Most popular is photo sharing (by 43% of us), with videos someway behind (17%).&nbsp; Americans mostly share news video clips, Indians share movie trailers and Brits share travel, news and education clips.&nbsp; On Facebook alone, 4.75bn items are shared per day, with Turkey being the most sharing nation (93%), 25-34 the most sharing age group and men sharing more than women.</p>
<p><a href="http://socialtimes.com/social-media-facts-figures-stats-infographic_b200159">Digital Insights</a> cut the data cake differently, informing us that:</p>
<ul>
<li>84% of women and 50% of men stay active on Pinterest</li>
<li>75% of the engagement on a Facebook post happens within the first 5 hrs</li>
<li>44% of Twitter users have never sent a tweet</li>
<li>40% of YouTube traffic comes from mobile</li>
<li>23% of internet time is spent on blogs and social networks</li>
<li>400m snaps per day are sent on SnapChat</li>
<li>There are 39m students and recent graduates on LinkedIn</li>
</ul>
<p>According to comScore, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/11/snapchat-is-now-the-3-social-app-among-millennials">Snapchat is now the third most popular social app</a> among millennials, with a 32.9% penetration on the mobile phones of those aged 18&ndash;34.&nbsp; This puts it behind Instagram (43.1%) and Facebook (75.6%), but ahead of Twitter, Pinterest, Vine, Google+ and Tumblr.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone gets the same internet service.&nbsp; A free <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/07/23/aalto-unversity-helps-study-internet-quality-around-the-world.aspx">Netradar app</a> allows all of us to report our connectivity measurements, which are then displayed in terms of quality of download/upload speed, latency, and signal strength via an overlaid Google map.&nbsp; The app has already been installed more than 130,000 times, and the database contains about 3 million anonymised measurements.</p>
<p>And two excellent web pages from Pennystocks show <a href="http://pennystocks.la/internet-in-real-time/">how quickly internet data is generated</a> and how quickly those tech companies are <a href="http://pennystocks.la/battle-of-internet-giants/">generating revenue and profit</a> (about 50% of which goes to Apple). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Copyright law is complicated and OERs may not be as &lsquo;open&rsquo; as we think.&nbsp; Worse still is the different interpretation/application of the rules across Europe; for example 63% of EU/EEA nations allow academics to translate literary works for use in a teaching compilation, but 46% do not.&nbsp; <a href="http://oerpolicy.eu/oer-and-copyright-mapping-exempted-uses-in-europe/">OER and Copyright: mapping exempted uses in Europe</a> is a working paper that investigates and tries to define the fragmented European landscape of copyright exceptions and limitations for educational purposes, across 49 European states.</p>

<p><strong>Kenyatta Launches Digital &lsquo;Anywhere School&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; Paul Hoffman]</em></p>
<p>Kenya&rsquo;s Kenyatta University has become the first in East Africa with a digital school, offering a range of vocational certificates and degree courses through virtual and open learning.&nbsp; Each student will be issued with a free tablet, uploaded with all the course units registered for.&nbsp; Live tutorials will also be offered from the institution&rsquo;s 10 campuses across the country when the programmes commence in Sep.&nbsp; The &ldquo;<a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140716160151904">Anywhere School</a>&rdquo; is targeting adult learners and people unable to commit themselves to attending classes either as full-time or part-time students.&nbsp; Programmes will run on a trimester cycle which will enable students to complete an undergraduate course in three calendar years.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140815124144866">African Virtual University</a>, in partnership with the African Development Bank, is launching 29 new open, distance and e-learning centres in 21 African countries at a cost of approx $200,000.&nbsp; The first centre opened in Sudan on 11 Aug and all should all be installed in the next six to eight months.&nbsp; Despite steadily increasing admissions, Sub-Saharan Africa still has only around 6% of its population aged 25-34 in tertiary education, compared to around 60-70% in the UK and US.</p>

<p><strong>Distance Between IT and Campus Users</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>IT is a disjointed effort on most US campuses, according to a recent survey of 150+ HE IT staff.&nbsp; For example, in more than four out of five colleges and universities, IT professionals report that they <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/08/04/survey-it-and-academics-dont-work-together-much.aspx">do not regularly develop joint plans with academic departments for IT initiatives</a>.&nbsp; Nearly 60% don't survey academic or research staff on IT needs; and over 60% lack a catalogue of IT services &ndash; which might explain why 57% of end users view IT as the &ldquo;fix it&rdquo; folks and just 22% consider IT a &ldquo;trusted ally.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>[BBC; Campus Technology; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>China's Xiaomi has sold 57.4m smartphones since going into business three years ago and the company&rsquo;s new <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28416796">Mi 4 smartphone</a> matches or beats the spec of the iPhone 5 or Samsung S5.&nbsp; However, the Mi 4 costs just &pound;190 (16GB) or &pound;235 (64GB) and is paired with a &pound;7.50 wristband that can unlock the phone via Bluetooth, track activity and sleep, and act as an alarm clock.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/07/29/report-as-tablet-market-grows-smaller-vendors-make-inroads.aspx">global tablet market</a> grew by 11% in 2014 Q2 compared to the same period last year, according to new data from IDC.&nbsp; However, that represents a drop of 1.5% over Q1 which the analysts attribute to the &ldquo;the rise of large-screen smartphones and longer than anticipated ownership cycles&rdquo;.&nbsp; Apple continued to lead the market with 26.9% market share (13.3 million shipments), followed by Samsung with 17.2%.</p>
<p>A new report from Strategy Analytics shows <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/30/the-one-horse-race-android-represented-85-of-the-300m-smartphones-shipped-in-q2/">Android</a> accounting for 85% of the 295.2 million smartphones shipped in 2014 Q2, with Apple, Windows Phone and BlackBerry all losing market share.&nbsp; Meanwhile, IDC predicts that <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/08/05/report-smartphone-shipments-to-top-300-million-in-third-quarter.aspx">smartphone shipments in Q3</a> will top 300 million units.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on &hellip; Employability</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle; The Economist; New York Times; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>I speculated last month that students&rsquo; expectations suggest they might be yearning for some form of Technology Enhanced Polytechnic.&nbsp; Now news comes that <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/To-Fight-Unemployment-China/147217/">China intends to turn 600 of the country&rsquo;s general universities into polytechnics</a> to focus on applied knowledge and skills rather than over-academic, highly theoretical studies.&nbsp; Education vice-minister Lu Xin believes, &ldquo;There is an urgent need to reform our current education system, which has been struggling to provide high quality talents with skills and knowledge that meet demand at the production frontline&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Economist reports that, &ldquo;Around the world <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21605899-staid-higher-education-business-about-experience-welcome-earthquake-digital">demand for retraining and continuing education is soaring</a> among workers of all ages [...] In America, higher-education enrolment by students aged 35 or older rose by 314,000 in the 1990s, but by 899,000 in the 2000s.&rdquo;&nbsp; It believes campus-based degree courses &ndash; particularly those from &ldquo;middle tier institutions&rdquo; &ndash;are not well-suited to serve this growing and changing marketplace but that online education (MOOC or otherwise) can offer a viable solution.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.udacity.com/2014/06/announcing-nanodegrees-new-type-of.html">Udacity</a> reports that, &ldquo;McKinsey estimates there will be a shortfall of 85 million skilled jobs globally in 2020 driven by the rapid changes in technology. Students will need to acquire new skills and hone previously learned ones in time for their next job or strategic initiative to keep pace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence the announcement of a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/business/economy/udacity-att-nanodegree-offers-an-entry-level-approach-to-college.html?_r=1">NanoDegree</a> programme, developed by Udacity with $1.5m funding from AT&amp;T, designed to give learners, &ldquo;&hellip;compact, flexible, and job-focused credentials that are stackable throughout your career. &nbsp;And the NanoDegree program is designed for efficiency: select hands-on courses by industry, a capstone project, and career guidance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Learners pay $200 a month and, &ldquo;AT&amp;T will accept the NanoDegree as a credential for entry-level jobs (and is hoping to persuade other companies to accept it, too) and has reserved 100 internship slots for its graduates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the UK, the government persists with its target of 50% of school leavers entering university, with David Willetts asserting that, &ldquo;Graduates are the engines of our future growth&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, Ed Milliband last week called for the introduction of &lsquo;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-28197128">technical degrees</a>&rsquo; for those with more vocational aspirations, as part of a move to help drive a &ldquo;high-wage, high-skill, high-quality economy&rdquo;.&nbsp; He expects students to study whilst working and cited Germany as an example of how vocational qualifications can be given a high status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canada currently has an unemployment rate of 7% &ndash; similar to the UK (6.8%) &ndash; but a study from <a href="http://research.cibcwm.com/economic_public/download/feature1.pdf">CIBC</a> reports that, &ldquo;Large swaths of those unemployed are not what employers are seeking.&rdquo;&nbsp; Might competence based education (CBE) be the answer?&nbsp; A report from HEQCO, <a href="http://heqco.ca/SiteCollectionDocuments/CBE Report-ENG.pdf">Productivity Implications of a Shift to Competency-Based Education</a>, observes that, &ldquo;Compared to traditional models for the delivery of baccalaureate education, competency-based education is said to lead to better and faster acquisition of skills directly relevant to employment so that graduates are more job-ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, it urges caution because, based on its recent investigations, &ldquo;There is no systematic, comprehensive study indicating that the purported skills from a CBE program translate into performance, either in graduation results or in the labour market.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>[BBC; THE] &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28302487">Cabinet reshuffle</a>, Education Secretary Michael Gove is to become Chief Whip and will be replaced by Mrs Nicky Morgan, a former lawyer who has been a Treasury minister since 2013; she will also continue in her role as minister for women.&nbsp; David Willetts has resigned as Minister for Universities and Science, and education minister Liz Truss becomes Environment Secretary.</p>
<p>UCAS reports <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-28252308">UK university applications are up</a> by 4% over the same point last year, with slightly larger rises from applicants in Europe (5%) and non-EU nations (6%).&nbsp; However, the HE sector is still reeling from <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/home-office-student-visa-clampdown-rocks-sector/2014151.article">further clampdowns on visas</a>.&nbsp; Glyndwr University and another 57 private colleges have had their licences suspended and the University of Bedfordshire and the University of West London have also been prevented from taking any new international students.</p>
<p>The UK HE International Unit has warned that a <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140710070211366">British exit from the EU</a> would lose us access to an estimated &euro;1.2bn of research grants, plus the power to influence the European regulatory framework with an impact on research and higher education. &nbsp;PA Consulting&rsquo;s 2014 survey of UK university leaders, <a href="http://www.paconsulting.com/our-thinking/higher-education-report-2014/">Here Be Dragons</a>, warns that the prospect of withdrawing from the EU fills many British vice-chancellors with dread and is described as &lsquo;potentially disastrous&rsquo; for HE and the wider research community.</p>
<p>Expect fewer educational conferences and less research as a greatly slimmed down <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=2014288">HEA concentrates on just four priority areas</a>: improving curriculum design; promoting student engagement; exploring how to recruit and support more socially disadvantaged students; and promoting teaching excellence (more than 50,000 academics have become fellows of the HEA so far).</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Steve Rycroft; Ian Blackham; Pearson; Phil Hill; Wired Campus; Martin Weller; George Siemens; ALT; FutureLearn]</em></p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;the year of the MOOC&rsquo; well out of the way, the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Deke Kassabian considers <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/value-moocs-early-adopter-universities">the value of MOOCs to elite early adopter universities</a>, and the differences and overlaps between their goals and public perceptions.&nbsp; He concludes that, &ldquo;The exuberance of 2012 has faded, replaced by the skepticism of 2014, but at the early adopter universities, MOOCs appear poised to play an important role [&hellip;] with a strong value proposition: supporting the goal of improving on-campus teaching and learning while also promoting the university and its faculty.&nbsp; At the same time, the elite universities connect with the public through educational outreach, demonstrating leadership in an emerging higher education learning technology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The case of <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/07/08/massiveteaching-mystery-captivates-confuses#sthash.IY7kbCXN.dpbs">the disappearing MOOC</a> continues.&nbsp; The University of Zurich&rsquo;s &ldquo;Teaching Goes Massive: New Skills Required&rdquo; course was one week into its planned three-week run when the course materials were apparently deleted from Coursera by maths professor Paul-Olivier Dehaye.&nbsp; The university stated that this was part of Dehaye&rsquo;s &ldquo;pedagogical concept in order to get more students actively engage in the course forum&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, Dehaye wrote that his intention was to &ldquo;confuse everyone, including the university, [C]oursera, the Twitter world, as many journalists as I can, and the course participants. &nbsp;The goal being to attract publicity.... I want to show how [C]oursera tracks you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pearson&rsquo;s Amar Kumar considers whether MOOCs really are the magic bullet in opening access to education.&nbsp; He believes MOOCs offer a poor learner experience compared to on-campus offerings and that completely open entry fuels the 90%+ dropout rates we often see.&nbsp; Instead, he proposes a three tier model based on MOOCs for casual &ldquo;tourists&rdquo;, <a href="http://labs.pearson.com/will-soocs-eat-moocs-for-breakfast/">Selectively Open Online Courses</a> (SOOCs) for &ldquo;explorers&rdquo; with some proven competency or credential, and a campus offering for &ldquo;adventurers&rdquo; who need greater depth, collaboration and mentorship.</p>
<p>Diana Laurillard also asks, if MOOCs are not providing mass education for millions in emerging economies, or reducing student loan debt, or encouraging large numbers of unqualified or unemployed adults into education, then <a href="https://newsletter.alt.ac.uk/2014/06/what-is-the-problem-for-which-moocs-are-the-solution/">what is the problem for which MOOCs are the solution?</a>&nbsp; She concludes (as have many others) that all the data suggests MOOCs are mainly providing free university teaching for highly qualified professionals.</p>
<p>Google is giving Carnegie Mellon $300,000 in each of the next two years through the Google Focused Research Award program to focus on <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/google-will-finance-carnegie-mellons-mooc-research/53521">&ldquo;data driven&rdquo; approaches to research on MOOCs</a>, including &ldquo;techniques for automatically analyzing and providing feedback on student work&rdquo;.&nbsp; Google&rsquo;s goal is to develop platforms that are intelligent enough to mimic a traditional classroom experience.</p>
<p>Martin Weller believes <a href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2014/07/mooc-completion-rates-do-matter.html">MOOC completion rates do matter</a> but that we need to better understand why they sometimes disappoint, and he uses Stephen Downes&rsquo; analogy: &ldquo;no-one drops out of a newspaper, they just take what they want&rdquo;.&nbsp; He suggests that MOOCs might be more effective if they were designed more like newspapers rather than on a week-by-week basis (which we know currently means that &ldquo;90% of your registered learners are never even looking at 50% of your content&rdquo;).&nbsp; Interestingly, George Siemens reports that <a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2014/07/08/i-was-wrong/">corporate MOOCs</a>, with their different motivators, see completion rates in the 70-80% range.</p>

<p><strong>Characterising Online Learners</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Dropout&rdquo; is an unfortunate term in the MOOC lexicon.&nbsp; A study of MOOC engagement from Cornell and Stanford tracked the behaviour patterns of more than 300,000 Coursera students.&nbsp; From this, the authors devised a <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/study-of-moocs-suggests-dropping-the-label-dropout/53421">taxonomy of engagement</a> to differentiate between different types of participation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collectors</strong> primarily download lectures</li>
<li><strong>Viewers</strong> watch lectures, handing in few if any assignments</li>
<li><strong>Solvers</strong> hand in assignments for a grade, viewing few if any lectures</li>
<li><strong>All-Rounders</strong> balance the watching of lectures with the handing in of assignments</li>
<li><strong>Bystanders</strong> are registered for the course, but their total activity is below a very low threshold</li>
</ul>
<p>A survey of 2,500 high school and college students by the Boston Consulting Group identified <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/06/18/research-online-students-take-five-forms-each-calling-for-unique-offerings.aspx">five distinct types of students who take online courses</a>, based on their expectations for learning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Minds</strong> (30% of students surveyed) value the classroom experience, are the &ldquo;most satisfied&rdquo; with blended courses and don't consider online programs less credible than F2F education. &nbsp;They are receptive to virtual classrooms/whiteboards, searching learning resources and participating in online discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Experience Seekers</strong> (23%) believe that blended courses are &ldquo;generally effective&rdquo; and enable &ldquo;personalized learning&rdquo;.&nbsp; They want to achieve their degree by the most effective means and are open to game-based learning and simulations, collaboration and mobile learning.</li>
<li><strong>Money Mavens</strong> (17%) are the least satisfied with all of education and are more likely to believe that &ldquo;college is a waste of money&rdquo;.&nbsp; Many have taken blended courses and they are likely to be attracted by non-profits offering foundation degree programmes, career services and self-pacing.</li>
<li><strong>True Believers</strong> (15%) tend to be the most satisfied with online learning, they take more than 75% of their courses online or as a blend and they don't believe online degrees are &ldquo;inherently lower in quality&rdquo;.&nbsp; This segment should be fostered by bolstering the line-up of self-paced courses and career-advising services, improving credit transfer and offering the promise of faster degree completion.</li>
<li><strong>Online Rejecters</strong> (15%) have tried online courses and are &ldquo;skeptical of the quality, effectiveness and career outcomes of online education&rdquo;.&nbsp; They tend to be attracted by F2F offerings from non-profits, the quality of the faculty, &ldquo;exclusiveness of admissions&rdquo; and the positive aspects of campus life.</li>

<p><strong>The Future of US HE</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>A freely downloadable report from The Chronicle, <a href="http://results.chronicle.com/InnovativeUniversity2014">The Innovative University</a>, details how 350 US college presidents see the future.&nbsp; There is a general feeling that change is needed but the divergence of views is remarkable.&nbsp; For example: 60% believe US HE is heading in the right direction, 30% the wrong direction, but an astonishing 1 in 10 college presidents say that they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; (Fig 1).&nbsp; Some 67% believe massive or moderate disruption is required but 33% want just evolution or small changes (Fig 3).&nbsp; And as for OERs/MOOCs (Figs 8 &amp; 10) &ndash; they are clearly the work of the devil.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of Lifelong Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>The EU-funded <a href="http://www.bell-project.eu/cms/">Benefits of Lifelong Learning</a> (BeLL) project has just concluded, based on analysis 8,646 questionnaires and 82 interviews completed in ten European countries.&nbsp; BeLL focused on liberal adult education or non-vocational courses, characterised by voluntariness, self-motivation and goals related to hobbies, and investigated the changes experienced by adult learners over a period of 12 months.&nbsp; The study found that people involved in adult education activities become politically active, vote and are on the whole politically motivated, while adults aged between 50 and 71 will develop a higher level of self-confidence.&nbsp; They are also less at risk of adopting extremist attitudes and tend to develop more tolerant behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>Learner at the Centre of a Networked World</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>According to the Aspen Task Force&rsquo;s new <a href="http://aspeninstitute.fsmdev.com/documents/AspenReportFinalPagesRev.pdf">report on learning and the internet</a>, &ldquo;American students are falling farther behind their counterparts in other countries, which suggest that our 18th and 19th century model of education is not working as it should in the 21st century.&rdquo;&nbsp; The report goes on to highlight five essential principles and twenty-six action steps to achieve a new vision of learning.&nbsp; In summary: all learners should have access to, and be at the heart of, learning networks; those networks should be interoperable; students should be sufficiently information-literate, and their learning environment should be safe and trusted.</p>

<p><strong>Essay Fraud</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Mirror; ALT]</em></p>
<p>A Mirror investigation suggests that up to 100,000 students a year pay <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/watch-dodgy-firms-offer-ready-written-3782199#ixzz36Nv32uzl">essay-writing companies</a> to produce bespoke assignments, with one leading firm claiming to have produced &ldquo;nearly five million words&rdquo; for students in the current academic year.&nbsp; A mirror reporter was offered a 10,000-word masters dissertation on international relations for &pound;2,000 and undergraduate politics essays for &pound;85 per 1,000 words.&nbsp; A study by Birmingham City University found there had been more than 19,000 attempts at cheating by UK students since 2005.</p>
<p>A paper in the latest issue of JOLT scores more highly than the Mirror for academic rigour, although it is notably thin on evidence gathered from shady meetings in BMWs.&nbsp; Prof David Ison compared <a href="http://jolt.merlot.org/vol10no2/ison_0614.pdf">184 doctoral dissertations</a> submitted to traditional HEIs between 2009-2013 against 184 submitted to online institutions.&nbsp; Analysis using Turnitin revealed no significant difference between the originality indices of either batch, although more than half of all dissertations contained some level of plagiarism.&nbsp; Whilst basic plagiarism was slightly more prevalent at online institutions, the more extreme examples were found amongst bricks and mortar.</p>

<p>ABI Research reports a <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/06/23/tablet-shipments-fall-off-30-but-growth-expected-to-resume.aspx">30% decline in tablet shipments</a> in 2014 Q1 compared with 2013 Q1, although it expects growth to pick up. &nbsp;Samsung and Apple are expected to share about 70% of the estimated $85bn marketplace this year, with iPad remaining the No 1 device but Android combined having the larger worldwide user base by the end of 2014.</p>
<p>ABI has also been looking at the <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/07/01/report-wearables-dominated-by-activity-trackers-as-smart-watches-tick-down.aspx">wearables marketplace</a> where, in 2014 Q1, nearly 3 million devices were shipped.&nbsp; Of those, 2.35m were fitness trackers (with Fitbit, Garmin, Nike and Jawbone top sellers) and just 510,000 were smart watches (Samsung, Sony, Pebble, Casio).&nbsp; ABI forecast shipments of about 17m wearables this year, including 10m fitness trackers and 7m smart watches.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see how things go once Google and Apple kick into gear.</p>

<p>Towards Maturity&rsquo;s <a href="http://towardsmaturity.org/article/2014/06/16/towards-maturity-mobile-learning-work-2014/">Mobile Learning at Work</a> report is based on research derived from the TM 2013 Benchmark Study using responses received from 481 organisations in 44 countries.&nbsp; The survey found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>71% of respondents are using mobile devices (up from 36% in 2010 and 47% in 2012)</li>
<li>52% of organisations provide learners with smartphones</li>
<li>48% provide learners with tablets</li>

<p><strong>Focus on&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>This digest has only ever aimed to present a brief synopsis of each item, on the assumption that those who are interested will follow the hyperlink and investigate further for themselves.&nbsp; However, I have been asked to try and pick out some information of direct relevance to the OU each month and present a little more detail.&nbsp; So here goes.</p>
<p>As an organisation, we strive to better understand what our students like, need and expect from us in the shorter and longer term, and we are investing much more effort in conducting surveys and analysing data from various sources to try and build that picture.&nbsp; But we can&rsquo;t ask every survey question, nor can we fully understand what it really means if a student spends 7&frac12; mins on a VLE page, so relevant external studies can often help to provide additional useful guidance and evidence for us.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.laureate.net/AboutLaureate/University-of-the-Future">2014 Global Survey of Students</a> is a report commissioned by Laureate Education which analysed opinions from 21,000 students at 37 Laureate institutions in 21 countries on what universities of the future would look like.&nbsp; The key outcomes were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessible</strong>.&nbsp; Some 43% of students expect all content to be free for most university courses and 59% expect courses, &ldquo;will utilize social media to learn and teach skills to other students&rdquo;.&nbsp; One in three thinks a majority of classes, &ldquo;will be taught online instead of in a traditional classroom&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible</strong>.&nbsp; 52% expect, &ldquo;a majority of classes will be provided all day and night&rdquo; and 42% expect to be able to study in certificate-sized chunks throughout their academic career, rather than a concentrated few years leading to a degree.&nbsp; 64% also think courses will be taught simultaneously in multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Innovative</strong>.&nbsp; 54% expect a high degree of collaboration and group projects, with 43% hoping to receive, &ldquo;personalised tutoring and instruction by professors online, not in person&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Job-focused</strong>.&nbsp; Students expect courses to be job-focused, 61% expect most of these to have been designed by &lsquo;industrial experts&rsquo; (whereas only 26% foresee content being designed by other students) and 71% expect courses to, &ldquo;teach students career-oriented skills&rdquo; in additional to subject matter.&nbsp; They expect that employers will place a higher value on internships (55%), teamwork (53%) and workplace skills (48%) over pure academic performance (39%).</li>
</ul>
<p>There is considerable overlap between this report and the outcomes of Belinda&rsquo;s recent &lsquo;Learning Now - For the Future&rsquo; workshops, which included inputs from some of our own students.&nbsp; But perhaps that shouldn&rsquo;t surprise us because most of these things are quite reasonable expectations from busy students who want to acquire workplace-relevant knowledge and skills as efficiently as possible.&nbsp; It almost seems as if many are yearning for a Technology Enhanced Polytechnic?</p>
<p>Also noteworthy is a pragmatic attitude to technologies as there appears to be no great clamour for lots of interactive or multimedia bells and whistles.&nbsp; For those of Generation Y, technology is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; or &lsquo;special&rsquo; &ndash; it is simply part of what they do and what they use as part of their everyday lives.&nbsp; I recall a session at an Online Educa conference a few years ago in which delegates were able to quiz half a dozen high school students on their attitudes towards e-learning.&nbsp; The questions flowed and there was polite bemusement from the students. &nbsp;We eventually established that they routinely used e-learning and social media on a regular basis, but they never referred to them in those terms and simply couldn&rsquo;t understand what all the fuss was about on our part.</p>
<p>Further corroboration of a need for flexibility and an employment focus comes from two sources.&nbsp; Firstly, a Guardian report of a recent HEA roundtable discussion (which included our own Musa Mihsein) on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/jun/10/flexible-study-future-for-universities">Conditions of Flexibility</a> in HE, in which participants all seemed to accept the need for greater flexibility and workplace relevance.&nbsp; Several examples of current flexible practices are described and the impact of MOOCs, analytics, student attitudes to technology and QAA considerations were all discussed.&nbsp; Secondly, an article on the UA site of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada considers the merits of <a href="http://www.universityaffairs.ca/competency-based-degree-programs-are-growing-in-the-us.aspx">Competence Based Education</a> (CBE), citing examples of flexible, employment-focused programmes in North America.&nbsp; Athabasca&rsquo;s Dr Dianne Conrad believes &ldquo;CBE opens pathways to quicker and cheaper learning for students,&rdquo; but also suspects the reason why it hasn&rsquo;t been embraced by traditional Canadian universities (and some US ones as well) is because &ldquo;it smacks too much of training&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.qualt.com/">Qualt</a> is a new MOOC service with a difference.&nbsp; Firstly, it is a mobile-only service, with content and services made available through a free app.&nbsp; Secondly, all available courses cover a professional subject and are backed by a recognised industry body.&nbsp; An obvious downside is the size of some mobile device screens, which has always limited some types of learning activities and content &ndash; but the other benefits may outweigh this, particularly for tablet owners.</p>
<p>Andrew Kelly&rsquo;s Bellwether report: <a href="http://bellwethereducation.org/policymakers_guide_to_moocs">Disruptor, Distracter, or What?</a> provides a thorough, readable and well-referenced assessment of where we are with MOOCs and where things could be heading. He notes that, &ldquo;MOOCs are neither the cataclysmic disruptor that advocates predicted nor the flash in pan their critics were hoping for&rdquo;.&nbsp; He is also neither surprised nor concerned when MOOCs do not appear to completely solve a problem: &ldquo;MOOCs are a tool, not a solution.&nbsp; And like any tool, they are likely to be more useful for some jobs than for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to David Willetts, a mismatch between the content of university courses and the skills demanded by employers could lead to <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/employers-could-turn-to-bespoke-moocs-willetts-says/2013465.article">companies setting up their own MOOCs</a> and bypassing universities.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once a significant number of employers say &lsquo;we will take evidence that you have done this course as the basis for giving you an interview&rsquo;, some of the more formal accrediting processes within education can be bypassed,&rdquo; he said last month, predicting &rdquo;&hellip;the rise of the de facto accredited MOOC&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A new EC report based on a survey of about 3,000 people, including 731 students, said that only one student in four was not familiar with MOOCs and that about 64% of respondents had taken such courses.&nbsp; Most employers surveyed said <a href="http://www.openeducationeuropa.eu/node/142833">MOOCs could help close a skills gap in web design</a>, but only 56 MOOCs teach such skills throughout Europe, compared with 115 in the United States.&nbsp; For the most part, respondents rated MOOCs as more effective than colleges in teaching such skills.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC Analysis</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes; Harvard Business Review; Wired Campus; Campus Technology] </em></p>
<p>A new report from Columbia University, <a href="http://cbcse.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MOOCs_Expectations_and_Reality.pdf">MOOCs: Expectations and Reality</a>, is based on interviews with administrators, faculty members, researchers, and others from 62 different US institutions. &nbsp;The report contains a number of case studies and &ldquo;&hellip;investigates the actual goals of institutions creating MOOCs or integrating them into their programs, and reviews the current evidence regarding whether and how these goals are being achieved, and at what cost.&rdquo;&nbsp; The researchers conclude that MOOCs could potentially affect HE by offering participants credentials of economic value, and by catalysing the development of adaptive learning experiences.</p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania has analysed data from over 875,000 students enrolled in nine MOOCs offered by its <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/moocs-wont-replace-business-schools-theyll-diversify-them/">Wharton business school</a>, concluding that MOOCs do not threaten its traditional MBA or executive education market but they do reach at least three new and valuable student populations.&nbsp; For example, 78% of MOOC students came from outside the US and nearly half of these were from developing countries.&nbsp; MOOCs also attracted greater proportions of unemployed adults and underrepresented minorities than traditional MBAs.&nbsp; There remain concerns over completion rates and the researchers note that those who persist tend to be disproportionately male, well educated, employed, and from OECD countries.</p>
<p>Harvard and MIT have released <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/mit-and-harvard-release-de-identified-learning-data-open-online-courses">de-identified learning data</a> from the 16 HarvardX and MITx courses offered in 2012-13 that formed the basis of the first HarvardX and MITx <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/mit-and-harvard-release-working-papers-on-open-online-courses-0121">working papers released in Jan</a> and the open-source interactive <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/mitx-and-harvardx-release-mooc-datasets-and-vizualization-tools">visualization tools released in Feb</a>.&nbsp; However, Phil Hill suggests that the data are not as useful as we might have hoped, and that lessons can be learned from the analytics approach being taken by <a href="http://mfeldstein.com/harvard-mit-learn-university-phoenix-analytics/">Apollo/Phoenix</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/vpol/vpol-files/2013_Report/Stanford_Online_2013_In_Review.pdf">Stanford Online: 2013 in Review</a>, 1.9 million people have registered for one or more of the 246 online/blended courses on either Coursera, NovoEd or Stanford OpenEdX since autumn 2012 and four million hours of instruction have been delivered.&nbsp; Greatest participation was from 21-25 year-olds, 73% of enrolees were male (although women very more prevalent in older age bands) and most were well-qualified with a bachelors degree (33%), masters (40%) or PhD (12%).&nbsp; Around 40% of students spend 1-20 mins studying each week, 29% spend 20-60 mins and 32% exceed an hour.</p>

<p><strong>Part-Time Student Numbers Tumble in England</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; The Telegraph; BBC]</em></p>
<p>Ten years ago, 47% of all entrants to HE in England were on part-time courses.&nbsp; Today, that figure is down to 31%, with the biggest fall in undergraduate courses according to a new HEFCE report, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140523125614333">Pressure From All Sides: Economic and policy influences on part-time higher education</a>.&nbsp; UWN reports that, &ldquo;Some of the best-known providers have international reputations, such as The Open University, with 168,215 students when last counted by the UK Higher Education Statistics Agency, or HESA, in 2012-13.&nbsp; That figure sounds enormous, but it was down from 208,710 the year before.&nbsp; Birkbeck College &hellip; saw overall student numbers drop from 19,580 in 2011-12 to 16,460 in 2012-13 despite introducing new intensive evening courses, which enable students to gain a first degree in three years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>UCAS figures show that conventional <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/10863107/University-applications-soar-by-20000-in-12-months.html">university applications are up by more than 20,000 (4%)</a> to 634,600 by the end of May, compared to this time last year.&nbsp; This has partly been fuelled by rising demand from foreign students, with overseas applications up by more than 6%.</p>
<p>There is also evidence that students are starting to realise that they are (highly) paying customers, with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-27640303">more than 20,000 student complaints</a> being made last year.&nbsp; Responses from 120 universities across the UK revealed that total academic appeals and complaints were 10% higher in 2012-13 than in 2010-11 and that more than &pound;2m has been paid out in compensation.</p>
<p>But a new HEPI/HEA survey of 15,000 students shows that <a href="http://universitybusiness.co.uk/News/major_student_survey_shows_key_insights">86% are 'satisfied' with their course</a>, although 31% would have chosen another course if they were to have their time again.&nbsp; At Scottish institutions, 70% of undergraduates believe their (free) courses represent good value for money, compared with only 41% in England.</p>
<p>And is it all worth it?&nbsp; The ONS reports that one British person in five who receives university degree <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/10834895/One-in-five-university-graduates-become-millionaires.html">becomes a millionaire</a>.&nbsp; And the average 2:1 graduate is estimated to pay <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-27763112">more than &pound;200,000 extra in taxes</a> to the government over their lifetime.</p>

<p><strong>Reclaiming Innovation</strong></p>

<p>Jim Groom and Brian Lamb believe, &ldquo;If any concept should be seen as an uncomplicated good thing in higher education, it's innovation.&nbsp; Defined by a common-sense notion of &lsquo;doing things better&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; But they also note that, currently, &ldquo;innovation is increasingly conflated with hype, disruption for disruption's sake, and outsourcing laced with a dose of austerity-driven downsizing.&nbsp; Call it <a href="http://www.educause.edu/visuals/shared/er/extras/2014/ReclaimingInnovation/default.html">innovation fatigue</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp; They then go on to consider what&rsquo;s gone wrong, what part LMS/VLEs, MOOCs, Openness and disruption (&ldquo;it's difficult to see the value in disruption for its own sake&rdquo;) may have played in this, and what we can do to get things back on track.&nbsp; The discussion is good (including references to Martin Weller and Tony Hirst), as are the video clips and supporting case studies.</p>

<ul>
<li>90% of US adults aged 25-29 had a high school diploma and 34% had a bachelor&rsquo;s or higher degree</li>
<li>Median earnings were higher for those with higher levels of education</li>
<li>Around 87% of students at non-profit colleges were under the age of 25 but this was much lower (29%) at for-profit colleges</li>
<li>Only around 60% of those who began their degree in autumn 2006 had completed it by 2012</li>
<li>In 2012, the US awarded over 1.8m bachelor&rsquo;s degrees, and 750k master&rsquo;s degrees</li>

<p><strong>Should Universities Ditch Lectures?</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Guardian; The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>According to Diana Laurillard, &ldquo;Intelligent people leave their brains behind when it comes to technology&rdquo; and so Donald Clark suggests <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/may/15/ten-reasons-we-should-ditch-university-lectures">10 reasons why universities should ditch lectures</a>.&nbsp; Sounds good, but it transpires that he only wants to cull one-off F2F lectures by recording them.&nbsp; Okay, so that provides a convenient location and timing (reasons 8 &amp; 9), plus a means of pausing the lecture (4), but it does nothing to improve the length (1), amount of detail (7) and skills of the presenter (10), nor does it enhance student engagement through participation (2).&nbsp; Add some new factors such as dodgy sound, lighting and camerawork into the mix and I remain unconvinced.&nbsp; Technology offers tremendous potential to improve teaching and learning, but I&rsquo;m afraid recorded lectures don&rsquo;t get my vote.</p>
<p>Prof Alex Small takes a contrary position.&nbsp; He uses <a href="http://m.chronicle.com/article/In-Defense-of-the-Lecture/146797/">lectures as part of a broader mix of activities and techniques</a>, and believes that a well-constructed and well-delivered lecture, &ldquo;is engaging, it naturally invites discussion and dialogue, it operates at a level much higher than raw information delivery, it is a natural setting for the expert to act as a role model, and it can be integrated with more formal activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>[Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>Edutechnica has published usage data for <a href="http://edutechnica.com/2014/05/26/lms-by-the-numbers-spring-2014-updates/">LMS/VLEs by US HEIs</a> with &gt;1000 FTEs.&nbsp; Blackboard is way ahead with adoption (35.8% of institutions) and enrolments (7.62m) but Moodle comes in a clear second (19.7% and 2.82m users), with most users still running Ver 2.5.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Wired Campus; Campus Technology; GEDB; Stephen Downes; Audrey Watters; Taylor &amp; Francis; ALT]</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;Udacity will no longer give learners the opportunity to earn free, &lsquo;non-identity-verified&rsquo; certificates, although access to course materials will remain free.&nbsp; &ldquo;Discontinuing the &lsquo;free&rsquo; certificates has been one of the most difficult decisions we&rsquo;ve made,&rdquo; wrote Sebastian Thrun. &ldquo;We know that many of our hardworking students can&rsquo;t afford to pay for classes.&nbsp; At the same time, we cannot hope that our certificates will ever carry great value if we don&rsquo;t make this change.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/udacity-will-no-longer-offer-free-certificates/51757">Udacity is developing premium courses costing $150 per month</a> which include contact with human coaches, project-based assignments, and job-placement services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Not only have 26,000 learners signed-up for Michigan Prof Chuck Severance&rsquo;s <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/04/17/u-michigan-prof-open-sources-mooc-teaching-materials.aspx">Programming for Everybody</a> Coursera MOOC but he&rsquo;s also made all of the learning materials available to participants who may want to turn around and teach the subject themselves.&nbsp; These are provided under a Creative Commons license via the Open Michigan site and include syllabus, lecture videos, software and the course textbook, Python for Informatics, authored by Severance himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A study of around 400 MOOC students by Glasgow Caledonian University found that <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/passive-mooc-students-dont-retain-new-knowledge-study-finds/52295">many took a passive approach to learning</a>, avoiding collaboration with others, seeking only passing grades, and therefore not retaining new knowledge.&nbsp; &ldquo;Learners focused on activities such as watching videos and taking tests, with little evidence of learners&rsquo; relating new knowledge into practice, or connecting to their peers through the discussion board,&rdquo; said research fellow, Colin Milligan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;And, given his belief that written words, &ldquo;will create forgetfulness in learners&rsquo; souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves&rdquo;, Slate considers <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/05/socrates_moocs_a_brief_history_of_technology_and_education.single.html">what Socrates would make of MOOCs</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The EU has launched EMMA, <a href="http://openeducationeuropa.eu/en/project/emma-0">a European MOOC aggregator</a>, that will provide a system for the delivery of free, open, online courses in multiple languages from different European universities, &ldquo;to help preserve Europe&rsquo;s rich cultural, educational and linguistic heritage and to promote real cross-cultural and multi-lingual learning.&rdquo;&nbsp; The service will aggregate and host courses provided by EU universities and allow users create their own learning paths by bringing together various units from different MOOCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Coursera is establishing a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/about/translate">Global Translator Community</a>, &ldquo;to make great educational content accessible across geographic and linguistic boundaries&rdquo;.&nbsp; The company currently offers courses with subtitle translations in 13 foreign languages, with Chinese, French, and Spanish among the most popular.&nbsp; Only 40% of Coursera learners live in English-speaking countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;edX has selected the <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/04/29/edx-implementing-vital-source-etextbook-platform.aspx">VitalSource Bookshelf</a> to distribute publisher content for its MOOCs, allowing learners and educators to interact with content and share notes and highlights with online peers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;edX is also teaming with <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/04/17/edx-taps-coursetalk-for-online-course-reviews.aspx">CourseTalk</a> to provide a platform for course reviews.&nbsp; A sidebar will contain mini-reviews on each course description page but users can click-through to CourseTalk.com to read more detailed comments and ratings of course quality, difficulty, workload and general thoughts about the course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Routledge is offering the Library community free access to a collection of articles highlighting <a href="http://explore.tandfonline.com/content/bes/moocsandlibraries">MOOCs and librarianship</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Commercial News</strong></p>
<p><em>[edSurge; THE; Audrey Watters; TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;French-owned <a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-110652.html">CrossKnowledge</a> has been acquired by John Wiley &amp; Sons for $175 million.&nbsp; The company offers subscription-based online learning solutions for enterprise and postsecondary schools, which include over 17,000 courses and course management tools for instructors and students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The UK&rsquo;s first for-profit university, <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/for-profit-universitys-first-accounts-reveal-premier-league-sized-debt/2012992.article">the University of Law</a>, appears to have had its accounts loaded with the &pound;177m debt that a private equity firm took on to buy it, in much the same way as often happens with Premier League football clubs.&nbsp; It is now owned by a parent company registered in Guernsey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2014/05/pearson_wins_major_contract_from_common-core_testing_consortium.html">Pearson</a> has won a contract to develop and administer Common Core tests for potential US college entrants.&nbsp; Those states in PARCC partnership who will use the service collectively educate about 15 million students. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s a lot of $24 per test fees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Online skills-based learning supplier, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/08/udemy-series-c/" target="_blank">Udemy</a>, has raised $32 million in a funding round led by Norwest Venture Partners.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Education Post-2015</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News; Towards Maturity; EdSurge; </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;A UNESCO Position Paper on <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140508162141672">Education Post-2015</a> suggests that unequal access to HE is likely to persist in most countries globally despite concerted attempts to expand opportunities by 2030.&nbsp; It also warns that the problem will not be limited to scarcity of places but that there is also likely to be a knowledge divide caused by lack of chances to acquire skills in technology.&nbsp; The authors note that the quality of schooling in many countries continues to suffer from limited learning resources, teacher shortages, teacher absenteeism, and distance and safety travelling to and from school &ndash; leading to high drop-out rates, especially among girls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Towards Maturity does a good job investigating and supporting those using learning technologies in the workplace.&nbsp; Their latest benchmark report, <a href="http://www.towardsmaturity.org/article/2014/04/09/towards-maturity-learner-voice-part-1/">The Learner Voice</a>, provides evidence from over 2,000 UK private sector e-learners.&nbsp; Although directed at workplace learning, it&rsquo;s a fairly compact and readable report that does also have some relevance for the potential design of OU material for adult learners.&nbsp; Some highlights: 88% of learners like to proceed at their own pace; 86% believe collaborative learning is essential or very useful; and 64% would recommend online learning as a result of their own experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In a similar vein, the Gates Foundation has just released the results of a survey into <a href="http://collegeready.gatesfoundation.org/Innovation/InnovationContent/TeachersKnowBest">what those in the K-12 sector want and need from digital instructional tools</a>.&nbsp; A total of 3100 teachers and 1250 students were questioned, revealing that only 54% of teachers believe that the digital tools their students use are effective.&nbsp; For example, according to Chicago teacher Arelys Villeda, &ldquo;I realize that I haven&rsquo;t found a single edtech tool that helps my students communicate with each other and develop communications skills&rdquo;.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>How Long Should Web Content Be?</strong></p>
<p><em>[TNW]</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;Kevan Lee provides advice on <a href="http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2014/04/06/ideal-length-everything-internet/">the optimum length for different forms of web content</a>, from tweets, through blog posts to videos.&nbsp; Whilst he doesn&rsquo;t look specifically at content for learning, his findings and some of his sources of evidence may provide some useful rules of thumb.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>The Learning Designer</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://learningdesigner.org/">Learning Designer</a>, from the London Knowledge Lab (Diana Laurillard and others), is a suite of tools that, &ldquo;enables teachers to share their good teaching ideas.&nbsp; It is intended to help a subject teacher see how a particular pedagogic approach can be migrated successfully across different topics.&nbsp; There are sample patterns to browse and edit, or you can design your own from scratch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Educational Technology Action Group Consultation</strong></p>
<p><em>[ALT; Education Technology]</em></p>
<p>Would you like to help shape policy for learning technology in education in 2025?&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.heppell.net/etag/contributions.html">Education Technology Action Group</a> (ETAG) would like your input (by 23 Jun) to help, &ldquo;evolve policies that are heading in the right direction, are affordable, achievable and realistic, but at the same time brave and ambitious (our remit), and that might get English education to a likely 2025 but by perhaps 2020.&nbsp; Disruptive and radical thoughts are welcome.&nbsp; We also need your input on specific past policies which have stood in the way of that progress towards 2025.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Sir Richard Branson is inviting children in 20,000 UK schools to share how technology is supporting their learning.&nbsp; <a href="http://edtechnology.co.uk/News/virgin_gives_pupils_voice_in_ed_tech">Generation Tech</a> &ndash; launched this month by Virgin Media Business &ndash; is calling for submissions from pupils and teachers across the country to answer &lsquo;the Big Digital Question&rsquo;: how schools today are embracing the 21st century classroom and how it can continue to enhance learning tomorrow.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Funding for Technology-Based Learning Studies </strong></p>
<p><em>[ALT]</em></p>
<p>The Technology Strategy Board and the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills are to invest up to &pound;1.1m in <a href="https://www.innovateuk.org/competition-display-page/-/asset_publisher/RqEt2AKmEBhi/content/learning-technologies-design-for-impact?p_p_auth=tzK5Owj7">exploratory studies into the design of technology-based products</a> and services that will improve learning outcomes.&nbsp; Proposals are invited for projects up to &pound;80k/6 months to deliver high-quality commercially viable products and services that can be delivered at scale and aimed at formal or non-formal learning from KS1 through to HE.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>What Enhanced eBooks can do for Scholarly Authors</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Chronicle]</em></p>
<p>Jacob Wright doesn&rsquo;t beat around the bush.&nbsp; &ldquo;For scholars in the humanities, <a href="http://m.chronicle.com/article/What-Enhanced-E-Books-Can-Do/145969/">the &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; e-book format is a game changer</a>.&nbsp; A fully enhanced e-book can do the work of two or more traditional print volumes: Authors can address the general reading public and lower-level students in the main body of the text, while treating technical matters for advanced readers in more detail by providing electronic links to extensive pullout or pop-up windows.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Universities Failing to Exploit Social Media</strong></p>
<p><em>[edSurge; University World News]</em></p>
<p>Out of the <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-04-30-twitter-exec-reports-that-educators-dominate-the-twitter-sphere/">&frac12; billion tweets posted every day, 4.2 million are related to education</a>, according to Twitter&rsquo;s Brett Baker.</p>
<p>However, none of the UK&rsquo;s 10 top-ranked universities &ldquo;is sending out more than four tweets a day, let alone directly engaging with their followers&rdquo;, despite having a combined total of more than 400,000 followers on Twitter, according to a study conducted by Brandwatch between 31 Jan&ndash;31 Mar to ascertain what leading universities are using their primary Twitter handle for and <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140417142829783">how successfully they engage their followers</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Office Mix &amp; Adobe Voice</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Microsoft is releasing <a href="https://mix.office.com/">Office Mix</a> as part of Office 365 ProPlus.&nbsp; This enhances PowerPoint to allow users to create rich media presentations and interactive lessons, share them online and view analytics.&nbsp; A plugin gives educators the ability to record lecture materials directly within PowerPoint and embed these, together with tests and quizzes (with customisable instant feedback), onscreen annotations, polls and user controls for pausing and rewinding a presentation or skimming it at 2x speed.</p>
<p>Office Mix doesn&rsquo;t yet work on iOS, but <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/05/08/adobe-releases-free-voice-app-for-ipad.aspx">Adobe Voice</a> is a free iPad app that lets users create presentations, combining voice, video, motion graphics, still images and music.&nbsp; It comes with a bunch of templates, images, sounds and built-in visual effects.</p>

<p><strong>iPad Infants Lack Dexterity and Social Skills </strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>There is concern from the British Association of Teachers and Lecturers that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/infants-are-unable-to-use-building-blocks-because-theyre-too-addicted-to-ipads-2014-4">3 and 4 year-old children don't have dexterity in their fingers</a> because they're too addicted to swiping tablet screens.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have spoken to a number of nursery teachers who have concerns over the increasing numbers of young pupils who can swipe a screen but have little or no manipulative skills to play with building blocks or the like, or the pupils who cannot socialise with other pupils but whose parents talk proudly of their ability to use a tablet or smartphone,&rdquo; said Colin Kinney at the association's annual conference.</p>

<p>The (US) National Gallery of Art has released an interactive e-book of Arthur Wheelock Jr&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/research/online-editions.html">Dutch Paintings of the Seventeenth Century</a>.&nbsp; This is the first release in a planned series of NGA Online Editions that will provide open access to the Gallery&rsquo;s permanent collection catalogues and will eventually document more than 5,000 paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts.</p>

<p><strong>Time to Retire From Online Learning?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tonybates.ca/2014/04/15/time-to-retire-from-online-learning/">Tony Bates</a>, long-time academic, e-learning consultant and founding member of IET, has announced (aged 75) his retirement from &ldquo;(nearly) all professional activities&rdquo;.&nbsp; His blog post explains the reasons, which include:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t express adequately just how p***** off I am about MOOCs &ndash; not the concept, but all the hubris and nonsense that&rsquo;s been talked and written about them. At a personal level, it was as if 45 years of work was for nothing. All the research and study I and many others had done on what makes for successful learning online were totally ignored, with truly disastrous consequences in terms of effective learning for the vast majority of participants who took MOOCs from the Ivy League universities. Having ignored online learning for nearly 20 years, Stanford, MIT and Harvard had to re-invent online learning in their own image to maintain their perceived superiority in all things higher educational. And the media fell for it, hook, line and sinker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am concerned that the computer scientists seem to be taking over online education. Ivy League MOOCs are being driven mainly by computer scientists, not educators. Politicians are looking to computer science to automate learning in order to save money [&hellip;] This is a battle that has always existed in educational technology, but it&rsquo;s one I fear the educators are losing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Fees and Tough Visa Rules Blamed For Foreign Students Dip</strong></p>

<p>International student recruitment to English HEIs has fallen for the first time in 29 years, according to a report from HEFCE, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140402104158289">Global Demand for English Higher Education: An analysis of international student entry to English higher education courses</a>.&nbsp; HEFCE notes that, &ldquo;This is in stark contrast to previous years, when international entry to postgraduate taught programmes enjoyed double digit growth.&rdquo;&nbsp; As an example, &ldquo;Entrants to English higher education institutions from India and Pakistan have halved since 2010, at the same time as their numbers are growing in other countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a House of Lords report, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140410182334514">International Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Students</a>, has raised similar concerns over drops in international STEM students, citing tighter immigration rules as creating an &ldquo;unwelcoming&rdquo; impression.&nbsp; International students on STEM courses fell by more than 10% 2010-11 to 2012-13 and the decline is particularly acute among postgrads.</p>

<p><strong>Video for Learning</strong></p>
<p><em>[Education Technology; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>A study by Kaltura finds that 90% of respondents believe <a href="http://edtechnology.co.uk/News/video_now_a_must_have_in_he">video improves the learning experience</a>, with even basic video tools having a significant impact; 81% also agree that online learning will grow in prominence and will underpin the award of a large number of degrees going forward.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, Kaltura hosts an online platform for learning videos.</p>
<p>Derek Muller&rsquo;s PhD thesis examined the effectiveness of videos (such as from Khan) for teaching physics.&nbsp; His premise was that (1) learners often start with some subject knowledge, (2) their understanding can often be wrong or contain misconceptions, but (3) because they think they know the content, they don&rsquo;t pay full attention and so never remedy the situation.&nbsp; His <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8">8-min video illustrates his findings</a> in a clear and thought-provoking manner (tip: start around 1:18 if you want to skip the general intro about Khan Academy).</p>

<p><strong>Change the Homework, Improve Student Achievement</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>A new US study, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/03/20/change-the-homework-improve-student-achievement.aspx">Integrating Cognitive Science and Technology Improves Learning in a STEM Classroom</a>, has shown the beneficial effects of taking a cognitive science approach to undergraduate homework tasks, by providing students with:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Immediate feedback on homework, which they were required to read</li>
<li>Problems spaced over three weeks rather than all in a single week</li>
<li>Follow-up problems assigned in subsequent homework (&ldquo;repeated retrieval practice&rdquo;)</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparing groups who received this approach with those who did &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; homework showed a 7% improvement on short answer questions on the final exam and 5% on multiple choice questions.</p>

<p><strong>Ethnicity Has Greatest Impact on UK Degree Grades</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News]</em></p>
<p>A study of 130,000 recent graduates by HEFCE suggests that <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140329102323216">ethnicity is the most significant factor in students' performance</a> at university, although other factors such as gender, disadvantage and school type also affected students&rsquo; chances of success.&nbsp; Some 72% of white students who entered HE with three B grade A-levels graduated with a first or upper-second class degree, but only 56% of Asian students and 53% of black students did so.</p>
<p>Separate data published by HESA shows that the proportion of students at English universities from <a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2060&Itemid=141">disadvantaged backgrounds</a> rose during the first year of higher tuition fees &ndash; up from 10.2% in 2011-12 to 10.9% in 2012-13.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; TechCrunch; TES; IRRODL; Stephen Downes; The Economist; JISC]</em></p>
<p>European MOOC platform <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/02/19/european-mooc-platform-nearing-500000-enrollments.aspx">iversity</a> launched last Oct and now claims to have reached 500,000 enrolments in its 28 courses, with 5,000 students completing the first five courses.&nbsp; Students were also able to obtain ECTS credit points in two courses &ndash; <em>An Introduction to Business Studies</em> and <em>Marketing</em> &ndash; by completing an onsite exam (in Germany) even if they were not enrolled at one of the institutions offering the course.</p>
<p><a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/03/06/edx-expands-membership-structure-adds-12-organizations.aspx">edX is expanding its membership</a> by adding 12 new institutions including The Smithsonian, the International Monetary Fund and OpenCourseWare Consortium, plus universities in the US, Spain, Mexico and Japan.</p>
<p>Google is about to launch its own MOOC, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/26/google-announces-an-online-data-interpretation-class-for-the-general-public">Making Sense of Data</a>, which will run from 18 Mar - 4 Apr and will be taught mainly by means of video lectures and interactive projects, supported by community teaching assistants.&nbsp; According to Google, &ldquo;Making Sense of Data is intended for anybody who works with data on a daily basis, such as students, teachers, journalists, and small business owners, and who wants to learn more about how to apply that information to practical problems&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Donald Clark believes MOOCs are reaching beyond higher education into vocational learning, with the arrival of <a href="http://news.tes.co.uk/further-education/b/opinion/2014/02/21/39-moocs-have-burst-out-of-higher-education-into-vocational-learning-voocs-have-arrived-39.aspx">VOOCs</a> that are no longer the domain of just undergraduates and interested academics.&nbsp; He cites an example of a maths VOOC funded by the University for Industry charitable trust that he claims is the world&rsquo;s first &lsquo;adaptive&rsquo; MOOC that personalises the path taken by the learner through a network of maths topics.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is not about GCSE maths, but functional maths, the maths that most people find useful in the real world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katy Jordan was among the first independent commentators to start compiling and analysing MOOC user data.&nbsp; Now, her IRRODL paper, <a href="http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1651/2813">Initial Trends in Enrolment and Completion of Massive Open Online Courses</a>, draws together public domain data relating to enrolment and completion, from which she concludes that: &ldquo;The average MOOC is found to enrol around 43,000 students, 6.5% of whom complete the course.&nbsp; Enrolment numbers are decreasing over time and are positively correlated with course length.&nbsp; Completion rates are consistent across time, university rank, and total enrolment, but negatively correlated with course length.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jimmy Daly has also collated a number of visualisations of <a href="http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2014/02/harvardxs-and-mitxs-mooc-data-visualized-and-mapped">demographic data for HarvardX and MITx</a>.</p>
<p>Terry Anderson reports on a study of a Coursera MOOC which concluded that <a href="http://terrya.edublogs.org/2014/03/13/does-teaching-presence-matter-in-a-mooc/">teacher presence</a> had no significant relation to course completion, most badges awarded, intent to register in subsequent MOOCs or course satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Economist believes the rise of online tuition &ndash; particularly MOOCs - will <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21595901-rise-online-instruction-will-upend-economics-higher-education-massive">upend the economics of higher education</a>. &nbsp;However, the situation may be different for elite and less selective institutions, with MOOCs seen as a closer fit for the latter but quite different to the educational package offered by the former.&nbsp; Stanford&rsquo;s Caroline Hoxby believes, &ldquo;these universities may have threatened their own business model by embracing MOOCs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leah Belsky and Michal Tsur&rsquo;s edSurge opinion piece argues that, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-03-01-opinion-are-moocs-a-disappointment-or-a-gift">MOOCs have failed to meet some of our greatest hopes</a>&rdquo; but that they have succeeded in highlighting the importance of, &ldquo;high quality teaching and top teachers (not always the top researchers), which are critical for high quality learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harvard Students in English professor Elisa New&rsquo;s &ldquo;Poetry in America&rdquo; lectures have been asked to <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2014/03/harvard_student.html">keep quiet and not ask questions</a> so that the sessions can be recorded without interruption for rebroadcast via HarvardX.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; edSurge; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>Ingram&rsquo;s <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/03/03/vital-source-acquires-coursesmart.aspx">Vital Source</a> Technologies has acquired CourseSmart, a provider of digital HE textbooks that was originally founded by Macmillan, Wiley, McGraw-Hill, Pearson and others. CourseSmart has millions of worldwide users and claims to offer access to more than 90% of core HE titles, plus other e-resources and a data analytics service.</p>
<p>Pearson and Microsoft have announced four <a href="http://gettingsmart.com/2014/02/pearson-creates-leading-curriculum-apps-digital-learning-environments/">Windows 8 apps for digital learning</a> environments, including a Common Core system of courses &ndash; &ldquo;the first curriculum built for a digital personalized learning environment&rdquo; &ndash; an eBook app and a secure assessment app.</p>
<p>Wikispaces &ndash; a social writing platform where over 10 million teachers and students currently collaborate on projects &ndash; has been acquired for an undisclosed sum by <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/03/04/uk-publishing-giant-tsl-snaps-up-ed-tech-startup-wikispaces-exclusive/">TSL Education</a>.&nbsp; UK-based TSL owns TES and THE magazines (amongst others) and claims the largest online network of teachers in the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/da514c30-8402-11e3-b72e-00144feab7de.html#axzz2utlx49hg">Pearson has issued a profits warning</a> due to rising restructuring costs and a slowdown in the US arm of its business which accounts for about 70% of company profits.&nbsp; The US has become a tougher market for all education companies, with tight government budgets and falling college enrolments.&nbsp; The &ldquo;career college sector, in which we have a strong market position, was particularly weak&rdquo;, Pearson said.</p>
<p>McGraw-Hill has launched <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/03/03/mcgraw-hill-education-intros-real-time-analytics-on-student-performance.aspx">Connect Insight</a>, a data analytics and visualization tool that provides at-a-glance views of student performance in real time via a tablet device.&nbsp; Lecturers can see how each student is performing individually and relative to peers, gauge the effectiveness of their assignments, and spot early signs of those who may be struggling.</p>
<p>Turnitin has launched <a href="http://www.turnitin.com/en_us/features/grade-anything">Grade Anything</a> to assess &ldquo;virtually any type of assignment,&rdquo; including presentations, spreadsheets, designs and calculations; it also provides a grading template for assessing assignments such as performances and recitals.</p>

<p><strong>Further Cuts to English University Budgets</strong></p>
<p><em>[University World News;</em> <em>The Guardian</em><em>]</em></p>
<p>English universities face further heavy cuts in direct support.&nbsp; The government is concerned at the <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20140212143349697">upward drift of salaries for vice-chancellors</a> and other top posts and has urged 'restraint'.&nbsp; A grant letter from Vince Cable and David Willetts makes clear that the settlement will mean reductions in HEFCE funding over the two years &ldquo;beyond those accounted for by the switch to publicly funded tuition fees&rdquo; that began in 2012-13.&nbsp; Total HEFCE funding for 2014-15 is &pound;4.091bn &ndash; &pound;125m less than the 'indicative' funding of &pound;4.216bn set out in last year&rsquo;s grant letter.</p>
<p>What pressure?&nbsp; The Guardian reports that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2014/mar/06/mental-health-academics-growing-problem-pressure-university">mental illness is on the rise in UK academia</a>, &ldquo;amid the pressures of greater job insecurity, constant demand for results and an increasingly marketised higher education system.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Student Narcissists Favour Twitter over Facebook</strong></p>
<p><em>[BPS; Audrey Watters]</em></p>
<p>US researchers have found that students (<em>n=</em>515; average age 21) who scored higher on measures of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2013.12.011">narcissism</a> were no more likely to post Facebook status updates or have more Facebook friends, whereas there <em>was</em> a correlation for the general public (<em>n=</em>669, aged 18 to 75; average age 33).&nbsp; However, students with higher narcissism were more active users of Twitter and were likely to say they posted updates to attract followers and to gain admiration on the site.&nbsp; The researchers suggest that Twitter may have a number of features that particularly appeal to narcissists, including the fact that relationships need not be reciprocal &ndash; people can follow you on Twitter, without you having to follow them.</p>
<p>But watch out - Australian student Andrew Farley has been fined AUS$105,000 after <a href="http://www.thewire.com/global/2014/03/defamatory-tweets-about-teacher-cost-australian-student-100000/358843/">defaming a high school teacher</a> on social media.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Natives &hellip; or Not?</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; ReadWrite]</em></p>
<p>The Pew Research Center has released details of <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/">social attitudes of US adults</a> in various different age groups from Millennials (18-33) to Silents (69-86).&nbsp; The survey covers a wide range of factors from religion to politics but also includes attitudes to, and use of, social media.</p>
<p>But just how media savvy are &lsquo;digital natives&rsquo;?&nbsp; A new study from Northwestern University discovered that <a href="http://readwrite.com/2010/07/29/so-called_digital_natives_not_media_savvy_new_study_shows?awesm=readwr.it_j1MH">many students are quite na&iuml;ve, especially when it comes to search engines</a> and the ability to determine the credibility of search results.&nbsp; During the study, one of the researchers asked a study participant, &ldquo;What is this website?&rdquo; to which the response was, &ldquo;Oh, I don't know.&nbsp; The first thing that came up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Only 10% of the students made mention of the site's author or that author's credentials while completing tasks.&nbsp; Another interesting finding was that only a third of the students used Wikipedia to search for answers when given particular tasks, possibly because of teachers' insistence over the years that it is not a credible source of information.</p>

<p><strong>Global Online Education Report</strong></p>
<p><em>[Campus Technology; University World News; Time]</em></p>
<p>The Sloan Consortium is partnering with a group of HE and inter-governmental organizations to generate a <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/02/24/new-global-online-education-report-to-study-impact-of-online-learning-worldwide.aspx">Global Online Education Report</a> (GlobalOHER) which will be based on empirical data on the state of online learning worldwide.&nbsp; It will include information on enrolments and programs offered online, the role of MOOCs, adoption of OERs, and strategies, challenges and policy issues relating to the delivery of high quality online education.</p>
<p>An internal report from <a href="http://philosophy.cornell.edu/epl/upload/CornellDistancelearning.pdf">Cornell</a> states that distance learning, and particularly MOOCs, &ldquo;holds much promise&rdquo;, advising that, &ldquo;Cornell should pursue a diverse portfolio of distance learning avenues, continually rebalancing it as evidence emerges&rdquo; but that faculties should not be, &ldquo;making commitments that adversely impact on-campus teaching and research.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Time reports on disquiet amongst some US academics over <a href="http://nation.time.com/2014/03/01/online-courses-moocs-ownership/#ixzz2vABOK0N0v">who should own online courses</a> that they have authored, fearing that their work may be altered for the worse or be taught by other, less-qualified people.</p>

<p><strong>Using Khan Academy to Support Maths in Schools </strong></p>
<p><em>[edSurge]</em></p>
<p>Researchers SRI International (with backing from Gates) have just published a detailed report on <a href="http://www.sri.com/work/projects/research-use-khan-academy-schools">how US schools have been using Khan for their maths classes</a>.&nbsp; The study covers nine sites that encompass 20 public, charter and independent schools from 2011 to 2013.&nbsp; The aim of the research was to generate information for educators on how Khan (and other) digital learning tools and resources, could be used to support personalised learning (i.e. learning that tailors what is taught, when, and how, according to student needs).</p>

<p><strong>UK Universities Lag in STEM Subjects</strong></p>
<p><em>[The Telegraph]</em></p>
<p>The UK is performing strongly in arts and humanities subjects but lagging behind in science and maths at university level, according to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10661330/UK-universities-facing-tough-global-competition-in-STEM-subjects.html">QS World University Rankings</a>, published last month.&nbsp; The findings revealed that only two STEM-related subjects were in the ten disciplines with the most UK universities in the top 200: psychology, which has 28 UK institutions in the top 200 and environmental sciences with 27.&nbsp; Asia had 10 of the top 30 institutions in the areas of chemical, civil and electrical engineering and eight for mechanical engineering, with the National University of Singapore making the global top ten in all five of the engineering and technology disciplines.</p>

<p>The Association of Commonwealth Universities is behind <a href="https://beyond2015.acu.ac.uk/">The World Beyond 2015: Is Higher Education Ready?</a> &ndash; a campaign to raise awareness of why and how HE should respond to global challenges.&nbsp; According to ACU, &ldquo;The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) expire at the end of 2015 and a new set of international targets will be tabled at the United Nations in early 2016.&nbsp; Whatever the goals that emerge, higher education will play a fundamental role in enabling countries to achieve them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Ring: Gesture Control Input Device</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch]</em></p>
<p>The Ring is a hardware device that resembles an ordinary (if slightly chunky) ring, containing sensors and electronics to give it the ability to control devices and render input.&nbsp; As their impressive video shows, it can enable <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/28/the-ring-input-device-puts-gesture-control-and-home-automation-on-your-finger">gesture controls</a>, (&agrave; la Wii), as well as text input by drawing letters in the air, gesture-based authorization for finalizing payments, and transmit alerts from connected devices via a built-in vibration motor and onboard LED.&nbsp; The Ring is currently compatible with iOS and Android devices with Bluetooth 4.0 support.&nbsp; The pre-order cost is $165, with estimated delivery in Jul 14.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile Learning Handbook </strong></p>
<p><em>[ADL]</em></p>
<p>ADL (the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative) has published a free <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/adlnet.gov/mobile-learning-guide/resources">Mobile Learning Handbook</a>.&nbsp; This contains a range of information and advice relating to needs analysis, learning design and hardware, interface and layout considerations.&nbsp; There is also a glossary, some case studies and links to further advice and research.</p>

<p><strong>Oppia</strong></p>
<p><em>[edSurge]</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I usually cringe at &ldquo;no programming skills required&rdquo; authoring tools, mainly because users end up working within the original developers&rsquo; vision of what components are available and how they should function.&nbsp; But then along comes <a href="https://www.oppia.org/">Oppia</a>, which has been largely written by a group of Google engineers in their &ldquo;20% time&rdquo; and so should hopefully contain some best-of-breed features.&nbsp; Oppia is an open source project that aims to let anyone create interactive online activities &ndash; alone or as part of a community &ndash; that enable students to learn by doing.&nbsp; It aims to &ldquo;simulate the one-on-one interaction that a student has with a teacher by capturing and generalizing &lsquo;interaction dialogues&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Spritz</strong></p>
<p><em>[Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.spritzinc.com/">Spritz</a> [HTML5] offers &ldquo;compact text streaming&rdquo; which presents a rapid sequence of single words in a 13-character window, but at speeds considerably faster than our typical reading rate of around 220 wpm.&nbsp; We can cope with this because Spritz finds the &lsquo;Optimal Recognition Point&rsquo; (ORP) of each word for us, thus saving the time and effort it normally takes our eyes and brain to do that.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t aim to replace the paged text preferred for study and revision, but it offers a useful solution for some other situations.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>Device Updates</strong></p>
<p><em>[TechCrunch; Campus Technology]</em></p>
<p>Gartner reports that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/03/gartner-195m-tablets-sold-in-2013-android-grabs-top-spot-from-ipad-with-62-share">195 million tablets were sold</a> worldwide in 2013, of which 62% were Android, 36% iPad and 2% Microsoft.&nbsp; This compares with 2012 figures of 116m sales, with iPads leading at 53%, followed by 46% Android and 1% Microsoft.</p>
<p>According to IDC, overall <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/03/05/pcs-see-most-severe-contraction-on-record.aspx">PC shipments fell by 9.8%</a> to 315 million units in 2103: &ldquo;the most severe contraction on record&rdquo;.&nbsp; IDC predicts a 6% decline this year and a further 1% in 2015.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/09/console-crisis">games console market</a> is also looking fragile.&nbsp; Although Sony&rsquo;s 6m PS4 sales outshine Microsoft&rsquo;s 4m Xbox shipments, TechCrunch points out that these are well below sales figures for earlier consoles.</p>
<p>ABI Research reports that <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/03/04/forecast-billions-will-have-high-speed-mobile-broadband-within-5-years.aspx">total worldwide 4G/LTE subscriptions</a> reached 230 million last year but will grow at a compound rate of 43.6% each year through to 2019, reaching about 2 billion in total.&nbsp; By then, around a third of those subscribers will have LTE-Advanced, offering peak mobile download speeds of 1 Gbps and typical download speeds of around 200 Mbps.</p>

<p><strong>Machine Marking of Essays</strong></p>
<p><em>[edSurge]</em></p>
<p>A paper from Getting Smart considers the relative efficacy and costs of <a href="http://cdno4.gettingsmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ASAP-Pricing-Study-Final.pdf">human versus machine marking of essays</a>.&nbsp; It cites evidence from research sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation that, &ldquo;machine scoring engines are generally capable of producing scores similar, in the aggregate, to the scores of human raters for long form English Language Arts (ELA) essays (defined as essays with more than 150 word responses).&rdquo;&nbsp; The paper concludes that &ldquo;Machine scoring of student essays proved to be significantly less expensive than human scoring. Depending on the set of assumptions used, machine scoring of long form essays can be as low as 20 percent to 50 percent of the cost of human scoring given favorable conditions and major volumes of student responses&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Serious eLearning Manifesto</strong></p>
<p><em>[Will Thalheimer]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://elearningmanifesto.org/">Serious eLearning Manifesto</a> launched on 13 Mar:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that learning technology offers the possibility for creating uniquely valuable learning experiences.&nbsp; We also believe, with a sense of sadness and profound frustration, that most elearning fails to live up to its promise.&nbsp; We further believe that current trends evoke a future of only negligible improvement in elearning design&mdash;unless something radical is done to bend the curve.&nbsp; Finally, we have concluded that in order to elevate elearning to the height of its promise, we need to begin with a personal commitment to a new set of standards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has the backing of some big hitters, mainly in the US commercial sector, so it will be interesting to see what transpires.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[Belinda Tynan; Audrey Watters; THE; Getting Smart; Paul Hoffman; edSurge; Stephen Downes]</em></p>
<p>Harvard is making some MOOCs available only to its alumni from next month in an effort to help Harvard graduates reconnect with the university and one another.&nbsp; <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/harvard-u-will-offer-exclusive-moocs-to-alumni/50265">HarvardX for Alumni</a> will offer versions of seven Harvard MOOCs exclusively to graduates of the university. The courses will not be full-length MOOCs but &ldquo;segments&rdquo; that include some new material developed specially for graduates.</p>
<p>One notable absentee from MITx/edX has been MIT&rsquo;s own <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-12/mit-sloan-follows-wharton-hbs-in-offering-mba-courses-online">Sloan School of Management</a>, but that&rsquo;s about to change as Sloan offers its data analytics course for free in the spring semester.&nbsp; Analytics Edge will offer the same curriculum for MOOC and campus students, including studies of the dating site eHarmony and the 2012 US presidential election, with MOOC students watching prerecorded lectures and submitting assignments online.</p>
<p>Belinda Tynan spots a &ldquo;slightly confused article&rdquo; in Business Week, reporting a Babson poll of more than 2,800 colleges and universities that finds 39% disagree that <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/academics-are-down-on-moocs-dot-business-schools-arent">MOOCs are &lsquo;a sustainable method for offering courses&rsquo;</a> (up from 26% last year).&nbsp; She comments that, <em>&ldquo;It wouldn't be entirely cynical to see this as a piece of simple product differentiation on the part of the 'elite' schools designed to bolster their position as custodians of the self-styled quality end of the market. &nbsp;MOOCs may indeed be the democratisation of knowledge but the thrust of the article is that such new-fangled devices cannot be compared with the personal treatment available at the premium end of the market&rdquo;.</em>&nbsp; She also wonders, if MOOCs are so poor, why Harvard/Wharton/MIT are still pursuing them, and is some form of hybrid solution possible that exploits MOOC precepts within a suitably supported student experience?</p>
<p>Diana Laurillard explains in THE why <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/comment/opinion/opinion-five-myths-about-moocs/2010480.article">MOOCs are not necessarily the answer to all our problems</a>.&nbsp; In particular she notes that content which may be &lsquo;free&rsquo; to the consumer is almost certainly not free for the provider, and she discusses in detail the myths that students might simply support each other through their courses and that MOOCs will bring education to the underprivileged.</p>
<p><a href="http://gettingsmart.com/2014/01/udemy-launching-android-app/">Udemy has launched an Android mobile app</a> which allows students to engage with course materials, watch videos on demand and download rich content for offline consumption.&nbsp; Udemy&rsquo;s existing iOS apps have already been downloaded nearly 1 million times and mobile course consumption now accounts for approximately 20% of content from Udemy&rsquo;s catalogue of around 10,000 courses.</p>
<p>Coursera is partnering with Discovery Communications (The Discovery Channel, Animal Planet) to offer MOOCs on their new <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/73302211026/now-explore-coursera-courses-on-discovery">Curiosity.com</a> online learning portal.</p>
<p>A new paper from <a href="http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/2014/898">CETIS</a> discusses three themes that have emerged from recent MOOC activity: the provision of scalable, open, online learning; different revenue models such as applying the concepts of freemium and premium offers; and disaggregated services such as offering paid-for assessment or support on top of free online course content.</p>
<p>edSurge offers an infographic that portrays <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-01-10-a-handy-cheatsheet-on-moocs">the size and shape of the current MOOC marketplace</a> and, although some data have been previously reported directly by Coursera, it still provides a useful numeric overview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if it&rsquo;s detail you&rsquo;re after, turn to <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2381263">Harvard and MIT&rsquo;s detailed research into participants in their first 17 MOOCs</a>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the standard demographic information we&rsquo;ve come to expect, along with some more interesting but rarely reported details such as ages of certificate-earners (Fig 6), when students enrolled relative to the start date (Fig 8), forum posts (Table 6) and course grades vs content accessed (Fig 13).</p>
<p>Even more detailed and varied are the just-published <a href="http://www.emoocs2014.eu/sites/default/files/Proceedings-Moocs-Summit-2014.pdf">proceedings of the 2014 European MOOCs Stakeholders Summit</a>.&nbsp; Even a rapid scroll through its 293 pages suggests that this must surely be required reading for MOOC theorists everywhere.</p>
<p>...but the most esoteric MOOC research of the month award goes to Cheng &amp; Shatin in EURODL for <a href="http://www.eurodl.org/?article=607">the emotional affordances of the massive open online course</a>.</p>

<p><strong>BBC is 'Stifling' Educational Innovation</strong></p>
<p><em>[Belinda Tynan]</em></p>

<p>The &lsquo;most biased and uninformed opinion of the month&rsquo; award goes to investment banker Hugh Campbell. He complains that the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/16/bbc-stifling-educational-innovation-claims-tech-investment-bank">BBC is stifling educational innovation</a> by giving away too much content for free, singling out BBC Bitesize as the main offender (an obvious next choice, given that the commercial sector managed to kill off the highly innovative (and also free) BBC Jam in 2007).&nbsp; Oh Hugh.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s probably more educational innovation going on right now than there ever has been.&nbsp; You just need to get over the fact that a lot of it isn&rsquo;t making you any money and start seeing some of those perceived threats as opportunities &ndash; for example, just think what a next generation of Coursera&rsquo;s <em>signature track</em> technology might do for reliable remote assessment across our industry.&nbsp; And, yes, we know MOOC completion rates are around 10% but that&rsquo;s not failure, it&rsquo;s a different &lsquo;normal&rsquo;.&nbsp; Have you read every textbook you own from cover to cover, Hugh?</p>

<p><strong>Puttnam: Fear of Technology May Hold Back Change in Education</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mobile Media Use, Multitasking and Distractibility</strong></p>
<p><em>[IGI Global]</em></p>
<p>IGI is offering a free download of a recent paper from International Journal of Cyber Behavior, Psychology and Learning.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.igi-global.com/free-content/70087">Mobile Media Use, Multitasking and Distractibility</a> examines how multitasking with media affects users' performance in various domains (e.g. driving, work, studying) and why media multitasking is related to distraction, distractibility, and impulsivity.&nbsp; The authors conclude that &ldquo;Greater use of media is correlated with higher levels of trait impulsivity and distractibility, but the direction of causality has not been established.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Short-Fat vs Long-Thin Online Study </strong></p>
<p><em>[Tony Bates]</em></p>
<p>US researchers compared 58 students studying <a href="http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/winter164/shaw_chametzky_burrus_walters164.html">an online undergraduate course on abnormal psychology, designed to have a 16-week duration</a>, with a group of 57 who took a condensed 8-week version.&nbsp; The former group achieved a mean final score of 756/1000, submitting 15.5 of 18 possible assignments, whilst the latter group scored 763 and submitted 15.6 assignments.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the paper is quite thin on background details so it is not clear to what extent this might be generalizable to OU students.</p>

<p>According to analysts IDC, total worldwide mobile phone shipments in 2013 were up by 4.8% to 1.82 billion units.&nbsp; The number of <a href="http://campustechnology.com/articles/2014/01/28/one-seventh-of-the-worlds-population-got-a-smart-phone-last-year.aspx">smartphones shipped worldwide in 2013 topped one billion</a> &ndash; or about one smart phone for every seven human beings alive and, for the first time, smartphones also made up the majority of all cell phone shipments, at 55.1% (up from 41.7% in 2012).</p>
<p>While Android is by far the most prevalent mobile OS worldwide, iOS remains particularly dominant in the US.&nbsp; Q4 figures show that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/27/apple-q1-2014-iphone-ipad-mac/?ncid=tcdaily">Apple shipped 51 million iPhones and 26 million iPads</a>.&nbsp; The demise of the iPod comes ever closer as sales halved from 12.7 million (2012: Q4) to around 6 million.</p>
<p>According to Juniper Research, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/21/phablets-are-officially-a-thing-with-20m-shipped-in-2013/">phablet</a> shipments are expected to hit 120 million units shipped by 2018, up from the estimated 20 million phablets shipped in 2013.&nbsp; Juniper notes that, when Samsung launched its first Galaxy Note, the company sold 2 million units in the first four months, but the most recent Galaxy Note 3 sold 5 million units in a week.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC News</strong></p>
<p><em>[RFI; ST Louis Today; Forbes; ALT]</em></p>
<p>France is investing &euro;20m to develop a MOOC programme: <a href="http://www.english.rfi.fr/node/161363">France Universit&eacute; Num&eacute;rique</a> (FUN).&nbsp; The first eight courses start this week and around 90,000 people have so far signed up for the 25 courses that are due to start this year.&nbsp; According to France&rsquo;s Minister for Higher Education, Genevi&egrave;ve Fioraso, FUN will particularly target Africa because of the, &ldquo;&hellip;very large countries with not very many campuses. &nbsp;So it is very well adapted to the African culture. &nbsp;We want to be more connected to the African development via MOOCs."</p>
<p><a href="http://interact.stltoday.com/pr/business/PR123013062015461">LaunchCode</a> is a St Louis-based volunteer initiative that provides a way for people of any background to get a job in software development and help fill the current US skills gap. &nbsp;LaunchCode is taking advantage of an edX MOOC (CS50x, &ldquo;Introduction to Computer Science&rdquo;) plus free mentorship and partnerships with over 100 local companies who have agreed to take on inexperienced programmers traditionally screened out by HR recruitment processes. These novice programmers then are given &ldquo;pair programming&rdquo; apprenticeships at companies.</p>
<p>ALT&rsquo;s first MOOC, the <a href="http://www.efficiencyexchange.ac.uk/3753/using-technology-to-innovate-new-mooc-from-the-association-for-learning-technology/">Open Course in Technology Enhanced Learning (ocTEL)</a> attracted 1,200 participants during its 8-week run last year and registration is now open for those interested in the 2014 re-run, likely to start around 1 Apr.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.openculture.com/free_certificate_courses#January2014">OpenCulture</a> site lists around 800 MOOCs, although many of these have now come and gone; however, the list starts with 50 or so that are starting in February. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.teachthought.com/technology/free-online-courses-january-2014/">TeachThought</a> improves on this with a longer list of 98, helpfully organised by topic area, and <a href="https://www.class-central.com/">Class Central</a> suggests 150+.</p>
<p>Forbes profiles Simon Nelson, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterhigh/2014/01/13/a-british-mooc-with-a-44-year-old-parent/">FutureLearn</a> and their relationship with the OU.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC Data</strong></p>
<p><em>[EdSurge; Duke; New Republic; Gill Marshall; Michel Wermelinger]</em></p>
<p>EdSurge&rsquo;s Dhawal Shah presents some <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-12-22-moocs-in-2013-breaking-down-the-numbers">2013 MOOC stats</a>, based on data from his Class Central aggregator site. &nbsp;He shows growth, &ldquo;from about 100 MOOCs in 2012 to almost 700 starting in 2013&hellip;&nbsp; More than 1200 [2014] courses have been announced so far.&rdquo;&nbsp; Coursera is by far the major provider (47%), with FutureLearn coming in alongside Udacity on 2.8%.&nbsp; Humanities (20%) and computing (16%) top the subject rankings, with engineering (5.1%) bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>Duke was one of the earliest MOOC providers to publish stats a year ago, based on its first two courses.&nbsp; Kim Manturuk now reflects on life a year down the track and she suggests that the growth has been &ldquo;nothing short of amazing&rdquo;.&nbsp; <a href="http://cit.duke.edu/blog/2013/12/duke-moocs-year-in-review/">Duke offered 16 MOOCs during 2013</a> which attracted over 876,000 enrolments, 595k of whom visited the course website at least once, 443k watched at least one video and 108k attempted the first assessment.&nbsp; Of these, nearly 30k attempted the final assessment and were therefore deemed to have &lsquo;completed&rsquo;.&nbsp; Motivation for enrolment is perhaps surprising, with &lsquo;enjoyment&rsquo; being considerably more important than &lsquo;credentials&rsquo;.</p>
<p>New Republic also considers who&rsquo;s doing what with MOOCs, based on a <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116013/mooc-student-survey-who-enrolls-online-education">U Penn survey of 35,000 MOOCers</a>.&nbsp; The results are presented as an infographic, highlights of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most MOOC students come from the US (34%) followed by India (5.8%) and Brazil (4%), with the UK in fifth place (3.6%).</li>
<li>Around 80% worldwide already have a degree</li>
<li>Business, economics and social sciences courses have the highest enrolments (42%) and highest completion rates (7.2%)</li>
<li>54% would not have been willing to pay for their MOOC and a similar number enrolled for &lsquo;fun&rsquo; or &lsquo;curiosity&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Aimee Hosler suggests that MOOCs, and they types of people who are often attracted to MOOCs, may open up possibilities for <a href="http://www.emergingedtech.com/2014/01/massive-open-online-research-the-mooc-evolves-into-the-moor/">Massive Open Online Research</a> (MOORs) which she describes as, &ldquo;essentially a MOOC, but with a major emphasis on research&rdquo;.&nbsp; She explains some of the thinking behind UCSD&rsquo;s recent Bioinformatics MOOR which ran during last Oct/Nov which, in addition to standard coursework, also allowed students to work on research projects under the guidance of UCSD&rsquo;s &ldquo;prominent bioinformatics scientists&rdquo; from all across the globe.</p>
<p>MCT&rsquo;s Michel Wermelinger blogged last year on his early MOOC experiences and he now reflects on a further <a href="http://michel.wermelinger.ws/chezmichel/2014/01/moocs-some-further-experiences/">four MOOCs</a>, ranging from Data Analysis to Write Like Mozart.&nbsp; He believes there are, &ldquo;four common core mechanisms (video lectures, discussion forums, mix of short and longer assessment pieces and of automatic and peer marking)&rdquo; but that, &ldquo;clear, well-paced lectures are of course key, as they&rsquo;re the main teaching vehicle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Assignments that help turn theory into practice are good motivators, automatically graded quizzes can be too simplistic and peer-assessed larger projects are engaging but can introduce workload peaks.&nbsp; Differentiated activities good for keener students who want to be challenged and dive deeper, and model solutions are very helpful where tutor support is unavailable.</p>

<p>WCET&rsquo;s latest survey, <a href="http://wcet.wiche.edu/advance/managing-online-education-survey">Managing Online Education 2013: Practices in Ensuring Quality</a>, was most notable in my opinion for the have-nots rather than the haves.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>8% of institutions have no review process for new online courses (p21)</li>
<li>15% of responding institutions did not have any organisational quality standards for curriculum design and teaching of online courses (p9)</li>
<li>16% of institutions had &lsquo;no policy&rsquo; on whether their online courses met the needs of students with disabilities (p30).</li>
<li>55% of institutions were not able to provide completion rates for online courses (p17)</li>

<p>The latest Pew research report shows that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/30/pew-social-networking">73% of US adults use some form of social networking</a>.&nbsp; Facebook is the clear leader, used by 71%, followed by LinkedIn (22%) and Pinterest (21%).&nbsp; Twitter drops from 3<sup>rd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> spot this year (18%) followed closely by Instagram (17%).&nbsp; Frequency of use shows Facebook topping the &lsquo;used daily&rsquo; category (63%), whereas the &lsquo;used weekly&rsquo; figures show LinkedIn ahead (34%), presumably reflecting the less immediate nature of that site&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>The release of Windows 8.1 also brought with it IE11 and this boosted <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/01/02/ie11-triples-market-share-10-42-firefox-slips-bit-chrome-gains-back-share/#!ruFQ8">Microsoft&rsquo;s browser share</a>, with all versions capturing 58% of the worldwide market.&nbsp; IE11 rose from 3.3% in Nov to 10.4% in Dec, largely at the expense of IE10.&nbsp; Interestingly, good old IE6 is still hanging in there with a 4.4% user base.&nbsp; Firefox (all versions) has 18.4% with Chrome slightly behind on 16.2%.</p>
<p>And Gartner predicts that shipments of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/08/androids-rise-to-platform-dominance-in-one-graph">Android devices</a> will grow by about 26% this year to surpass one billion units in 2014, making it the clear market leader, way ahead of Windows and iOS.</p>

<p>Coursera celebrated its second birthday last month with an <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/students/Coursera Infographic (2).jpg">infographic</a> that encapsulates the enormity of what they&rsquo;ve achieved: 532 courses from 107 partners; 5.2m students in 190 countries who&rsquo;ve spent a collective 5,565 years watching videos and submitted 9.9m assignments.&nbsp; The one telling stat that&rsquo;s missing is the educational qualifications of those students, maybe because MOOCs in general still seem to benefitting more of the haves than the have-nots?</p>
<p>Coursera&rsquo;s partner list was swollen by the addition of 13 new institutions from 11 countries spanning the Far East, Russia and Europe, including the <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/64905875290/with-13-new-organizations-coursera-reaches-100">University of Manchester</a> which will be offering four courses in health, climate and sanitation.</p>
<p>Developing countries will benefit from an agreement signed last month by the <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20131017131951244">World Bank Group and Coursera</a>.&nbsp; MOOCs will be offered as part of a new Open Learning Campus, &ldquo;where practitioners, development partners and the general public can more systematically access real-time, relevant and world-class learning&rdquo;.&nbsp; The first MOOC - &ldquo;Turn Down the Heat: Why a 4&deg;C warmer world must be avoided - is expected to start in Jan 14.</p>
<p>Coursera is launching <a href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/65596539008/introducing-coursera-learning-hubs-global">Global Learning Hubs</a> which will offer people around the world &ldquo;physical spaces where they can access the Internet to take a Coursera course, while learning alongside peers in an interactive, facilitated setting.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are currently 30+ locations, many within US embassies as part of the US State Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;MOOC Camp&rdquo; initiative.</p>
<p>Google has launched <a href="http://www.edukwest.com/coursera-rosetta-stone-alliance-francaise-google-helpouts/">Helpouts</a> (&ldquo;real help from real people in real time&rdquo;) and Coursera plans to use this to offer a mix of free and paid tutoring sessions for its Machine Learning course.</p>
<p>Coursera is hiring a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/jobs2/view/9664054">Director of Teaching and Learning</a> to help &ldquo;define a vision of what teaching and learning in the 21<sup>st</sup> century should look like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berlin-based <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/14/iversity-initial-students/">iversity went live last month</a> with its first 6 courses and 115,000 enrolled students.&nbsp; The top three courses so far are &ldquo;The Future of Storytelling&rdquo; from the University of Applied Sciences in Potsdam (29,000 students), &ldquo;Design 101&rdquo; from the Academy of Fine Arts, in Catania, (18,000) and &ldquo;Public Privacy: Cyber Security and Human Rights&rdquo; from the Humboldt Viadrina School of Governance, in Berlin (17,000).&nbsp; iversity hopes to offer 24 courses and enrol a million students by the end of next year.</p>
<p>Open Universities Australia has announced that its free online learning platform <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20131029072955369">Open2Study</a> has attracted 100,000 enrolments, with 53,000 students from more than 180 countries undertaking one or more of its MOOCs.&nbsp; Open2Study began by offering 10 four-week courses in April.&nbsp; Seven months on, 32 courses are available with 60% of enrolments now from overseas nations &ndash; the top three being the US, India and the UK.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20131031165710979">Chinese government</a> is speeding up the development of its own MOOC offerings and is actively encouraging the import of quality courses to China &ndash; as long as they do not contain politically sensitive content.&nbsp; For example, Tsinghua University has a team of 30 people now working on MOOC platform development and another team working on course content.&nbsp; Tsinghua has launched its own platform, <a href="http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20131101154620288">XuetangX</a>, which is already hosting nine courses from Tsinghua, Peking and MIT.&nbsp; But as the MOOCs flood gates open, university leaders in China are calling for clearer policies from the government on MOOCs.</p>
<p>Around 150 participants gathered in Brusselslast month for the Academic Cooperation Association (ACA)-EUA Seminar, Making Sense of the MOOCs.&nbsp; A summary of the event and links to presentations are available via the <a href="http://www.eua.be/News/13-10-18/Making_sense_of_the_MOOCs_-_report_from_ACA-EUA_Seminar_in_Brussels_10_October.aspx">EUA site</a>.&nbsp; Meanwhile, across town on the Open Education Europa site can be found a <a href="http://www.openeducationeuropa.eu/en/european_scoreboard_moocs">European MOOCs Scoreboard</a> which plots who&rsquo;s offering what across Europe.</p>
<p>The University of Western Sydney&rsquo;s Jonathan Tapson has pasted <a href="http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/10/24/moocs-and-the-cycle-of-hype/">MOOCs onto the Gartner Hype Cycle</a>.&nbsp; He shows us just cresting on the peak of inflated expectations as we&rsquo;re about to plummet for about two years&rsquo; into the trough of disillusionment (good luck FutureLearn) before gradually climbing up to the plateau of productivity by 2023.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Cast your mind back ten years to Windows XP, IE6, the first colour phones and 250 kbps ADSL.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a brave person these days who looks forward to 2023.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses">FutureLearn</a> has added a further 9 MOOCs to its course list.</p>

<p><strong>MOOC Experiences</strong></p>
<p><em>[Michel Wermelinger; Stephen Downes; Seb Schmoller; BBC]</em></p>
<p>Michel Wermelinger (MCT) has <a href="http://michel.wermelinger.ws/chezmichel/2013/10/a-tale-of-two-moocs/">blogged about his recent MOOC experiences</a>, having signed up for 5 Coursera courses, started two and dropped out of one by the second week due to its poor presentational style &ndash; based on webcam video lectures of up to 30 mins comprising quite complex narrated slides of text or graphical plots.&nbsp; His good example &ldquo;&hellip;was quite the opposite.&nbsp; Not only were explanations clear and the pace gentle, the lectures were professionally lit, filmed, and edited.&rdquo;&nbsp; He concludes, &ldquo;while [X] seems to be mostly reading out the slides he prepared for his graduate course to biostatisticians, [Y] seems to have prepared his course from ground up, as a MOOC.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>OERu Launches</strong></p>
<p><em>[THE; Stephen Downes; Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/mooc-rival-oeru-puts-accreditation-on-menu/2008571.article">OER University</a> was launched on 1 Nov by Sir John Daniel.&nbsp; OERu will allow students to study courses from 31 institutions around the world online at no cost.&nbsp; Students will be able to pay a fee to have their work assessed for academic credit, which would then be recognised by any of the other participating universities.&nbsp; Wayne Mackintosh, director of the Open Educational Resources Foundation, the NZ-based organisation that is coordinating the development of OERu, said that the option given to students to gain credit for their work made OERu more attractive than typical MOOCs.&nbsp; Initially OERu will offer two credentials &ndash; one undergraduate and one post-graduate, and they are currently experimenting with micro Open Online Courses (<a href="http://bccampus.ca/2013/10/31/the-launch-of-oeru-towards-free-learning-opportunities-for-all-students-worldwide/">mOOCs</a>).</p>
<p>MERLOT was an early pioneer of OERs but has been overshadowed by MOOCs of late.&nbsp; Now along comes <a href="http://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm">MERLOT II</a> with a revamped website that allows users to search the 40,000+ resources, upload their own or create new ones using MERLOT&rsquo;s Content Builder.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NYT questions the value of the four-year-old <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/education/edlife/where-are-the-graduates-of-university-of-the-people.html?_r=0">University of the People</a>.&nbsp; It has an annual budget of $1 million, 14 paid staff members, 300 volunteers and runs on donations from foundations such as Hewlett, Gates and Carnegie.&nbsp; Only 1,500 students (from 137 countries) have enrolled since it opened and there are currently only 736 active students.</p>

<p><strong>American University of London Sells Study-Free MBA</strong></p>
<p><em>[BBC; Matthew Moran]</em></p>
<p>The American University of London (AUOL) has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24618786">awarded an MBA to a dog</a>, resident in Battersea Dogs&rsquo; Home, in exchange for a &pound;4,500 fee.&nbsp; BBC Newsnight reporters created a one-page fake CV for a management consultant, Pete Smith, which included 15 years of made-up work experience and a bogus degree from a UK university.&nbsp; Pete was accepted onto the MBA and, when Newsnight telephoned to check whether he would be required to submit any work, an AUOL representative said: &ldquo;No, no, apparently the APEL [Accreditation of Previous Experiential Learning] board awarded him the full degree immediately based on his qualification and his professional experience, so he doesn't have to do any courses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not convinced?&nbsp; Perhaps you should try the <a href="http://www.globaleducationgroup.us/">Global Education Group</a> instead: &ldquo;You don't need to take any admission test to enter our protrams [sic]&rdquo; and &ldquo;You don't need to take classes or courses if you enrol in our &lsquo;research track&rsquo; programs.&rdquo;&nbsp; And finally, the rather curious footnote, &ldquo;No animals were harmed in the making of this site.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Gove's Education Reforms Thwart Second Chances </strong></p>
<p><em>[Pete Mitton; THE; Belfast Telegraph]</em></p>
<p>According to Laura McInerney, writing in the Guardian, &ldquo;If heaven is indeed a place on earth, I'd put money on it being <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/14/gove-education-reforms-failing-children">an Open University graduation ceremony</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp; She bemoans the effects of government funding cuts on OU fees: &ldquo;People who slipped through the education net first time around &hellip; need low-cost options for accessing higher education.&nbsp; If they, and their families, have the determination to do all the rest of the hard work, the least they can expect is that politicians on both sides will fight to support them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thanks Laura - the cheque&rsquo;s in the post.</p>
<p>And a report from Universities UK, <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/put-part-time-study-at-the-heart-of-policy-says-uuk-review/2008206.article">The Power of Part-time: Review of Part-time and Mature Higher Education</a>, warns of the potential for &ldquo;market failure&rdquo; under England&rsquo;s &pound;9,000 fee regime, recommending that such provision be intrinsic to higher education policy instead of an &ldquo;add-on&rdquo;.&nbsp; The review, chaired by Bristol&rsquo;s VC, Eric Thomas, was commissioned by the government in response to the 40% fall in part-time undergraduate numbers in England since 2010-11.</p>
<p>David Willetts, writing 50 years after the Robbins Report was published, suggests that our HE system has become &ldquo;lopsided&rdquo;, with <a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/uk/universities-should-teach-more-29675786.html">institutions focusing more on research than on teaching</a> students.&nbsp; He argues that over the years, universities have focused primarily on research &ldquo;because that is where the funding and prestige came from&rdquo; but that the &ldquo;pendulum has swung too far away&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Educause Survey of Technology Usage</strong></p>
<p><em>[Audrey Watters; Inside Higher Ed]</em></p>
<p>Educause&rsquo;s latest <a href="https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ERS1302/ERS1302.pdf">ECAR study of students and IT</a> is based on responses from 113,000 HE students in 13 countries.&nbsp; Key findings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students recognise the value of using technologies; basic things such as the institution&rsquo;s web site and VLE/LMS are most valued; most students still regard OERs, e-books, e-portfolios and educational games as &lsquo;experimental&rsquo;</li>
<li>More students are taking online courses, most prefer a blended experience, few have taken a MOOC and few say they would use a digital badge as part of a job application</li>
<li>Students own 2-3 internet-capable devices; smartphone and tablet ownership has grown fastest but laptops are still regarded as the most important devices for academic work</li>
<li>Students value their digital privacy and prefer to keep their social and academic lives separate; when communicating with staff, they prefer F2F, email and the VLE</li>
</ul>
<p>A separate survey of over 700 US students found that <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/10/21/study-documents-how-much-students-text-during-class">92% use their mobile devices for non-class activities during class times</a>.&nbsp; Main offences are texting (by 86% of students), checking the time (79%), e-mail (68%), social networking (66%), web surfing (38%) and gaming (8%).</p>
<p>And a study by Noel-Levitz shows that <a href="http://blog.noellevitz.com/2013/11/07/older-students-satisfied-online-learning-traditional-aged-students/">older students are more satisfied with online learning</a> than younger ones, despite the latter having grown up in an online world.</p>

<p>Pearson has just published its annual <a href="http://www.pearsonlearningsolutions.com/higher-education/social-media-survey.php">Social Media in Higher Education survey</a> which shows that academic professional use of social media has lagged behind personal use but has increased each year.&nbsp; A majority of faculty now use social media in a professional context (any aspect of their profession outside of teaching) but use of social media for teaching purposes has lagged even more.&nbsp; This appears to be mainly due to concerns about privacy and about maintaining the class as a private space for free and open discussion, plus some concerns about the integrity of student submissions by this method.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello,&nbsp; I joined the University of the Arts London UAL in 2003 and since 2007 has been researching and developing open educational practice and OER content communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am the <a href="http://dial.myblog.arts.ac.uk/about-dial/">DIAL</a> project manager 'Digital Integration Into Arts Learning' part of the JISC UK Developing digital literacies programme.&nbsp; I recently completed a <a href="http://www8.open.ac.uk/score/fellows">SCORE fellowship</a> at the Open University and I'm the initiator of <a href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/">http://process.arts.ac.uk</a> an open online resource sharing day-to-day arts practice and research of arts staff, students, alumni and practitioners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been involved in the JISC UKOER programmes phases 2 &amp; 3 ALTO &amp; ALTO UK and have an interest in UAL's Open Educational Practice advancements, building on UALs growing reputation as forward thinking university in this newly developing area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Groups i would be interested in are ... creating MOOCS from user generated content and open content communities. Independently driven MOOCS and agile development of MOOCS. And Digital Literacy all aspects but maybe focus on digital identities -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two or more projects linked to the DIAL <a href="http://dial.myblog.arts.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://dial.myblog.arts.ac.uk/</a> project and <a href="http://process.arts.ac.uk" target="_blank">process.arts.ac.uk</a> <br /><br />During these projects we aim to develop and design a pilot MOOC with specific pathways for bespoke training in this field.<br /><br />Including:<br /><br /><a href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/category/project-groups/things-unlimited" target="_blank">http://process.arts.ac.uk/category/project-groups/things-unlimited</a><br /><br /><a href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/category/project-groups/professional-online-identities" target="_blank">http://process.arts.ac.uk/category/project-groups/professional-online-identities</a></p>

              <title>Chapter 1. An invitation and a departure</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7510</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7510</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>If the invitation had arrived in the regular mail, it would have been embossed on heavy, high quality, cream paper in an envelope, addressed in a perfect, copperplate hand, making a satisfying, &lsquo;thwup&rsquo; as it landed on the doormat. It might even have contained a stamped, addressed envelope and reply card to minimise my trouble and to encourage me to respond. There was, however, no satisfying, &lsquo;thwup&rsquo;, no envelope, no high quality paper and no embossed card. The invitation arrived without ceremony, electronically, sans even a &lsquo;ping&rsquo; to announce its appearance. I was reading it when a colleague bounced past: &lsquo;What ho, old thing&rsquo; he hooted, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s that? An invitation to visit one of those MOOC thingies? Rum coves, those. I once had dealings with one; just got away by the skin of my teeth. If you&rsquo;re going to accept, you&rsquo;d better break out the explorer&rsquo;s kit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, I like a challenge as much as the next e-learning professional, so I dragged the trunk down from the top of the wardrobe and filled it with necessities such as a pith helmet, khaki shirt and jodhpurs, stout leather walking boots, a butterfly net, a machete and a year&rsquo;s supply of, &lsquo;The Lady&rsquo;. As I did so, a white rabbit ran past, clutching a pocket watch and gasping, &lsquo;Oh my ears and whiskers, I&rsquo;m late!&rsquo; &nbsp;And so was I.&nbsp; Heaving the trunk onto my shoulders, I galumphed after the rabbit, caught my toe on the edge of a sleeping jabberwock and found myself falling towards my laptop&hellip;</p>
<p>After a long descent, I landed with a bone-jangling, &lsquo;SPLAT&rsquo;. Looking around, I found myself in a mangrove swamp full of salty water (could this swamp be made of tears?) at the edge of a shimmering landscape over which hung a flashing, neon sign, &lsquo;Welcome to OLDS-MOOC&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The rabbit raced past me again. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m late, I&rsquo;m late. I&rsquo;ve missed the introduction. I won&rsquo;t ever catch up&rsquo;.</p>
<p>My trunk floated by. I grabbed it, donned the pith helmet, jodphurs, shirt and boots and took firm hold of the machete. The butterfly net could wait and it didn&rsquo;t look as though I&rsquo;d have time to settle down to read, &lsquo;The Lady&rsquo; but at least I&rsquo;d had the forethought to grab my tablet as I fell towards the laptop. Perhaps it would be useful.</p>
<p>Striding through the mangroves towards the desert at their edge (a strange landscape, this), the shimmering horizon started to become clearer. Or at least it shimmered less. The isle wasn&rsquo;t so much full of noises as of words floating through the ether. Written words, spoken words, words in real time, words in deferred time, wordles, wall wishers, words, words, words. Now I understood why the mangroves were growing in a swamp of tears. I collapsed under the flashing sign. What had I done by accepting the invitation?</p>
<p>I gazed at the spinning vortex of words, reached out and grabbed a copy of the invitation I&rsquo;d received, smoothing it out so I could examine its content more fully. What a boon to find that something as apparently ephemeral as an electronic missive remained uncrumpled and unstained, despite my inelegant arrival in OLDS-MOOC. The content was as easy to read, and as difficult to understand, as the day it was keyed in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, pull yourself together woman,&rsquo; I encouraged myself. &lsquo;Why did you come here? What did you want to get out of the experience?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Four things immediately,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to find my way around OLDS-MOOC landscape, find out what I can do in any MOOC that&rsquo;s different from what I can already do, identify a useful project to work on and, with luck, find some other MOOCizens, preferably each with their own pith helmet at least, to form an intrepid band of explorers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Already I could tell that my first goal was going to be difficult. The spinning, dancing, jumping, falling, feinting, leaping, galloping and, frankly, dizzying array of words had parted slightly, only to reveal an equally spinning, dancing, jumping, falling, feinting, leaping, galloping and, frankly, dizzying array of different paths ahead. Which should I follow? I tossed my pith helmet into the air, &lsquo;Heads I try to identify a well-defined route that I want to explore further, tails I plough on regardless to see what happens if I don&rsquo;t have any definite ideas in my head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The pith helmet rose into the whirling vortex. This may have been a mistake. Would it simply be sucked up into the maw of the MOOC? Would I ever see it again? It stopped rising. It hovered. The rabbit rushed through the periphery of my vision, hotly pursued by several baying videoconferencing demons. Time stopped. The pith helmet began to fall. Heads.</p>
<p>It had been a long day. I needed to rest before considering which to follow of the definite routes I could see emerging from the darkening landscape&hellip;</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Screwing up my eyes against the dazzling light emerging from a warren of alleys that had appeared overnight, I saw the flashing sign now read, &lsquo;Dreambazaar&rsquo;. After giving myself a stern talking to in order to stiffen my sinews and motivate myself to pursue my goals, I picked up my machete, attached it to my belt, placed the pith helmet on my head and set off towards the noise and bustle of the alleys. A few minutes later, I staggered out into the desert again. So many things to see, so many artefacts to examine. Could I absorb all that information or would my mind simply snap? Would I be carried off to recover by the para-emedics who were loitering by each entrance to the bazaar, taking bets on which visitor would make it through the maze to the other side? How I wished I&rsquo;d brought my copies of, &lsquo;The Lady&rsquo; with me. There&rsquo;s nothing so good at putting things in focus as reading an article about how to make the perfect cup of tea, what? Indeed, just thinking about such an article refreshed me and, after a few false starts, I evaded the para-emedics and made it through the maze, leaving<a title="Research methodology, dissemination and publication" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7147" target="_blank"> my own artefact</a> behind me.</p>
<p>Having visited the bazaar, it was clear that there were other inhabitants of and visitors to OLDS-MOOC. I&rsquo;d seen the evidence. Now all I needed to do was to find my intrepid band so that we could explore together and maybe even add something to the landscape as we moved towards the mountains of OLDS.</p>
<p>But how to find those dear companions? An electronic missive floated towards me. It was a summary of my journey so far and included details of where to go next. I&rsquo;d noticed some of these missives earlier, but there were so many of them that I&rsquo;d had to dodge them as they fell &ndash; the butterfly net would have been useful, after all. Reading on, I realised that I could return to the bazaar and leave a note expressing my interest in certain artefacts, waiting for the merchant to contact me. I could also make use of my tablet to create a request for chums, place the request in an electronic bottle called a &lsquo;Google group thread&rsquo; and throw that into the ether to see whether anything came back. Neither option was tremendously attractive; after all, it was unlikely I&rsquo;d know any of the respondents and I had always heeded my parents&rsquo; advice not to talk to strangers.</p>
<p>Feeling a sharp pain in my chest, I put my hand into my shirt pocket, wondering about the lump that had suddenly appeared there. &nbsp;Withdrawing my hand, I found I was holding a computer key marked, &lsquo;Panic button&rsquo;.&nbsp; Instructions floated in the air around it; &lsquo;If at any point you feel uncomfortable or threatened, if you find a message that you deem unsuitable, press this button to report it.&rsquo; The button wheezed, shuddered and turned itself into an electronic approximation of a safety net which I folded up and put it inside my pith helmet for safe keeping before I ventured back into the bazaar to leave some expressions of interest for different merchants. I re-examined my own sales booth and found some notes there from other adventurers. I left the bazaar, sat down on the edge of the OLDS-MOOC foothills, got out my tablet and wrote <a title="Message in a bottle (Google groups)" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/olds-mooc-open/GFPHOuArG5A" target="_blank">a short message asking if anyone would like to join a team leaving for my final destination</a>. I put the message in the electronic bottle and threw it into the briny ether. Then I waited. And I waited. And I waited some more, ignoring the incessant tweeting from the e-birds hovering in the fog beginning to surround the bazaar.</p>
<p>Those jolly hockeysticks days at school slipped into my mind. Cold autumn days, gym skirts, waiting to be picked for a team. The shame of not being chosen. The bullying. The scorn. Could it all be about to happen again?</p>
<p>Perhaps I should set up a camp for those who might want to join. Yes, that would be my next move. <a title="Study Circle: Beginnings and endings(?): from Unit 0 to publication" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2821" target="_blank">A cosy camp</a> with good food and good company; a resting place before we ventured deeper into the jungle at the base of the mountains. But would anyone travel with me?</p>
<p>Only slightly reassured, I prepared to set up that cosy camp realising that I'd missed a 'convergence' of MOOCizens while battling the lag beasts surrounding OLDS-MOOC.That must have been why the videoconferencing demons were pursuing the white rabbit; missing the event was no excuse. I'd simply have to find time on the journey to access the recordings and hope that they were engaging enough to distract me from that article in 'The Lady' about.how to persuade Cook to shop more frugally.</p>
<p>There would doubtless be more hidden obstacles to overcome and more fearsome monsters to slay before finally arriving at the mountains of OLDS where the treasure was supposed to be located according to the map that floated to the ground in front of me. Or was it? The map&rsquo;s outline shifted as I reached out for it, then the map folded in on itself and disappeared in a spark of electronic implosion. An electronic howl sounded in the gathering dusk.</p>
<p>The adventure continues&hellip;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[Here I will post regular reflections on how this is going for me. Currently I'm a little lost but hope that feeling disappear soon!

I work in academic development and regularly assist teaching staff with learning design. I've just started a project to teach bookkeeping through a storytelling approach and we have just finished filming the ten videos that will tell the stories. My son, a film maker, is currently making them for me and I can't wait to see the finished product! I will then design all the support structures to go with those films and PebblePad is my chosen place for student reflections and recording of activities this will be accompanied by an iBook made using iBook Author and embedded into iTunesU. I'm hoping that's not too many tools for students as I feel a bit lost with all these different tools; I guess this will help me think through strategies to alleviate these problems. ]]></description>

<p>What are the benefits to them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do traditional aged learners reallly lack communication skills or do they just communicate differently using cell phones, social networking and other technology supported tools. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a research based project. &nbsp;Identify resources and at least develop a draft presentation on this subject.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How you might go about bringing that change</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><br />What is your pedagogical approach? Which technologies will you use to implement it, and how? Qual &egrave; il tuo approccio pedagogico? Quali tecnologie si utilizza per la sua attuazione, e in che modo?<br /><br />Approcci pedagogici: costruttivismo, doing by doing, imparare ad imparare, lavoro di<br />gruppo, esercitazioni e meta analisi.<br /><br />Tecnologie: wiki, cloud, sw mappe mentali, video,</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Well, I've worked out that I haven't structured this as well as I might have done. Really, I should have created a new blog artefact and linked to it from here. Instead, it looks as though I'm going to have many clouds - they don't lend themselves to long entries, so individual musings per day. Why don't I create a blog? Because I already have a couple and I simply can't be bothered to set up yet another blog, particularly as it won't get used after the OLDS MOOC experience. Does that sound cynical? I reckon it's realistic. I know how I operate: I've had a lot of experience working with me and I don't feel the need to share my OLDS MOOC thoughts on a long term basis. I'm beginning to get the hang of this thing, I feel and I'm starting to consider the design aspects but maybe more from the point of view of what works for me rather than more generally. On the other hand, what this suggests is that the environment is sufficiently flexible to allow me to take my preferred approach, so maybe the mercury-like tendency to slide away when you think you've pinned it down is a benefit rather than the annoyance it feels like at present. Back to my question of yesterday - is a MOOC just a collection of loosely (or more tightly if there's an overarching goal) related collection of PLEs? And are these really PLEs or are they constrained by the artefacts suggested by the designers... A semi-structured VLE, maybe? So far, I haven't seen anything innovative or even new about this environment, We were doing similar things years ago but they didn't have a label! At least the fog is lifting, and that emphasises my view that it's essential to experience a tool or environment to design in a manner appropriate to it. This is not to promote technology-driven design; rather, it's a reflection that too many designers develop learning activities unsuited to where they take place. This may be something as simple as providing an instruction using inappropriate terms, but there's far too much of it about in my experience. It would be so easy to check things out before designing...</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Lu&iacute;s Salema. I&rsquo;m from Portugal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a teacher of Portuguese language and literature, latin and greek, at secondary school.</p>
<p>I worked at the University of the Algarve and I&rsquo;m a on line tutor at Universidade Aberta (Portuguese Open University).</p>
<p>I have a Master in Sciences of Speech and Hearing. My dissertation was in the intersection field of dialectology, experimental phonetics and computer language processing.</p>
<p>I have a post graduate course in Information Management and School Libraries.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m a PhD student at Universidade Aberta (Distance Education and E-learning).</p>
<p>As a researcher, my interests are language learning, online language learning and linguistics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very curious about history, classical studies and about different countries and cultures.</p>
<p>I like to travel and to learn more. I think this new online experience will be great. I will have the opportunity to learn more about learning design and about technology, with people from different countries and with different approaches to these areas.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Lu&iacute;s</p>]]></description>

              <title>@isharacomix: My Dream: A MOOC that explores low-level hacking</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7071</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7071</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>@isharacomix: A low-level and historical MOOC</p>

<p>One of the most inspiring things I've seen in my life has been the Raspberry Pi. A low-cost, credit-card sized computer that can be used for anything from OS development to robotics. I got to go to a talk last night where a bunch of local hackers got together and showed us the cool things they've done with their Raspberry Pis. At a price of only $35, it would be awesome to see a MOOC that explores low-level computing.</p>

<p>Computers have become so powerful and abstract that many computer scientists can succeed in school without ever understanding what goes on under the hood. Special purpose computers have been replaced by general purpose and consumer hardware, and because there aren't really jobs for "6502 Assembly Programmers" anymore, you don't see students signing up for the classes in earnest.</p>

<p>The Change I would like to see?</p>

<p>I want to see a course that addresses these concepts - we introduce them just barely at State with our "Assembly and Software Tools" course, but I want students to explore old computing in more detail. Given the appeal of development on the web and cloud these days, lower level hackery isn't nearly as glamorous. Development on constrained devices made coders more like wizards, being able to squeeze out amazing things like games in less than 32KB of space. Not only is it interesting in its own right, it helps expose new programmers to the mindset of their predecessors.</p>

<p>What I'm going to do?</p>

<p>I've already made up my mind and decided that I want to make a MOOC on this topic. This is how I'm going to do my final project for several of the classes I'm taking this semester, developing resources and infrastructure to support this MOOC on my own, without the help of big powerhouses like Coursera. Even if it doesn't go worldwide, I just want to be able to expose it to my fellow students at State.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>My dream is to help create a MOOC that will enable world wide <strong>Digital Literacy.</strong></p>
<p>I envision a <strong>map of learning activities</strong> for raising ones <strong>digital literacy</strong> competencies. Learners could jump in at any time, anywhere on the map,&nbsp;and find guidance to master that particular skill set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The map would be dynamic, continually being improved and expanded, much like in wikipedia.</p>
<h2><strong>Structure</strong></h2>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong><a title="digital literacy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy">Digital Literacy</a></strong> includes an enormous range of competencies.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>Mapping</strong> out the ever growing skill sets could perhaps be structured as a massive <strong>outline</strong> with collapsing/expanding branches (or a <strong>MindMap</strong>)</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong><a title="Multi-level Marketing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing#Setup">Multi-level Marketing</a></strong> techniques - newbies would sign up and be given a number of tokens/coins. They would offer to pay a coach/mentor/teacher coins &nbsp;in order to master a particular competency. Eventually they would advance into the mentor-coach role and pay their former mentor coach for back-up or support.</p>]]></description>

I have little concept of what we are trying to do or where we should do it, or how, or with whom. Hopefully, meaning will begin to form...</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm loking at creating something practical for use in my work as an Educational Technologist in University College Dublin.&nbsp; Perhaps something that bridges the gap between theory and practice - the gap between all the thories, models used in designing OERs (Bloom, Gagne, Salmon etc) and putting them into practice as an engaging learning.</p>
<p>I have recently completed <a href="http://venture-lab.org/education">Stanford's Designing a New Learning Environment</a> and will be interested in comparing the two MOOCs. The project was the best part of the Stanford MOOC. OLDS requires a greater time commitment so hope I can keep up</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Massive Open Online Courses now enroll millions of students. MOOCs and their implications nearly toppled a president at a major research university last spring, and disruptions like these are sure to continue. Yet these extraordinary developments do not by themselves constitute success for open education. As we seek to move &ldquo;beyond content,&rdquo; there are principles we have not yet discovered or fully articulated, conceptual frameworks we must revisit, and challenges we must acknowledge and address. By synthesizing, or at least mashing up, Seymour Papert&rsquo;s &ldquo;yearning for megachange&rdquo; and Gregory Bateson&rsquo;s &ldquo;ecologies of mind,&rdquo; I will suggest some ways the open education movements might avoid reinforcing the worst models of computer-aided instruction, and instead lead the way toward deep, meaningful, and enduring educational reform.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>We are  pleased to report there has been lots of interest in the OLDS MOOC (Open  Learning Design Studio Massive Open Online Course) over the last few months with  over 800 people having registered their interest.</p>
<p>After  consultation with many of those planning to participate or present, we have also  confirmed the start and end dates for the OLDS MOOC.&nbsp; The MOOC will run from  <strong>10<sup>th</sup> January &ndash; 13<sup>th</sup> March 2013</strong>.&nbsp; This is slightly later  than originally advertised, but takes into account that October and November are  often busy times for Further and Higher Education professionals and allows those  commencing post-graduate courses to settle into those  first</p>
<p>The course  website is currently being built and you will be able to see the course taking  shape over the next few months at <a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/">www.olds.ac.uk</a>.&nbsp; There will be monthly updates on  the website blog and the course has a Twitter account at  OLDS-MOOC.</p>
<p>We are  grateful for your continuing interest in this free, open online course on  curriculum and learning design.</p>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL PRESS RELEASE: </strong>The Open University&rsquo;s Institute of Educational Technology  is leading the first Open Learning Design Studio MOOC (Massive Open Online  Course) focusing on the theme of curriculum design with OERs, to be held in  Autumn 2012.</p>
<p>This course will be valuable for anyone seeking to develop their  professional skills and experience in curriculum design, learning design and use  of OERs in education. In particular the course will appeal to new and  established HE and FE lecturers, to those completing professional certificates  in teaching, and to researchers and managers of teaching and learning  innovation.</p>
<p>The course aims to (1) provide a rich open learning  experience for teaching and learning professionals (2) build greater skills and  understandings of Curriculum and Learning Design theories and frameworks, with  an emphasis on the reuse of OERs (3) help participants appreciate the need for  careful educational crafting of learning experience and associated curriculum  structures and (4) empower participants to become more effective educators and  change agents in their own context.</p>
<p>Eight core themes will provide the focus for weekly  activities, speaker presentations, discussions and postings of useful resources  and tools. It will give access to, and the opportunity to learn from, successful  UK JISC and HEA projects in addition to some of the best of European  initiatives. The resulting aggregate resource will remain online for future  use.</p>
<p>The term MOOC stands for &lsquo;Massive&rsquo; Open Online Course and  we expect to achieve an educational equivalent of this by offering truly open  opportunities to introduce new themes, debate topics and self-select material.  In addition, a basic underlying core pathway will offer an entry route for those  new to open courses or who have limited time.</p>
<p>Further details regarding how to get involved, start  dates, and core themes will be announced during the summer. In the meantime,  please register your interest here: <a title="blocked::http://goo.gl/j5jIe" href="http://goo.gl/j5jIe">http://goo.gl/j5jIe</a> (or use the embedded form below) so we can keep you informed.

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6255</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6255</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.gold.ac.uk/gleu/futuretense/ft-banner-220px.jpg" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /> Goldsmiths Learning Enhancement Unit is hosting an international  conference to profile individuals or groups of staff and projects, that  have shaped, challenged or shifted learning and teaching in their higher   education contexts.  There will be space and opportunity for engaging  with potential futures of technology-enhanced learning as well as  interrogating what familiar concepts such as &lsquo;interdisciplinarity&rsquo; and  &lsquo;research-based teaching&rsquo;  really mean in practice.</p>
<p>In an exciting collaboration, Martin Conreen, who lectures in  Goldsmiths' Design Department, and Mark Miodownik, Professor of  Materials and Society at University College and Royal Institute  Christmas Lecturer, will be giving the keynote.</p>
<p>Other key speakers include education campaigner and journalist  Melissa Benn, Glasgow School of Arts education leader Professor Linda  Drew, Goldsmiths cultural scholar Professor John Hutnyk, audio learning  innovator Andrew Middleton and Kings College neuroscientist and Wellcome  Collection adviser Richard Wingate.</p>
<p>The event is free - <a href="http://futuretense.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">but you must register</a> -&nbsp; and <a href="http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/travel-fund" target="_blank">you may be able to get funding to attend</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A note from me on Cloudworks...</strong></p>
<p>I first encountered Cloudworks while studying on H800 last year, so this seemed like a good place to create a space around the event.&nbsp; I think I might be a little rusty, so any feedback on my attempt is most welcome!</p>
