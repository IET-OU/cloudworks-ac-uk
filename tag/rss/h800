              <title>E-Design Template - Healthy Eating Model</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11664</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11664</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I thought the e-Design template was clear and easy to understand, providing timings and task criteria for each action, rather like a rubric. Unlike the 4Ts model which I liked for its fluidity, I liked the e-Design model as it provided a "scaffold" upon which to build knowledge and understanding. There is the opportunity for both teacher-led and student-managed learning. The e-Design also helps you view the "bigger picture" in that it can provide an overview of progression as the course evolves.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I particularly like the fluid nature of the 4Ts model - the fact that there is no requisite order, and every decision impacts upon the other dimensions. While this means moving between each of the 4Ts and continually tweaking them, it ensures continuous improvement. I particularly liked the swimming pool lanes used in the link below.</p>]]></description>

              <title>How to tie your shoelaces</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11632</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator &nbsp;Teacher and Parent</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>This occurs with parent (who is also a teacher) and eight year old son in home context with aim that now many shoes the child wishes to wear have shoelaces they need to be more independent and learn to tie shoes themselves.</em></p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Child to be able to tie shoes independently in a variety of contexts.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>Went through following list of instructions &ndash; firstly with assistance from parent, then child with support of parent and then child on own with parent observing and finally child independently.</p>
<p>Tying Shoelaces instructions:</p>
<p><strong>1.Place the shoes on a flat surface.</strong> Let the laces fall to either side of the shoe</p>
<p><strong>2. Tie a basic knot.</strong> Take both laces and thread one lace over the other and then pull them tight. They should form a knot in the middle of the shoe</p>
<p><strong>3. Make a loop with one of the laces.</strong> You should be holding the lace between your thumb and your first two fingers.</p>
<p><strong>4. Use your other hand to wrap the other lace around the loop.</strong> You should be holding it over your fingers and around the loop. Wrap the other lace toward you rather than away from you.</p>
<p><strong>5. Pull the shoelace through the hole to form another loop.</strong> You should use your free hand to pull the shoelace through. There should now be a hole between the looped shoelace and the wrapped shoelace. Pull the wrapped shoelace through so it comes through this hole.</p>
<p><strong>6. Hold both loops and pull them tight.</strong> You should now have a nicely tied shoe.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>Expected outcomes were around need to cover particular steps more than once and this differs dependent upon different children. Unexpected outcomes were that child adapted technique to find own way more like &lsquo;bunny ears&rsquo; approach to tying shoes and continued with this independently. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>That there is more than one way to teach a simple (or complex task) and this has to be tailored to a personalised learning approach.&nbsp; To also adapt to the capabilities of the student and be flexible to their approach and recognise the value of this.</p>

              <title>Kelly Williams: Moving from face to face workshops to flexible online/distance learning </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11621</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11621</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>Workshop/network facilitator </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>HE (Higher Education) led workshops for small scale primary and secondary classroom Action Research (AR) projects as CPD (Continuing Professional Development) or school research focus. The AR projects to form case studies for analysis and research by the lead university.<br /> <br /> </em></p>
<p><em>Initial workshops took place face to face either in whole school INSET days or &lsquo;twilight&rsquo; workshops in the nearest university provider to the school. 2<sup>nd</sup> &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup> workshops initially delivered face to face but due to realities of time-poor teaching profession increasingly looked to move to on-line/distance learning offering after analysis of project feedback.<br /> <br /> The key actors were the lead HE Education research unit, with HE partners also facilitating sessions and teaching professionals from primary and secondary sector<br /> <br /> Focus for the workshops and AR was &lsquo;Expansive Education&rsquo; http://www.expansiveeducation.net/page-1730518</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>To achieve improved engagement amongst participants after the initial workshop and increase final written AR reports.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions (KW &ndash; me)</h2>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project sign up request from school (or university) request lead member name and member e-mails from the school for enrolment on GroupSpaces (GS) system</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School and joining members receive welcome e-mail from Groupspaces system inviting them to confirm membership by logging in and setting a password &ndash; they then have access to member only area with all workshop resources and case study library.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead member also receives e-mail from KW welcoming to network (and making sure system invitation has not been caught by firewall)</p>
<p><strong>issue 1 : participants needed to set passwords for site &ndash; unclear reset procedure &ndash; many e-mails asking for manual re-set &ndash; time consuming</strong></p>
<p><strong>issue 2 &ndash; Groupspaces site stops providing backend support 2015 &ndash; migration of full project listing and material to new group hosting Wild Apricot</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notify university tutor of school enrolled. University tutor sends out e-mail to invite to AR1 workshop. If no workshop scheduled tutor sets date and books room for AR1 workshop.</p>
<p><strong>issue 3: HE partner tutors variable in engagement and understanding of GS system I often ended up organising for them</strong></p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tutor informs KW of workshop, KW posts to website event page with map and sends system invitation to all enrolled for it.</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortnight prior to workshop GS reminds teachers to RSVP to event. Week prior to workshop GS prompts again and reminds attendees about workshop</p>
<p><strong>issue 4: automated e-mailing not always reliable, due to firewall and sheer volume of e-mails some teachers received</strong></p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AR1 workshop &ndash; Tutor and participant resources on Dropbox &ndash; Facilitator Guide, Powerpoint&nbsp; and agenda template also resources R1 &ndash; 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>issue 5: Dropbox more widely used &ndash; participants reluctant to engage in GS site to the barrier of logging in</strong></p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attendees go away from AR1 workshop with idea for AR question and tutor sets date for next workshop AR2 with them, if possible.</p>
<p><strong>issue 6: High rates of attrition from AR1 to 2 &ndash; offered Skype or Adobe Connect session for AR2 and AR3 &ndash; much higher rates of uptake</strong></p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to AR2 KW send invites and prompts out, tutor sends out e-mail to lead member reminding them to bring Emerging AR plan (R4) to next workshop</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AR2 workshop &ndash; consolidate AR question and help teachers on path to AR3 - presenting findings</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AR3 workshop presenting findings &ndash; then on to publishing final report on Wordpress</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>Expected outcomes: &nbsp;More participants finishing course of workshops, greater involvement of staff researchers from the university, small increase in final reports submitted.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Unexpected outcomes: More international schools participated wholly via distance learning, further research and development of the project with TEL (Technology Enhanced learning Department) of project resources on the internal learning network (this did not quite work as more passwords and logging in required, developed links with Aberdeen Universities TEPL (Technology Enhanced Professional Learning Unit)</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>The success or failure of the AR projects came down the motivation for the teachers taking part. If the school lead was very engaged and active&nbsp; &ndash; so was their cohort. For these schools offering a more flexible way of taking part not only helped with time issue but gave them direct access to the lead researchers on Expansive Education project through smaller online sessions<br /> <br /> Some teachers were not quite sure why they were taking part and barely made it through the first workshop &ndash; usually a head had simply &lsquo;signed them up&rsquo; (it seemed hoping that research CPD would have some sort of magical positive effect ) If there was any perceived problem in the process (ie logins, time between workshops, change of senior management) these teachers would quickly disengage.</em></p>

              <title>Creating a visual Learning Aid for Ebsco&#39;s Discovery Service</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11620</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11620</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title:&nbsp;</strong>Using Discovery - Visual Learning Aid</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:&nbsp;</strong>Marie Smith</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>When they arrive, many of our first year students have a &ldquo;Google mentality&rdquo; and are used to typing their essay titles into Google to find information. Ebsco's Discovery emulates Google in that it finds articles, books and other academic material through a single search. However, it is so much <strong>more</strong> than this. I wanted to help our <strong>first year</strong> students make the transition from further education to higher education, and showing them how to search electronic resources with confidence would be a step towards achieving this.</p>
<p>Ebsco's Discovery is a search engine that finds articles, books and other academic material through a single search. I was looking at how students were&nbsp; using the Discovery service, how successful their searches were, and how satisfied they were with the Discovery search tool in general. The qualitative data from snap focus groups, along with quantitative data gleaned from a simple questionnaire I designed, and first-hand experience &ndash; talking to students and showing them how to use the Discovery tool while working on the Enquiries Desk - suggested that they weren't using filters to refine their searches and were getting too many results.</p>
<p><strong>Task&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>To provide a simple, visual learning aid that breaks down the steps of a Discovery search. To improve the student experience, enabling students to search Discovery with confidence to find meaningful results.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>I hoped to produce a simple flowchart &ndash; a visual learning tool that would guide students through the process of searching Discovery and refining their results. Success criteria = Students becoming more confident in their abilities, and ready to embrace more in-depth search techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>I discovered that I was rubbish at producing flowcharts - and just to reiterate, the aim of my project was to produce a SIMPLE, visual learning aid. My flowchart was anything BUT simple! It also didn&rsquo;t break down the steps in the way that I hoped it would, and didn&rsquo;t convey a lot of the information that I wanted to share with our students. It was time to go back to the drawing board<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>In the end I decided to use a tree diagram as a visual learning aid. While I was reading about visual literacy, I discovered that the most memorable visualizations are the ones that feature natural images. This being the case, I decided to make an actual tree a key feature of my visual learning aid. Completing this project was a valuable lesson. I found the courage to admit when my design wasn't working, and began thinging about other courses of action. In the end I was much happier with my visual learning aid, which is now available of the University Library website as both an animation, and as a poster. It is also used by the Faculty Librarians in their teaching, and I use it during my one-to-ones with students.</p>]]></description>

              <title>ESOL and Mobile Learning</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10388</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10388</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>I was an ESOL teacher in a community setting which had been relatively technology-free. I suppose I was lucky to have an interactive whiteboard (which frequently did not work) connected to an extremely old laptop running XP.</em></p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>The room in which I was teaching was spacious, with tables and chairs and only1 laptop, connected to the Interactive Smartboard. I planned my sessions for a class of about 10 students, however, due to changes in rules for childcare, only recruited 7 students.</em></p>
<p><em>I was not able to use most of the Internet sites and tools I wanted to as the browsers on the laptop could not be updated, except by the local council IT department, who had never responded to any requests for updating. In addition, certain sites, eg. YouTube, were blocked and access to the Internet was restricted by a convoluted process of applying for a temporary account, lasting 1 day. </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em>My class had a module on the college VLE. However, the VLE was not very ESOL-friendly and so had not used it with the students. I hoped by using mobile-learning to find an alternative online space for the class.</em></p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>I wanted to find an alternative way to use technology with the group, take advantage of existing mobile phone skills and develop digital literacy with tablets.</em></p>
<p><em>My learners came from diverse countries, including refugee and asylum-seeker populations and I was also aware of an existing digital divide. Fortunately, there was a small amount of money available to purchase some tablet computers. I investigated the possibility of using them by connecting to a portable wifi hotspot (initially borrowed from the technician). I hoped to address the digital divide by prioritising access to tablets for students without Smartphones. I also included a trip to the local library, encouraging students to join and use computers there.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Actions</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;1. I purchased 4 tablets, researched apps useful for teaching and learning English language and downloaded onto tablets.</p>
<p>2. Introduced tablets to the students and demonstrated some useful apps for spelling and grammar that they could download onto their smartphones. Students liked using the tablets and did so in pairs or groups of 3. Some students were able to download apps and use their own phones.</p>
<p>3, Experimented with mindmapping apps for vocabulary and planning presentations and writing on the tablets.</p>
<p>4. Presented sessions on Internet safety and creating strong passwords.</p>
<p>5. Set up an online virtual classroom space using the app Edmodo. This app is safe for the learners as it does not require them to supply any personal information or email addresses. First session with Edmodo, students introduced themselves and got used to sending messages to each other and teacher.I linked in some lesson objects I had created online for grammar and punctuation practice.</p>
<p>6. Also linked in a visual noticeboard (Lino) as a collaborative space for showing student work and building up links to videos and other resources around topics. Our first topic was Media-Cinema and Films.</p>
<p>7. Students used mindmapping to plan presentations, then created them using PowerPoint. (We were able to borrow a couple of ancient laptops which had PowerPoint 2003 and were just about able to surf the Internet for images).They also read film reviews, planned and wrote their own film review.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The students enjoyed using the tablets and got used to using Edmodo app on their phones. Edmodo has a similar look to Facebook and students used it between classes for communicating with me and each other.</p>
<p>However, the class had under-recruited and was stopped at the end of the autumn term so my experiment was rather short-lived.</p>
<p>For the purposes of getting students through the compulsory assessments, the tablets usefulness was limited, however. They were good for practising with apps, recording audio and video for role play, listening and pronunciation practice and surfing the Internet but a desktop in the main college was necessary for typing up writing and printing out research materials from the Internet, as we did not have access to a printer in the community centre.</p>
<p>There were some apps I really wanted to use in the classroom, such as Kahoot, but couldn't because of the dodgy browsers on the XP computer connected to the Smartboard.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>I think that the experiment was a useful experience. It was quite frustrating at times with the unreliable wifi and it revealed many challenges to be overcome.</p>
<p>I believe that, if more money becomes available, more tablets and also new laptops should be invested in to help develop digital and employability skills in community settings.</p>
<p>At the time, I also took on the editing of the community ESOL magazine, which gave me the opportunity to visit other community ESOL classes and find out what teachers were doing with technology. I found that most classes also did not have access to computers, however, some enterprising students had taken the initiative and set up a WhatsApp group called &lsquo;ESOL Mums&rsquo;, which they used for sending photos and recipes to each other and messages about the class. They reported that they found this helpful for their writing skills.</p>
<p>Mobile learning has lots of potential for English language students and most students like talking about and using their phones for learning.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Healthy eating as a 4TS model</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Readability&nbsp;</strong>- the model is well explained. The explanation of symbolism and how it relates to the model helped me to understand the content.</li>
<li><strong>Expressiveness</strong> - the model was presented both visually and with an explanation of the visual depiction. The explanation of how the components combined and worked together through a cyclical, iterative process made it clear how the model works in the learning situation.</li>
<li><strong>Utility</strong> - the model was explained clearly both generally and in relation to the scenario. The critical analysis that was offered helped to see where the model could be further developed.</li>

<p><strong>Healthy eating in an e-Design template</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Readability</strong> - a brief surface outline/explanation of the model. Images/models were used in place of explanation.</li>
<li><strong>Expressiveness</strong> - almost a 'factual' stance, quite matter of fact. Diagrams not explained in text form requiring reader to work out and connect what is going on.</li>
<li><strong>Utility</strong> - lack of explanation of what happens at each stage. Assumes each stage will be successful - does not consider things going wrong, adapting for any issues etc.</li>

              <title>Tracey Adams’s design narrative: Advanced clinical assessment protocol workshop</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10351</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10351</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>I was asked to assist a group of senior clinicians in discussing a complex clinical assessment protocol for their country.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>The proposed learning event was a one day workshop. I hadn&rsquo;t met the clinicians before or visited their country so had limited knowledge of the key personalities involved and the healthcare provision available.&nbsp; I was not given information about the room, the number of people attending but I was assured that they were &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; and needed a critical &rdquo;deep dive&rdquo; of information rather than introductory basic lectures.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The key actors were my colleague, the Country manager (who invited me) and the team manager of the clinicians. In addition there were clinicians from independent clinics attending (that is to say there were a mix of internal and external staff present). </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>From the information I received I was under the impression that the clinicians had a belief that there was a protocol available, that they should be following it to be able to better advise potential patients, to get better value for money by improving patient selection and a desire to provide the best possible care for their patients. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>According to my research there is no published standard protocol available globally however the group assembled feel that a protocol should be provided. </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>In my experience of this clinical assessment in different countries and from published literature, the clinical assessment protocols vary depending on the age of the subject, the equipment available, the experience and the needs of the clinician (what they are trying to show to whom). </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The task I was trying to achieve was to bring together ideas in the room concerning appropriate basic test criteria to ascertain whether a subject is a candidate for a particular clinical treatment. In order for the outcome to be successful the discussion needed to be owned by the clinicians attending the event and not imposed by me or managers present.&nbsp; To get to that conclusion they must first decide who they are testing, why and what they need to know (for the patient, for them, for funders, for research).</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The measure of success for me would be if we could produce a list of tests that the majority of clinicians present thought were required, appropriate and achievable given the standards of care and equipment available in their clinics.</em></p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>My first task were practical &ndash; finding out about the level of knowledge in the room, the background of the situation and how they had tried to resolve it in the past.&nbsp; I also needed to ensure that simultaneous translation would be available to enable discussion.&nbsp; I imagined that discussion could be stilted by translation and needed to take account of this in the design plan. </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Next I carried out background research on the clinical condition and papers published that showed test protocols. I looked for a Cochrane review of outcomes.&nbsp; I summarised these findings in a brief introduction lecture and used one of the key evidence papers to show typical test methods.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>A discussion workshop was then planned around discussing this paper and the tests used. The plan was to come up with a gold standard of test protocol and a second more practical one. I expected the discussion to be amongst small groups with the groups summarising and leading to a joint plan. Having not met the clinicians or worked in the country before it was difficult to judge whether large group discussion would be inhibit discussion as it does in some cultures.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Due to the level of the English that the local responsible manager had it was difficult to get clear ideas about the clinicians or how the workshop would run.&nbsp; The organisation was not clear, the timings variable and the set up unknown. This was frustrating but is not unusual. As a result I needed to be prepared to adapt the workshop to suit the needs of the audience as the day progressed.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The workshop was planned with timed goals along the way and submitted to the manager responsible for the region.&nbsp; In order to legitimise the discussion I asked for the clinicians to submit case studies that we could discuss.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>I had not considered the set-up of the room layout. It was too small for breakouts. The teacher at the front and the introductory lecture could have led the attendees to feel that the invited expert will tell us, I should have considered what the layout of the room would infer to the learner or as Michael Wesch puts it: &ldquo;what does our classroom say?&rdquo;&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Small discussions were not possible because of the layout and because unless the speaker held the microphone I could not understand (through translation).&nbsp; This stilted the conversation flow and led to a more formal turn taking that I had envisioned.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>This made the introduction extremely important; I needed to encourage discussion from the start, to set the expectation that they would be co-collaborators rather than pupils. Fortunately the group were happy to share their opinions (many were extremely vocal) and this made the large group format successful. It could have failed if this had not been the case. </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Case studies were not submitted but they did bring them on the day. I did not get to review them and had to look at them without preparation. This format was not unsuccessful, although stressful for me, as we looked them as a group in relation to our proposed protocol and made adjustments, suggestions and comments as a group.&nbsp; In hind sight this flowed very nicely and was in the main accepted (that I wasn&rsquo;t going to give an answer, only my opinion along with everyone else) and once the group got into this it worked much better than I expected.&nbsp; It could have failed if none of the group offered ideas or asked questions.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Because the discussion was more formal it took less time than originally planned and the local manager asked me to give another presentation, this one on a deep technical dive into the key clinical tools available to adjust the hearing instrument for complex recipients. This was rather off topic and much more in a lecture mode but to keep them engaged I tried to provide clinical patient stories and asked them to give their own experiences for each tool.&nbsp; This was not ideal however and I felt it detracted from the key aims of the day.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Although the aim had been to provoke a discussion that would result in a protocol proposal, an additional outcome was that the group realised that they had all the information they needed and an organised workshop had led them to come up with the protocol. On summing up my main conclusion points were that all the answers were in the room and that they had designed the protocol and could have similar discussions to review it after a period of use.</em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>I should spend more time on finding out about the audience! I know this can reduce my stress levels (as I don&rsquo;t have to adjust agendas and rely on my ability to adapt and the task can be better designed to suit the situation and learner).&nbsp; I feel like I&rsquo;m asking the impossible when I request this type of information so I must not be explaining myself or why I need the information properly.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I did not plan the outcomes well, my aims were very limited. An outcome was that the bones of a good clinical protocol were established but no method agreed to take it forward and flesh it out.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>On reflection I should have spent more time looking at how they could provide this level of interaction (without me there to run a face to face workshop) and move the project forward. I would have liked to introduce the Delphi technique (Hill et al 2012) which involves collaborative agreement on statements and has been successfully used in setting up clinical protocol.&nbsp; I should have also spent more time discussing the technology required to enhance this discussion (Padlet or Google Docs) and making concrete action plans to move the project forward. As a result I have been left with finishing the project, and being separated geographically from the participants it is now hard for me to get their further collaboration.</em></p>

<p>Of all the example models provided in Activity 2a of H800, I found this the easiest to comprehend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also found the &lsquo;swim lane&rsquo; diagram provided on ld-grid.org to be highly readable and easy to understand without prior knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<td valign="top" width="180">
<p>The e-Design template is fairly readable, but it relies on a lot of small text to get its points across.</p>

<p>Expressiveness</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="151">
<p>The diagram with the four interconnecting circles (with Technology in the centre) doesn&rsquo;t quite manage to express the nuanced dependencies between each of the four Ts, in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the Time required for the Task may increase with larger Teams (more people involved in the discussion) or decrease (many hands dividing up the jobs to be done).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The swim lane chart is an improvement, as it conveys the chronological sequencing of activities in the lesson (in other words, the &lsquo;narrative&rsquo;).&nbsp; I would improve upon this by using different sized circles to indicate the size of the Team or Time required, thereby making it easier to see at a glance which are the most labour-intensive tasks.</p>

<td valign="top" width="180">
<p>I feel it succeeds in conveying the linear progression within an online course, where the activities require the learner to become increasingly self-sufficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This progression recalls a three-act &lsquo;Discovery &ndash; Exploration &ndash; Reflection&rsquo; structure that I have used in online course design previously, but turns into it a four-act journey with clear development in the roles played by tutor and learner:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tutor&rsquo;s progression:</p>
<p>Instructor<br /> &nbsp; &gt; Guide<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; Coach<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Facilitator</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learner&rsquo;s progression:</p>
<p>Access<br /> &nbsp; &gt; Extend<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Adopt<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; Integrate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model (and diagram) could do more to emphasis these changing roles: as the learner&rsquo;s confidence and domain knowledge grows, he/she becomes more self-sufficient and the&nbsp; tutor becomes less and less active.</p>

<p>Utility</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="151">
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the 4Ts diagram itself is particularly useful in communicating anything about a specific design, but the conceptual model makes it quick and easy to get started on designing a new lesion/activity/module by breaking it down into the four component parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="180">
<p>I think the e-Design template is extremely useful for online projects based in a single technology environment over a number of weeks, where there is room for the progression of a narrative and the development of learners from novices requiring hand-holding into independent self-directed learners.</p>

<td valign="top" width="95">
<p>Adequate for expressing my own design?</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="151">
<p>It strikes me that the 4Ts model is useful for blended learning programs where there is a face-to-face element in which Teams come together to collaborate and the designers have the option to utilise a variety of different Technologies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, for a fully online course (SPOC) where the Technology is fixed &ndash; a single online platform will host the course &ndash; and there is no opportunity to work in different sized Teams, the model is less useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="180">
<p>This model is very well aligned to the approach I took to my design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first section of the course I wrote about in A1b was quite instructive &ndash; the tutors needed to establish the facts and give all learners an <strong>induction</strong> to the basics of the new sales model to ensure they shared a common understanding on which to build. There was also a diagnostic self assessment early on to help the learner understand their current behaviour and skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the second phase, the tutors <strong>guided</strong> participants towards a deeper understanding of the sales techniques, with case studies and discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the third phase, participants were asked to <strong>adopt</strong> elements of the new sales model in their interactions with customers and then report back, with coaching from their own manager, their peers on the course, and their online tutor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, having <strong>integrated</strong> the new skills into their standard practice, learners were asked to assess themselves again and re-evaluate their behaviours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="95">
<p>Benefits for my design</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="151">
<p>The emphasis on estimating the Time needed for each component part of the lesson is very useful to MOOC/SPOC designs, such as mine, especially as my design was for a time-poor, mobile user group for whom frequent shorter Tasks were preferred to fewer longer sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="180">
<p>This model would have been extremely beneficial when I was developing the course I described in my design narrative. &nbsp;It feels like we unknowingly followed it when designing the online courses I described in A1b.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four week MOOCs are very common on FutureLearn, so I the four-part structure of this model could be very helpful when developing a short course where learners start out knowing very little and are expected to become self-directed by the end of the fourth week.</p>

              <title>Yvonne Moore&#39;s Design Narrative - reusable training sessions </title>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>A few years ago I was part of an elearning training team and we identified a number of training sessions that we wanted to deliver to teaching staff (in a large FE college). As part of the team I was given a couple of topics to cover.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>The training team wanted to address the fact that training sessions were often badly attended or were not suited to the audience who did attend.&nbsp; We decided to create a series of short (1 hour long) training sessions with the intention of teaching staff how to use various learning technologies in classroom situations.</p>
<p>The team were not based in the same building (4 of us travelled between 5 campuses) so we allocated sessions based on interest and expertise.&nbsp; We planned that once complete we would deliver our sessions to each other, to share skills and refine the plans if necessary.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The team wanted to try something new to engage more fully with the teaching staff. Success would be measured through attendance figures (each of us was to approach a specific department to encourage participation). We would also gather feedback from participants.&nbsp; We were also introducing a qualification for teaching staff (EPICT) and we mapped those attending our sessions with those taking up the qualification.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Identify topics based on current themes (assessment for learning, peer assessment etc.)</li>
<li>Allocate topics to team members</li>
<li>Each trainer to identify and create activities for their session</li>
<li>Each trainer to identify and/or create resources required to deliver the activities</li>
<li>Write a session plan based on a template, to aid consistency and reusability</li>
<li>Make sure the session fits into 1 hour by practising on team.&nbsp; The sessions were to be publicised as &ldquo;1hour2&rdquo; sessions as in &ldquo;1hour2 peer assessment&rdquo; etc. so they needed to fit the 1 hour time slot.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obstacles &ndash; the team had very specific experience which meant that some topics were not easily covered.&nbsp; However, the development of the sessions came to be seen as CPD for the team.</p>
<p>Trying to create sessions that involved activities for participants was quite time-consuming.&nbsp; To fit activities into a one-hour slot a lot of preparation was need beforehand.&nbsp; For example, creating sample VLE courses and fake students to illustrate how a &lsquo;self and peer assessment&rsquo; tool could be used.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Trying to keep in mind that someone else may need to deliver &lsquo;your&rsquo; session often resulted in a change in direction.&nbsp; This was useful as it meant we kept on track for training teachers who had little experience in using these technologies.&nbsp; Keeping it simple was key.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The sessions we delivered to ourselves (i.e. the training team) were helpful in expanding our skill base. The small number of 1hour 2 sessions we delivered were well received although we didn&rsquo;t always reach the intended target audience (in terms of our department targets). The number of people signing up to the EPICT qualification went up after these sessions (but in conjunction with much publicity and management strategic decisions).</p>
<p>Due to a restructure at the college, these sessions didn&rsquo;t have a very long life span.&nbsp; However, the experience did help inform the next series of training that came along.&nbsp; It became clear that staff wanted more basic, fundamental training and sessions were built around the idea of scaffolding skills from basic to expert level.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>My experience was a really positive one.&nbsp; I chose to create sessions on tools I&rsquo;d never used so I got to learn new skills and share those with others.&nbsp; In developing this kind of training, I learnt about the complexity of demonstrating technology systems for specific purposes.&nbsp; In an earlier job, I&rsquo;d been an ICT teacher and activities I created were designed to introduce skills over an extended period of practice but this was attempting to provide others with information and inspiration in a very short time-frame.</p>
<p>I also learned about how teachers can find it difficult to transfer what they learn in these types of training session to their own practice.&nbsp; When they come with a specific problem to solve they fare better than coming with no real context on which to hang the learning.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Comparison of e-Design Template and 4Ts Model</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10329</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10329</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I found that both of these representations were visually appealing; they both use columns to show the different "steps" of the activity in chronological order and they indicate aspects such as the number of students involved and the form of interaction i.e. student-student, teacher-student.&nbsp;The 4Ts model is perhaps more&nbsp;practical for teachers involved in lesson planning, while the e-Design template can also provide an overview of activities in both a single lesson and a longer course.</p>
<div>The e-Learning template is perhaps not ideal for the healthy eating activity example as it doesn't really include learning technologies. However,&nbsp;it is useful for examining whether the activity is structured in a way that develops student autonomy or the "self-organised learner", if this&nbsp;is one of the learning objectives for the lesson.&nbsp;I think that this template might be best used for a series of lessons or a whole course to give an overview of this progression from tutor instruction to independent student learning.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The 4ts model is very similar to the lesson plans I use as an English teacher. It includes nearly all of the same criteria, with the exception of learning outcomes and lesson objectives. It's like an example of best practice lesson planning, so it's very detailed, but not necessarily the most efficient way to plan all the time, especially if it's part of a longer course with many lessons.</div>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Title</h2>
<h2>Design Narrative: To better enable English Language learners to read with an emphasis on reading for gist.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>&nbsp;Student English Language Instructor at a language school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>A language school offering English language lessons, this particular class was made up of young adults of intermediate ability English.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Trying to improve reading skills but particularly to put an emphasis on reading for gist and to help improve reading speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>As a lead in the Students were shown a newspaper and an understanding of the body and headline and sub headline were checked. This was a simple activity which involved student participation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students were then put into pairs and asked to find a story they find interesting. They were given 3 minutes for this task. A check question was used to make sure the students understood the task, and duration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students then had to decide on two questions which were &ldquo;what is it about?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why is it interesting?&rdquo; Understanding of the task was checked using questions such as, &ldquo;Are you going to read every word?&rdquo; Students were given 3 minutes for this task. They were then asked about their stories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students were then given a couple of headlines to look at in their pairs and were asked what the stories could be about. After this Students were given a hand-out with some phrases and they had to decide which headlines they went with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a final activity Students were given some stories and all around the level headlines had been hidden, they had to find the headlines and match them to the stories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The lesson was a successful one and the students really enjoyed it, it was a fast paced lesson, but this led to the weaker students finding it quite difficult to keep pace, which was very noticeable at times. Overall the desired outcomes were achieved.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The 2 representations I chose are the 4 T's model and Web collage.</p>
<p><strong>Readability</strong></p>
<p>The 4 T's model is very readable and follows a linear path which I like, this makes it very user friendly and it is also very easy to see what at which point at a glance. Web collage could suit somebody who likes to visualise more and it is very flexible and can accomodate more complex information on one single representation.</p>
<p><strong>Expressiveness</strong></p>
<p>Both representations are expressive but the web collage lends itself more to expressionas it has the visual elements and allows the user to incorporate many different aspects in the single representation. This could work very well from the perspective of the healthy eating activity as it is spread over many weeks and the web collage represenntaion allows a complete overview. This is not to say the 4 T's lacks expression, but is a lot more simplistic in design.</p>
<p><strong>Utility</strong></p>
<p>Ease of use is the 4 T's strength as everything for that lesson can be seen at a glance and it is very easy to see what is happening, by whom and with what. The web collage is a lot more involved and less user friendly, but its strengths lay in other areas.</p>
<p>I chose the 2 above as they had good contrasting elements, I did, however, really like the e-design for both its simplicity and also the scaffolding features.</p>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9893</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9893</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Title</h2>
<h2>An Employer&rsquo;s view of CVs (HE workshop).</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I was an Associate Tutor for Employability, working in an HE Media Department.&nbsp; This is a session on CVs I created and delivered while in post. &nbsp;I included the use of Video CVs for the first time.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>A UK university in 2012.&nbsp; The room was set out with tables to support group work, and a screen at the front for presentations etc.&nbsp; I was invited in by the regular tutor to deliver a workshop on CVs.&nbsp; The class size was about 30, and the tutor was present.&nbsp; It was my intention to give a brief discussion-based presentation, summarising CVs, and then have the students take on the role of an employer and address the issues via group work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was working with third year undergraduates I had never met, and this was a one-off workshop. &nbsp;I was very positive about the material I was delivering, had experience with most elements, and had updated it to include video CVs, which for them as media students, was highly relevant.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t sure what the atmosphere within the class would be like or how they would react to me/my topic.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Preparing students to market themselves successfully to employers via a CV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning Outcomes included:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand a CV as a marketing document</li>
<li>understand how employers use CVs</li>
<li>make value judgements on CVs based on content, clarity of information, and selection criteria (employer&rsquo;s perspective)</li>
<li>Integrate this new understanding in preparation for revising/creating their CV.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was trying to empower them to create great CVs.&nbsp; My measure of success in the session was that they would engage with the learning activities in order to integrate new learning about creating a good CV, so that after the session they were equipped to update their CV based on best practice before approaching an employer.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>I expected them to be bored with the topic before I even started (they have been learning about CVs since school, the topic often elicits pantomime groans at the start of sessions in HE) so I had prepared an activity-based session to counter this, with minimal &lsquo;me talking&rsquo;.&nbsp; I had a PowerPoint with basic prompts for discussion/activities, and a few slides with key information to present after discussion.</p>
<p>I started with questions to the entire group.&nbsp; It was my intention if this did not provide answers to move straight to pairwork/groupwork for the follow-up questions, but the level of engagement was good, and class discussion worked well, so I kept the questions directed to the whole class:</p>
<p>Q: What is a CV?&nbsp; (What is its purpose?)</p>
<p>Some people were happy to volunteer information, and discussion built on that leading to the point I wanted: a CV is a marketing document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What is a spam CV?</p>
<p>Q: How long (on average) will an employer spend looking at your CV?</p>
<p>Discussion about how employers use CVs/targeting your CV etc.&nbsp; Students were shocked at the average time employer spends looking at a CV.</p>
<p>PowerPoint slide &lsquo;What makes a great CV?&rsquo; - explanations re. matching/mirroring the vacancy, researching the organisation, CV scanning software for keywords etc.&nbsp; Some discussion.&nbsp; Again, students had been unaware that some organisations now scan CVs for keywords as a way of filtering them, which highlights the importance of including the same terms on their CV as are used in the vacancy information/selection criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Learning activity: &lsquo;A memorable CV?&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>I put a CV up on screen, asked them to read it, and removed it after 2 minutes. &nbsp;I then put up a second CV for 2 minutes.&nbsp; Both CVs were fairly standard &ndash; one was skills-based, one more traditional.</p>
<p>I asked: what was the name of the first candidate?/second candidate?&nbsp; What posts have they held?&nbsp; What skills did they highlight? &nbsp;&nbsp;Working as a class, they got some of the answers, but most students had not retained much information.&nbsp; I then asked: if you had looked through 25/50/100 CVs, how much would you remember about these two?&nbsp;&nbsp; (getting to that awareness was the point of the exercise).</p>
<p>I then used these CVs to make some points on CV layout and the importance of the front page, and showed them a website with different types of CV, and CV advice.</p>
<p>Class discussion on &lsquo;what to include in your CV&rsquo; with plenty of questions from class, followed up by a PowerPoint slide checklist.</p>
<p><strong>Learning activity: &lsquo;Video CVs: an employer&rsquo;s perspective</strong>&rsquo;</p>
<p>I showed the class 5 Video CVs for a big online competition to become the caretaker of an island for a year (big PR element to the post), and told them that one was from the successful applicant and I wanted them to see if they could figure out who that was. &nbsp;Before showing the videos I went through the selection criteria for the post, so that they knew what the employer was looking for from the successful candidate.</p>
<p>After watching the CVs, I got them to discuss in groups who they would have given the job to.&nbsp; Then I got the class to vote (show of hands) on who they thought had got the job.&nbsp; Split vote between 3 (including the successful applicant).&nbsp; I told them the outcome (many were surprised &ndash; they had had a negative reaction to the winner (as had I)) and we re-watched the three CVs the majority had voted for, to see if the class could understand/explain why one had been successful.&nbsp; Useful class discussion afterwards &ndash; not the best video, not the most likeable person, but the person who demonstrated the most experience.&nbsp; How does this transfer across to a written CV? etc..</p>
<p><strong>Concluding learning activity: &lsquo;Create a CV crib-sheet&rsquo; </strong>(in groups, with feedback to class) &ndash; what will they consider when writing/updating their own CVs?.</p>
<p>Useful discussion-based overview of the session which covered everything, and came from them rather than from me.&nbsp; Based on their crib-sheet suggestions, I created a master crib-sheet and posted it as a document to the VLE, along with my slides, after the session.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All discussion elements worked well, and participation was good.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;A memorable CV?&rsquo; </strong>&ndash; expected outcomes of this met my objectives.&nbsp; In their discussions, the students began to consider CVs from an employer&rsquo;s perspective (e.g. &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have read page 2 of this CV because&hellip;&rsquo; &lsquo;I think this looks very cluttered&hellip;&rsquo;).&nbsp; This lead to the recognition that their CV must be strong in order to be effective.&nbsp; Also, having shown them the information and support available on the website they will now be able to access it via a link in their VLE.</p>
<p><strong>Video CVs: an employer&rsquo;s perspective</strong></p>
<p>This met my objectives, but I realised that I should have been more explicit in my initial instructions.&nbsp; I should have asked them to focus on content and clarity of information, and reminded them that this is just another format of CV, to be considered in the same way as paper-based CVs.&nbsp; Many were initially distracted by the quality of the film-making (being film-makers), while I wanted them to focus on content (suitability for the post), which we got to by discussion. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Crib sheet activity</strong></p>
<p>This was a lively group activity and a nice way to summarise the session.&nbsp; Students showed that they had retained the main points of the session, including the employer&rsquo;s perspective.&nbsp; I hope students will feel &lsquo;ownership&rsquo; of the class crib sheet they contributed to, and use it when writing their CV.</p>
<p>I met my objectives for the session, as evidenced during participation in the Video CV activity, and the final recap crib-sheet activity.&nbsp; In analysing the Video CVs, students demonstrated an understanding of the purpose/use of CVs in the selection process and took on the perspective of an employer to rate the CV.&nbsp; In creating their own &lsquo;crib sheet&rsquo; they demonstrated that they had taken on board the main points of the session and were left with a lasting document of best practice, to support them in writing their CV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t assume learners will transfer understanding (e.g. of paper-based CVs) into another format/context without support.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Keeping them active worked well</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Adding a new element (video CVs) made me rethink and restructure my entire approach.&nbsp; This was useful, and led to the crib sheet activity.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The crib sheet activity shifted the focus from me to them, replacing a more traditional summary from me.&nbsp; This worked well.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Keep looking for new ways of doing things.</li>

              <title>Nicola McIntyre&#39;s: Essay structure for science students</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9892</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9892</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I am a tutor on a 3rd level university neuroscience&nbsp; course at a distance learning institute. Tutor support is provided through online tutorials and through extensive feedback on assignments.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>Students typically study this module towards the end of their degree and they come to it from across the range of science disciplines so their experiences of assessment can be quire different. In particular some of the physical sciences students might never have written a scientific essay in the past.</p>
<p>Having marked the first assignment of the course, it was clear that when&nbsp; tasked with constructing an essay covering a scientific concept, students were able to structure paragraphs appropriately however they didn't seem to understand how to write an introductory paragraph and really struggled with a concluding paragraph. This applied even to those students who would have&nbsp; been exposed to essay writing skills throughout their studies.</p>
<p>I decided that this needed to be addressed within a tutorial prior to the next assignment. The teaching environment was an online learning room with a whiteboard and audio communication facilities.&nbsp; Students can communicate via their microphones but many students are reluctant to do so, preferring to use the text function instead and this added an extra challenge to the task.&nbsp; This exercise was conducted as part of a bigger tutorial focused on preparing students for their next assignment.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>I suspected that part of the problem was that students didn't see the worth of the introductory and concluding paragraphs. It eats into their time, they don't see the importance of this task as a way of framing their essays and they don't think that marks are available for structure. In addition, they simply don't understand what content needs to be included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The aim of this task was therefore to raise awareness of why students need to structure their essays appropriately (marks are available in the assignments and exam) and &nbsp;to&nbsp; help them work together to build a collective knowledge of what constitutes a good introduction and conclusion to an essay.</p>
<p>My measure of success was that students engaged fully with the task and that they applied this understanding to their next assignment.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>Prior to the tutorial, I sent out a reminder to students informing them what we would be covering including a mention of the essay structure activity.</p>
<p>During the tutorial I firstly asked students why they thought that an appropriate introduction and conclusion for scientific essays&nbsp; were necessary.&nbsp; I was surprised to find that the group (6 students)&nbsp; came up with some good answers to this question.</p>
<p>The next part of the task involved me outlining the important components of an essay and then assigning them into small groups to look at an example of a badly constructed introduction and a badly constructed conclusion. They worked on this for 10 minutes in their groups&nbsp; and then each group shared their ideas about what was wrong with the examples and I used this to summarise how the paragraphs could be constructed better. I was careful not provide a model answer following on from the discussion as I don't think this would have been an effective aid to understanding.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One of the groups appeared to be discussing the task in detail (using microphones) whereas the other group didn't seem to be interacting very well.&nbsp; However there was plenty of input into the group discussion (some with microphones and some via text).&nbsp; The result was that&nbsp; students came to a collective agreement on how the examples could be improved. An expected outcome was that there were some suggestions about what was wrong with the examples which I hadn't considered.</p>
<p>Overall the essays which were submitted for the next TMA were constructed much more appropriately with many students seeming to understand what was required.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>This proved to be a worthwhile exercise as the intended outcomes were achieved.&nbsp; It made me realise how much time and effort is involved in planning, executing and analysing one small component of a tutorial.&nbsp; I didn't ask for feedback on the activity and in hindsight, this was an important element which was missing.</p>
<p>In the past I have generally avoided splitting&nbsp; students into rooms off the main tutorial room for the purposes of discussion as I wasn't particularly confident about doing so. I can now see that there are benefits to this type of activity although it probably still depends somewhat on the personalities of the group.</p>

              <title>Rob Moore&#39;s design Narrative: From MOD to Renewable Energy</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9884</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Title</strong> <em>From MOD to Renewable Energy<br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator </strong></p>
<p><em>I was comissioned to write an introductory training session for use with military personnel about to leave military service and looking for new careers.<br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>Whilst senior military personnel in the UK are well qualified and find new roles outside military service failry easy to find, the lwer ranks, whilst well trained, find it more difficult to transfer the skills they have developed into civilian life. Each individual has a generous training budget to help them resettle, but lack of knowledge and good advice results in the training budget being wasted. <br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>My task was to write a six hour training course, to be delivered in one day to a mixture of army, navy and airforce personnel, of differing ranks, that would show case the opprotunities in the renewable energy sector and help them to identify: the transferable skills they had, the relevant experience, gaps in their knowledge and effective trainig to fill the gaps.<br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>Stage 1) research the skills and expereince likely to be gained by the different services and different ranks.</p>
<p>Stage 2) carry out a mapping exercise between the skills and experience and roel available in the Renewables Industry.</p>
<p>Stage 3) Create resources, to be used by third party trainers, that were accesible and jargon free.</p>
<p>Stage 4) Train the trainers in delivering the material as intended.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>There were two big challenges in the exercise:</p>
<p>1) getting access to sufficient military personnel to give a good overview of their skills and experience. This was acheived thorugh face to face meetings and through existign career counsellors who helped a lot.</p>
<p>2) cutting through the military and power industry jargon. It felt like we were speakign different languages at times.</p>
<p>In teh end the trainig ended up as:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overview of renewables technologies and teh roles available</li>
<li>A personal exercise based on transferable skills and experience</li>
<li>A matching exercise between personal skills and expereince and renewable indutry job roles</li>
<li>A personal development plan for individuals who tehn wanted to pursue the industry further, idenitfying the most suitable training for their situation and the role they wanted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall the exercise was a success, with the main aims of raising awareness of the industry and the best training options to enter the industry being met. Because delivery was through third party trainers the feedabck was quite limited and I did not get the opportunity to deliver a course myself, I only had feedback from the trainers to go on and this was positive.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>From this activity it became clear that insider knowledge of the subject matter was essential. I am an expert on renewable energy job roles but not military roles, so if I were to undertake this type of activitiy again i woudl partner with someone with the complementary skill set rather than try to pick the brains of experts. <br /></em></p>]]></description>

<p>The grouping of information into four areas and representing this in a diagram is helpful. However, some of the information presumably is behind the diagram (such as individual vs. collaborative work in relation to PM) as the space in the diagram is quite limited.</p>

<p>It provides an overview of (what I call) steps within the activity, whether individual work or collaborative (apparently, according to the description but I can&rsquo;t actually see this in the diagram), and timings; who is involved in any interaction (though not in relation to each of the steps); where the learning takes place and technological requirements; relationships between the above. I like the capturing of relationships.</p>

<p>The description presents the model as a means of collaborative designing between the SMEs and the learning technologists. I guess this could be true.

<p>It could have worked for both planning my training session and recording the design for future use/sharing. However, it&rsquo;s not obvious where I would capture the learning outcomes; nor where I would capture the stakeholder feedback on the initial design and subsequent alterations to the design &ndash; to be honest, I&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve expected this to be what &lsquo;History&rsquo; is but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be. I tend to find it useful to be able to capture the development of a design over time.</p>

<p>For something &lsquo;simple&rsquo; like a two-hour face-to-face training session, it works. I guess for a 30-week blended learning HE course, you&rsquo;d need to have many multiple entries. I&rsquo;d suggest the benefit of this is to focus on (what I call) a key activity and to be able to break that down into steps (what they call activities). Within a longer more complex course, his could be used just for those key activities which feed into assessment.</p>

<p>The conceptual model shows who (student vs. teacher) is doing what and which resource is required. This is useful at a glance. The flow model shows who (student &ndash; individually or in a group vs. teacher) is doing what and for how long. I prefer the swimlane representation and would have thought the resources could be included in that diagram, doing away with the need for the conceptual model. While the conceptual model provides a lot of useful information, the spider web-like lines make the diagram quite busy and less easy to read. The lack of numbering of the (what I call) steps within the activity makes it less easy to read at a glance.</p>

<p>This enables more detail to be provided in two models. I like the fact that what the various people do is broken down into more detail, and I like the fact that student activity is represented as individual or group work. I like the fact that learning outcomes are captured, which is an improvement on 4SPPIces model (although only one per activity can be captured). I like the fact that related resources are captured.</p>

<p>The current version apparently only has limited activity types and they were selected for online learning... so most useful for online course design. The model could potentially be used as a means of reference post design for those involved in producing the course (in terms of explaining why it has been designed in the way it has), as well as for designing the course, though its use as a reference tool may be less obvious than the 4SPPIces model. There's no suggestion of collaborative design which is a selling point for the 4SPPIces model.</p>

<p>My training session was face-to-face, so may have struggled to make use of pre-determined aspects such as the activity types. It is probably more beneficial for larger/longer courses given the two models enabling a lot of detail to be captured. The flow model with resources integrated into it would probably have sufficed for my two-hour training course.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ability to work with other platforms such as Moodle and in this case add functionality that current versions of Moodle claim but currently struggls with such as adding groups (nice from imported lists of names)</li>

<li>Time consuming to make visual repressentations and these could be confusing / complex if not considered carefully</li>
<li>Doesn't account for all of the parameters of a session such as time and as it is not mature, it doesn't feel like it fully addresses the job</li>

<li>Technology section serves as a reminder to consider utilisation of computer based and other tech</li>
<li>Meets the aims of KISS and therefore could be applied in different levels of sophistication by a range of practitioners</li>
<li>Would make a useful addition / could replace standard SP - sugest could become 5T's to incorporate 'Themes' such as English and maths, PREVENT, E&amp;D etc.</li>

              <title>SLowe&#39;s design narrative: The application of instructional design to the HE context</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9862</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9862</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Narrator</strong></h3>
<p>I was studying a PostGraduate Certificate in Instructional Design for eLearning and was working in a newly formed Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) unit at a university in the UK.</p>
<h3><strong>Situation</strong></h3>
<p>The TEL Design team, part of the TEL unit, had just started running a TEL Special Interest Group (SIG) to spread the word about TEL and the new TEL unit. The SIG was open to all members of university staff but the audience at the time was largely those in the TEL Design team, those in the production unit and those involved in learning design (LD) both in faculties and in the LD team. Attendance was voluntary.</p>
<p>Three other colleagues had been studying the PG Cert in ID for eLearning alongside me. The course had been sponsored by our unit and we were asked to pass on &lsquo;anything useful&rsquo; to other colleagues.</p>
<p>Key actors were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Me and my three colleagues, as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and training session designers</li>
<li>Our training department, sponsor of our studying the PG Cert</li>
<li>TEL management team, wishing to spread the word about TEL</li>
<li>The SIG organiser, needing to ensure what we did worked from the SIG&rsquo;s point of view</li>
<li>SIG participants, wishing to get something useful out of the session.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>The task was to design a TEL SIG session (a face-to-face training session) about the application of instructional design to the university&rsquo;s context. The aim was to provide a brief overview of what instructional design is, with a focus on one particular approach, ADDIE. The participants would then consider what could be taken from it, if anything, perhaps adapted, and applied to their own work context in designing and producing university courses. The session would last two hours.</p>
<p>The task was also to spread the message that TEL Design relates to a wide range of activities/aspects.</p>
<p>Success would be measured through participants being able to discuss instructional design, albeit very briefly and loosely, and through participants evaluating what they currently do in the light of ADDIE, potentially adapting what they do, where relevant.</p>
<p>Success would also be measured in terms of attendance to the SIG increasing, as well as word getting around about what TEL is and what the TEL design team does.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p>The following actions were taken in developing the training session:</p>
<ul>
<li>My three colleagues and I talked to the training department, TEL management and the SIG organiser to establish their requirements, how much time we had etc.</li>
<li>We thought about who was likely to attend, and talked to some of them to gauge what they would find useful in terms of content and approach.</li>
<li>The four of us, as SMEs, worked up learning outcomes for the session.</li>
<li>The four of us created a storyboard for the session.</li>
<li>We explored options for teaching/learning and decided to give a presentation to provide the brief overview, followed by the participants working in small groups, each group with a different task focussing on a specific aspect in relation to ADDIE.</li>
<li>We got feedback from the stakeholders.</li>
<li>We produced the materials (presentation, task sheets, feedback forms).</li>
<li>We did a trail run, just amongst the four of us.</li>
<li>We ran the session.</li>
<li>We asked for feedback from participants and passed this back to the training department, management and SIG organiser.</li>
<li>We made the presentation and outcomes from the group work available to everyone via the TEL website.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The expected outcomes are as stated under &lsquo;Task&rsquo; above.</p>
<p>The session went well overall. There was good attendance and the discussions were lively. Outcomes were captured and made available to everyone for future reference.</p>
<p>Participants said they did feel there were certain aspects from ID/ADDIE that they could apply to their day-to-day work. This came out of the group work in which participants worked in separate groups to consider what might be taken from or adapted in relation to Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation. The separate groups then fed back to the plenary. This made the most of the short amount of time available.</p>
<p>In terms of spreading the message about TEL, my evidence is anecdotal only, to date, in that some staff continue to ask what TEL is and what the TEL Design team does. Personally I see this as positive in that it <em>is</em> difficult to capture in a few words or ideas what TEL&rsquo;s all about and the fact they are asking about TEL is a good thing as it&rsquo;s keeping TEL at the forefront of their minds :)</p>
<p>SIG attendance varies, admittedly &ndash; attendance is voluntary and everyone is busy &ndash; but on the whole, it is good and the existence of a TEL/LD SIG has become the norm (though this is not only due to this particular session, of course).</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>This was &lsquo;only&rsquo; a two-hour training session, not a &lsquo;full-blown&rsquo; online training course lasting several days nor a university course lasting many weeks. That said, the process of planning and designing the learning event is as important. We tried to implement what we were teaching &ndash; analysed the audience and stakeholder requirements, designed, developed and evaluated the learning event.</p>
<p>Having said that, we did each of these stages on quite a small scale &ndash; for example, there was no need for technical testing during the development stage, other than checking the Powerpoint slides showed sufficiently clearly on the screen in the training room, for example. Nor did we assess the learning given attendance was voluntary. In hindsight, we could have introduced an element of assessment, albeit a light-hearted quiz perhaps.</p>
<p>I would also like to evaluate the session from a longer-term perspective. Has the session changed the behaviour of any of those who attended? Has the university benefitted from it at all? Perhaps a follow-up session and/or interviews/questionnaires with stakeholders. I do wonder whether some participants were/are unwilling to apply the ideas of ID to their own context since there seems to be a stigma attached to ID amongst some members of the HE community.</p>
<p>Overall, we were relatively limited in what we could do given the session was only two hours. (The length was pre-determined.) We were also relatively limited in what we could do in that it was only the second TEL SIG session with the TEL team still introducing the idea of the SIG in itself. Nevertheless, a successful session within the constraints.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This design narrative forms part of an exercise for Open University H800 module.</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>I was a school teacher responsible for teaching English.</em></p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I was a supply teacher on a long term placement in a state secondary school (over several terms). The placement happened within the last five years. &nbsp;I was covering a leave of absence and teaching English as a subject.&nbsp; &nbsp;The class in question were around twenty five twelve to thirteen year old pupils (Key Stage 3, in the UK).</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The class were variously described as &lsquo;challenging&rsquo; and &lsquo;lower ability&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the subject in the school, pupils were streamed, and this class was in the lowest mainstream.&nbsp;&nbsp; The class were described as &lsquo;challenging&rsquo; &nbsp;because a large proportion of pupils had statements of additional needs many of which related to behaviour and emotional difficulties.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Lessons for this specific class were held in various classrooms around the school throughout the week.&nbsp; I was therefore required to arrange the logistics of delivering books for every single lesson, with the aid of the pupils.&nbsp; I taught English mainly within a French classroom, thus nearly all the displays related to France and the French language.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Around ten minutes were alloted at the start of each lesson for silent reading by pupils.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>As a supply teacher, I was the pupils&rsquo; second supply teacher within that year.&nbsp; I had taught them for three months before undertaking the learning exercise described below.&nbsp; I had built up a level of trust with the pupils and understanding of their individual needs.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Pupils generally hold a negative view of transient supply teachers, even those employed on a longer-term basis.&nbsp; There is of course the issue of trust.&nbsp; Can we trust this new teacher ?&nbsp; There was the desire, on the pupils&rsquo; part and mine as a teacher, to build a good working relationship based on trust and respect.&nbsp; This took many months to achieve.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Belief : Please note that an important assumption I make as a teacher is that within every pupil is a writer and that every pupil is capable of telling a story in writing.</em></p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I was trying to get the pupils to develop their understanding of the writing process.&nbsp; I wanted the pupils to write about where they were now : this very moment, in the classroom, sitting at a desk, with their friends, in school, with a pen, their thoughts, and the sights, sounds and smells around them... describing their direct experience.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I explained to the class that they would be having a picnic in class in two days&rsquo; time.&nbsp; &nbsp;By picnic, I mean that I would allow the pupils to eat a snack and work during part of the lesson.&nbsp; I explained that they would be doing some creative writing as a lesson focus.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>(Effect &ndash; pupils were amused and surprised as they had never had a &lsquo;picnic&rsquo; in class previously, but looking forward to the experience.&nbsp; There was palpable excitement &ndash; not the fear usually associated with writing.)</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>At the start of the agreed lesson, I explained to pupils that they would be writing in their books about their experience in the classroom, describing what they saw, heard, smelled, thought etc...&nbsp; (Effect &ndash; confusion, pupils not familiar with this way of working, excitement that they could have a snack etc).</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I told the pupils that I too would be writing about my experience in the classroom... but that I would share all my writing with them immediately and live.&nbsp; Thus I used Microsoft Word and ensured it was showing on the projector screen for the whole class to see.&nbsp; The writing was enlarged to make it easily readible by the whole class.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Using my computer, I wrote freely.&nbsp;&nbsp; I described what I saw and noticed in plain language.&nbsp; I mentioned the pupil names where appropriate :</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I notice a French flag draped above the door.&nbsp; This is the first time I&rsquo;ve noticed this flag.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B looks like he&rsquo;s lost in thought, holding his hand against his forehead.&nbsp; L looks at the ceiling, looking for ideas.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>(Effect &ndash; the whiteboard writing caught the attention of pupils.&nbsp; The use of humour in the exemplary writing on the board reduced the &lsquo;fear factor&rsquo; associated with writing with this profile pupil).</em></p>
<p><em>Pupils likewise emulated this process of free writing in their writing books.<br /></em></p>
<p><em>In my writing example, I quoted speech from people in the situation, making it as realistic and lively as possible, reflecting directly on experience as it was happening.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Obstacle.&nbsp; As I was describing in writing the experience of the classroom, some of the pupils saw this as a means of &lsquo;playing up&rsquo; so that they were named in the written exemplary albeit in a humourous tone.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>After giving the example writing to pupils, I moved around the classroom, reading pupil work, encouraging, making suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the lesson, I took in pupils work for marking and for feedback during next lesson.&nbsp; </em></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>As regards pupils developing their understanding of the writing process, the expected outcome was that most of the pupils were able to describe some aspects of their direct experience.&nbsp; This was achieved as evidenced in their written work.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Unexpected outcomes :&nbsp; Describing what is happening in a live classroom, quoting people as they speak, has an engaging and humourous quality about it reducing the typical tensions associated with writing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also actively &nbsp;demonstrates the use of speech and quotation, but it can become a distraction to the learning focus, as evidenced in my post lesson reflection.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Additional outcomes : Using the whiteboard to &lsquo;live write&rsquo; as an exemplary for pupils led to much imitative writing.&nbsp; This of course is a facet of writing that could be discussed in a future lesson (how one can imitate or parody other writing, for example).</em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Using the computer and projector to model &lsquo;free writing&rsquo; in a live classroom context can be very effective as a means of encouraging the pupil/learner/writer.&nbsp; With portable display technology (eg. an iPad attached to an Apple TV device linked to a screen) one could show pupils&rsquo; work in a similar live way on the screen during the lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is much potential here for formative assessment, peer assessment etc.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Fear is a major learning obstacle in English as indeed every subject.&nbsp; Embedding this writing exercise within a picnic in a classroom may seem a little eccentric but this, along with the humour co-created in the experience, it helped make the learning much more effective because it didn&rsquo;t seem like hard &lsquo;classwork&rsquo; but instead it seemed more natural and more like &lsquo;having fun&rsquo;. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>One of the transferable metacognitive insights pupils can gain from this exercise concerns their own creative process in producing writing : recording their first draft (as in this lesson example), subsequently showing and sharing, re-drafting, developing, editing etc.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>

              <title>Creating a video for distance learners sitting exams</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9854</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9854</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>I was tasked with producing a video for our students all of whom are studying as distance learners. The video was to show dos and donts for sitting exams.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>Some of our students study independently, some at a college (using our syllabus and materials). Most of the students are overseas. It is very important that examination procedure is clearly and succinctly communicated to all of our students. The video was to be short (around 3 minutes) and accessible to all. I had 2 months to produce the video so that it was ready before the exam session.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>I wanted to produce a video with the following:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Concise yet informative</em></li>
<li><em>Text graphics so that the sound does not need to be on to be watched<br /></em></li>
<li><em>Clear narration so it can be accessed by visually impaired students </em></li>
<li><em>Institutional branding throughout (logos, colour schemes)</em></li>
<li><em>Footage of &ldquo;students&rdquo; sitting an exam to be included, shots of important elements such as ID, water bottles, calculators etc</em></li>
<li><em>Footage to include a diverse group of students to reflect our student body</em></li>
<li><em>Footage to contain no reference to the year so video does not quickly date</em></li>
<li><em>Graphic list of dos and donts for clarity</em></li>
<li><em>A link to be in the video to the Exams page on our website</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Measure of success:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>High quality video that met the points above</em></li>
<li><em>Successfully viewed by 1000s of students<br /></em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Met with the colleague who requested the video to make a list of requirements</li>
<li>After the meeting check my list of requirements matched colleague's</li>
<li>Wrote the script</li>
<li>Asked the colleague to check the script against his checklist</li>
<li>Amended script accordingly</li>
<li>Got a quote from video producer (outside agency), gave her timeline for finished work</li>
<li>Storyboarded script so that video producer could write a shot list/timings for filming</li>
<li>Booked rooms to film mock "exams"</li>
<li>Recruited colleagues to act as students</li>
<li>Recruited a colleague with a clear voice to act as narrator</li>
<li>Shot the footage and recorded narration</li>
<li>Reviewed producer&rsquo;s finished work- noted several things were unclear (dos and don&rsquo;ts were written with same colour background, narration did not make it clear which were dos and which were donts).</li>
<li>Producer put background of donts in red and dos in green and added a big &ldquo;do&rdquo; or &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo; graphic at the beginning of each section. Producer cut the narration so that &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo; was said at the beginning of each &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo;</li>
<li>Passed draft 2 of video to colleagues for review, including by audio/visually impaired staff and received comments</li>
<li>Tweaked video to add University tag line at the end</li>
<li>Distributed video via You Tube and the University Portal</li>
<li>Posted video on webpage</li>
<li>Emailed students about the video as well as updating Twitter/Facebook</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>Despite providing a clear and detailed script, there were still hiccups where the producer did not entirely understand what she was supposed to be doing. All of my correspondence was done via email, next time I will schedule a face to face meeting as talking is quicker and she would have had space to ask questions.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Distribution was important, no point in producing an amazing video and have no-one watch it. Slow hit rate at first as the video was hidden on the website and posted on Facebook and Twitter (but not &ldquo;boosted&rdquo;). Putting a link on the home page carousel and emailing the students directly resulted in much higher viewing figures.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I met my objectives overall, time was an issue and last year viewing figures could have been much higher but we launched it very close to exam time. This year figures were very high indeed.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>The video was well received and helped the students feel like part of the University. There were fewer queries regarding examination procedure because the video overview provided knowledge and a sense of understanding for the students.<br /></em></p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>For this activity, i chose to look at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/-healthy-eating-in-the-design-principles-database">Design Principles Database</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/-healthy-eating-in-an-e-design-template">e-Learning Template</a>.</p>
<p>For both representations, the content was easily understood as both presented the information in a structured, sequential way with clear labels. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For the <em><strong>Design Principles Database</strong></em>, the focus clearly seemed to be on presenting a pedagogically sound argument and rationale for each feature of the 'Healthy Eating' lesson chosen. &nbsp;This was presented in a table: the features of the lesson in one column of a table, with the rationale (via comparison with a feature in the Database) alongside it. &nbsp;This approach helped clearly demonstrate the links between the activities chosen and the underlying rationale, as well as explicitly relating this to wider non-domain specific learning experiences / approaches.&nbsp; However, although the rationale was clear, the overall structure and flow of the lesson, and important features of this (such as interaction type, timings, support and additional resources needed) was not.&nbsp; Even though the aim of this representation was to show how a lesson may be evaluated post-planning, these features, presented in a systematic way detailing the relationships between these, would seem to be an essential part of this.&nbsp; In terms of utility, from a pre-planning perspective, it would seem that a designer would need a clear idea of what they wanted to achieve, and an awareness of appropriate ways of scaffolding and structuring learner activity before utilizing this (<em>when </em>is specific type of activity most appropriate).&nbsp; From a post-planning perspective, this is a very useful evaluative tool, although, again, this would necessitate that the designer was aware of, and had structured, relevant and appropriate activity types at various stages throughout the wider learning activity.</p>
<p>The <em><strong>e-Design Template</strong></em> took a similar approach (and resembled a more traditional type lesson plan) with descriptions of activity type, interaction patterns, timings and assessment types collated together under the main principle headings. &nbsp;This afforded a clear, linear, progressive view of the activities throughout the lesson, as well as the level of difficulty / support and expected level of learner autonomy required at each stage. &nbsp;In comparison to the Design Principles Database, this representation clearly helps provide a framework for the wider design of a lesson / learning event, but on a more granular, activity level, would benefit being used in conjunction with another type of tool / representation (such as the Design Principles Database mentioned).&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, although the general scaffolding principles as defined in the headings gave a good impression of the general types of activity / interaction that would be happening at each stage of the lesson, locating specific detail (such as specific interaction type or timing) was more difficult to locate at a glance due to the way that activities were described/ grouped and the table headings chosen.</p>
<p>For both representations, it was unclear what references were / are made to technology within the learning process, apart from the tools that were used to create / evaluate them.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly either of these representations would have helped the design process as described <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9849">here</a>.&nbsp; Their key value for myself in both cases, albeit slightly differently, is that they afford a common framework of reference and vocabulary that can be used in the design process &ndash; something that was sorely needed as miscommunication caused a lot of frustration (and additional work) in the learning design process I described!</p>]]></description>

              <title>Nathan Casey&#39;s design narrative: Chinese (online) Camp</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9849</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9849</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Chinese (online) Camp</h2>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>My role in the design of the overall learning activity was two-fold:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>To advise the Design Team on how the aims of the course could be met in terms of overall structure, sequence of activities, activity type and type of activity template used</li>
<li>To create the course online content by building assets in our online content management system, and using these to create the individual activities within our online LMS.</li>
</ol>
<h2>&nbsp;Situation</h2>
<p>This short professional development course was designed for globally-distributed online teachers who work either from a physical teaching centre or from home. These teachers use a synchronous audiographic platform to work with students, but the majority of the students study is independent, using our own proprietary LMS (in a intended flipped classroom-type of model).</p>
<p>From our teacher satisfaction surveys, we understood that teachers wanted more networking opportunities with their global counterparts and to understand the experience of our students to a greater degree (both in terms of how students study independently using our online courseware, as well as their cultural background).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As one of our biggest groups of students are culturally Chinese, we wanted to provide an opportunity for teachers to learn more about the culture and language as well as use the exact same online learning management system as out students (this was the first time we had planned to do this, using a separate LMS for initial teacher orientation and professional development opportunities).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course itself consisted of a number of individual, primarily independent self-study activities, designed to be put into practice in a synchronous audiographic conference at the end of the one-week course. &nbsp;The content management system used for this course consisted of an asset bank and activity templates that dictated the form of activity, type of interaction and type of resource that could be used within it.</p>
<p><strong>Key actors:</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>The course Design Team: responsible for designing the overall structure of the course and individual activities within the course, managing the online LMS (inviting teachers, tracking individual progress and completion rates, etc), creating individual activity content and sourcing resources (video, image, audio)</li>
<li>The Production Team: (primarily this consisted of myself) Responsible for adding / building resources / assets in our content management system and using these to create the individual learning activities. Additionally to hep evaluate the pedagogic approach proposed by the Design Team and negotiate how the course aims / objectives may be more effectively met through structure / sequencing of the individual learning activities and the templates available.</li>
<li>The Academic Team: Responsible for testing the trial and beta versions of the course and providing feedback.</li>
<li>Global online teachers: these were our students.</li>
</ol>
<h2>&nbsp;Task</h2>
<p>Provide a new type of professional development opportunity that:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Facilitated networking and relationship building amongst our teachers from different global locations</li>
<li>&nbsp;Built awareness of main aspects of &lsquo;the student experience&rsquo; (in this case both culturally and using the same online independent study resources that our students use when studying with)</li>
<li>Developed (Mandarin) Chinese language awareness and ability to use basic phrases</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Success would be measured through:</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Participation</li>
<li>Course completion</li>
<li>Surveys at the end of the course (enjoyment and perception of &lsquo;usefulness&rsquo;)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Initial group collaboration / brainstorming to:</li>
<ol start="1">
<li>Clarify aims and objectives of course</li>
<li>Present the main features of the activity templates and how they could be used</li>
<li>Outline the creation and production process with key milestones / deadlines</li>
</ol></ol>
<p><em>Unexpected outcome</em></p>
<p>As opportunity to network was a key driving force behind this, it quickly became clear that our system did not easily support the type of interactions that we were hoping for. This led to myself, from a production side, more clearly outlining what templates were available and how they should / could be adapted and used in context of what we wanted to achieve.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Once the draft content outline had been created, a further group check to ensure that the sequence of activities was logical, clear and sound.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Unexpected outcome</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point it was clear that there was a knowledge &lsquo;gap&rsquo; between the types of activities that we could create and the types of activities that the design team wanted to include.&nbsp; At this point, I ran a further, more detailed knowledge sharing session to ensure that everyone understood what our system was capable of and how this would look / work in practice.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Design Team created detailed learning activity production notes, including sourcing / building relevant resources.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Expected / Unexpected result</em></p>
<p>As this was the first time we had done this, we expected to &lsquo;expect the unexpected&rsquo; especially at this stage.&nbsp; However, the sourcing / creation of materials took a lot longer than expected and further advice / guidance needed to be sought from the team who use the content management system to create content on a regular basis.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Content production: Putting resources into the content management system and using these to build a test course.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Unexpected outcome</em></p>
<p>Some of the resources created / sourced displayed differently than expected after being converted into Flash / HTML.&nbsp; This meant a second round of content sourcing / creation had to be undertaken.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Testing: the academic team tested the course and provided feedback.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Expected Result</em></p>
<p>The academic team agreed that the course meant the initial brief provided, and was effectively designed to meet the learning aims / objectives.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Course rollout (providing course details to developer team who released this into our live environment).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><strong>Intended objectives:</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>High interest in the course; more teachers than we could include in each session applied to participate.</li>
<li>Participation was initially high, but slowed towards the end of the week, with not all teachers within a group completing this within the required deadline.</li>
<li>Participation rates in the synchronous online audiographic conference were low: not all teachers attended.</li>
<li>Course survey rates were very positive: teachers enjoyed the course (both in terms of content and opportunities to interact) and perceived it to be useful (clear links between course content and how this could be used in class).</li>
</ol>
<p>However, there was also a clear need for greater peer-to-peer interaction opportunities and the course took longer than initially thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Unintended outcomes:</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>New ways of collaborating and working with our online LMS / CMS; clear need for further, more in-depth training for the team.</li>
<li>Understanding of how our &lsquo;student&rsquo; LMS and activity templates can be adapted and used to meet alternative needs (than those they were initially designed for).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Through this design experience, a number of underlying factors became very clear:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>All participants involved in learning design in this particular context / using this particular LMS and CMS need a clear awareness of, and knowledge about, the limitations of the system and activity templates.&nbsp; This helps efficiency during the design process as well as allows for more creativity when adapting the set activity templates to meet a variety of needs.</li>
<li>Although this course was only one-week long there was a clear need for more &lsquo;micro-touchpoints&rsquo; in which collaboration, discussion and comparison was engendered &ndash; this would not only help teachers to feel connected but also build rapport and a feeling of community that could only help when approaching the live session (and increase participation / completion rates).</li>
</ol>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;&lsquo;Social&rsquo; templates (in which teachers listened to audio recordings of their peers and responded to these in kind) were only used to a very limited degree and these were the most popular activities &ndash; these need to be utilised to a greater extent and additional activity templates that allow for such interaction developed.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>From this experience it was clear that we needed to provide more of a forum which facilitated and afforded such experiences and opportunities (as described in the point above) outside of a structured &lsquo;course&rsquo; of study.</li>
<li>Attitudes towards the &lsquo;authentic experience&rsquo; could have been more thoroughly investigated and the teachers encouraged to reflect on this and what this may mean for their students (e.g. why were the live session attendance rates lower than expected?&nbsp; What implications may this have for the students that they work with and what they do during the live sessions that they themselves facilitate?).&nbsp; This still has not yet been fully explored during future iterations of the course.</li>
</ol>

              <title>Andrew Windram – Designing a New Users e-learning Course (H800 Apr 16)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>I am responsible for the day to day management of an e-learning platform for a large organisation (220,000 personnel).&nbsp; In addition, I am responsible training all the users of the e-learning platform from administrators, course designers and students on how to use the platform according to their user role.</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>The in-service e-learning platform, Docent LMS, had become dated and the organisation decided to replace the LMS with a Moodle LMS.&nbsp; My team migrated the content between the 2 LMS&rsquo; and I was required to develop a training solution that could be undertaken by all learners across the organisation irrespective of location on how to use the new Moodle platform to undertake their learning.&nbsp; The LMS migration took place during April to June 2015 with the old LMS being switched off in the June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority of learners are based throughout the UK; ranging from newly employed personnel to senior managers with many years experience.&nbsp; In addition, several hundred routinely work overseas.&nbsp; Given the age of the previous LMS and its limited functionality, the expectation was that the new Moodle LMS would resolve every conceivable training related issue, from both an organisational and user perspective.</p>
<p>The key actors in the New User Training Course learning design were:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Training Requirements Authority (TRA), who determined what is to be trained.</li>
<li>Moodle SMEs from the Technical Support contractor.</li>
<li>The Media and Graphics team that created the e-learning package</li>
<li>E-learning trainers from within my team: and</li>
<li>Myself as the course designer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>The task was the design of an e-learning package that informed all personnel how they should use the new e-learning platform for individual and collaborative learning and to identify the differences between the old and the new LMS&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Given the relatively high number of complaints about the Docent LMS, success was measured through the rate of uptake of the New User Training Course; the ratio of help desk calls to the number of users; and the number of complaints.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>The following actions were taken in developing the e-learning package:</p>
<ul>
<li>I analysed the performance statement as supplied by the TRA in order to understand what new users of the LMS should be taught.&nbsp; Give that the requirement had been written some ten years previous, there was very little detail and the TRA did not have the resources to further analyse the requirement, so I was given some latitude to &ldquo;reverse engineer&rdquo; the requirement from the solution until such a time that a new requirement was produced.</li>
<li>I created Training Objectives (TO) based on the performance statement and the TOs that supported the training for the Docent LMS (where applicable, e.g. maintain own user account details).</li>
<li>With the support of the Moodle SMEs and the e-learning trainers, we identified the key learning points (KLPs) that make up the totality of the TO.</li>
<li>With the e-learning trainers we conduct a methods and media analysis and determine the appropriate representation for each element of the learning (text, diagram, video clip etc.).</li>
<li>With the support of the Media and Graphics team, I created a storyboard for the e-learning.</li>
<li>Prior to committing to e-learning production, the story board was reviewed with the TRA, SMEs and e-learning trainers.</li>
<li>I then tasked the Media and Graphics team who produced an Alpha version of the New User Training Course, this was created in Captivate and exported as a SCORM rapped package that could be loaded into Moodle.</li>
<li>My team and I conducted user acceptance testing against the Alpha package and I fed back a list of amendments to the Media and Graphics team for their action.</li>
<li>After reviewing the amendments, the package was released as a Beta package on the new LMS during the early stage of migration between the 2 LMS&rsquo;.&nbsp; Early users of the Moodle LMS were invited to undertake the New User Training Course prior to undertaking any other e-learning on the platform.&nbsp; The take-up rate was in the order of 80%, considerably higher than expected.</li>
<li>Prior to the old LMS being switched off, I reviewed the helpdesk call and live user comments and where valid, fed these back in to the Media and Graphics team who made final minor adjustments to the e-learning package and produced a final version of the training.</li>
<li>The final e-learning package was released in June 2015 on the new Moodle LMS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The process of identifying TOs and KLPs and conducting a methods and media analysis prior to storyboarding the e-learning was extremely useful and met the objective of producing a package that is as close to being correct first time and this was born out given that there were very few amendments between the Alpha and Beta e-learning packages.&nbsp; The Beta pilot was received well with very few criticisms being made from across the user base.&nbsp; Where constructive comments were forwarded, we tried to include them in the final release.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, and still holds true to today, we have received less than 10% of the help desk call for the Moodle course that the equivalent Docent based course.</p>
<p>Although the take-up of the New User Training Course is just less than 60% of all users, this is considerably better than that of the equivalent Docent based course which closed at just over 20%.</p>
<p>One additional outcome was that we identified that Docent and Moodle treat the same SCORM data differently and we had to amend the tracking and recording settings on the SCORM generator for Moodle.&nbsp; This learning I was able to share with other courseware designers so that they would not experience any teething problems with their e-learning packages.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>On reflection, the concrete experience of planning, analysing and developing each stage prior to tasking the Media and Graphics team to create the e-learning was the right thing to do.&nbsp; Whilst initially time consuming, overall I believe that going through this process saved me and the other stakeholders a considerable amount of time and resource.&nbsp; Equally, running a Beta pilot with live users was the right thing to do as they viewed the learning in their own context rather than that of a training designer and provided valuable feedback that allowed me to tweak the e-learning package and provide a better product; this approach I have transferred to the piloting of the new Moodle Course Designers Course, which replaces the 7 years old Moodle Developers&rsquo; Course, which will be Beta piloted from 18 April 2016 before going live in September.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p><em>I was tutoring a teenager one-on-one at home in English.</em></p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>The physical space was a living room in early evening, with a clear space in the middle that was to be used for this exercise, and a table we usually sat at, with notebooks. Socially, it was the home environment of the student and her father was present, though was not an actor in this narrative. The time was a single hour a week in which I provided some help with English to supplement what she learned in school. Intentionally, it was a short-term low-frequency set of meetings in which a very specific goal needed to be achieved, namely, that grammar, especially using verbs, were clarified enough for this student to pass her exam.</em></p>
<p><em>Key actors were the teenager, in her last class in high school, and me, the English tutor.</em></p>
<p><em>The student believed she needed to practice grammar, but was unclear exactly what or how she needed to practice. In addition, she overestimated her understanding when something was explained well enough for her to see the logic and apply it immediately after, &ldquo;I can do it&rdquo;, but swung around to underestimating what she could do when she applied it several days after the lesson and found herself making mistakes, &ldquo;I'll never be able to do this&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p><em>After observing this, I speculated she had a partial understanding of most subjects, but mostly required practice to gain confidence in the application.</em></p>
<p><em>A belief that I suspect also played a role was that textbook and class were &ldquo;enough&rdquo; and the student would magically start to understand it if she &ldquo;just made more of an effort&rdquo;, which I didn't believe to be a problem, since she was highly motivated and organised in the work she did for the class.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>The task was to practice the application of verb tenses in sentences. Specifically, that the student would be able to distinguish when to use which, since she already seemed to know how to distinguish between the different types.</em></p>
<p><em>In order to motivate her, I decided to break from the usual format (explain and practice sitting down) to include a physical element to the exercise, since I'd just seen Total Physical Response used in class, and how well moving in space helps sometimes.</em></p>
<p><em>My measure of succes would be how well she could judge whether a particular tense was wrong in a sentence, based either on stated purpose or time the sentence was supposed to describe.</em></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>Before this class, I printed each of the nine tenses we were to practice in large letters, each on an A4. At the start of the exercise, I placed them on the floor in this configuration, to mimic the passage of time in one direction:</em></p>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"><colgroup><col width="33*" /> <col width="43*" /> <col width="41*" /> <col width="51*" /> <col width="38*" /> <col width="50*" /> </colgroup>

<p><em>The first round of the game was meant to be a recap of the class the week before, and an introduction to the exercise, where I hopped from one sheet of paper to the other, and she needed to change the verb in the example sentence to the correct tense. We used each sentence several times so she could hear the difference.</em></p>
<p><em>I discovered even this was a challenge for her, she only remembered half the tenses unprompted, so rather than practice this with two sentences, we did so with five. For the unfamiliar tenses, we stopped to discuss how to make them, and their purpose. This did mean we discover questions she had that might have gone unnoticed during a regular explanation. Especially when she had two different questions about the same tense.</em></p>
<p><em>The second round, I would take a sample sentence, and then change it, and she would need to hop to the correct tense. This allowed me to see if she really did recognise all tenses. We discovered she still had trouble distinguishing the past simple from the present perfect. Otherwise, this round was relatively easy.</em></p>
<p><em>In order to check whether she understood everything now, we briefly repeated the first round, with another two sentences. It went more smoothly now, so it was on to the next round.</em></p>
<p><em>The third round served as a warm-up for the final one, where I said a sentence and then stepped on a certain tense, and she had to say if the two matched or not. This was more difficult for her than I believed it to be, especially given she could match sentence to tense when asked to do it on paper. Spoken English was a lot harder to keep in mind than a sentence in a test, which was easily reread. After I needed to repeat the sentence a few times, we found the problem was solved when I spoke more slowly, as if I was dictating rather than speaking.</em></p>
<p><em>The fourth round she needed to say a sentence, and I had to hop to a certain tense, and she had to say if it was correct or not. This was harder again, since she needed to both think of a tense, how to say it and then judge if my actions matched her thoughts. This went as planned, and she expressed more confidence in being able to link tense and sentence, by a sense of what was correct, though it was still basic, and future perfect was still a bit nebulous to her.</em></p>
<p><em>In order to check that she really was alright, she now had to think of a sentence and hop to the tense, and I had to say whether she was correct. We did this for three sentences before we could say with some confidence that she got it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><em>A major outcome I had not expected was that in doing something weird, we were able to overcome her insecurity that she couldn't do it as well as the overestimation that she was fine when something was explained. Emotion, in this case enjoyment overcoming uncertainty and bravado, plays an important role.</em></p>
<p><em>Unexpected was also that she had more questions about the tenses that hadn't come up before, so it was good that the unusual setting allowed them to arise.</em></p>
<p><em>Expected was that with some intense practice, she would gain more confidence in using and recognising the different tenses. After one class, her grasp of them was not yet perfect, but she was quicker in giving answers and using them and telling me with some confidence that I was standing on the wrong piece of paper.</em></p>
<p><em>A later unexpected result was that she did end up failing her oral exam because she wasn't using her tenses correctly. Not because she couldn't, it turned out, but because of L1 interference and nerves. When talking about her vacation (the subject she'd chosen), she put most of her sentences in the present perfect rather than the past simple, because it most closely resembles the Dutch sentence structure. And when she was nervous, &ldquo;I have&rdquo; (pause) was her standard answer, and only after she paused did she think about what else she wanted to say. Making the sentence a present perfect almost automatically, regardless of whether that was correct.</em></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>I think a major insight I gained was the influence of emotion on what language people produce, especially when it comes to grammar. It makes people self-conscious, so it's good to find ways to circumvent that self-consciousness and turn it into an enjoyable exercise that encourages participation. And, I had not at all foreseen that my student understanding tenses in regular classes would be defeated entirely by her nerves in class.</em></p>
<p><em>Another was that this break from 'regular' tutoring was succesful. I've become more confident in using exercises I couldn't in a group or formal education since then.</em></p>
<p><em>The last was that in preparation I need to build in more redundancies into the exercise, that people will usually have more questions and understand less than they seem to at first.</em></p>
<p><em>And a good one was that not all trouble with grammar necessarily arises from not understanding or practicing grammar. A person's first language and emotion are just as important, among other things. It's good to take that into consideration.</em></p>]]></description>

              <title>Review of ISiS and SCenEdit</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9036</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9036</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello all- found this an intersting challenge and actiivty- I am also very pleased that I wont be typing SCenEdit anymore!!</p>
<p class="Body">Review of ISiS and SCenEdit</p>
<p class="Body">I read and re read the ISiS Model and the ScenEdit tool piece and I did want to understand-because I am very interested in the way design and collaborative tools can be used to make the learning design experience more explicit.&nbsp; Design tools can be a means to challenge the tacit and implicit in the acquisitional model to make clearer the benefits of utilizing a participation model.</p>
<p class="Body">It was difficult to read, which takes away from the potential of the representation, and I was unclear which came first ISiS or ScenEdit.&nbsp; The increased complexity of having at least two different sorts of rectangles, and other images to represent the ideas did add &lsquo;imagery clutter&rsquo; for me.&nbsp; Equally only having images of the tools to depict the activities and scenario didn't make it any easer to work through, and &lsquo;for me&rsquo; at least an explanation that &lsquo;makes&rsquo; so much use of &lsquo;inverted apostrophes is uncertain of the language it is using!</p>
<p class="Body">ISiS is a goal-orientated approach that resides within an intention orientated conceptual model.&nbsp; What this conceptual model is they don't actually seem to say.&nbsp; They do describe what their model attempts to do which is focused on the</p>
<ul>
<li>Intentional</li>
<li>Strategic</li>
<li>Tactical</li>
<li>Operational</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">dimensions of a given scenario (later on in the paragraph it actually says that the &lsquo;model describes 3 dimensions' which results in a description of the scenario which added more confusion for me)</p>
<p class="Body">In short the intention is what the learning design wants to do- the Aim of the lesson.&nbsp; Strategy is the teaching method determined upon (which is itself limited to two types of methods, sequencing or distribution). The tactical is what activity the teacher will do to ensure she meets her aim using the teaching methods determined.&nbsp; These are all then put into a scenario for example a classroom or a home environment.&nbsp; The ScenEdit then goes onto capture this linear sequence in a tool for iterative use and sharing.</p>
<p class="Body">It was difficult to read with the structure of the piece organised in such a way to make it hard to see the levels in the model or the tool.&nbsp; The use then of a vertical outline which is what that tool produces and not use the language in the description in the phases described, did create a big disconnect for me in the description of the concept and the use of the model.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">&nbsp;CADMOS is a tool rather than a conceptual framework.&nbsp; It organises the tool around two models of activity.&nbsp; The conceptual model that describes the different roles and activities, and the Flow model that describes the way in which the learning design unfold, is used, is enacted.</p>
<p class="Body">It is much easer to read than the description of the ISiS, and the graphical representation for the healthy eating lesson and the flow model following illustrate clearly the use of the model.</p>
<p class="Body">&nbsp;I tried to find a link to access a demo of ScenEdit but couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The link via SourceForge was not operational nor was the demo sites accessible so I cant offer a comment on how the tool might be used.&nbsp; The CADMOS site was available and whilst it wouldn't register me the design area was accessible to review.&nbsp; This opportunity to see a design in practice and the use of the computer mouse in hover mode, which enables pop up boxes of extra info, really helped me understand the tool.</p>
<p class="Body">&nbsp;As regards my design, which was a programme of learning of 25 hours for a group of adult learners neither would be adequate for expressing my design.</p>
<p class="Body">The CADMOS tool in the iterations I reviewed on the CADMOS site seemed highly capable of describing and designing activities in a given scenario.&nbsp; It enabled complex ideas, for example web design and bullying to be designed into scenarios.&nbsp; It enabled relationships to be built between teacher, student, students and resources and as such appeared highly flexible for designing individual scenarios.&nbsp; I am not clear on how it would be used to design a learning programme from initial concept through to evaluation.</p>
<p class="Body">The ScenEdit model on the other hand did not, to me, appear as user friendly in the design of the scenarios and didn't seem to be able to build up &lsquo;layers&rsquo; of design activity like the CADMOS model.&nbsp; What the ScenEdit did potentially provide for was a framework that enabled the learning designer to run an idea from concept into a design.&nbsp; It wasn't clear on whether how this might work</p>
<p class="Body">The ScenEdit provides the possibility of engaging with the ADDIE Model- Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation and the CADMOS model seems more capable of enacting the intervention in learning and being more accessible in sharing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">&nbsp;Design needs to happen further up the stream than the scenarios one encounters whilst paddling down the stream.&nbsp; A design tool needs to consider the total environment of the learning and not just individual scenarios.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>The 4 T&rsquo;s model &nbsp;</strong>is very readable, providing a linearly structured overview on activities, roles, technologies and times which is intuitive and should be easy to apply for an experienced teacher. In fact, it very much resembles a conventional lesson script with the additional component of technology. In terms of expressiveness I also find it Therefore it might restrict the learning design to teacher centric options and miss out explorative activities. It seems to me that the &lsquo;Healthy Eating&rsquo; example asks for a more learner centric approach and the 4T&rsquo;s model might be too rigid in terms of timings and possible variance.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The e-Design Template</strong> is also quite &nbsp;readable althogh the linear development of a lesson plan is not its main organising principle. Still this model could be applied in a straight forward manner to formalise existing or planned learning desings in terms of guided vs. self-organised learning. It is easy to identify which forms of learning are applied and at what stage and it becomes immediately apparent that in the example of &lsquo;Healthy Eating&rsquo; opportunities for more open, self-guided learning are missing. Utility is rather restricted with regards to the use of technology as there is no dedicated section for this aspect and potential interdependency of individual activities do not become apparent. &nbsp;</p>]]></description>

<h3><em>&nbsp;</em>Task</h3>
<p>Profiling of project community using assessment centre techniques had identified risk management as an area of weakness.&nbsp; This was recognised as an important area for capability development by Senior Management and the Head of the PMO.&nbsp; Project managers generally felt they were doing it OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Aim: To improve risk management practices</p>
<p>Measure of success:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk workshops run effectively by project managers (stakeholders engaged and report positively in the experience)</li>
<li>Risk logs used appropriately by project managers specifically:</li>
<li>Risks prioritised and measured consistently allowing portfolio views of overall risk exposure</li>
</ul>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>This learning programme was completed over a nine month period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Reflection stage 1</em></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Recent risk logs extracted and analysed in terms of their effectiveness.</li>
<li>Workshop 1 (all PMs): Results reviewed and discussed with all PMs in lunchtime forum session</li>
<li>Workshop 2: (all PMs) Best practice reminder &ndash; review of risk management practices &ndash; PMs work in groups to compare what they are doing with best practices.&nbsp; Action plans developed.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Action stage 2</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop 3 (Senior PMs and PMO) &ndash; Detailed review of best practices in risk management. Standards for quantifying risk debated and agreed.</li>
<li>Coaching on packs provided.</li>
<li>Workshop 4 (all PMs) &ndash; The xxx way for risk management &ndash; briefing session on the new approach to risk management.&nbsp; What should be done, why and how?</li>
<li>Coaching on risk workshops &ndash; Senior PMs</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reflection stage 3</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop 5 (Senior management) Briefed on new process and discuss how they can support process</li>
<li>PMO manager does spot checks on risk logs and provides remedial action coaching support</li>
<li>Internal audit asked to review risk practices and advice on whether improvements are seen</li>
<li>Workshop 6 (Other project groups in other parts of organisation) &ndash; Shared lessons learned with project managers from other groups.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>Expected:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Audit confirmed improvements in risk reporting</li>
<li>Senior managers gained confidence in risk reporting and now demand it as an input to their decision making around projects</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Unexpected:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect and learn process to capability development preferred to simply sending people on training courses.&nbsp; Annual reflect and learn on a selected project process has now been performed for last three years.</li>
<li>18 months after this training the risk management practices were seen to dip down again.&nbsp; We believe this is because of high rates of staff turnover &ndash; new people coming in were not briefed into the process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Insights:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Holding up the mirror&rsquo; &ndash; showing the team how they were currently performing and why they needed to improve was very important.&nbsp; This must be done with no blame and must show that all members of the team can contribute to the improvement &ndash; use of the word &lsquo;we&rsquo; very important.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes it&rsquo;s better to take more time to really embed the capability change in one area than try to address too many improvement areas at once.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Learning programmes over time are good in that the team could try and reflect and try again but they introduce other problems, most notably &ndash; how to deal with staff turnover during this period.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is something we must build into future programmes &ndash; one approach to this is the use of e-based learning supported by coaching by senior PMs.</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Educating GPs about safer opioid prescribing at the end of life</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:   </strong>I am a senior palliative care physician, with a special interest in safe medicines management at the end of life.  I'm also a lecturer at the Graduate Medical School, leading a pain management course. Hence, when an educational programme to address some issues of unsafe prescribing practice amongst local GPs was proposed, I was approached to design and lead it.</p>
<p><strong>Situation:  </strong>The community palliative care team had identified and reported a number of prescribing errors amongst their patients.  Analysis of these incidents showed that the safe prescribing of strong opioids (such as morphine and oxycodone) for pain control in people in the last few weeks of life was an issue, particularly in kidney failure.  Some strong opioids were more risky than others, particularly those that were injected.  There was no pattern of prescriber, practice or location.  Strong opioids are known to "high risk" drugs and this is monitored nationally (<a title="Medicines safety thermometer" href="http://www.safetythermometer.nhs.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3&Itemid=107">Medicines Safety Thermometer</a>).  The local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) agreed that education was required.</p>
<p><strong>Task:  </strong>To educate GPs about safer opioid prescribing at end of life, making them aware of pitfalls and enabling them to implement procedures to mitigate these risks. Success was measured by participant feedback from the educational events and from the number of opioid-related drug errors identified.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<div style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->1) secured dates, times, venue and funding.  Two events were held.  The major obstacle came in securing a venue.  We discovered that the hospice seminar room had been booked extensively by an external team, leaving us limited to Monday afternoons, which is possibly the busiest day of the week for GPs.  We also learnt that the hospice's address on google maps is incorrect, meaning several attendees got lost and turned up late.  We have had to prioritise meeting rooms for palliative care, signpost delegates clearly to the correct postcode and explore the possibility of providing online collaborative learning for GPs in</div>
<div style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--> </div>
<div style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->2) I reviewed national guidance and published literature on opioids, including their side effects and safe prescribing guidelines.</div>
<div style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--> </div>
<div style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->3)  I reflected on medicines management improvement project we had successfully implemented in the hospice.  I used this process-based structure as a framework for small group discussion about the risks GPs and patients face.</div>
<div style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--> </div>
<div style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->4) The GPs were then asked to come up with ideas to reduce these risks from their own practice and referencing national guidelines.</div>
<div style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--> </div>
<div style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->5)  the session ended with each participant writing a pledge to do something differently in their practice as a result of this education.  Pledges (anonymous) were displayed on a "pledge wall", which was photographed and shared on Twitter.</div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Results:  </strong>The sessions evaluated well, with a total of 40 attendees.  Everyone made a pledge and consented to it being shared.  A minority of participants did not like the group work, stating a preference for didactic "talk and chalk" learning.  It's too early to know whether drug errors have reduced and we may never be able to measure exactly how much these sessions have contributed to safer patient care.  However, the CCG has formally commissioned more education, so I interpret that as success.  Unexpected learning came in relation to our system for booking classrooms</p>
<p><strong>Reflections:  </strong>These sessions had the potential to be confrontational, as we (te hospice team) had identified an area of inadequate practice in the professional group we were educating.  I had to ensure there wouldn't be an "us and them" hierarchy.  I tried to do this by making it a collaborative effort and it largely worked.  We will have to see if it has contributed to safer care by monitoring error reports.  I would definitely try this approach again rather than the usual large group teaching.  I was also pleased that everyone made a pledge, even if it was from a sense of bemusement rather than genuine commitment.</p>

              <title>Social Work Practice Educators Briefing</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8977</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8977</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>My role was to organise and co-facilitate the briefing </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;Situation</p>
<p>The briefing is an annual event in the calendar of the OU&rsquo;s social work programme in the south west of England.&nbsp; The event takes place in a hotel, we use one large conference room for the main event plus bar areas for coffee/lunch. The key actors are social work staff members who give presentations focused on the practice learning element of the OU&rsquo;s BA Hons Social Work. The degree has 170 days where students are on placement and their developing professional social work practice is assessed. The assessment is principally undertaken by qualified social workers who have undergone further training to become &lsquo;Practice Educators&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The event also serves to showcase the OU&rsquo;s work face to face in the context of the degree being offered through a distance learning route. The event attracts about 40 participants.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The principal aim is to inform practice educators about how to work with, and assess, Open University social work students undertaking work placements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It is difficult to identify measures of success but possibilities are</p>
<p># positively completed event evaluation forms</p>
<p># anecdotal positive comments from participants during and at the end of the day</p>
<p># low number of post event queries from participants about topics/issues covered at the briefing</p>
<p># high level of students successfully completing their placements.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>The event was designed to convey information about the OU&rsquo;s social work programme, to help participants to understand the philosophy and method by which practice learning is assessed in the OU, and to promote a shared learning amongst the participants (many of whom are very experienced in their roles).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The day was split into several sessions</p>
<h2>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome and introductions</h2>
<h2>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The OU social work programme: supporting practice learning</h2>
<h2>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment of practice learning: using the Professional Capabilities Framework</h2>
<h2>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students&rsquo; reflective writing: how to interpret and assess</h2>
<h2>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice learning and peer support: how students can support each other</h2>
<h2>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plenary</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>The expected outcomes of the sessions included</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>a raised awareness for participants of the nature of distance learning and the pressures for learners of undertaking professional study while sponsored by their employer,</li>
<li>Greater familiarity for participants with the OU&rsquo;s processes for assessing practice learning</li>
<li>Greater familiarity with the professions standards for professional practice (The Professional Capabilities Framework)</li>
<li>Reflection by participants on the central role of reflection and reflective writing in social work practice learning assessment</li>
<li>Consideration of how peer supports might be an effective way of students developing resilience in them to complete their studies.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>The briefing went well but it is interesting to reflect on the challenges of coordinating a group of staff to facilitate the day when, as a staff group, we rarely meet. I had particular expectations of how colleagues would facilitate sessions but at times the way the sessions were facilitate was very different to how I would have done it. This has let me to think about how as educational practitioners we all have different strengths and styles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Equally the role of participants was interesting. With forty participants at the event they all brought different qualities and skills which in turn influence the development of the &lsquo;tone&rsquo; of the day. People were broadly receptive to the structure and content of the day but there was a sense to all facilitators that participants wanted greater clarity and certainty than we could provide on some topics. So, for example, practice learning assessment &ndash; even with criteria and guidance &ndash; is essentially a subjective judgement. Therefore it is very difficult to set out what &lsquo;the standard&rsquo; is, or what &lsquo;the right answer is&rsquo; or &lsquo;the right level&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When I discussed how this subjectivity gave permission for practice educators to use their professional judgement and autonomy it seemed to back fire and be interpreted as a lack of clarity or certainty from the University about what constituted a &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; standard of work!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;So, a key reflection from the event &ndash; to contribute to the development of future briefings &ndash; is how to enable participants to recognise their own skills and autonomy to make assessments, to believe that the University will respect their judgements, and to learn how to cope with the anxiety that a lack of certainty/objectivity, inherent in practice learning, creates.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Text from discussion re DPD</p>
<p>It is interesting how slanted the DPD is towards the sciences and science education (at least this is how it appears to me). &nbsp;When I browse and click on specific features these appear to almost all belong to the sciences. The meta and pragmatic principles are more accessible to a non-scientist I think.</p>
<p>Text from discussion re e-Design template</p>
<p>I also like how easy it is to see how the lesson is chunked. There is mention of student-external activity in the paragraph following the table, it is difficult to see where this might be. I think it would be very interesting to see the final or penultimate lesson and see if any activity made it over to the self-organised learner column.</p>
<p>I do think it is early enough in the inquiry not to expect much open activity, though perhaps the case study itself might have missed an opportunity by picking such an early lesson to evaluate?</p>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8963</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Narrator</h2>
<p dir="ltr">My role was to support a teacher in conceptualising, designing, development and implementation of an online learning activity.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Situation</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">University of Applied Sciences, Department for Social Work</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Compulsory elective subject in a bachelor curriculum for Social Work.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students (approx. 40) attending the course into their 3rd or 4th term, having completed several courses covering theoretical and methodical basics of the field.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students have to deliver a report on a project they have worked on during the course. This is a group work of 3-4 students and delivered at the end of the term.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Previously, a significant proportion of the face-to-face course time has been used for organizing group work, providing instruction and facilitating communication. Peer feedback in the face-to-face environment has proven to be very time-consuming and has often not been leading to satisfactory results</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">LMS: Moodle (Students have worked with Moodle before, but are not necessarily experienced with collaborative elements and practices; teacher is fairly familiar with Moodle)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Task</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I have focused on opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness of group collaboration in this course. I decided to use blended learning elements which would allow to guide students towards group work and communication in a virtual environment. I selected administrative, organizational and methodological elements of writing a term paper which could be supported by with online components. The measure of success was a reduction of administrative and organisational efforts by the teacher and administrative staff.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I also included elements of reflection and evaluation for the students to &nbsp;take an active, participative, and critical role (providing peer-feedback at several stages of the paper writing process). The success factor was a consistent quality in the term papers delivered, not below the quality of previous papers delivered in the standard course format.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Actions</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Together with the teacher in charge I drafted a concept for the course, including goals, key stakeholders, format and sequence of elements included, implementation of a pilot, implementation of the final course, and evaluation by students, teacher, and supportive staff. The result was a common understanding of the goals as well as the actions to be taken and related responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I then developed the main elements and run a pilot with a few selected testers not yet involved in the course design. It turned out that several elements were not sufficiently described or did not work exactly the way they were intended.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">On the basis of the pilot we adapted the course design were necessary and then run the course for an entire term. At the end of the turn we evaluated the results, questioned students, staff and teacher and analysed the overall outcomes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Results</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The papers delivered were of a consistent quality at about the same level as in the previous version of the course (without blended learning elements). The effort for preparing and developing the course was significant, during the course support and occasional adjustments were necessary which also meant some additional effort for both teacher and supportive staff. However, most of the issues could be resolved for the next term and without the one-time preparational efforts qualitative as well as quantitative objectives could be met.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A survey conducted among the students showed that most of them appreciated the design of the course, but would have liked to use the space for further collaboration more extensively.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Reflections</h2>
<p dir="ltr">It is important to create a detailed design of the course - including goals, key stakeholders, elements and sequencing, evaluation, etc. - in order to make sure that all involved parties have the same understanding of the project. However, even with a detailed design there are issues which cannot be anticipated and therefore running a pilot with people who have not been involved previously is crucial to discover any gaps and flaws. At the end, an evaluation can reveal further gaps and issues, but also provide input for further development.</p>

              <title>SJ From F2F to on-line support for B201 Global Direct</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8959</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8959</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp; From F2F to on-line support for B201 Global Direct</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp; Over the summer of last year I was asked, with another tutor, to help create tutorial resources for B201 Global Direct &ndash; an on-line version of the B201 course I tutor for the Open University.&nbsp; These tutorials would be delivered via OU Live.</p>
<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Situation</strong><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->:</strong>&nbsp; After and initial face-to-face meeting at the OU in Milton Keynes, with the course team leader, the work was to be completed by myself and another tutor. At the initial meeting time scales were arranged and a tutorial schedule decided upon and the work divided between myself and the other tutor. Contact would be virtual, via email and telephone, and a Dropbox folder was created for us to put in on-going resources.&nbsp; The team leader drove the work; they had been tasked with finding a way to take a course, which had originally been designed to have face-to-face support, and create resources that would allow for this to be delivered in the virtual environment of OU Live.</p>
<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Task:</strong>&nbsp; We were trying to create / adapt tutorial materials for an on-line only version of B201.&nbsp; Success would be measured in part by this creation, that by an agreed date we would have a full set of tutorial resources, including PowerPoint slides, tutorial plans and tutorial notes.&nbsp; Success however was also to be measured in the use of the tutorials created &ndash; in how well they worked and suited their purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<p>Creating each tutorial started with looking at the content to be covered, the course is divided into topics, which have a given range of materials.<br />Case materials were then considered for the purpose of creating activities that would lend themselves to the tools within OU Live &ndash; drop and drag, breakout rooms and so on.<br />A rough plan for the tutorial would be created and shared with my colleague for comment.&nbsp; When agreed the plan would be completed fully.<br />PowerPoint slides to accompany the plan and the tutorial notes were developed.&nbsp; These were all posted to Dropbox for both my colleague and the course team to access.</p>
<p><em><strong>There were problems:</strong></em></p>
<p>The nature of activities within OU Live need to be different than those tutors can use in a face-to-face environment.&nbsp; It is better to keep them shorter and more focused than would be necessary in a classroom, this made it difficult to cover some content meaningfully, that content that benefits from more discussion. &nbsp;We overcame this by linking activities, short individual activities building up knowledge content.</p>
<p>It was also difficult to fully convey the purposes and hoped for results of the activities.&nbsp; This links to a comment in the H800 materials &ndash; <em>&lsquo;</em><em>design is an inherent part of any educator&rsquo;s and trainer&rsquo;s practice (i.e. preparing for teaching/training sessions or creating learning materials, activities and assessments). Indeed, it is so core to what educators and trainers do, that it&rsquo;s often taken for granted; it&rsquo;s assumed that it &lsquo;just happens&rsquo;. In other words, &lsquo;design&rsquo; is so embedded in a practitioner&rsquo;s practice that it tends to be implicit &ndash; not formally articulated or externalised for others, apart from at a relatively superficial level in the module syllabus or lesson plan.&rsquo;</em>&nbsp; (Open University, 2015).&nbsp; It was difficult to fully convey our understanding of what we had designed without being overly prescriptive in what tutors could do within these sessions.</p>
<p>A further problem was with having 2 tutors with different styles producing tutorials.&nbsp; Again, difficult to overcome but we were successful in part by standardizing our approach using standard plans, tutorial form (all starting with an opening discussion for example) and tutorial notes.</p>
<p><strong>Results:&nbsp; </strong>The tutorials were completed as per requirements; in this respect the objectives of the activity were met.&nbsp; However, how successful we were in producing effective resources is still to be seen.&nbsp; I have used OU Live with my current group &ndash; to allow me to assess the efficacy of the resources we produced, however, only few tutorials have been used so far, not enough to gain an overall picture as to how effective they are.</p>
<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Reflections</strong><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->:</strong>&nbsp; For me this was an extremely valuable experience and I learned a lot about how tutorials and their resources need to be different for an on-line environment.&nbsp; OU Live is becoming increasingly important within the OU, training in this is a requirement for &lsquo;appointabilty&rsquo; on courses (the new B100 for example), what I have learned as part of this activity is still building as I gain more experience of OU Live, via these tutorials or others.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Narrator</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Tutor/teacher</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Situation</h2>
<p dir="ltr">OU Live</p>
<p dir="ltr">Web conferencing software</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students have Sense programming software at home and a Sense board (with LED lights and a button)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Level one HE students</p>
<p dir="ltr">One tutors</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some students may have met at dayschool but would expect them not to know eachother.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They may have some sense of community from communicating on the forum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They want to learn programming.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Task</h2>
<p dir="ltr">What were you trying to achieve?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The students may believe that they should use the programming environment immediately before working out a design and developing the logic for their program. I want to give them the tools to enable them to design the logic first which is then translatable into any computer programming language.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What was your measure of success?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The measure will be seen in their approach to the programming problems in the module.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Whether they are able to do the task set and quickly program a solution.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Actions</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Introduce the 3 d&rsquo;s</p>
<p dir="ltr">Firstly by using a mundane situation - taking off wallpaper</p>
<p dir="ltr">Define - define the problem in one sentence</p>
<p dir="ltr">Describe - describe the steps required to be able to create the details for the problem</p>
<p dir="ltr">Detail - write out the algorithm for solving the problem</p>
<p dir="ltr">Introduce the programming problem - setting up LED lights to model traffic lights</p>
<p dir="ltr">Put students in small (2 / 3) groups</p>
<p dir="ltr">report back each &ldquo;D&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students get caught out understanding the difference between describe and detail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tell them that one of the steps in describe needs to be to find the regulations for traffic lights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Make sure they all have the correct algorithm (shared in large group)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ask each student to program their Sense Board</p>
<p dir="ltr">Using simulator do application shares on random students</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Results</h2>
<p dir="ltr">List the expected and unexpected outcomes of your actions. To what degree did you meet your objectives? What additional outcomes did you engender? Provide evidence to back your claims.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Those students who are already able to program find this much easier and need extension activities (using button as pedestrian wait)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Used to group students with an experienced programmer at helm, now make sure that all the non-programmers are together and let the programmers be creative - so split the groups. This is because programmers found it too easy and non-programmers were able to hide behind this.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Reflections</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I will try this out next week because this is a classroom activity we do at Dayschool but should be transferable to the OU Live environment.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Narrator</strong> &ndash; My role is as a marketing tutor in HE. I am to facilitate learning and understanding of the promotion mix and use of marketing communication tools</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong> &ndash; A higher education establishment within an FE college.&nbsp; We are using a computer suite with one PC per student. The group of 18 are mature and diverse and are studying for an FdA in leadership and management. &nbsp;They are a well established group, they have known each other for 6 months but this is their first time in the computer room. This session is important as is relates directly to their next assessment task.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong> &ndash; The students are given a template listed with a number of promotion tools available and some other marketing concepts. They have been instructed to view the website of one organisation and describe examples to fit into the template. For example they might look at Next and look for evidence of relationship marketing. &nbsp;They have been told to work in pairs and discuss what they find in a plenary at the end of the session. The purpose of the task is the help them become more familiar with the promotional tools and examine the strengths and weaknesses of each tool in context. The success will be measured in terms of the population of the template and the quality of the short presentation at the end.</p>
<p>Actions</p>
<ol>
<li>Students put themselves into pairs and log on to PC</li>
<li>Handout template</li>
<li>Students read instructions on sheet (template)</li>
<li>Tutor provides more detailed instruction and advises good orgs to use</li>
<li>Students &nbsp;find relevant website</li>
<li>Students start at the top of the template with advertising and begin to navigate the website for examples</li>
<li>Students jump from one box (on template) to another when they come across relevant examples to add.</li>
<li>Tutor visits each pair to offer help and assistance and encourage students to evaluate what they discover.</li>
</ol>
<p>Results</p>
<p>All students fill out the template and present their&nbsp;findings at the end of the session. One group worked in a group of 4 and divided the work into 2. One person worked alone. &nbsp;All students were engaged and had much anecdotal experience to share. One student wanted to look at game company but found the site blocked.</p>
<p>Reflection</p>
<p>An interesting task which all students can relate to, many pick org they work for such as Halfords or orgs they use such as Boots. &nbsp;Some of them started to consider the implications of the tools used and the impact of them on sales or customer perception of the org. Not all of them noticed the blending of the tools and how they over lap. The limitation of the template is that students try to make all examples fit into a box.&nbsp; Some students started to understand the use of loyalty cards and relationship marketing. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a practical and interactive task. I should have got all the groups evenly matched to create a level playing field and ensuring all students have the some amount of work to complete.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<h1>4Ts</h1>
<h2>Readability</h2>
<p>Very readable.&nbsp; Swim lane, starting at the top and moving down is a simple structure and qute easy to read.&nbsp; The bubble shapes might make adding detail a little tricky.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Expressiveness</h2>
<p>Quite expressive but everything has to fit the notation.&nbsp; Could be a difficult fit with some scenarios, particularly if there is any iteration involved or if activities can occur in different orders</p>
<h2>Utility (i.e. their usefulness in communicating important aspects of the design).</h2>
<p>Could be very useful because it is simple.&nbsp; On the other hand if the tool is to be used for sharing designs it would require all the sharers to be happy to use this rather structures approach</p>
<h2>Adequacy for my design</h2>
<p>Mu design would fit this model.&nbsp; On the other hand my design actually changes in detail each time I use it so I would need to have various versions of the design which would get clunky</p>
<h2>Benefits of using this representation for my design</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>4SPPIces Model and in LdShake</h1>
<h2>Readability</h2>
<p>As far as you can see from the diagram&nbsp; in <a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/4sppices">http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/4sppices</a>&nbsp; this is a simple, readable model of a learning process.&nbsp; Everything is there on one page, so it&rsquo;s a great summary.&nbsp; Its not so easy to see what other levels of detail exist.&nbsp; It appears that you can dive into more detail but that the detail might lose the view of the four PM, P, S H categories.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Expressiveness</h2>
<p>This seems expressive at the summary level but its hard to see how the different elements connect in the design.&nbsp; There seem to be constraints in that the designer must use the 4 categories but the relationships between them may not be obvious.&nbsp; This is in contrast to 4Ts and e-Design where relationships between swim lanes is clearer</p>
<h2>Utility (i.e. their usefulness in communicating important aspects of the design).</h2>
<p>The usefulness of this model may be more connected to the apparent ease with which learning designs may be shared between designers using the LdShake tool.&nbsp; It is hard to tell with the level of detail provided.&nbsp; You can get a better idea of what it may like to use the associated the tool from here <a href="http://ldshake.upf.edu/">http://ldshake.upf.edu/</a> .</p>
<h2>Adequacy for my design</h2>
<p>My learning design is quite flexible and can change from day to day.&nbsp; The notation would seem to accommodate this.&nbsp; On the other hand the summary does not tell you much about how the design actually works.&nbsp; So I would still prefer 4T or e-Design.</p>
<h2>Benefits of using this representation for my design</h2>
<p>This model may communicate the essence of my design well by allowing the different elements of the design to be presented.&nbsp; But the model does not easily show how my learning design would work in practice.&nbsp; I would prefer to use 4Ts as this method does not provide the detail needed to operate the method.&nbsp; There seems little room for ad hoc comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Comparison with Systems Design</h1>
<p>With systems design, there are different design notations that are closely associated with different design methodologies.&nbsp; For example object oriented systems design &nbsp;(e.g. see <a href="http://www.kilowattsoftware.com/tutorial/rooPresentation/ooFundamentals2.htm">http://www.kilowattsoftware.com/tutorial/rooPresentation/ooFundamentals2.htm</a>) adopts a completely different notation than a more traditional approach &ndash; say SSADM (<a href="http://www2.docm.mmu.ac.uk/STAFF/M.Stanton/sad/Tutorials/DFDTutorial3.html">http://www2.docm.mmu.ac.uk/STAFF/M.Stanton/sad/Tutorials/DFDTutorial3.html</a>). &nbsp;This is because software design has changed over time and design techniques have changed to accommodate the advances in technology.&nbsp; To me the connection between learning theory and the method for communicating the design is not as developed in the examples of LD models here.&nbsp; The notation does not seem to connect explicitly with learning theory.&nbsp; 4Ts and e-Design seem convenient notations resembling process design rather than any specific learning theory.&nbsp; 4SPPIces may come closer though the theory is less familiar to me.&nbsp; Would it be better to find a theory of learning that work first and then find tools that enable the design to be created and shared second?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I have missed some obvious points&hellip;&nbsp; I wonder what others think?</p>]]></description>

              <title>Review of 4T Model and Web Collage methods of Representation</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8692</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8692</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Review of 4 T&rsquo;s Model and Web Collage</strong></p>
<p>The 4T&rsquo;s model might have appealed to me because it appeared to come straight out of a project manager&rsquo;s handbook.&nbsp; The 4T&rsquo;s could be renamed to Task, People, Resources, Time or a variety of other titles that would also convey the same idea.</p>
<p>I liked the linear simplicity of this model, with its focus on constructivist pedagogies.&nbsp; The fact that each task is of a particular duration is an important factor in planning.&nbsp; The simple and elegant graphical illustration made the lesson plan easy to follow and understand, even when looking at collaborative group work in the class. I felt that it would be easy to use.</p>
<p>However, it was limited in that it did not have a focus on defining the environment, defining the objectives, or understanding the learner&rsquo;s aspirations.</p>
<p>Webcollage was the complete opposite of the 4Ts for me.&nbsp; I spent a not inconsiderable amount of time trying to comprehend it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I liked the idea that the model created could be used to create a lesson directly in moodle.&nbsp; I liked the idea of a collage of ideas, graphically represented, that could be quickly used to put together a raft of complementary activities in a lesson.&nbsp; But when taken as a whole, I felt that the method of modelling took something that should be simple, and made it into something more complex, the opposite of what it was supposed to achieve.</p>
<p>I found that I actually used items from 3 or 4 of the learning design representations when designing the learning activity that I described in Activity 1B.&nbsp; One of the keys to the success outlined in my chosen narrative was clearly defining the objectives and the environment.&nbsp; The other important aspect was not deviating from these, even when problems occurred. The overall design followed the path laid out in the eDesign Template representation, where the learner was first of all shown the important tasks, then she worked under supervision, and finally learned and worked on her own.&nbsp; However, the detail design followed the 4T&rsquo;s, with each Task given a resource in, an output and a time allocation.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Paul McCullough&#39;s Design Narrative: Muddling through Moodle Management</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8690</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title</strong>&nbsp;Muddling through Moodle Management</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>I design and setup elearning solutions for small healthcare agencies who want their staff to do compliance training online.&nbsp; The key to getting this setup to work is to make sure the Training Administrator (TA) who manages staff training, is confident in the use of the new system.&nbsp; If the TA understands and instructs her staff well, then I am not bothered by support calls.</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>The TA usually has had a the job of following protocols with regards training requirements &nbsp;and ensuring that training courses are organised and staff files are kept current.&nbsp;&nbsp; A new system of work can cause changes to the established way of working, and needs to be introduced with care.&nbsp; If the online training solution is seen to make everyone&rsquo;s lives easier and more manageable, then it is continued by management.&nbsp; If there is bad feedback from staff, then it is discontinued.</p>
<p>I have found that a training that follows specific protocols works well in these situations.&nbsp; I also have found that the training must take place with the candidate&rsquo;s own computer, so that they can take ownership of the training directly.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>If the client understands how to enrol students, what the common FAQ&rsquo;s are, and how to deal with common problems, then I do not get inundated with support queries.&nbsp; The measure of success is measured over the ensuing weeks, by the number of support calls I receive, and by the feedback the system receives from staff.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>The first action was ensuring that the candidate&rsquo;s computer was setup in a way that ensured a successful &nbsp;outcome.</p>
<p>The company IT department had left IE7 as the default web browser.&nbsp; This is so out of date, that it wouldn&rsquo;t work with &nbsp;the HTML5 &nbsp;coursework that we use.&nbsp; I had to ask for an upgrade, and preferably for google chrome (which is automatically updated) to be installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next stage was to set up a series of steps that the candidate could follow for each of the processes involved.</p>
<p>These included templates of instructions for enrolment, what to do when emails went missing, how to print out certificates and the basics of managing the site.</p>
<p>By having a folder with protocols set up, the training was reasonably simple and straightforward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also asked the TA to take notes that she could refer to in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The results of the training were better than expected. By focusing on the client&rsquo;s desire to follow systems, I was able, in a short space of time, to get the online system rolled out to the agency&rsquo;s staff.</p>
<p>In the first week or so there were some minor hiccoughs, but things went relatively smoothly.</p>
<p>With my time not taken up doing support, I was able to offer some further courses to the company that they could use for staff development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Both staff and management were very supportive of the system as both groups felt it gave them greater flexibility, while increasing interaction within the company.&nbsp; I felt that this was due, to a large degree, to the confidence that everyone had in using the system.&nbsp; This confidence was hinged on the clear instructions and support that they received at the start of their training by the TA.&nbsp; While the TA&rsquo;s attitude and personal competence played a major part, I would like to think that the training she received at the beginning, also helped in the success.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>Understanding that the TA wanted a series of protocols to follow, and providing these in a clear way, underpinned the success of this training.&nbsp; She was not interested in the the pedagogal and instructional theories that underpinned the training.&nbsp; The TA wanted to give clear instructions to candidates in what to do to complete the training, and wanted a simple outcome at the end of each training session.</p>
<p>Understanding&nbsp; the TA&rsquo;s objectives, and gearing the training to both her objectives, and her existing way of working, helped make the transition smooth.</p>

              <title>Review of 4SPPIces and E-design template</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8678</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8678</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I chose 4SPPIces as a representation.&nbsp; The healthy eating example is laid down in a diagram that is very accessible. The project aspires to create a common language that promotes collaboration between teachers and technicians. I&rsquo;m in favour of a common language in principle, but this can also be a barrier to others so this has dangers and may militate against this idea. I was struck by the description of dataflow, not show in the paper. I think that the capacity to describe the learning &lsquo;conversation&rsquo; of &lsquo;incomes&rsquo; and &lsquo;outcomes&rsquo; is useful. The model provides a structure to think about four significant aspects of learning design.</p>
<p>I also chose e-design template. I didn&rsquo;t find the graphic representation very helpful, so I split it up in table form, in order to understand it fully. I was able to see the progression across the stages more clearly and the gradual emergence of the autonomous learner. It also reminded me of the four stages of competence <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence</a> and Blooms Taxonomy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy</a> . &nbsp;It has a comforting familiarity.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Students engaging more closely with Lesson Objectives</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8673</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I teach two classes of Level 3 BTEC Business Students&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>They are second year BTEC Business students mostly aged between 17 and 19 years old.&nbsp; The course consists of 18 units covered over two years. I was teaching Internet Marketing which involved the students in much researching on line.</p>
<p>Assessment of students is through coursework.&nbsp; Tutors set 1-3 assignments per unit</p>
<p>The two classes are taught in a relatively modern teaching block. The classrooms are equipped with desktop computers or laptops.&nbsp; Students mostly choose their own desks on entering the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Task</strong></h2>
<p>College policy was for all courses to have Schemes of Work (a detailed week by week plan for teaching each module) and each lesson to have a Lesson Plan.&nbsp; The format of these were mandatory following OFSTED guidelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tutors are subject to at least one formal observation each year.&nbsp; Two years ago the main feedback for tutors following observations focused on &lsquo;lesson objectives&rsquo; and weaknesses in students&rsquo; engagement with them during a lesson.&nbsp; I, like others, would write up the lesson objectives at the beginning of the lesson and refer to them during the lesson and at the end when the results of each lesson would be summed up in the &lsquo;plenary section&rsquo; of the class. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My initial objective was to find a way for students and me, their tutor, to engage better with the objectives of a lesson in the hope that their participation in class and performance in the assessments would improve. And, yes, another objective was that this might contribute to a nice grade if the class was observed!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, take up and use by and feedback from students would be a leading indicator of success together with my own reflections.&nbsp; This could be followed up by comparing the performance of students with assignments compared with previous years or other units.&nbsp; The best indicator of success would be the number of referrals of student work.&nbsp; Whilst this data is now being gathered, comparative data would be hard to find.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Early in the teaching of the module, ask students to review the module's assessment criteria and for each assessment criterion describe:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>What they need to know and</li>
<li>What they need to know how to do in order to be able to meet each criterion</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>In order to create a meaningful list of students&rsquo; learning objectives, each criterion was discussed in class and students completed descriptions of what they felt they needed to know and what they needed to be able to do to achieve the assessment criterion.&nbsp; I then collected these at the end of the lesson.&nbsp; The difficulty here was that students would often not identify all the knowledge and skills gaps that would need to be covered.&nbsp; In these cases I introduced these in the discussion and &lsquo;reserved the right&rsquo; to add others later</li>
<li>By the next lesson, I had pulled the students&rsquo; objectives together and created a combined &lsquo;learning log&rsquo; from the output of the discussions. The challenge was to preserve the essence and the words of students whilst keeping the list of objectives short and comprehensive. &nbsp;The log consisted of a multi page, four column table.<ol start="1">
<li>The left hand column listed the assessment criteria.</li>
<li>The second column listed the various learning objectives agreed with the students for each criterion</li>
<li>The third column was blank and headed &lsquo;Date when learnt&rsquo;</li>
<li>The final column also blank was headed &lsquo;How Learnt&rsquo;</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Each criterion was thus linked to 5 &ndash; 10 learning objectives which would now form the basis of lessons. These Lesson Objectives would appear on the interactive whiteboard at various points in the lesson and would always be in front of students in class on paper, on their desks.&nbsp; &nbsp;Copies of the log was made and given to each student who added their names to the log. &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>At the beginning of each lesson, I handed out the log to of the students.&nbsp; The lesson was introduced with reference to learning objectives set on the log.&nbsp; During the lesson I could refer to the log as the lesson developed</li>
<li>At the end of the lesson, students were asked to review their logs and place today's a date next to each lesson objectives that the student felt they had met.&nbsp; Students were also asked to place a comment in the &lsquo;How Learnt&rsquo; column.&nbsp; The difficulty here was convincing students not to blindly tick everything but date only those objectives they felt were achieved.&nbsp; This often worked and I was sometime disappointed how few objectives were ticked &ndash; though happy that I was aware of this!</li>
<li>Before students left the class, they handed back the log to me which enabled me to see quickly what each student felt they had learnt</li>
<li>As preparation for the next lesson, I could see where there were gaps in each students&rsquo; progress and could adapt the next lesson accordingly.&nbsp; This helped with differentiation in class</li>
<li>As I handed out the logs at the beginning of the next lesson it was evident where gaps in each student&rsquo;s learning existed.&nbsp; In practice it was often difficult for me to assess the starting point of each student.&nbsp; As students arrived in the classroom over a period of minutes there was some time for me to assess each student&rsquo;s log. However this was often not completely effective.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Completion of the logs was initially patchy but gradually improved so that by the end of the unit most of the logs were at least, complete.&nbsp; Some students simply ticked rather than dated each entry.&nbsp; It is clear that some saw the exercise as a &ldquo;tick box&rdquo; affair.</li>
<li>However, most students were more thorough entering dates and often how they learnt.&nbsp; Interestingly as the exercise progressed, students would ask for their logs if I was slow handing them out.</li>
<li>Two students tried to use the lesson objectives as assessment criteria in their assignments which actually slowed their progress to completion of assignments.&nbsp; One of these students preferred to retain the log at the end of the lesson rather than return it.</li>
<li>The result was that I could use the logs to find gaps in achievement or student confidence.&nbsp; For me the logs were very useful evidence of what had worked in the class and what did not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>For me the technique holds promise:&nbsp; students are now used to completing the logs and are happy to do so.&nbsp; Some are more diligent than others.&nbsp; However, non attendance does mean that the logs are blank and this in itself is a graphic way of highlighting gaps in learning to be filled in.</li>
<li>The next step would be to try and measure success in a quantifiable way.</li>
<li>It would also be useful to see what other teachers have found in similar schemes.</li>
<li>The key to developing this would be to find a way of tracking success efficiently.&nbsp; Given the load of other tasks, it is hard to find time to do this.&nbsp; On the other hand, if by taking a little more responsibility for their learning, students can produce better work, time should be saved in marking and revision.</li>
<li>I am conscious that the whole exercise is paper based!&nbsp; In an environment where all students have desktops in classrooms the reliance on technology is significant.&nbsp; Would another window open on line be as effective as this rare paper exercise?&nbsp; My feelings are that for this classs, paper is a more convenient way for students to record their learning and that it is quicker for me to access.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Finally I am conscious that it might be useful to show examples of the log and I will endeavour to scan some in. &nbsp;</li>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8649</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I was at the start of running an after school robotics club for year 8 (13-14 years) pupils. I was a mathematics teacher in the school but had experience of computing as well.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>The club was going to run for an hour and a half after school and we were in a dedicated computer room. We had four new sets of Lego &lsquo;Mindstorms&rsquo; robots which can be programmed either in a &lsquo;drag and drop&rsquo; form or for more experienced users in a number of computer languages. The program is written on a computer, in the case of &lsquo;drag and drop&rsquo; with supplied software and then down loaded to the control unit. The robot has to be built out of the Lego with the control unit incorporated into the build. The pupils attending the club were limited to eight in number, because of the availability of equipment, and had to express interest on a list prior to joining. The places were allocated on a first come first served basis and there was a waiting list throughout the school year. The pupils were mainly boys and they had all used technical Lego at home with varying degrees of expertise. They did not initially know each other but soon formed a strong friendship group. They all expressed an interest in robots but had no previous experience of any kind of programming.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>This describes the first task set for them at the initial meeting. They had no access to either the Lego or computers at this time. I was aiming to build the group of boys together as a collaborative group, to give them an initial understanding of how they needed to think in order to be a successful programmer. To have a lot of fun.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>When the boys arrived for this first meeting, the first task I gave them was to come up with, by the following week, a name for the club and a logo that could be displayed on a notice board. I explained to them that for the first week they would not be using the Lego or the computers but they would soon find out why!</p>
<p>I sat them down in a group and handed out paper; then gave them their task for the session. They were also giving a sketch plan of two sides of a kitchen, there was one side, with a notional robot facing it, that held a kitchen sink with hot and cold taps and surrounding surfaces, to the robots left, the other side was a worktop holding a kettle, a tub of teabags a mug and an unopened bottle of milk.</p>
<p>They were told to write instructions to the robot to reach it how to make a mug of tea. They were also told that it was not a competitive task; they were free to collaborate as much as they liked.</p>
<p>They were given up to half an hour to complete the task, with a definitive list of instructions they all agreed on.</p>
<p>After this time, I asked them to read the result to me one step at a time and I responded with comments and questions as they did so. It was suggested that they took any notes that they considered relevant as they would need the insight when they started on their first actual program.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>Expected results: </em></p>
<p>There was initial disappointment at not being allowed to start straight in with the Lego.</p>
<p>The instructions they wrote were incomplete and at times confusing.</p>
<p>My comments produced some hilarity among the group as they started to understand the complexity of the task.</p>
<p>The common errors that I was expecting were</p>
<ul>
<li>They did not turn the robot on, so nothing happened</li>
<li>They did not take the lid off the kettle when filling it, so we all got sprayed with water!</li>
<li>They did not plug the kettle into the power point and/or turn it on</li>
</ul>
<p>The outcome of all this was that they started to gel as a group and to relax with me out of &lsquo;teacher mode&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Also, they began to realised the complexity of writing a program and that they needed to learn to be very detailed and yet concise in their thinking.</p>
<p><em>Unexpected results:</em></p>
<p>They all decided this was something they wanted to try out on unsuspecting parents!</p>
<p>I found out that it produced a lot of hilarity at home when I met the parents at the next parent&rsquo;s evening.</p>
<p>One of them had the insight to realise how difficult it would be to teach his disabled sister how to make a cup of tea!</p>
<p>Much further down the line, a number of the club members took GCSE Electronics and their teacher told me he could always tell who had belonged to the robotics club because they had a very developed ability to think logically.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>It was more successful than my expectations, the teacher/pupil divide disappeared very quickly and it made me consider how much a similar approach could be used in the maths classroom. Given time, what mathematical skills could be learnt in a more exploratory way?</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Title: Creating A PDF Of Your Blog Using Adobe Acrobat Pro.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">My role in this was to deliver a short instructional session on how to use Adobe Acrobat X to make a PDF archive of a students blog.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The level 4 undergraduate students (20) &nbsp;had been introduced to blogging as part of their Personal, Professional Practice module of their degree programme. All students had been using Blogger for some months and were required to submit a digital snapshot of their blog for archive purposes and assessment purposes. The session was to be delivered in a fully equipped computer lab and all students had access to appropriate internet resources and a computer each.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This was a face to face session with a web based supporting document provided for reference and future guidance if required. All guidance materials were placed in the VLE (moodle) as a web page. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The task was to ensure that all students developed an understanding of how to set up their blogs, prior to the PDF making process for maximum readability by the assessors. To identify and articulate common problems that the students may come across and to make sure that students were then able to make a PDF for this and future modules.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Welcome the students</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Introduce the aims and objectives of the session.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ensure that everyone was logged into their computers and then their blogs. Check to see if everyone was at the same stage.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Talk through the process of setting up their blogs to show maximum number of posts, reminding them why we are doing this.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Help the students all find their way to Adobe acrobat on the computers.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Launch Adobe Acrobat, and create a .pdf from a webpage, paste link in then set up the page sizes.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">PDF and wait&hellip; Whilst the PDFing is happening time for a quick Q&amp;A about the process or follow up if any students are having difficult.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">PDF complete.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Show students how to set blog back to previous settings and save them.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Review of what we have done. Final opportunity for questions</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">End of session. (Lasts about 40-45 minutes.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The session went quite well but as anticipated there is an inevitable lag with students who can&rsquo;t quite work as fast as others. Other problems encountered were when individuals raced ahead because they thought that they understood what to do then came up against technical issues. In terms of overcoming them I asked individuals to support each other initially as they are a close knit group, then to ask me if there were still problems. Overall though it was a relatively straightforward task.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The anticipated outcome was that students understood how to make a PDF of their blogs. This was demonstrated by the fact that all students submitted a blog for assessment. In terms of perhaps slightly unexpected results it got one or two students who I didn&rsquo;t expect to work together doing so.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Overall it was a positive experience but preparation is key, I have run this session before and did so two or three months prior to this session. In the meantime google had updated the interface for blogger slightly and I had to modify the session ever so slightly on the fily. If I had checked that day I would have been prepared. In terms of transferable skills, check your work, be prepared and know your material before you start teaching!</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><em>This design narrative describes the redesign of an ICT Functional Skills lesson.&nbsp; Classroom layout was restricted and lessons were often disrupted with students taking a long time to settle down at the start of lessons.&nbsp; In reducing &lsquo;teacher talk&rsquo; for activity instruction and changing the tutor position from the front of class to moving within the group, this enabled more time to be spent in noticing and commenting upon positive behaviours displayed by individuals.&nbsp; The focus and attention were therefore removed from the negative behaviours resulting in changing the classroom atmosphere to be more positive and increasing student productivity.</em></p>
<h1>Context</h1>
<p><em>Students enrolled on a practical, hands-on Construction course were required to attend mandatory ICT Functional Skills lessons for one hour per week.&nbsp; Students were able to take their assessment when they were individually ready to do so.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h1>Material</h1>
<p><em>The setting is a small classroom.&nbsp; Facilities available are a PC and desk for each student with a PC and projector for the tutor.&nbsp; The projector can only be projected onto the front wall of the classroom and all students sit along the two sides and back of the classroom, facing the wall.&nbsp; This can&rsquo;t be changed due to room size restrictions and cabling.</em></p>
<h1>Social</h1>
<p><em>The students are aged 16-19 and attend a Further Education college on a full-time basis.&nbsp; They attend this lesson in the same groups that they are in for their other subjects so know each other.&nbsp; Although the course is full-time, some students have to attend college for this hour long lesson only on a given day due to their personal time-tabling.</em></p>
<h1>Intentional</h1>
<p><em>As this course is mandatory and is in contrast to the practical nature of their core qualification, this lesson can be viewed as &lsquo;not relevant&rsquo; to the group or &lsquo;a waste of time&rsquo;.&nbsp; They enjoy socialising with friends although some relationships between peers are at times tense.&nbsp; Some find it difficult to concentrate in a traditional classroom setting due to factors such as ADD, ADHD and negative previous experiences of education.&nbsp; These negative experiences have a detrimental effect on learning motivation &ndash; &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the point?&rsquo; There is a lot of chat and noise at the beginning of lessons and time is wasted in waiting for everyone to settle down before starting.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h1>Force Map</h1>
<p>&nbsp;I am experiencing problems uploading to Flickr currently but will display my Forces Diagram in the embedded content section as soon as I am able.</p>
<h1>Challenge</h1>
<p><em>The challenge is:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>to enable students to gain an essential qualification to enable progression within their chosen programme</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>to contextualise the learning in relation to their potential future roles within Construction to demonstrate relevance</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>to enable the students to gain a positive experience of learning to replace the previous negative experiences that some may have had.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<h1>Theoretical / Pedagogical Framework</h1>
<p><em>The main part of the challenge was to encourage positive behaviour towards learning in order that individuals could participate in lessons.&nbsp; The plan was to do this using a model of positive behaviour reinforcement. &nbsp;&nbsp;Unless extreme circumstances necessitated this, undesired behaviours were not commented upon with a focus instead of finding opportunities to praise positive behaviours wherever they arose.&nbsp; The aim was to remove negativity from the classroom and replace it with an atmosphere where students enjoyed participating in the activities.&nbsp; The longer term goal was to demonstrate to students with negative previous experiences of education that learning could be an enjoyable process.</em></p>
<h1>Actions</h1>
<p><em>I changed the structure of the lesson and instead of waiting at the front of the classroom, I met everyone at the door, greeting them by name and ensuring everyone got settled at their PC.&nbsp; When asked by some students &lsquo;What are we doing today&rsquo;, I would act quite casually and point at the screen at the front of the room which gave a simple instruction: &lsquo;Welcome to today&rsquo;s lesson, please log in and check your email :)&nbsp;</em><em>&rsquo;</em></p>
<p><em>Students logged into their email to find an email from me giving background for the lesson&rsquo;s activity:&nbsp; &ldquo;Your mission, for today, is&hellip;&rdquo; They were asked to go to Moodle to download their worksheet which contained further details. Their mission was a learning objective treasure hunt of sorts rather than one delivered traditionally by the tutor.</em></p>
<p><em>After downloading the worksheet from Moodle, students could either print out the worksheet or read it on screen.&nbsp; The worksheet listed tasks:&nbsp; a research activity and to create a spreadsheet.</em></p>
<p><em>When the task was complete the final stage was to send me an email, telling me that they had completed the task, complete with a copy of their work as an attachment.</em></p>
<p><em>These tasks linked to the learning outcomes of the ICT Functional Skills assessment and enabled students to practice reading and following instructions.</em></p>
<p><em>While students were working I was able to move freely among the group, who were all working at different speeds, offering individual support as required.&nbsp; The new structure gave me more time to comment positively on the work that they were carrying out rather than focussing on what wasn&rsquo;t being done.</em></p>
<h1>Obstacles</h1>
<p><em>Sometimes login passwords were forgotten and I would have to reset them which took away some attention from the group briefly but eventually everyone started to take care to remember their passwords as they didn&rsquo;t want to get &lsquo;left behind&rsquo;.</em></p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p><em>Some students finished the work very quickly and wanted to leave the lesson early which they weren&rsquo;t able to do whereas others completed the work in the allocated time.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Students responded well to less &lsquo;teacher talk&rsquo; in relation to instruction and the relationship between tutor and students was more relaxed and less tense as I was able to offer individual support and comment positively on the work that was being done as opposed to focussing on the negative aspect of the initial disruption at the beginning of sessions.</em></p>
<h1>Reflections</h1>
<p><em>By changing my own position within the room and not attempting to &lsquo;lead from the front&rsquo;, this removed the initial issue of the inflexibility in room layout.&nbsp; The students couldn&rsquo;t move in order to change the dynamic so I did.&nbsp; This took away a lot of the traditional classroom feel that was learning barrier at the beginning.</em></p>
<p><em>Sessions were less stressful for both myself and the students as the focus was on encouraging and commenting upon any positive behaviours.&nbsp; Due to the increased productivity within the group this led me to expand the activities that were given to include a &lsquo;Step it up&rsquo; task at the end which was a stretch task.&nbsp;</em></p>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8631</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8631</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Title:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Using ePortfolio's for the collection and management of assessment evidence in KS3.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Narrator:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">A technology teacher and coordinator with an interest in the role of eportfolio systems in educational development (KS3- KS4), reflection and the assessment of learning.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Situation:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The American International School where the project tool place is one example in a growing trend of privately owned K-12 educational institutions that seeks to prepare the children of expatriate adults for higher education. The students could generally be categorized as being multinational, multilingual and operating at a higher developmental stage that would be expected on average and with a greater degree of maturity and collective responsibility.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project was conducted with two groups of Year 8 students aged between 13 and 14 Years. The project was complete over the course of 8 weeks with 4 hours of contact time per week. Students were divided into teams of three or four and assigned roles and responsibilities: these were Team Leader, Researcher(s) and Designer.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Task:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The theme of the project was Digital Literacy. This involved a student investigation into Bias/Propaganda in the Media as well as developing Internet searching skills and developing skills with cloud based tools such as Dropbox and Google Docs in order help them complete the project. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The final part of the project was to create an ePortfolio as a container capable of storing visual and auditory content including text, images, video and sound. This was created in order to display evidence of their work directly against the learning standards of the project. To do this we decided to use Google Sites.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students created an introductory page and then subsequent&nbsp;pages for each learning standard that project covered. Students were free to include whatever evidence of their work they thought best demonstrated their competance in the meeting of the standard.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Teaching and Learning standards were taken and adapted from<a href="http://www.iste.org/STANDARDS"> ITSE</a>&nbsp;technology standards.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>To contribute to project teams to produce original works or solve problems</strong>. This was done in the form of a collaborative presentation.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. To locate, organize, analyze, evaluate, synthesize, and ethically use information from a variety of source and media.</strong> This included the recording digital sources in a &lsquo;Sources Table&rsquo;.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. To evaluate and select information source and digital tools based on the appropriateness to specific tasks.</strong> This involved the evaluation of digital sources and their suitability for use. Again, this needed to be added to a &lsquo;Sources Table&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Evaluate and select information sources and digital tools based on the appropriateness to specific tasks.</strong> This task involved providing evidence that the team had used collaborative tools such as Google Apps, Drive and Dropbox to complete the project. Evidence of this was to be provided in the form of screenshots. Some analysis had to be provided in terms of the strength and weaknesses of the tools being used.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. A written reflection of the project in terms of how successful the team was in meeting the learning objectives of the project.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">1. To understand different propaganda techniques commonly used in the media (Inquiry)</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students wrote a list of questions they had concerning &lsquo;the media&rsquo; and the role that they play.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">2. Evaluate sources of information for trustworthiness, validity and reliability.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students investigated the &lsquo;Kony 2012&rsquo; video for reliability and trustworthiness. Develop a set of amendment questions to the makers of the video.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students prepare a group presentation on Israel and Palestine conflict &nbsp;that was reliable and trustworthy. Presentation had to be created according to a design specification and that was informative and interesting for the audience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">3. Students are taught to be able to find, locate and disseminate information from appropriate, reliable and legal sources.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students taught how to develop their Internet searching skills to find information more quickly and effectively. Students use TLD modifiers and search modifiers to restrict searches of information in order to answer prescribed questions.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students to &nbsp;research information as a group on the Israel and Palestine conflict , share, research tasks and collate findings in a single presentation. Information sources recorded in a the &lsquo;Sources Table&rsquo; and evaluated for reliability and propaganda.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">4. Students are able to share work and information and an efficient digital manner using attachments, Dropbox and Drive.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students use Google Drive and Dropbox to create shared folders, documents and communicate both synchronously and asynchronously.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">5. Students create an ePortfolio in Google Drive</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Student embed evidence against each of the learning standards of the project into the ePortfolio.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">6. Project Review</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students complete an individual reflection. This is done in the form of a structured essay</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Results/Reflections</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">An example of finished ePortfolios can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/thuysicteportfolio2/">here </a>and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marytranicteportfolio/">here</a>. All students involved in the project submitted an ePortfolio of which some were fully completed and others partially completed. I will discuss the issues encountered below.</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Evidencing work directly against learning standards was a revelation in fostering students interest , understanding and pride in their own, and each others, contributions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Outcomes-based assessment strategies were favoured because this gave the students a greater choice in how they meet the requirements of the project. However, summative assessment of the project was done using a rubric (shared with the students) that contained no mechanism for giving credit to those students who were active participants in meeting the learning standards but then subsequently failed to show evidence of this activity in the ePortfolio. This process then may not have fairly recognised the true progress and achievements of those students whose contributions were more tacit. With hindsight this problem could have been overcome with more on-course learner tracking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Students were not being assessed on the ePortfolio itself nor on the majority of the digital tools that they used throughout the project. Yet, success in this project was determined by what they displayed in the end. We therefore need to ask the question as to whether the technical knowledge required to create and maintain the ePortfolio unfairly disadvantaged those students who may have ended up being assessed more on their technical prowess than on the knowledge they were meant to have acquired. Diagnostic skills test before the project may have helped overcome such issues.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4. The decision to incorporate student reflection into the ePortfolio was made in order that students could reconsider and makes a story out of their own learning experiences. This was an extremely beneficial exercise both for them, and for me as a teacher, in order that we could gauge progress.</p>
<p>5. Assessment of the project and then the process of providing individual feedback was an exhaustive and time consuming. Rather than providing so much assessment summatively based solely on an end &ldquo;product&rdquo; , &nbsp;it may have been preferable to break down the task into smaller parts and feedback on those instead.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Improving English skills</strong></p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>I manage the training aspect of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>A large care services employer identified fifteen members of staff judged to have insufficient functional English skills to operate as needed within their teams. They worked in widely distributed places, many miles from each other. Budgets to fund any training were extremely limited. The demands of the operation meant that they could not be allowed much release time from normal duties. All the learners had further constraints on their spare time (work and family). Face-to-face tuition was not affordable, practical or possible.</p>
<p>The key actors were the staff members/learners and their managers and the training delivery staff and their manager. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>The staff members/ learners would be provided with the opportunity to improve their English skills by at least one level within a twenty-six week period and ultimately to reach a level equivalent to GCSE English A*-C, Level 2.</p>
<p>The project would need to do this with little funding and great distances between individuals who had little available spare time available to them. It was decided that the only learning approach capable of addressing the challenges of distance and lack of spare time was through web-based e-learning.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Carry out a risk analysis and work out ways of ameliorating these as far as possible.</li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Risk 1</em> &ndash; learners with reading skills at too low a level to be able to engage with the learning material. Action &ndash; carry out initial assessment of English; identify any learners with skills below Entry 3. Support these staff members to find local face-to-face tuition.&nbsp;</li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Risk 2</em> &ndash; learners experiencing difficulty logging on to website through lack of experience and confidence. Action &ndash; provide an opening face-to-face induction session with laptops and wifi. Ensure that they have logged on successfully and carried out some early exercises with support.</li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Risk 3</em> &ndash; learners not making reasonable progress over time. Action &ndash; call for their commitment at the induction session, introduce their distant tutor and ensure each learner has the opportunity for a face-to-face discussion with her. Ensure that they understand that progress will be closely monitored. Engage line managers in providing support and encouragement at work. Let them know that those who make good progress will be supported to take an English qualification that will mark their achievement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Organise induction session, as above.<br />Effects&nbsp;<br />- Two learners with Entry Level 2 English identified. They were guided to local services.&nbsp;<br />- Induction sessions were closely planned, with technical support in attendance, and a 1:3 tutor/learner ratio. The sessions engaged learners and they were enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Monitor progress on monthly basis, flagging up any who appear to have lost enthusiasm. Contact any to discuss / re-engage.<br /> Effects</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Tutor monitored learners&rsquo; activity e.g. log-on times and progress. Email and telephone calls made to any not meeting planned activity deadlines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Line managers were contacted in two cases and the learners became re-engaged. Monthly reports were made to training manager.</p>
<p>After 20 weeks, identify learners who may be able to be entered for qualification. Engage these learners&rsquo; line managers in forward planning to enable them to be released for preparation for formal assessment and examinations.<br /> Effects <br /> &ndash; Five learners identified as ready for formal assessment. Their line managers were contacted and plans were made.</p>
<p>After 25 weeks confirm learners going forward for formal assessment.</p>
<p>At 26 weeks provide all learners with advice and guidance about her or his next steps (formal assessment, continued e-learning, an alternative learning route)</p>
<p>Effects&nbsp;<br />- individual interviews arranged for all learners with advice and guidance tailored to each one&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>Re-plan for these learners and for any new staff members identified to join the programme</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>Five (of 13) learners achieved one level improvement in 26 weeks and were entered for formal assessment. Four of these were successful in achieving a Level 1 English qualification. (Success rate 30% overall, 80% for formal assessment group)</p>
<p>Objective not met. It was too ambitious and set before the entry skills of learners were known or fully understood.</p>
<p>Additional outcomes &ndash; there must be a range of next steps options available for learners, including continuing on the programme, providing progress continues to be made.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>The detailed planning for the induction session was well-worth the time and effort involved. I knew that this face-to-face time with learners would be valuable but only available on this one occasion. It was important to lay strong foundations. I knew that the learners had strong speaking and listening skills and that social contact was important to them. They also had very poor experiences in compulsory education and lacked confidence. Well balanced encouragement was very important, and the support or their line-managers helped.</p>
<p>Other forms of communication could valuable to them, allowing them social interaction with fellow learners. It would be useful to find out what forms of digital communication they used in their lives, because it would be important use one with which many felt confident e.g. text messaging.</p>
<p>The English tuition programme was generic and &lsquo;off-the-peg&rsquo;, but the learners worked in one vocational sector with its own terminology. Value-added extras provided could have included commentated slide-shows focusing on e.g. professional communication in that sector, spelling strategies for sector specific terms.</p>
<p>My main transferable insight was a greater understanding and recognition of the need to treat each adult English literacy learner as someone with very individual and often complex needs.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Healthy Eating - 4Ts model Review</strong></p>
<p>This model seems to me to be quite structured and rigid and seems to initially encourage collaboration but my feeling is that it might stifle it. The fact that each step has set tasks to complete would push the participants into a single path instead of allowing them the freedom to explore many different possibilities.</p>
<p>It also seems to be heavily reliant on the teacher to move the students through the process instead of letting them take ownership of the tasks and decide amongst themselves how much time they need to dedicate to a certain activity.</p>
<p>The model is quite set in stone and easily transferable to different scenarios which would reduce the amount of planning teachers would need to do before delivering a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Healthy Eating - E-Learning Template Review</strong></p>
<p>This model appears to be different to the 4Ts model as it relies more heavily on the students themselves to drive the learning. It also seems to be less structured and allows for the students to direct their own learning. This is something spoken about in previous weeks of the course, that really it should be the student who is in charge of what they want to learn.</p>
<p>In a way it reminds me of my own learning experiences at university where we were initially given some ideas to discuss and then given the opportunity to work out for ourselves what we should discuss and define from those discussions and report them back to a tutor.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title</strong> <em>Remedial session with a new student</em></p>
<p><strong>Narrator </strong></p>
<p><em>I am an Associate Lecturer tutoring a Level 1 course for the OU</em></p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>I was asked to carry out a one to one session for a student in another group who had been identified by Turnitin on two occasions submitting work which was not original.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>Identify how the student was approaching assignments and managing to submit plagiarized work having been previously advised about the same issue. Look at ways to improve his note taking and transcription of notes into essays without copying blocks of text. Work on examples of how to reference materials included in his assignments as quotes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>The options for a face to face meeting with the student were restricted; he lives some distance from me and a face to face meeting was going to be difficult to arrange. The session was arranged as an Elluminate session.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Discussion of what the session was aiming to do with the student</li>
<li>Discussion of what constitutes plagiarism and how the OU detects this</li>
<li>Exercises on how to quote from another text with references</li>
<li>Discussion of what paraphrasing is</li>
<li>Exercises on making notes and paraphrasing a selection of articles</li>
<li>Detailed discussion of how the situation had arisen, this identified the main area was in paraphrasing text.</li>
<li>Exercises in using notes as a base for essays.</li>
<li>Review of the points discussed and setting of further practice to carry out after the session ended.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><em>I was not really that sure what to expect from the session, the student had previously been through a similar session and his tutor was surprised the issue had arisen a second time. The first issue was that the student had some difficulty in getting his microphone working with Elluminate, this made the session quite difficult in the earlier stages. This was compounded with English not being the first language of the student. At times, I did feel the session became very one-sided and feedback was hard to come by.</em></p>
<p><em>As the session progressed it was clear that the concepts were well understood but the application of the concept of paraphrasing was poor; whole sentences from the text were being copied into notes and these were subsequently being copied into the essays being written by the student in a verbatim manner. At the end of the session I felt the points had been understood and the exercises we carried out demonstrated a level of understanding of the materials covered.</em></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>There were two technical aspects that I left the session reflecting on. First was the difficulty the student had with setting his microphone levels adequately, I had given plenty time at the start of the session to complete the setup but lost some time in running through this a number of extra times. I also felt at times there was a gap in understanding what I was saying due to the student not having English as his first language. If I were to run this session I would send out a set of preliminary activities that needed to be completed before the session to avoid this delay. </em></p>

              <title>Tim&#39;s Design Narrative for Online Reading Circles</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8366</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8366</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title </strong></p>
<p>Providing students with the opportunity to engage with communicative reading tasks.</p>
<p>Narrator</p>
<p><em>My role, as an English Language Teacher at the Higher Colleges of Technology, was to <strong>design</strong> an online version of a traditional reading circle for use by foundation (and undergraduate) students. </em>This done my role was to <strong>facilitate and encourage reading</strong> of texts relevant to the learners&rsquo; real-life needs and goals.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>English is the medium of instruction in all government tertiary institutions throughout the UAE and to exit Foundations and proceed to a locally-accredited bachelor&rsquo;s programme students only need an overall Band 5 in the IELTS. However, the majority of students fail to obtain the necessary grade. Emiratis show a clear weakness in demonstrating an affective reading ability in such externally standardised benchmark exams as the IELTS. For the adult learner, reading is a key to success in higher education.</p>
<p>The local culture is often referred to as an oral culture but perhaps a better description would be a non-reading culture! One does not become a good reader unless one reads a lot, this might seem like stating the obvious but it is something that does not seem to occur to my learners. The activity I describe here is designed to help address this lack of a reading culture.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>In line with the college learning outcomes and to help address this &lsquo;<em>non-reading culture&rsquo;</em> the main aims of this activity are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>To encourage student autonomy and independent reading and learning.</li>
<li>To provide students with the opportunity to read extensively and (hopefully) for pleasure.</li>
</ol>
<p>The secondary aims are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To expose students to a variety of texts types relevant to their real life needs.</li>
<li>To help build vocabulary and deeper understanding academic texts.</li>
<li>To begin challenging and evaluating text.</li>
</ol>
<p>The activity is based on the concept of a <em>Reading Circle. </em>This usually takes place face-to-face when a group of five or six like-minded individuals meet to discuss a piece of literature in depth. They share their experiences in a structured discussion which guides the participants to a deeper understanding of the text. Collaboration is at the heart of this approach. Each group member has a specific role and there is group leader whose job it is to develop questions for the group to discuss.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>As we meet face to face in college every day the activity was set up in the classroom via an introductory IELTS lesson in third week of the semester, or once the class size has settled down and all students have been issued with their iPads.</p>
<p>This lesson is staged as follows:</p>
<p>Engage and interest the learners in the topic, set context for the reading, activate vocab and background knowledge. Emphasize the need read more often and on a variety of themes.</p>
<p>The first reading circle text is done in class. This makes it easier to set up the activity, form groups, give clear instructions with examples and then monitor closely to check all students are on task. I then monitor discretely; guiding, encouraging and prompting only when and where necessary. Thorough preparation for the online activity should provide an incentive for more effective participation.</p>
<p>Provide clear instruction of the process with screen shots of the BBL interface and links to BBL&rsquo;s own instructional videos will be the first documents the learners will encounter. I will also set up and &lsquo;sandbox&rsquo; course for the learners to play around in. This will be accompanied by example videos of each of the role cards completed for an example text. I would also create a &ldquo;Help&rdquo; in the discussion board, feedback would be timely but the contract would be that I only answer in office hours.</p>
<p>A &lsquo;spark&rsquo; &ndash;&ndash; the role cards which accompany the text provide the learners with the stimulus, challenge, task or problem. The learners rotate roles so as not to repeat the same role, and therefore the same way of looking at a text. The first five texts are obligatory and run in order but after that, in turn, each student can select form a bank of suitable texts.</p>
<p>Example role cards:</p>
<p><strong>Artist </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your job is to create an image or images based on the text.</li>
<li>Your image(s) can be anything that you want. For example, a picture, a diagram, a cartoon, a flow chart, a graph, etc.</li>
<li>You will need to explain and justify your image(s) to the group.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global Issues Analyst</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your job is to read the text and find information relating to global issues.</li>
<li>This information could relate to social, political, economic and environmental issues that affect us all.</li>
<li>You will need to explain and justify your choices to the group.</li>
</ul>
<p>The learners complete the task on their role cards and post a short video message via Voice Board.</p>
<p>Students have to respond &ndash; the students must respond and comment on at least three other students&rsquo; posts.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>It is now only three weeks into the activity and it is not compulsory it is too early to talk of results. As this activity goes beyond the course boundaries to provide an extra layer of learning for students, only the students who are extremely enthusiastic or who have the extra time are expected to participation.&nbsp;Those involved in the learning activity are assigned different roles when undertaking these tasks. The role cards I have designed are specifically aimed at each of these learning outcomes and the development of the associated reading skills and sub-skills. The initial sequencing of texts before letting the activity become more student-centred as students choose their readings is also an important part of achieving my aims and making the activity a success.</p>
<p>Hopefully, on completing this course, students should be able &lsquo;<em>to read with some independence&rsquo;</em>, being able &lsquo;<em>to select a reading strategy suited to their purpose and the text&rsquo;</em>, and &lsquo;<em>to demonstrate comprehension in a variety of ways&rsquo;</em>.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Again it is too early to reflect on this activity, or lack of activity, the use of BBL for the purposes of recording and reflecting on achievement and the ease with which comments can be made for support, encouragement and continuous formative assessment make it the ideal tool. My initial impulse was for no assessment, as in schools here reading is rarely taught but frequently tested. There are many negative connotations with words such as &lsquo;assessments,&rsquo; &lsquo;grades,&rsquo; &lsquo;wrong,&rsquo; &lsquo;punishment.&rsquo; I wanted to avoid this. However, my students are pragmatic in their approach to learning; they will try to obtain the maximum grade with the minimum amount of effort. So, in reality that would mean that without some sort of assessment, most students at HCT simply would not participate. When discussing with other faculty it seems students make the postings needed to earn marks, but rarely contribute otherwise. What to do?</p>

              <title>Lynne&#39;s comparison of 4SPPI &amp; e-Design</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8342</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8342</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p class="western"><strong>Similarities</strong></p>
<p class="western">Both representations involve capturing the key features of a learning activity on a template, organised according to certain principles. The aim in each case is to produce a standardised representation which will enable one learning activity to be compared with another, in a consistent way. But the methods used &amp; the appearance of the end product are quite different.</p>
<p class="western"><strong>Differences</strong></p>
<p class="western">4SPPI analyses each learning activity design according to four factors: space (where it happens), pedagogy (how it is taught), participants (who is involved) &amp; history (what is produced during the activity). The information for each factor is then displayed as segments in a circular graphic. By contrast, e-Design uses a tabular format. Each stage in the learning activity is allocated to the column corresponding to its type: active induction (tutor-managed, closed), guided exploration (student-managed, closed), facilitated investigation (tutor-managed, open), self-organised learning (student-managed, open).</p>
<p class="western"><strong>Readability, expressiveness, utility</strong></p>
<p class="western">I found e-Design easier to use from the point of view of quickly finding out what each activity involved, perhaps because reading text left-to-right &amp; top-to-bottom is such a familiar process. 4SPPI took more interpretation, as the segment labels were displayed around the graphic (difficult to rotate the image on a PC monitor!). Both required a good deal of decoding, due to their use of space-saving abbreviations. But once familiarity with the layout &amp; language was achieved, 4SPPI gave me a deeper understanding of the intentions behind each activity &amp; its practical requirements (in terms of equipment, classroom space etc.). With e-Design, a teacher would know what s/he was supposed to do during the session. With 4SPPC s/he would know much more about how &amp; why to do it.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Joe&#39;s design narrative: introducing interactive whiteboards within a high school department </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8341</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8341</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Education challenges are situated within a specific context and incorporating/designing new interventions must take this into account. Logistics and resourcing are key components to consider.</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>About a decade ago, as interactive whiteboards and digital projectors became more popular in English secondary schools, the senior management team of the school within which I worked asked/wanted the science department to make more use of a recently purchased interactive whiteboard.</p>
<p>This was a single interactive whiteboard, which was available for use by the science department. The interactive whiteboard had to be booked and was shared with other departments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were 9 science teachers within the department. I, the head of department and one other science teacher were already using the interactive whiteboard in our science lessons. There was some resistance from the other science teachers in using the interactive whiteboard (essentially they had been offered no training with the technology - or in resource creation - and said it could currently add little to their teachings as no useful resources available and they had no time to develop resources). There was also resistance from the science technicians as they claimed it would be another task they would be &lsquo;lumbered with co-ordinating&rsquo; as they would have to move the whiteboard around the school site.</p>
<h2>My role</h2>
<p>As I had some previous experience in this area the head of science department passed this task on to me to action.</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p><strong>What the school wanted:</strong> increased use of the interactive whiteboard by the science department.</p>
<p><strong>What the head of department wanted:</strong> the interactive whiteboard task highlighted by the senior management team (SMT) resolved to a satisfactory conclusion for the SMT.</p>
<p><strong>What the science teachers wanted:</strong> training and access to ready-made resources for use with the interactive whiteboard.</p>
<p><strong>The perceived challenge:</strong> the SMT thought increased use of the interactive whiteboard itself would help (in part) improve the science (and any other) department. There was paranoia and mistrust within the science department regarding an initiative suggested by the SMT, the science department thought they were being unfairly targeted (part of an &lsquo;us&rsquo; and &lsquo;them&rsquo; culture). However, there was no wider resource-sharing between the science teachers within the department, which my work on this task highlighted as the biggest issue to overcome.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><strong>SMT:</strong> I highlighted to SMT the fact use of the interactive whiteboard alone would not improve a department; resources would be needed for more interactive whiteboards if any intervention was to be anything more than supplemental to department&rsquo;s offering; resources would also be needed for technology specific software and staff training (not assuming proficiency or ability to learn by some of the teachers). I also suggested grouping separate departments together for new strategies to overcome possible &lsquo;us&rsquo; and &lsquo;them&rsquo;; and &lsquo;being targeted&rsquo; issues.</p>
<p><strong>Head of department:</strong> there was a need to create a departmental culture of resource-sharing and this would have to be led by the head of department. Giving individual teacher&rsquo;s responsibility for separate parts of the curriculum was a suggested starting point in resource creation/sourcing, as was limiting resource development to one key stage initially.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers within the department:</strong> I ran a training session on suggested ways the interactive whiteboard could be used both interactively and passively (as a digital projector). I created some simple template resources in PowerPoint for use by the department (trading off some of the resource interactivity with the important characteristic of &lsquo;recreatability&rsquo; by novice and expert teacher creator alike for future sustainable working).</p>
<p><strong>Science technicians:</strong> together with the technicians I created a booking form for the interactive whiteboard which the science teachers would have to complete sufficiently in advance if they wished to book the whiteboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><strong>SMT:</strong> agreed to purchase of departmental specific resources and future purpose of departmental whiteboard. Though the SMT felt training needs should be met in-house.</p>
<p><strong>Head of department:</strong> agreed to lead on resource-sharing culture (creating first resources for use by other teachers) to support interactive whiteboard use and also to push for greater resource expenditure in support of this area.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers within department:</strong> agreed to create resources on a rolling basis targeting on key stage at a time. Two-thirds of the teachers produced resources for use by the wider department; the same proportion began to use the interactive whiteboard on a regular basis, usage increasing with resource availability.</p>
<p><strong>Science technicians:</strong> eventually saw the interactive whiteboard as just another piece of science kit to be ordered.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><strong>SMT:</strong> the SMT purchased subject specific software for the department without consulting the department for expertise. It was later agreed future software purchases should be signed-off by head of department.</p>
<p><strong>Head of department:</strong> became a great advocate for the whiteboard use and resource creation with the school.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers within department:</strong> as more teachers within department became regular users of the interactive whiteboard, clashes for using the whiteboard resources arose (led to purchase of departmental interactive whiteboard). Teachers became increasingly more confident in whiteboard use and creation of specific resources; they thrived on the additional responsibility of taking ownership of expertise within the curriculum and this transferred across to all areas of resource development within the department.</p>
<p><strong>Learners:</strong> a departmental survey of pupils several months later stated learner preference for lessons in which the interactive whiteboard was used as being more fun (this survey was later used by the SMT as evidence for rolling out use in other departments).</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I decided to compare and review the following:</p>
<p><a class="oucontent-hyperlink" href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/-healthy-eating-in-an-e-design-template">"Healthy Eating" in an e-Design Template</a></p>
<p><a class="oucontent-hyperlink" href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/scenedit-healthy-eating">"Healthy Eating" as an ISiS model</a></p>
<p>&lt;!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?--&gt;</p>
<div>Edesign template- easy to read, communicates the idea and type of activity well. It's a standard table really so not sure if it expresses&nbsp;much visually.&nbsp;It also did not feel sequential even&nbsp;though&nbsp;activities are numbered but more of an "sorting shapes" in box excersise.&nbsp;I don't see how this template caters for edesign as it incorporates common elements of any lesson plan?</div>
<div>This would&nbsp;for&nbsp;instance not&nbsp;support me to transfer my lesson into a&nbsp;vle .There are no&nbsp;timelines&nbsp;, no interactive elements&nbsp;to include; nothing terminology wise to encourage you to think in terms of eLearning.&nbsp;I &nbsp;expected the template to be use&nbsp;learning&nbsp;specific headings like tools /forum/interaction etc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Isis model &amp; ScenEdit- as a contrast this model works well for an eLearning situation as it is very task focused. However the &nbsp;greatest&nbsp;advantage is that it works visually. Through the Scenedit software you have a workable mix between storyboarding&nbsp;and interaction designing. It makes the design explicit. I therefore think this model would work with my information&nbsp;literacy&nbsp;lessons.&nbsp;The&nbsp;benefits as I see it would be the visual element granting a "walk&nbsp;through" of the lesson highlighting maybe any issues. On the downside the Isis model on its own is to theoretical in my view and would not work as effeciently for me.</div>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3 id="sites-page-title-header" align="left">4SPPIces Model and in LdShake</h3>
<p>The readability of this model is easy to understand. It divides the critical components into four areas which are intuitive. In terms of expressiveness, the drawn model has a high impact with the exception of the circular space that was chosen: I would not have put a timeline into a quarter slice of the 'apple'. In terms of utility, I would rate it average: the design needed a lot of verbal explanations rather than being self-explanatory.</p>
<h3>Cadmos</h3>
<p>Cadmos I thought was a better, as more ordered, way of representation. The linear format supports the time line element, although I would have put the participants line next to the group line to make it easier to see when the participants were part of the group, and when they were working on their own. &nbsp;The readability was therefore better than LD Shake's. They representation was as expressive as LD Shake, but in different ways. It was better because of the linear structures, but worse because it looked a bit amateurish. I would rate the utility higher. The conceptual model complemented the flow model well, the first showing outcomes and the second the methods and timings.</p>
<h3>For my own learning design</h3>
<p>I would say that either model would work. 4SPPI would probably work better, because the nature of the activities is so short, and the assessment is not built into each learning activity but due to time consstraints, takes place as a summative activity some time later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits would be that the pedagogical method would be made clear to the teachers before they start the achtivity. As the time available for each activity is very short, I would not need a long timeline, so the criticism I mentioned above would not apply to this particular activity. It would also be possible to alert the teacher to the nature of the assessment, which is summative and takes place several days or even weeks down the line. Further, the home learning using the revision guide could be introduced in the 'space' section.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p>I was tasked with giving year 11 form tutors a method of delivering content of the AQA Personal Economics syllabus (GCSE) quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>A PSHE coordinator who was on maternity leave handed over to me. Previously, the classes had had access to printed packs which they were supposed to work though. However, this was very difficult because in a ten-fifteen minute timeslot, the register had to be taken relevant announcements made, the packs given out, the relevant page sought (pages had not been numbered), then the teachers and students were to engage with the material and collect the booklets in at the end. This lost momentum very quickly so that not much of the material was in fact "delivered". A quicker method was needed, with less emphasis on administration of resources and more engaging content. &nbsp;The work is done in the form rooms, and students (as well as teachers) had a negative attitude towards the work. Teachers did not feel they had the relevant subject knowledge, while students felt it was a waste of time. Neither I nor the teachers or students had any choice as to whether students could take this course or not.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>To engage students and teachers in the activities.</em></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Seek (informal) feedback on the methods used before I took over this subject.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Understand what the main issues with delivery were.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Familiarise myself with the course.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Parcel the content into small, bite-sized chunks, deciding which aspects of the content to prioritise.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Create an initial series of interactive resources that can be delivered by the teacher.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Seek feedback from teachers regarding timing and nature of the resource, and their confidence in delivering them.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Set up my own youtube channel featuring relevant videos.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Produce a comprehensive revision resource for students to take home during the Easter holidays.</em></li>
<li><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Produce a further set of form time activities, bearing in mind the feedback received.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><em>Expected outcomes from the feedback were that teachers were somewhat more engaged, but not enormously - as the novelty wore off and other pressures grew. &nbsp;Evidence is in the minutes of the recent meeting with form tutors. The revision guides were very sought after by both students and teachers - evidence in relevant emails - to the extent that one set of class booklets disappeared. This was unexpectedly positive: I though that all would try to avoid engaging with the topic further.</em></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>What went well</em></p>
<p><em>The tutors were able to express their concerns clearly to me.</em></p>
<p><em>Tutors enjoyed the resources and this built up their confidence.</em></p>
<p><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Even Better If</em></p>
<p><em>I had anticipated the ability and willingness of some tutors to use embedded video. Two tutors (out of 8) had technical problems with this. One tutor refused to deliver any further material given that their first encounter with the embedded resource had been negative. I should have surveyed this beforehand.</em></p>
<p><em><em>To deliver a specialist course, all tutors must have secure relevant subject knowledge.</em></em></p>
<p><em>Following feedback, the form time resources should have been even shorter. Tutors and classes were discussing individual slides so didn't manage to finish activities. This could be resolved by suggesting timings.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/-healthy-eating-in-an-e-design-template">"Healthy Eating" in an e-Design Template</a> was, for me, the most readable of the selection. &nbsp;The opening sentence set the tone with a sentence that said no more or less than it actually wanted to say. &nbsp;Furthermore, its succinctness wasn&rsquo;t simply an element in its readability but also an aid to its expression. &nbsp;This will to be read was also visible in the illustrations of its principles.</p>
<p>I was, however, disappointed by the actual template. &nbsp;Although it was a grid, and in that sense similar to the 4Ts model, it struck me as being too rigid in its limited categorizations. &nbsp;I think it could be useful in certain, relatively stable, learning narratives but I&rsquo;m not convinced it would be much use for my learning design narrative.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3 dir="ltr">Narrator</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I am the Training Officer for a final year apprentice electrician who failed to pass the &lsquo;Inspection and Testing of an Electrical Installation&rsquo; &nbsp;section in his Final Integrated Competence Assessment. &nbsp;(FICA is the assessment that all apprentice electricians in Scotland need to pass to upgrade to the role of electrician). &nbsp;My role was</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to provide feedback on the apprentice&rsquo;s performance to the apprentice and his employer</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to liaise with the apprentice on what skills he needs to develop prior to his re-sit</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to arrange with the employer the means by which the apprentice might gain the skills he needs</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">to arrange an appropriate re-sit date that suits both the apprentice and the employer</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="ltr">Situation</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I met with the employer and the apprentice at an address where they were working together. &nbsp;This is the normal arrangement which causes minimal disruption to the employer&rsquo;s business. &nbsp;The location transpired to be the new house of a friend of the employer. &nbsp;The employer was switching his interactions between me and his apprentice, and his friends.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Under normal circumstances I will have met with the apprentice and employer on numerous occasions over the apprenticeship but on this occasion I have only met the employer once, and the apprentice on two occasions before this meeting. &nbsp;I have only recently taken over this area and don&rsquo;t really have a relationship with either of them. &nbsp;The apprentice has been in employment with this contractor for over four years, &nbsp;This timing turned out to be significant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Initially they were both very cautious about discussing the situation. &nbsp;I suspected this would be the case from the context that I describe below. &nbsp;However there was something more that I didn&rsquo;t understand and whilst the employer was disappointed that the apprentice had failed a section of FICA there was an awkwardness about their personal &nbsp;interaction that I didn&rsquo;t understand. &nbsp;I thought that the apprentice was embarrassed, and that because they both didn&rsquo;t really know me they were being over cautious. &nbsp;This was not so, and only became apparent later.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Task</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I was trying to achieve a number of solutions and outcomes to this situation.</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I was trying to provide a quality of service of support to both the employer and the apprentice. &nbsp;With regard to the employer this is somewhat mercenary in the hope that the employer will recruit a new apprentice when his current one completes the course. &nbsp;Secondly, the employer had already made the claim to me in an earlier telephone conversation that his apprentice had been placed under undue pressure by a member of the test centre staff and was considering making a complaint. &nbsp;I was aware that both the employer and the apprentice were unhappy at the (alleged) performance of my colleague.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Outwith the diplomacy of the above I was trying to facilitate a number aspects of learning. The first was learning on my part. &nbsp;I wanted to identify whether the apprentice had sufficient knowledge and understanding about the subject of &nbsp;inspection &amp; testing (the failed section) that might make their claim of undue pressure justifiable.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The second learning objective that I was trying to achieve was one that</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">ensured that the apprentice gained sufficient on-site training in the inspection &amp; testing subject area so that he would</p>
</li>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">be in a position to pass his re-sit</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">be in a position to perform inspection &amp; testing as part of his role as an electrician.</p>
</li>
</ol></ol>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s a generally held belief in my workplace that the most appropriate place to learn is in the authentic workplace. &nbsp;I arrived at this location and situation with this assumption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before arriving on site I had a clear idea of what would be successful outcomes. &nbsp;These were</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">that the employer and the apprentice were content with the service my employer provides;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">that the apprentice would be informed about his performance at FICA; and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">that training would be agreed upon that would make possible 4a and 4b</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">As the meeting progressed these outcomes it became increasingly obvious that these aims were unlikely to be met. &nbsp;It was only after the meeting that I understood why.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Actions</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I started by reviewing the diagnostic report of the apprentices first attempt at FICA. &nbsp;This allowed me to get oral testimony of what the apprentice had done during the assessment. &nbsp;This was firstly designed to allow me to guage the apprentice&rsquo;s &nbsp;overall knowledge about the subject and secondly to suggest areas where he might have lost marks during the assessment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was quickly clear that the apprentice knew very little about one of the tests in question (the second out of 6 in total). &nbsp;His employer, witnessing his confusion, tried to assist by reminding the apprentice about what the test entailed. &nbsp;Unfortunately it was clear that the employer knew just as little about the test in question as his unfortunate apprentice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was when I had to correct the employer that he himself admitted that he had trouble understanding the topic of inspection and testing. &nbsp;This effectively put the sand in the engine of my learning plan, and &nbsp;I was now making it up as I went along. &nbsp;I suggested that I approach the local college with a view to them providing the apprentice with some training. &nbsp;The employer was only happy with this arrangement when I agreed that we would fund the training.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When we got onto the topic of when a re-sit could take place the employer told me that it had to take place before a certain date the following month to ensure that he would be able to claim funding should the apprentice be successful. &nbsp;I was unaware of this necessity and this placed an unexpected time-limit on the apprentice&rsquo;s college supported training.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With this new on-the-hoof plan agreed I took my leave of the meeting and the apprentice walked me back to my car which was parked at the other end of the street. &nbsp;It was at this point that the apprentice told me that he has never received any on-site training on this subject because the employer 'doesn&rsquo;t have a clue' about electrical testing. &nbsp;The apprentice also told me that the previous Training Officer had been aware of this and had numerous discussions about this with the employer. The apprentice had assumed that I knew this.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Results</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">An expected outcome was that the apprentice would gain the training to prepare him for his FICA resit. &nbsp;The outcome wasn&rsquo;t achieved in the way I had planned though</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Whilst I think that it is possible that the college training will provide the apprentice with the training to perform well in his resit, i suspect that there is very little chance that I will meet the objective to allow the apprentice to perform inspection &amp; testing as part of his future role as an electrician.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">An &nbsp;unexpected outcome was that my employer was now going to have to pay for this additional college training and which, if successful, will result in the employer receiving a &pound;1000 grant.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I had hoped that I would leave the meeting with the complaint possibility becalmed and the good name of my employer restored. Instead as the meeting went on I began to feel like a character in a Pinter play who allows suppressed tensions to become manifest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">Reflections</h3>
<p dir="ltr">I was very pleased to read recently that John Seely Brown described learning as messy. &nbsp;This messiness isn&rsquo;t just down to the difficulties of putting something as complex as learning into words but includes an understanding that learning involves financial motivations, personal tensions and resentments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The assumed expectation in a Community of Practice, in which an apprentice moves from the periphary to full membership of a discourse, is that the gatekeeper is sufficiently competent to be a gatekeeper. &nbsp;This situation has caused me to reflect on the value of a discourse that can allow the gatekeeper to be without competence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The situation has also shaken my confidence in the value of assuming that the workplace is the site of authentic learning. &nbsp;Since, in this situation, the FICA assessment itself takes place in the inauthentic setting of a test centre then perhaps the &lsquo;inauthentic&rsquo; setting of a college workshop is actually the most authentic place to learn.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Peter Scott&#39;s view of  Representations</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8307</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8307</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>One point I found I had to remind myself of in this activity is that the representations of the lesson were produced from the actual lesson that took place. I would expect these tools to be used to plan lessons before delivery.</p>
<h2>Web collage</h2>
<p>Web collage is a web based tool that produces Computer Supported Collaborative Learning scenarios, these are suited especially to methods of teaching and learning delivered primarily online with online social interaction as a key component. The tool gives access to 6 defined flow patterns used in CSCL, examples of these are Brainstorming where a group bounce ideas around between them or Think Pair Share where pairs of learners focus on a subject.</p>
<p>This approach provides less in the way of a lesson plan for an activity but does allow a more detailed view of how an activity can develop an idea. The example given in the review online is that of the pyramids where the class is broken into groups who are initially given some information and subsequently go off to carry out research in groups of 4 before coming back together as a whol to review their findings.</p>
<p>The outputs of the tool give a clearer view of how the class collaborate on activities and allows modelling of the collaboration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CADMOS</h2>
<p>CADMOS is a graphical tool aimed at educators with lower skill levels in Computer Technologies but with knowledge of learning standards. I took the opportunity to download he tool and familiarise myself with it in operation as part of this task.</p>
<p>The approach to use of the tool is to define the tasks that will comprise the learning scenario, define the metadata that define the individual tasks, goals and the associated prerequisites for each task. The tasks, goals and prerequisites are then used to develop and define the conceptual model for the learning activity. This is one area of the tool where there is a restriction; an activity may have only one goal and one prerequisite. A detailed description of the activity can be attached to the model at this stage and the task categorised.</p>
<p>The tasks are then used to generate the conceptual model of the lesson where each task is defined and the actor of the task is listed, these generate a swim lane flow model of the activity which can then be divided into phases and which define the flow of the lesson.</p>
<p>The tool gives a clear view of the activities, their order and the prerequisites and resources. The representation produced works well for me personally, I am comfortable with the idea of swim lanes for representing activity flow and the conceptual model is very clear.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are 2 very different tools giving different views of the same activity. The first, Web Collage, allows the modelling of the interactions for collaboration within the classroom, the second, CADMOS, provides for the development of a lesson plan and defines the structure and flow of the activities in the lesson. The tools should be seen as complementary in the context of modelling the lesson</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3>Title</h3>
<p>Teaching Support Workers to Convert Print to Alternative Formats</p>
<h3>Narrator</h3>
<p>I facilitated the session.</p>
<h3>Situation</h3>
<p>Training sessions are scheduled on an ad-hoc basis throughout the year, as required.&nbsp; Sessions are offered to Educational Support Workers (recruited solely to work with disabled students) and to members of staff throughout the institution. Training sessions take place in a small computer room within the library.&nbsp; There are 8 PC&rsquo;s, arranged in 2 rows, and one for the facilitator, which is attached to a projector.&nbsp; Each PC has a book scanner.&nbsp; The room has height adjustable desks, and additional resources, such as a Braille printer and CCTV (<a href="http://www.specialneedscomputers.ca/index.php?l=product_detail&p=1553">http://www.specialneedscomputers.ca/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=1553</a>)&nbsp; is available.&nbsp; The room is usually used as an open access lab for students with disabilities.</p>
<p>There were a total of 5 people in the session, myself, 3 support workers and a student with whom one of the trainee&rsquo;s would be working.&nbsp; For this session the student would assess/provide authentic feedback for all learners.</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>The objective of the session was for the support workers to be able to convert inaccessible printed or electronic materials into an alternative format so students could access it effectively.&nbsp; In this session this was Braille.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ol start="1">
<li>Contacted all participants with information about date, time, venue, etc</li>
<li>Welcome</li>
<li>Introduction &ndash; interactive session asking what is Braille.&nbsp; Examples provided.</li>
<li>Alphabet exercise. Braille alphabet provided, along with a brief message in Braille &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to decipher.</li>
<li>Introduction (cont) - What we are trying to achieve and why</li>
<li>Demonstration of process</li>
<li>Materials to be converted handed out</li>
<li>Tutor guided activity &ndash; conversion of materials</li>
<li>Students try to convert further materials &ndash; supported by tutor</li>
<li>Results checked by visually impaired student</li>
<li>Feedback provided to learners</li>
<li>Further attempts of conversion, some with inappropriate (diagrams/photographs/etc) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and electronic texts &ndash; introduction to advanced features if required</li>
<li>Further feedback.</li>
<li>Summary/conclusions</li>
<li>Provision of supporting materials</li>
</ol>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>By then end of the session the learners could take printed text and inaccessible electronic texts and convert to Braille.&nbsp; In addition, they learned why this is necessary, and why in some cases it would not be appropriate/desirable to do this in all situations.&nbsp; As the conversion is a two step process they could also convert to electronic text (where necessary).&nbsp; Students also learned why this was necessary, and what other formats could be created from electronic texts (though not how to do so).&nbsp; Having a student there meant that they were able to receive authentic feedback, and see how results could be improved in real time.&nbsp; This meant that, once completed students were offered high quality support, which is noted in responses to our annual student survey.</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>The best part of this session is the feedback provided by the student, without this it loses much of its authenticity, and believability.&nbsp; Learners seem to be able to better understand the difficulties when they can see them for themselves, rather than having them explained by a trainer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hands on approach also seems to be popular with learners, as this is a practical task and the experience of doing it seems to keep everyone engaged.&nbsp; Working in small groups allows the support workers to discuss problems/progress with one another (especially as the same student evaluates all work so can compare), which keeps the session light-hearted.</p>
<h3><strong>Additional Resources</strong></h3>
<p>I have also created a CompendiumLD jpeg illustrating this activity, and a word document from PPC (PPC file itself is available below)</p>

Actions and objectives are included in circles and squares, and it is easy to drag ones&rsquo; eye across what needs to be done. This would be very easy for the experienced teacher/instructor to refer to during the lesson as it is colourful and states what needs to be done e.g. working out how many students need to be in how many groups. The only drawback would be lack of space to add further detail/list comments or stimulation of further learning design processes such as details of social interaction to look out for, pedagogy and recording of results.</p>
<p><a title="4sppices model" href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/learning-designs/pi-project-healthy-eating-activity/4sppices ">Healthy eating as a 4sppices model</a><br /><br /> This web based resource has a lot of additional features such as tagging, sharing and tabs to split up different areas. It is also easy to see at one glance the process, with the addition of allowing additional text /comments unlike the 4TS model. However the P1, P2, P3 labels might&nbsp; be a tad confusing and colour/shapes might better represent this function. <br /> <br /> These models would be adequate for expressing my learning design as it would ensure that I stick to a learning design that has been agreed prior, and enable me to go through the stages in the actual lesson without going off task. I would also be able to store and share these models with colleagues and other students and keep a solid record of proceedings. If I was able to add student details, comments, photos and films, even better.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Amanda Everitt’s design narrative: raising awareness between deaf and hearing students</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8261</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I worked as a Participation Officer for deaf young people and my role was to engage with this audience and find out their interests, thought and their obstacles through fun and interactive activities, and to use this as a vehicle to influence organisational change from a child-centred perspective.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>This 1 hour long activity took place within a school classroom with 5 deaf and 5 hearing students aged 11-18. All the participants knew of each other having seen each other around school, however only two were friends. Students were initially awkward with one other there being a wide range of ages and communication factors present such as students who signed, students who spoke but still needed communication assistance to understand full instructions. The presenter was deaf, and relied on the British Sign Language interpreter to translate the comments of the hearing students, and the BSL interpreter was also on hand to translate the comments of the deaf students to the hearing students. To encourage full disclosure, no other classroom teacher was present. The classroom was of a good size, however tables had to be adjusted from rows to a horseshoe shape so that the deaf students could see and lip-read the hearing students better. Students had access to felt pens and coloured post-it notes so that thoughts and comments could be jotted down. All the students were interested in contributing to improve communication and awareness between deaf and hearing people within the school.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Developing a new resource pack containing films and lesson plans to educate hearing students about deaf students and how to communicate better with them. The measure of success was getting positive feedback on how the students wanted the films and resources to look, and to see improvement in awareness and communication within this group of students to be passed on to other students within the school.</p>

</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Objectives were met and interesting thoughts and comments were gained from the students to influence the creation and design of the resources.</p>
<p>The group dynamics were interesting as there was such a wide age range, older students talked more than the younger students and the younger students had to be encouraged to share their thoughts. It might have been better to have a separate session focusing on the look, feel and style of the resources, audio and subtitle access.<br /> However access to the students was limited. <br /> <br /> Due to limited time, evaluation of the session in the form of a short questionnaire was sent to the teacher to do with the students, and questions included if the students had talked to each other after the event, and if they had shared some tips from the session with their classmates.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Further sessions were held with deaf and hearing students separately, however it would have been beneficial if several sessions were held with the same group together and separately so as to glean more articulate thoughts and suggestions as deaf students may have been reluctant to share communication difficulties with hearing students.</p>]]></description>

<p>New Hire Induction aimed at introducing new recruits into company, familiarise everyone with essential departments, products and procedures applicable to every employee. It did not aim to teach specific job skills.</p>
<p>Target audience (new hires) was quite diverse, as program was offered to everyone, regardless of their position with the company, so it could include executive managers, as well as specialists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The program was scheduled to run for three days, in the Company X Training Centre office.&nbsp;During those days new hires were meeting with representatives and/or managers of various key departments (e.g. Marketing, HR, Legal, etc) and would learn about purpose, structure and operations of each departments, as well as their role in support of products offered by a company. Essentially, 3 days of meetings and greetings, with some information on company's history, core values and general policies in between.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>My main objective was to make the induction program be more structured, less chaotic and less boring for the audience. My measure of success was the satisfaction survey which we asked every participant to fill in.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="western">Actions</h3>
<p>First of all, I reviewed the satisfaction survey form. Original form asked participants to evaluate every presentation on the scale of 1 to 5 (5 being awesome). I expanded satisfaction form with fields for comments and added instructions to provide comments for any marks below 4. I did this to gather specific information about low satisfaction with some of the presentations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, I reviewed the presentations included in the agenda and arranged them in more logical order, covering company's history and values first and going towards products and related procedures and departments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then we ran a couple of induction sessions to gather feedback through satisfaction surveys, as well as measure any changes in evaluation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once specific comments from the audience were gathered, I reviewed them and worked together with the authors of least successful presentations to introduce constructive changes based on audience's feedback, e.g. restructuring the narrative, removing some of the topics, expanding some of the points participants found most useful, adding activities which would involve audience members. It was interesting to see that all of the presenters were extremely interested in getting to know their "survey results", however, not everyone was cooperative and forthcoming as far as changes were concerned. While majority of presenters were willing to make changes, it was very challenging to inspire change in those who needed to present compliance-related information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, I introduced some ice-breakers and energizers between lectures.</p>
<p>Once these changes were in place, we ran three more induction sessions with new content and compared the ratings received from satisfaction surveys with our previous results.</p>
<h3 class="western"><strong>Results</strong></h3>
<p>As a result, we achieved the increase in satisfaction rating from 3.5 to 4.7 (average score &nbsp;given to the question "How satisfied were you with induction training?"). Overall, audience satisfaction survey reflected increasingly positive reaction from the audience and we could also observe that in-class behaviours were not indicative of boredom. In addition, through informal conversation I could hear that new hire induction was great for introducing other departments, getting to know each other and building relationships.</p>
<h3 class="western">Reflections</h3>
<p>In this particular case, as obvious as it may sound, I learned that opinion/satisfaction surveys should always have comment fields, as numbers alone look fancy in the reports, but don't give practical information for experience design. Secondly, I was happy to see how interesting but tiresome program can be turned into an engaging and informative session.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>My role as an OU associate lecturer was to design and facilitate an online tutorial for my own group of 3<sup>rd</sup> level undergraduate students undertaking a module focused on &lsquo;promoting public health: skills, perspectives and practice&rsquo;.</em></p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>This was the first online tutorial for a new group of students in the initial weeks of the module.&nbsp; The online tutorial takes place within the VLE as part of the Tutor Group Forum (TGF) and as such it is &lsquo;closed&rsquo; i.e. available only to the tutor (me) and the students allocated to me.&nbsp; It was asynchronous and students were able to post their contributions at any time for a period of approximately 2 weeks.&nbsp; Given this was the 3<sup>rd</sup> week of the module the group was still forming and relationships although developing well remained tentative.&nbsp; Their interaction was driven principally because the online tutorial was part of a learning activity within the timetable, but was not compulsory.&nbsp; In terms of motivation and beliefs this was driven (a)in their role as OU students with a desire to learn; and (b) a personal and/or professional interest in health and wellbeing.&nbsp; Thus, as a voluntary activity they had to choose to take part.</em></p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>Principally my intention was to take abstract theoretical concepts from the module which had been considered through academic writing as well as more practically through case studies (including video material) and demonstrate that these issues were being considered in the &lsquo;real world&rsquo; of public health and health policy where they would be expected to practise i.e. to show that these concepts are more than abstract, but also to place them in a context more directly relevant to them than was the case in the module material.&nbsp; The measures of success were (a) quite pragmatic in terms of the amount of online posting and interaction generated (b) the quality of the posts with regard to the academic context in which the issues were being considered (c) evidence that they were getting beyond the module material into more immediately tangible areas (d) that their understanding of abstract concepts and real world application.</em></p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>The first thing was to write a clear set of instructions explaining the nature of the task and what was expected.&nbsp; This included providing an additional resource by way of an extract from a published document (The CMO Scotland Annual Report).&nbsp; The first part of the activity was to take a key theoretical concept from the module which had been the subject of a particular learning activity where they were expected to make contributions; and linkage to a chapter in the Module Reader.&nbsp; I wanted them to collaborate in the TGF to share their own views, and to develop this in the context of the additional material I had provided.&nbsp; I also asked that they offer their own views from a more personal perspective about a particular aspect (community based assets).&nbsp; I then offered some additional interventions: (a) reinforcement and encouragement for the work undertaken in the initial part of the exercise; (b) a summary which captured their discussions and thinking so that it became their product and could be used in TMAs etc thereafter; (c) links to further resources which would allow them to see the extent to which their thinking was in line with mainstream practical policy activity happening in practice. Generally, while this exercise worked well with those who participated, a number of students did not make specific contributions which perhaps diminished the wider collaborative effort.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Results</strong></h2>
<p><em>In general terms the expected outcomes were achieved in terms of the level of discussion; understanding of the subject matter amongst the group who participated; and recognition that what they were learning in the module had real world application. Also, the activity probably helped so support engagement and cohesion within the group.&nbsp; However, there a number of students did not contribute directly and the reasons for this were not explored further (as it was a voluntary activity).&nbsp; It could also have been the case that some students were not comfortable with the expected level of online participation or perhaps intimated by the technical nature or complexity of the discussion.&nbsp; The evidence of the level of participation remains within the module archive and could be quantified in different ways e.g. number and length of posts, perhaps against more academic criteria how the students used their experience in subsequent academic activity such as the TMA.&nbsp; The &lsquo;product&rsquo; i.e. the summary of the discussion remains available as a Word document. </em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>Looking back on this experience with a degree of critical distance it did work well and I would use it again, perhaps updating the supplementary material to ensure it maintains its contemporary application.&nbsp; It could work well for other tutors (each tutor designs their own online tutorial in K311 although there is a degree of informal sharing).&nbsp; The one thing which really stands out &lsquo;on reflection&rsquo; is the extent to which there is tangible evidence of the results.&nbsp; I know what I think was achieved and from the levels of participation I would contend that those students who participated.&nbsp; But, beyond the summary of the discussion (which I produced) how do I really know whether this intervention worked?&nbsp; Also, what measures might I want to put in place in future?</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title</strong>&nbsp;Moodle VLE induction training</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong></p>
<p><em>This is a design narrative on a potential / future learning design (as my past roles have not involved delivering teaching). The design narrative is therefore not based on real past experience but on an expected future situation. My role in this learning exercise would be to design a induction / introduction training session to new academic staff on the key relevant feature of the Moodle VLE platform so as to potentially inform their future use of the platform.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Situation</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The training is for a small group (3-6) people who are highly qualified academic specialists in their specific subject area but who are expected to have little or limited knowledge of online learning environments in general and the Moodle platform in particularly. The learning is expected to be in a F2F situation, probably over a day, in a equipped training room on campus with interactive whiteboard and ideally 3-6 PCs for direct access to the VLE. The key actors would be the Head of Department to whom the new staff report, myself as the training designer / presenter and possibly HR training specialist/s to input from the official HR side. The provision of local training outside HR is a unknown area and potential issues over the respective input to the training design process are unknown. There are also potentially issues in the new academic staff's response to and engagement with the training as the high level of qualifications within their subject specialism may give rise to reluctance to attend and effectively participate in what might be perceived as low level training.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>The objective of the training was to give new academic staff a broad overview of the features of the Moodle VLE system and to sufficiently engage them with platform so that they would be receptive and proactive in deploying the platform in their own learning designs. The measure of success would be an increase in the use of the VLE platform amongst this group of academics compared with other academic staff.</em></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>Actions that would be expected to be taken are:</em></p>
<p><em>Appropriate liaison with new academic staff to agree a date where all will attend so as to head off any issues with the staff members claiming unavailability and so undermine the overall objectives and targets of the training.</em></p>
<p><em>Appropriate liaison with the central HR training staff to ensure that relevant HR policies and procedures are incorporated so as to offset potentially concerns at a later date</em></p>
<p><em>Careful analysis of the key features of the Moodle platform to identify the features that are most useful / relevant to the new academic staff and the wider institution re future learning design development. This is possibly in conjunction with initial discussions with the new staff themselves, the Head of Department and the HR people.</em></p>
<p><em>The definition of the learning design for the day in terms of how / when to cover the different aspects and what activity to use with the staff and what facilities are needed to ensure effective learning took place. Possible issues to address include the timing for each feature, how to engage the new staff so they feel comfortable using &nbsp;the features themselves later</em></p>
<p><em>Defining what further support is needed / required to ensure the learning continues independently after the main training session</em></p>
<p><em>Locating the technology side re the platform within a wider concept of the learning process for the students</em></p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><em>As this is describing a future learning narrative this heading is somewhat problematic. Hopefully the staff will be sufficiently engaged with the potential of the Moodle platform to incorporate it into their future learning as appropriate so as to benefit student learning. The outcome would ultimately be improved students results, retention and subsequently recruitment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>Again problematic given that it is a future learning narrative. An expected key area of insight would be the new staff's engagement with the technology in the training / classroom session environment and the interaction between staff who have different previous levels of experience with the platform and how that dynamic was / could be used to aide the learning of all the staff involved.</em></p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I participated in two teaching/learning conferences where presentations included a fairly equal mix of LMS/VLE and web 2.0 activities; a fair number included a 'mash up' of both. Stories were told in hallways about institutions requiring the use of the 'official' learning technology, while in some sessions participants were launched straight into the cloud with no visible means of support.</p>
<p>Technology-enhanced learning and practice is in a volatile state, and everyone seems to have an opinion about the relative merits of an institutional LMS or VLE vs the cloud, with 'mash-ups' of both technologies widespread. Is compromise a real solution, or should we commit to one or the other?</p>
<p>It has been suggested that a well-designed VLE or LMS can support any kind of online learning activity, so there is no need to use web tools for learning. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>]]></description>

              <title>Lurkers as Learners</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3426</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Much evidence on the student use of collaborative tools such as online forums indicates that a majority tend to read them but not&nbsp;contribute. There is a gap therefore between how we design / anticpate their use and how they are used (unless students are compelled/forced to use them).&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we therefore best design for the behaviour&nbsp;of &lsquo;lurking&rsquo; (for want of a more enabling and positive term) and exploit it for learning?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s suppose that instead of relying on the &lsquo;possibly&rsquo; of someone in a particular group contributing something, why not &lsquo;fake&rsquo;, or rather let&rsquo;s say &lsquo;aggressively seed&rsquo;, the discussion forum? Why not prepare a set of useful real posts from previous years, add to this to posts written on behalf of &lsquo;imagined&rsquo; students and then intentionally drip feed them in to the forum at the appropriate time they were originally/intended to be made? You could call this &lsquo;time-shifted posting&rsquo; or &lsquo;simulated&rsquo; posting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Certainly what is 'collaborative' for one person is a broadcast or object purely for consumption by another. If the forum debate unfolds like a soap opera and most are only watching it, what would the difference really be?!</li>
<li>How do those reading forums &lsquo;know&rsquo; the people posting are real (in which case how does a student really &lsquo;know&rsquo; a post is from a &lsquo;real&rsquo; person unless they have met them face-to-face!)?</li>
<li>What is it these &lsquo;lurkers&rsquo; are getting from&nbsp;watching / reading things like online forums&nbsp;and discussion treads&nbsp;and are the patterns and content of posts currently 'on offer' or provided&nbsp;by them (by &lsquo;real&rsquo; people) really delivering what these &lsquo;lurkers&rsquo; want?</li>

              <title>Carrot or Stick? How to reach tipping point with a new technology in an institution.</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>We are overwhelmed by new educational tools, but how do these become meaningful to our students? Reaching a tipping point when a technology becomes ubiquitous amongst students seems almost impossible, unless it's a tool as pervasive as google or email. So how do we get new tools out there? Should we push our Ss to use tools or else? Or should we just put stuff out there and see what sticks? Who has a success story here? And who feels that we are slowly sinking under the weight of all these new options?</p>]]></description>

              <title>Has Twitter already peaked?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3374</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3374</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>A flash debate Inspired by the Week 8 Activity for the Open University H800 course.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://themetricsystem.rjmetrics.com/2010/01/26/new-data-on-twitters-users-and-engagement/">recent analysis of data from Twitter</a> found the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Twitter ended 2009 with just over 75 million user accounts.</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->The monthly rate of new user accounts peaked in July 2009 and is currently around 6.2 million new accounts per month (or 2-3 per second). This is about 20% below July&rsquo;s peak rate.</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->A large percentage of Twitter accounts are inactive, with about 25% of accounts having no followers and about 40% of accounts having never sent a single Tweet.</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->About 80% of all Twitter users have tweeted fewer than ten times.</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Only about 17% of registered Twitter accounts sent a Tweet in December 2009, an all-time-low.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would suggest that perhaps Twitter is a fad, and has already peaked. However, the same analysis found "tremendous loyalty and engagement from those Twitter users who stay on the system after their first week as members."</p>
<p>This suggests two questions:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Is Twitter a fad that has already peaked, and is falling out of favour?</li>
<li>If Twitter is here to stay, will it be only relevant to those in the inner circle of hardcore users, but irrelevant to everyone else?&nbsp;</li>
</ol></p>
<ul>
</ul>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>What has your experience been of using Elluminate or Flashmeetings? How do they compare? What has worked best for you as a learner or teacher? When is it best to use Elluminate or a Flashmeeting. Do you think either Elluminate or Flashmeetings are effective synchronous online tools? Or have they not worked for you?</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>As part of the H800 course you will get a chance to explore and use the Cloudworks site. Use this space to discuss your impressions of the site and any ideas about how the site might be used to support H800 students generally. You might like to look at the L140 En Rumbo Spanish <a href="/index.php/cloudscape/view/776">Cloudscape</a> for example, which was used as a space to aggregte relevant resources for an intermediate level OU Spanish course.</p>]]></description>
