              <title>Open Nottingham 2011: Lessons from Open Source Software Re-use - Greg DeKoenigsberg</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5316</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5316</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[&lt;!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Calibri} --&gt;
<p>Greg DeKoenigsberg (ISKME OER Commons) talking about&nbsp;lessons from the world of open source trransferred to open education. How does online collaboration work? Where is the learning in this process. What he learnt by participating and collaborating around a community of 10,000 plus members.&nbsp;What he learnt from open-source and what he think about OER.&nbsp;How the lessons from open-source can be carried on to the OER movement.</p>
<p><strong>Online communities of practice (taking Etienne's work on CoP):</strong> <em>What is the domain?</em> Participation is voluntarily &ndash; you must feel passionate about this. <em>What is the community?</em> The context in which your participants work together. <em>What is the practice? </em>The activies that move your participants closer to your golas)</p>
<p>The internet encourages the construction of endless communities of practice, serving vanishingly small domains.&nbsp;See entire worlds of people that you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise see.</p>
<p>What we conceive of as &ldquo;the OER community&rdquo; is actually a potential endless set of vanishingly small communities that all have different needs and priorities (Do we know enough about them?)</p>
<p>Talking about discoverability solutions that work: You need people to filter resources in the developed (1st world). 1<sup>st</sup> world problem too many resources / 3<sup>rd</sup> world problem not enough resources. 1<sup>st</sup> world needs people (eg people you follow and trust their opinion / judgement on twitter) to filter good/bad resources.</p>
<p>How can we leverage open content and infrastructure to build and service actual communities of practice?</p>
<p>The internet encourages the construction of endless communities of practice serving vanishingly small domains.&nbsp;Giving people new opportunities to be genuinely useful even in small ways is empowering in ways you wouldn&rsquo;t believe.&nbsp;Micro-contributions from the wider open-source community is what makes it work. Empower users.&nbsp;That is the secret to the open source world!</p>
<p>Licenses are mechanisms that allow people to share. These mechanisms are essential to the sharing of source code. Economic value / user case studies of open source.&nbsp;These mechanisms may be incidental to the sharing of content.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Open Nottingham 2011: Use of OER by an Open University Maths Course - Tim Lowe</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5314</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5314</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Tim Lowe talking about Maths course and resources and "Maths Help"</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for applying for course:</strong></p>
<p>a. Support module to do other courses (eg science, business etc)</p>
<p>b. Introduction to Maths in order to then progress to more advanced maths course; and...</p>
<p>c. To overcome fear of doing maths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aims of re-writing the materials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increase retention</li>
<li>Better prepare students for subsequent modules</li>
<li>Remove preparatory material</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Maths help?&nbsp;</strong><em>Mathshelp.open.ac.uk</em></p>
<p><em>"Maths Help" on the OU OER site OpenLearn&nbsp;</em>allows students to begin to prepare for maths course before they receive their course materials.&nbsp;Basic maths skills modules on OpenLearn, based on previous (printed) materials, enhanced with interactive activities and linked to the course website. Mathshelp is&nbsp;a door into everyday mathematics, points also within course materials, available for all to use (lined to from OU &ldquo;Skills for Study&rdquo;; STEM: North of Scotland; TechFest-SetPoint) and reuse (via Jorum). Materials from books into web friendly format. Plus very useful guide of how to&nbsp;use the maths calculator (used also by other organisations).</p>
<p><strong>The challenge:&nbsp;</strong>When students are reading materials and sending materials, the communication of maths should be enhanced, we should be able to teach more <em>How do we say maths?</em> <em>Who do we speak it? </em>&nbsp;Solution by using audio frames)</p>
<p><strong>Usage and feedback:&nbsp;</strong>Unique visitors: 1/1/2010 &ndash; 13/9/2010. users:&nbsp;500-1000 per module.&nbsp;Modules rated 4.5-5 stars (via OpenLearn &ndash; not many people do ratings).&nbsp;Students recommending to each other in forums.&nbsp;Tutors reporting better initial understanding.&nbsp;High take-up (95%) and achievement (mean:94%) in first early assignment</p>
<p><strong>Final thought from the room: </strong>Students doing other courses that need such support for other course &ndash; this could help so much.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>We want to better understand what learning is like in universities and what teaching entails.</p>
<p>Why is Nottingham involved? (5-year strategic plan) Detailed outline of the way OER contributes to the work and mission of Nottingham University:</p>
<p>1. Social responsibility</p>
<p>2. Excellence in education</p>
<p>3. Promotional opportunities</p>
<p>4. Internationalisation</p>
<p>5. Cost efficiencies</p>
<p>Nottingham University working with student unions to better understand how students are using the resources.</p>
<p>Nottingham University has campuses in Asia and Malaysia &ndash; they dont have the same materials &ndash; the ability and opportunity to share materials across continents &ndash; make it openly available</p>
<p>Evidence that Chinese students are using the open materials to study at the NU campus in Ningbo</p>
<p><strong><em>Nottingham Uni has two tools:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>XPERT</strong> (harvesting OER engine)</p>
<p><strong>XERTE</strong> (creating e-learning materials &ndash; open source tool)&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <title> Open Nottingham 2011: The Learning Registry - Steve Midgley</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5296</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5296</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Steve Midgley is the&nbsp;Deputy Director of the Office of Education Technology at the United States Department of Education. At Open Nottingham he introduced&nbsp;the "Learning Registry"&nbsp;to help educators to find the resources they need in the format they need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>What is the Learning Registry?</strong></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->1. Lightweight API</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->2. No centralised infrastructure: no &ldquo;off&rdquo; switch</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->3. Control and accountability is local</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->4. No default winners: level the playing field</p>
<p>Digital learning resources are widely available, but hard to apply for teaching and learning.&nbsp;Educators and students already know about how best to use resources.</p>
<p>Users are leaving data trails but their usage data is often thrown away or locked up.&nbsp;Expertise is highly distributed. users are leaving data trails, but usage data is often thrown away or locked up.&nbsp;The universe of diffreent forms of data orbiting around learning resources.&nbsp;Types of data: paradata (data about data), metadata, analytical data, linked data, context all around the learning resource.&nbsp;A big opportunity in the education space to be able to go after this metadata &amp; paradata and get value from it.</p>
<p>New services can include better discovery, recommendations, curricular integration and measurements of quality&nbsp;</p>
<p>The developer should be able to take the prototype and build with it / over it.&nbsp;Let the community speak to itself through the timeline of the learning registry (common metadata timeline).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Key messages:</strong></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Make possible a &ldquo;do-ocracy&rdquo; for those who run the project. Welcoming anyone who wants to make a difference.</li>
<li>Let the community speak to itself through the timeline of the learning registry (common metadata timeline)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Avoid bureaucratic heat death. Do as little as possible, as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Investment of time is a strong currency in education.&nbsp;Time constraint for teachers to find the resources &ndash; make it easy for them.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Wikipedia is increasingly used by university students for<br />"pre-research", <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/125899/">to gain context and explore ideas for course<br />assignments and research projects</a> [1]. Yet many among scientists,<br />academics and other experts are <a href="http://www.jmir.org/2011/1/e14/">reluctant to contribute </a>to Wikipedia,<br />despite a growing number of <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/members/aps-wikipedia-initiative/">calls from the scientific community</a> to<br />join the project .<br /><br />The <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research_Committee">Wikimedia Research Committee </a>has just launched a survey to<br />understand why scientists, academics and other experts do (or do not)<br />contribute to Wikipedia and other collaborative projects, and whether<br />individual motivation aligns with shared perceptions of Wikipedia<br />within expert communities. We hope this may help us identify ways<br />around barriers to expert participation. The survey is anonymous and<br />takes about 20 min to complete. Please help us circulate the link<br />among your colleagues and collaborators:<br /><br /><a href="http://bit.ly/ExpertBarriers ">http://bit.ly/ExpertBarriers</a> <br /><br />Dario Taraborelli<br />Panagiota Alevizou<br />Daniel Mietchen<br /><br />Please feel free to provide comments regarding the survey, or ideas for publicising this to other outlets as well as further thoughts....<br /><br /></p>]]></description>

              <title>From Open Content to Open Thinking</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3947</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3947</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>We propose that one of the barriers to adoption of Open Educational Resources (OERs) in common teaching practices is the lack of transparency of practitioners&rsquo; &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; around the production and consumption of those resources.</p>
<p>Thefore we propose to move from a paradigm of <em>opening up contents</em> and OER to a paradigm of <em>opening up people&rsquo;s thinking about OERs</em>.</p>
<p>Our objective is to make this thinking visible and exportable in a way that support the emergence of collective intelligence around OER. To cater for this we designed <a href="http://cohere.open.ac.uk/">Cohere</a>, a first prototype socio-technical infrastructure to gather Collective Intelligence around OER.</p>
<p>You can explore more these concepts by looking at the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AnnaDeLiddo/edmedia2010-de-liddo">PPT presentation</a> embedded here below. This is a presentation  for Ed-Media 2010 Conference, http://www.aace.org/conf/edmedia/, to be  held in Toronto, Canada, June 29 &ndash;July 2, 2010.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about <a href="http://cohere.open.ac.uk/">Cohere</a> you can also watch the movie, embedded here below, from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKykgBo-zGI&feature=player_embedded">submission to the Mozzilla Firefox Competition 2009: Jetpack for Learning</a>. In this movie we explain how Cohere can be used to enhance Web-Annotation to more effective learning.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<div>
<p><strong>Part of the <a href="http://olnet.org/" target="_blank">OLnet Project</a>'s mission is to investigate the   socio-technical infrastructure that will assist the Open Education movement in pooling   its "</strong><a href="http://olnet.org/node/102"><strong>collective   intelligence</strong></a><strong>". <br /></strong></p>
OLnet seeks to advance the movement's collective intelligence by   pooling the many different layers of evidence, that currently exist in   disconnected forms, on the use, reuse and unerstanding of Open Educational Resources. We are therefore considering a collective intelligence infrastructure as one way to:   
<ul>
<li>Invite your stories, informal feedback, or formal evaluation results   concerning a particular Open Educational Resource</li>
<li>Invite your inside knowledge of how the Open Educational Resource was designed (<strong>OER   Design Methods</strong>)</li>
<li>Invite your experiences and insights on tackling major challenges   facing the Open Education movement (<strong>OER Grand Challenges</strong>, e.g.   Organisational Obstacles, Remixing, IP Clearance...)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We invite feedback on the design storyboard of the Collective Intelligence infrastructure (please watch the video embedded here below).<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions for you are therefore...</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>What do you think of this design storyboard?<br /> </em></li>
<li><em>What would make these widgets 'killer apps' for you?</em><br /> ...so that you'd want to have these on your website, e.g. as an OER   educator, learner, publisher, remixer, researcher, funder...? Depending   on which hat(s) you wear, you might ask yourself:<br /> <em>What would I  like to know about an OER before deciding to use it  to learn, or teach  with?<br /> What would I like to know about the state of the art in a  given  debate, before deciding whether to enter it, or fund work on it?</em></li>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3239</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summary: Part of the <a href="http://olnet.org" target="_blank">OLnet Project</a>'s mission is to investigate the  socio-technical infrastructure that will assist the movement in pooling  its "</strong><a href="http://olnet.org/node/102"><strong>collective  intelligence</strong></a><strong>". We invite feedback from all members  of the OER community on the design storyboard introduced below...</strong></p>
<p>At this week's <a href="http://cmi2.yale.edu/hewlett_conference_2010/">OER conference</a> at Yale University, Hewlett Foundation grantees are considering many  of the big issues, which will be a valuable source of input into our  emerging CI infrastructure.</p>
<p>This cloud shadows the 'birds of a feather' Friday lunchtime&nbsp; session to discuss the design concept we storyboard in the slides and  movie below, but we invite feedback from all members of OER community  via this page...</p>
<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><a title="OER Collective Intelligence storyboard" href="http://www.slideshare.net/sbs/oer-collective-intelligence-storyboard-3612188"></a></strong>So, the idea is that working with you, OLnet develops some  "widgets" (attractive little apps you can embed in your OER website),  which enable us to crowdsource input from the community. These are  channelled back to the OLnet website which pools the data, generates  aggregate views, offers recommendations of related people and resources  to your interests, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What would these widgets do?</strong></p>
<p>OLnet seeks to advance the movement's collective intelligence by  pooling the many different layers of evidence that currently exist in  disconnected forms. We are therefore considering widgets as one way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite your stories, informal feedback, or formal evaluation results  concerning a particular OER (<strong>OER Impact</strong>)</li>
<li>Invite your inside knowledge of how the OER was designed (<strong>OER  Design Methods</strong>)</li>
<li>Invite your experiences and insights on tackling major challenges  facing the movement (<strong>OER Grand Challenges</strong>, e.g.  Organisational Obstacles, Remixing, IP Clearance...)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions for you are therefore...</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>What do you think of this design storyboard?<br /> </em></li>
<li><em>What would make these widgets 'killer apps' for you?</em><br /> ...so that you'd want to have these on your website, e.g. as an OER  educator, learner, publisher, remixer, researcher, funder...? Depending  on which hat(s) you wear, you might ask yourself:<br /> <em>What would I like to know about an OER before deciding to use it  to learn, or teach with?<br /> What would I like to know about the state of the art in a given  debate, before deciding whether to enter it, or fund work on it?</em></li>
</ol>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3063</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Abstract: Analysing communicative action in institutions: where the cultural historical shapes the interactional This presentation is concerned with the way which we understand and investigate the relationship between human functioning and social setting. It deploys post Vygotskian theory which attempts to account for the social <br />formation of mind mediated by artefacts understood as cultural historical products and Bernsteinian theory (e.g. Bernstein, 2000) which seeks to forge analytical linkages between structure, communication and consciousness. As I have noted elsewhere much of the sociocultural or Activity Theory research&nbsp; that claims a Vygotskian root <br />fails to fully articulate an appropriate&nbsp; theory of social structure and an account of&nbsp; how it directs and deflects the attention of the individuals it constrains&nbsp; and enables (Daniels, 2008,1). The central argument of this presentation draws on the work of Bernstein and Vygotsky. A novel approach to the study of the mutual shaping of human action and institutional settings is developed and an empirical example of its application is <br />presented and discussed. The research reported here is drawn from a 4 year ESRC TLRP funded study of professional learning in and for interagency working in Children&rsquo;s Services in England. The talk will describe and discuss an approach to the analysis of innovatory learning as a sequential and contingent process that takes place across many workspaces and over an extended period of time.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Anne Edwards on the development of relational agency in professional practices</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3055</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3055</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Abstract</p>
<p>It takes as its starting point a view of practices as knowledge-laden and emotionally freighted sites of purposeful and expert activity. Arguments therefore draw on cultural historical analyses of activities, practices and the institutions that shape them. Relational agency in inter-professional activities is a capacity for fluid and responsive work. It involves working with others to recognise and respond to what matters for each profession in complex professional tasks. It is seen to be mediated by common knowledge which is built in interactions at the points where the boundaries of practices intersect. The focus will be the development of common knowledge, described by Carlile (2004: 557) as a capacity to 'represent the differences now of consequence and the ability of the actors involved to use it', at the sites of intersecting practices. The argument, supported by evidence from four recent studies of interprofessional work, is that building and using common knowledge is an important feature of the relational expertise required for working across the practice boundaries on complex tasks.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2777</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2777</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>A culture of sharing and building more context around OERs were among the key and core tasks that are perceived as critical to meeting the needs of students, according to forty leaders in open education and technology who met in Barcelona on October 19-20, 2009, at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://openedtech.org/">Open EdTech Summit</a> sponsored by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.uoc.edu/">Open University of Catalunya</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmc.org/">New Media Consortium. </a></p>
<p><em>Creating the university of the future</em> was the title of the summit and the question is how and whether Open Educational Resources (OERs) are also examples of creative use of Web 2.0 in a higher education context.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://oet.wiki.nmc.org/CallToAction">Call to Action summarizes</a> the major findings of the 2009 Open EdTech Summit; Of those, point 5 is of particular interest:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Content producers and users alike must embrace strategies (reflective blogging, metadata, documentation of process, visualization of learning, etc.) for linking content generation to "pedagogical wraparounds" that embed context within effective learning practices. Such strategies would ensure that the focus remains on learning objectives and process, rather than on the technology used to deliver the learning materials.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What tools, platforms and environments are available and have been a success thus far in this respect? </li>
<li>What are the barriers for embedding such context? </li>
<li>technical literacies, time commitments? </li>
<li>what are the ways to inter-connect pedagogies around OER use? </li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <title>Question from a participant: How can Cloudworks improve the impact of specific OERs or make them more visible? </title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>A discussion is going on about the role of Cloudworks in increasing visibility of specific OERs. The issue is as Grainne points out not to create another repository, but to link to existing repositories and generate discussions or add additional links around particular objects within the particular OER.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>The specific objectives of Open Exeter are</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make available via a Creative Commons licence, a minimum of the equivalent of 360 credits of learning resources, from a range of subjects and a wide variety of mediums. </li>
<li>Make the resources available via JorumOpen and also Exeter's institutional repository. </li>
<li>Create a suite of protocols and templates that will facilitate the workflow from identifying resources to making them accessible such that future resources can be released under the same sustainable conditions. </li>
<li>Create an effective metadata schema so that resources can be readily found by end users. </li>
<li>Create an environment within which resources can be effectively evaluated, used and repurposed as part of e.g. student / staff collaboration course design and delivery collaboration. </li>

              <title>What are the main barriers to reusing/remixing OERs?</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>[First published at: <a href="http://olnet.org/node/119">http://olnet.org/node/119</a>]</p>
<p>In the <a title="OLnet home page" href="http://olnet.org/">OLnet</a> team we lately started a collaborative process of "reflecting" on Open Educational Resources reuse/remix challenges. In order to understand what these challenges may be we tried to answer to the following questions:</p>
<p>Why reusing/remixing and Open Educational Resource?</p>
<p>What are the barriers to reusing/remixing OERs?</p>
<p><a href="/index.php/cloud/view/2432">Liam cloud</a> summarized the answers that the OLnet team members proposed to the first question. In this Blog Post I just open for discussion and improvements the list of 20 barriers to OERs reuse/remix that the OLnet team identified as answer to the second question. Are this all the possible barriers? Are these the rights ones? We need help to enrich, revise, question and discuss this list with a wider group. If you have any idea, answer, or barrier to add to the list please add it in the comments, this would help enriching this collaborative reflecting exercise.</p>
<h2>What are the barriers to reusing/remixing OERs?</h2>
<p>1) Internationalization, OERs may be available but in a different language;</p>
<p>2) Cognitive overload: it is difficult to separate the 'content' from the 'context' in a OER, thus it is difficult to decontextualize an OER and re-contextualize it to a different learning context/purpose;</p>
<p>3) Cognitive overload: in terms of trying to illicit the implicit design of an OER and then needing to create a new design;</p>
<p>4) Cognitive overload due to Lack of good examples/ best practice:&nbsp; "remixing" an OER is a difficult concept to grasp, especially as examples of remixing might be difficult to find or something you wouldn't tend to stumble across;</p>
<p>5) Digital divide: lack of access to digital network implies no access to digital resources;</p>
<p>6) Digital divide: lack of digital literacy;</p>
<p>7) Lack of teacher's preparation and training in how to reuse OERs;</p>
<p>8) Distance from main stream teaching and learning practices and policy;</p>
<p>9) Curriculum alignment: OER may not fit specific curriculum, and vice-versa curriculums may not be designed around an OER reuse/remix culture;</p>
<p>10) Plagiarism: to which extent reusing and remixing an OER can be perceived as a form of plagiarism?;</p>
<p>11) Lack of technical support for teachers; institutionalized support i.e. a dedicated educational technologist team is considered important for promoting re-use within different educational instituions/contexts (relates to digital and socio-economic divides)</p>
<p>12) Copyright issues and different copyright jurisdictions: this is mostly about publishing original OERs, but it also relates to the ways in which an OER is 'translated' to different contexts/locations. It also hinders what other items, media objects can be added that are more relevant to a national culture / pedagogical context;</p>
<p>13) Lack of confidence: many teachers/tutors feel reluctant to reuse and publish their reused materials. One possible reason for that is that they feel that they tamper with something that was designed/published for a specific purpose/context; this relate with the Conceptual overload mentioned at point 2);</p>
<p>14) Lack of confidence: many teachers/tutors feel reluctant to "mess up" with someone else "good" design;</p>
<p>15) Lack of explicit learning design supporting the representation of resources and dialogue around their use in a particular context; if context/purpose and targetted audience alongside learning outcomes are not very explicit this makes more difficult to repurpose in a different context;</p>
<p>16) Lack of policy embeddedness and accepted institutional practices: OER use and re-use in mainstream educational institutions needs be legitimized by accepted national policies on education;</p>
<p>17) Issues of quality/legitimacy: some OERs are not considered worthy of using/remixing. Some advocates insist on putting ratings / quality and context indicators. That will enable tracing of use and perhaps stimulate re-use;</p>
<p>18) Lack of time: too much effort to put in reusing makes easier and faster to do it yourself from scratch;</p>
<p>19) Lack of tools to help deconstruct and reconstruct;</p>
<p>20) Lack of motivation - why should I, what's in it for me?</p>]]></description>

              <title>Why remix an Open Educational Resource?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2432</link>

<p>One of the ideas in the world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources" target="_blank">Open Educational Resources</a> (OERs) that can be a bit strange to grasp at first is the idea of &ldquo;remixing&rdquo;. When I first joined the OLnet project and was telling people about it, a mention of remixing would often prompt people to ask &ldquo;why would I want to do that?&rdquo;, a perfectly reasonable question as many will have just experienced education as courses they learn from, but wouldn't actually change. Often OERs are just thought of as free courses, but remixing creates a much bigger opportunity. So I thought I would draw on the collective wisdom of the OLnet team and compile a list of twenty reasons to remix an OER.</p>
<p>The list is in no particular order, and by its very nature isn't an extensive exploration of the reasons to remix an OER, so if you think of any more it would be great to hear about them in the comments.</p>

<li>Save yourself time and work by mixing in OERs with your own material to make something richer</li>
<li>Adapt the material to make it more accessible for people with different disabilities</li>
<li>Insert some cultural specific references to make a concept easier to understand</li>
<li>Translate it into another language</li>
<li>Correct any errors or inaccuracies</li>
<li>Keep the OER up to date by adding the latest discoveries or theories</li>
<li>Insert more media or links to other resources</li>
<li>Chop the OER up into smaller chunks that might be easier to learn from, or could be reused elsewhere</li>
<li>Adapt it for a different audience</li>
<li>Use the OER as the basis for a face to face lesson</li>
<li>Change the target educational level</li>
<li>Add input and participation from the people who are going to be using your remixed OER</li>
<li>Use the OER for a wider purpose by adding in other information</li>
<li>Changing the format of the OER to make it work in different computer based learning environments</li>
<li>To improve understanding of what an OER is by thinking about reasons to remix it</li>
<li>Insert a different point of view to that originally given in the material</li>
<li>Adapt it for different teaching situations</li>
<li>A way to experiment with new skills yo have gained (could be technical skills, media skills etc.)</li>
<li>To improve it</li>
<li>Because you can!</li>
</ol>
<p>As an IT person not an academic I'm more familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank">open source</a> than open educational resources, but the concepts do have a lot in common. With both you can just use the resources, you don't have to remix or contribute, and there is nothing wrong with that. If you do want to contribute though or you might feel an existing resource is near to what you want, you are free to build on it to meet new challenges.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Thurs, 1st Oct 2009, Venue Design Observatory, Venables Building OU.</p>
<p>A gathering to discuss the connections amongst the various OER and web 2.0 projects existing in the university took place.&nbsp; Representatives from projects such as OLnet, Atelier-D, OpenLearn, SCORM, LDI, iSpot, the TERG&nbsp;research group&nbsp;and the OU Library.</p>
<p>It's intringuing how using 'conventional media' like pens and images from magazines we managed to visualise and represent Olnet.</p>
<p>Even more interesting were the perceptions of participants and their feedback. I am trying to include some here:</p>
<ul>
<li>How could it link with JISC JORUM initiative and 'community bay'?</li>
<li>how do we improve resource discovery to deliver targetted and appropriate level material for reuse/repurposing? </li>
<li>Meta analysis of use is needed</li>
<li>how do we learn more about the sue of OERs? trough which methods?</li>
<li>OER international: all age groups, different cultures, web 2.0 tools</li>
<li>Are you investigating visualisations of qualitative/quant research data? </li>
<li>Researching 'known unknowns'</li>
<li>Communities of learners, delivery, designing, fostering?</li>
<li>global learning and cultures?</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps OLnet has something to contribute in all four themes that emerged from the workshop including:</p>
<ul>
<li>models of learning</li>
<li>models of communication / in social spaces</li>
<li>models of communication / tools for sharing</li>
<li>models of design </li>
</ul>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2389</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I guess the evidence is scattered in several national projects and depends on scope (teaching, research, scholarship), pedagogical drive, embedded purposes and situated practices. Any thoughts? what's your experience been as a tutor, student, researcher?</p>
<p>Are OERs a great case for effective use of Web 2.0 in educational contexts? What are the differences among instituional (i.e. those coming from 'traditional universities') and more 'alternative' OERs? (say <a href="http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page">Wikiversity</a>, <a href="http://p2pu.org/">P2PU</a> ?)</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>"Several themes&nbsp; overlap to form the compound concept of identity (ownership, control, credentials, assertions, personas, activities, etc&hellip;). Although many of the aspects are obvious and intuitive, a discussion of the implications, including risks and benefits, of open and online exposure is essential to fully understand what we are asking our students to do. What does it mean for a student to publish their work online? How does this affect their online identity, and by extension, their identity as a whole?"</p>

              <title>Scenario: Design of a 50 min lecture</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1838</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[Rebecca is a researcher in OER and she has to give a 50 minute lecture on the hystory of OER. She enter the OLnet platform and she type in the site search: &quot;What are the OER origins?&quot; the system give her back as a list of OER on the topic, every OER has an image and a hypermedia summary associated to it (text and video).... since she is a visual person she often deside to focus on  resource when she is atttracted by the image...  she finds a couple of interesting resources so she tag them and she import them in her favorite...Ones she is satisfied with three resources she drag and drop them in the canvas. Ones in the canvas the resources are fragmented in sections and paragraphs . ..she can drag and drop in the canvas also just parts she want to reuse. The system also give her a list of learning patterns on the hystory of OER.....every patterns has again a hypermedia summary that she can explore and she realize that one of them is exactly describing the experience that she want her student have!....so she drag and drop it in the canvas, the learnign design pattern unfold as a bar she can scroll forward and backwords. Every step in the learning pattern is a fragment that she can reuse....like in a movie maker tool...she is preatty exhited about that.....every piece is connected by a link that is explianig the semantic between the fragments (Why they are connected), and this helps her in the exploration...., she now starts to compose her new learnin pattern: her presentation for the lecture... At some point she realize that she need to associate references so she go in the area of 'references' and she drag and drop her reference in the learning pattern ban.....she like the reference to be at the end but actually she could put them everywhere and connect to the relevant resource......now she would like to add some images so she explore the suggested images area, she finds there pictures that she would like to reuse....she pick up a few of them... at the end she export her job in several multimedia formats, jpg ppt...she is ready for the lecture!
