<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="442">
<p class="normal">The two main drivers for the ICT Centre are the use of ICT for improving the quality of education and improving learning outcomes and strategies for kindergarten, primary, secondary and teacher training.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The centre produces online guides for educators and offers a series of online tools and services. These services cover a wide range of topics that educate students about careers, practice math exams, safety decisions when using media, copyright, democracy, Sami languages, collaboration for projects across national borders, learner resources for personalisation, data regulation information, entrepreneurial teaching methods, and digital literacy,</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The centre has also produced services and products for the purposes of monitoring schools. For example, it has carried out a longitudinal study on the digital skills of 7<sup>th</sup> graders, 9<sup>th</sup> graders, and upper secondary students. The centre has self-assessment for school managers on digital competence, self-assessment for teachers connecting them with professional development modules, and a national assessment on digital skills for all 8<sup>th</sup> graders.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The project also has developed pedagogical scenarios that were run in over 1,000 schools coordinated by Schoolnet. The ICT Centre ran a blog so that schools could contribute stories about everyday use of ICT.</p>

<p class="normal">Jisc, a UK charity with a mission to develop the exploitation of digital technologies for education and research in universities and colleges, is in the early stages of a national initiative to accelerate those institutions towards effective use of learning analytics through: the development of advice and guidance); the establishment of a technical platform with free and charged services, integration with institutional systems; and the support of a series of pilots using the platform.</p>
<p class="normal">The envisaged use includes both:</p>
<ul>
<li>access by students to measures of their own levels of participation and indicators of disengagement or falling-behind, as an aid to self-regulation;</li>
<li>use by staff to trigger interventions as part of a student support process.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">As of November 2015, the first tranche of pilots are just starting their Discovery Phase, in which the institutions assess their readiness as a baseline for implementation planning.</p>

<p class="normal">The approach taken has not been explicit with regard to pedagogy. The emphasis of the technical system and tools is on student support rather than on teaching and learning. In this respect, the implicit approach is mainstream in that the emphasis is on monitoring engagement and performance and using predictive analytics to prompt appropriate staff to the possible need for an intervention. Use by students for self-regulation is in scope but is of secondary importance. In essence: the envisaged use of learning analytics is as an enhancement of prevalent practice.</p>

<td colspan="2" valign="top" width="443">
<p class="normal">The World Bank Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) &lsquo;What Matters Most for Education Management Information Systems Framework Paper&rsquo; was published in 2014 as part of its Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) working paper series. SABER is an initiative to produce comparative data and knowledge on education policies and institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically strengthen their education systems.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The working paper focuses on data and their analysis as a tool for management, school-system oversight, and policy. The term &lsquo;learning analytics&rsquo; is never used. Nevertheless, the vision described in the paper includes feedback of student learning and other outcomes back to school level for action by teachers, students, so enablement of learning analytics practices is implicit.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal"><em>&lsquo;An effective EMIS is one that has a fully functioning information cycle. This cycle demonstrates that an </em></p>
<p class="normal"><em>EMIS is more than a simple annual school census, that the coverage of statistics goes beyond </em></p>
<p class="normal"><em>administrative census data. An EMIS is a dynamic system that has a defined architecture, the capacity to </em></p>
<p class="normal"><em>perform analytics, and the ability to serve its users. The functioning of this cyclical process results in more </em></p>
<p class="normal"><em>effective data sharing and coordination.&rsquo;</em></p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The paper concludes with a rubric for assessing progress toward the key policy goals identified, which gives indicative statements against four levels of maturity against a large number of indicators organised under policy lever headings including: legal framework, human resources, infrastructural capacity, data-driven culture, methodological soundness, openness, timeliness and data coverage.</p>

<p class="normal">This policy brief, written by Simon Buckingham Shum, was published in 2012 by the UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The aim of the report is to describe and define learning analytics and to provide real-world examples of their use. In doing so, it divides learning analytics into three levels -- micro (individual student), meso (institution), and macro (region/state/national/international) -- and highlights potential benefits of learning analytics for each. Examples of learning analytics forms are also given, including LMS/VLE dashboards, predictive analytics, adaptive learning analytics, social network analytics and discourse analytics.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The report also highlights debates in the learning analytics field. Topics include the perceived &lsquo;neutrality&rsquo; of data, conceptualising the definition of student &lsquo;success&rsquo;, and various ethical implications of using and sharing student data.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, the policy brief provides recommendations for higher education institutions in the light of the state of the art at the time of publication:</p>
<p class="normalCxSpMiddle">1.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using analytics as a tool to debate visions of teaching and education in the 21st century</p>
<p class="normalCxSpMiddle">2.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Training staff and researchers to use and develop analytics tools</p>
<p class="normalCxSpMiddle">3.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developing an analytics infrastructure for research at an institutional level</p>
<p class="normalCxSpMiddle">4.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collaborating with other institutions to develop trusted partnerships and robust learning analytics methods (for example, through an open analytics platform)</p>

<p>The Learning Analytics at the Workplace (LAW) manifesto is a document created for the Learning Analytics Community Exchange (LACE). Its creation followed a 2015 &lsquo;workplace learning&rsquo; session of a learning analytics workshop in Brussels, supported by the European Parliament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The manifesto first highlights the current state of the ar&rsquo; of European manufacturing, as well as potential industry changes in the future. In particular, 3D printing, Internet of Things, digital disruptions and Industry 4.0 are discussed. Next, the document highlights the 21<sup>st</sup>-century skills needed to address and embrace these changes, and proposes adoption of learning analytics to support increased workplace learning of these skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stakeholders for adopting learning analytics for workplace learning are described in detail in three primary areas: industry, education and society. Suggestions are offered at multiple levels, including tips for industry leaders, employers, workers, universities, teachers, social partners, teacher unions and trade unions. Finally, the future of learning analytics for workplace learning is addressed.</p>

<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">It considered ten case studies from universities in Australia, the USA, and the UK and explored the strategic issues pertinent to effective use of learning analytics.

<p class="normal">The key enabling factors identified in the report for a national agenda are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Australian higher education leaders coordinate a high -level learning analytics task force.</li>
<li>Leverage existing national data and analytics strategies and frameworks.</li>
<li>Establish guidelines for privacy and ethics.</li>

<p class="normal">This LAK '13 conference paper analyses policy frameworks from two large distance education universities, The Open University in the UK and the University of South Africa.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The paper reports that although a great deal of data was collected from and about students by the institutions, learning analytics were not explicitly addressed within the policies of either institution at the time of writing. Both institutions&rsquo; policy frameworks were focused on national and international legislative issues around intellectual property, data privacy, and data protection.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The review highlights the irregularity of learning analytics where the institution is the only stakeholder with decision-making power, determining the scope, definition and use of educational data without the input of other stakeholders &ndash; specifically students.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">It is clear from the existing policy frameworks of both institutions that the definition and scope, harvesting and analysis of data are imbalanced and non-transparent affairs.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">This research indicates that some higher education institutions&rsquo; policy frameworks may no longer be sufficient to address the ethical issues in realising the potential of learning analytics.</p>

<td colspan="2" valign="top">
<p>The Open University (UK) policy documents include both a formal policy and guidance documents. The aim of the policy documents is to set out how the University intends that student data should be used to inform the delivery of student support in ways which conform to the University&rsquo;s charter principle to &lsquo;treat each other with dignity and respect&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The policy, which covers use of data for both student-level interventions and institutional-level strategies and processes, but not use for academic research, is based around eight principles, which are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning analytics is an ethical practice that should align with core organisational principles, such as open entry to undergraduate level study.</li>
<li>The OU has a responsibility to all stakeholders to use and extract meaning from student data for the benefit of students where feasible.</li>
<li>Students should not be wholly defined by their visible data or our interpretation of that data.</li>
<li>The purpose and the boundaries regarding the use of learning analytics should be well defined and visible.</li>
<li>The University is transparent regarding data collection, and will provide students with the opportunity to update their own data and consent agreements at regular intervals.</li>
<li>Students should be engaged as active agents in the implementation of learning analytics (e.g. informed consent, personalised learning paths, interventions).</li>
<li>Modelling and interventions based on analysis of data should be sound and free from bias.</li>
<li>Adoption of learning analytics within the OU requires broad acceptance of the values and benefits (organisational culture) and the development of appropriate skills across the organisation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Guidance documents expand upon the policy, to summarise the principles for staff, and to provide answers to the &lsquo;frequently asked questions&rsquo; of students about how data about them is used in practice.</p>
<p>The policy is published under a Creative Commons Licence.</p>

In its introduction, the document states that it &lsquo;provides frameworks, suggestions, and resources that may prove helpful in considering risk and performing analytics at both ends of a possible spectrum &ndash; not doing enough or doing too much, too soon&rsquo; (pg 9).</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="normal">The final keynote, by Ms Birgit Lao-Peetersoo (Foundation Innove) and Ms Aune Valk (Estonian Ministry of Education and Research), looked particularly at data in education in an Estonian context.</p>
<p class="normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">A panel is also described, which discussed the tension between data that are available versus data that should ultimately be used in education. Additionally, four workshops are described, which covered developing data systems, data and trust, learning analytics, and the Estonian data system. The learning analytics workshop highlighted a scepticism on behalf of workshop participants that learning analytics would be able to deliver measurable changes in education. Also described was a general fear of exploitation of student data.</p>

<p class="normal">This code of practice was developed to help universities and colleges to develop effective approaches to a variety of issues relating to the practice of learning analytics. It is a concise document that would be suitable for development of local strategies and policies. Rather than providing a prescriptive code of practice, the approach taken is to clarify a set of principles that can be operationalised according to the policies and practices already in place in universities and colleges.</p>
<p class="normal">The topics covered are, as described by the authors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Responsibility</strong> &ndash; allocating responsibility for the data and processes of learning analytics within an institution</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and Consent</strong> &ndash; being open about all aspects of the use of learning analytics, and ensuring students provide meaningful consent</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> &ndash; ensuring individual rights are protected and compliance with data protection legislation</li>
<li><strong>Validity</strong> &ndash; making sure algorithms, metrics and processes are valid</li>
<li><strong>Access</strong> &ndash; giving students access to their data and analytics</li>
<li><strong>Enabling positive interventions</strong> &ndash; handling interventions based on analytics appropriately</li>
<li><strong>Minimising adverse impacts</strong> &ndash; avoiding the various pitfalls that can arise</li>
<li><strong>Stewardship of data</strong> &ndash; handling data appropriately</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">The Code was developed for use in the United Kingdom, and refers to some national law, but most aspects are generally applicable, drawing particularly on thinking from North America, Europe, and Australia. It is published under a Creative Commons Licence.</p>

<p>Open Essayist, developed by The Open University, UK, seeks to provide automated reflective feedback to learners on draft essays. The underlying idea is to present a computer-based analysis of the most important parts and key words in the writing, so that learners can compare those to what they intended to convey, and adjust their writing in the light of that comparison. Importantly, no summative judgement is made of the essay.</p>
<p>Learners upload their draft essay, and the system then generates a series of different views based on analysis of the text, including: the most prominent words and a graphical view of their distribution through the text; the key sentences in the text, with hints to aid reflection; and a graphical view of the structure of the essay.</p>
<p>The tool is intended as a formative, developmental tool rather than for summative assessment.</p>

              <title>WED: E-feedback - supporting teachers in their use of Turnitin and GradeMark (Lisa Hale)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9528</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9528</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>At my current higher education institution, most student coursework is submitted and marked as a hard copy and findings of a recent in-house survey show that many students do not collect feedback on their summative assessed work. Why is this and what can we do as educators to change this?</p>
<p>Despite the importance of feedback to learning (Gibbs and Simpson, 2004), learners and tutors complain about feedback. Learners say that they cannot access their feedback easily enough or the feedback process takes too long, and then they are often unable to read their tutor&rsquo;s handwriting, or feel the feedback should be more personalised and specific. The result? They do not collect it. Tutors say that their learners do not engage in the feedback process and complain that their learners do not collect their feedback from them. Tutors also say that it takes a significant amount of time to produce good written feedback.</p>
<p>Implementing an e-feedback policy could answer some of these issues. Learners can access their feedback at their convenience, read typed comments more easily, benefit from improved feedback through in-text annotations, comments and popup clarifications and advice which can give more specific and directed feedback, and also benefit from the use of audio feedback. Consequently, learners are more likely to access, read, and use their feedback to feed forward to future assignments.&nbsp; For tutors, an e-feedback policy is more efficient without the need to manage a considerable amount of paper. In addition, tutors can benefit from being able to provide quicker and improved feedback through the use of in-text comments and audio tools, which could engage learners more in their feedback and encourage further dialogue about their learning.</p>
<p>There are positive findings in the literature regarding the use of an innovative tool in Turnitin &ndash; GradeMark (Buckley and Cowap, 2013; Chew and Price, 2010). Turnitin is a software programme which helps learners and tutors to prevent plagiarism and supports best practices for the use and citation of other people&rsquo;s material (Turnitin, 2010). GradeMark enables a tutor to mark work online (through Turnitin) and easily return feedback and marks to their learners. Institutions who are using this software and tool say that learners are more likely to read and reexamine their feedback due to its convenience.</p>
<p>In order to support tutors working with international students on a pre-sessional English for Academic Purposes course in their implementation of e-feedback, I am developing a series of specific support resources (for example <em>How to</em> guides). These will help me to provide consistent support to these tutors due to the high turnover of staff to meet the demands of, in particular, summer semester courses. Moreover, as these resources will be stored in an open access repository, tutors can return to them when needed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In my multimedia conference presentation, I will briefly outline some of the issues surrounding feedback and how the implementation of e-feedback could address these concerns. Then I will show the repository that I have developed and some of the resources that I am creating.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>If people are changing the ways they engage with work then careers workers need to reform the help they offer.&nbsp; There are few twenty-first-century answers to twenty-second-century questions.</p>
<p>There's a lot to catch up on.&nbsp; Key areas of careers-work thinking need updating. &nbsp;The links to the thinking include the originals, so that you can track the background for reform.&nbsp; The new thinking is re-aligned to an increasingly commercial world, driven by a disturbingly clever information technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other links feature a widening range of new &amp; radical ideas for supporting the reform and expansion of careers work.&nbsp; All accommodate new thinking for twenty-first century reform.</p>

<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Careers work inhabits a world of accelerating change, carrying unforeseen risks, and provoking radical responses in overwhelmed locations.&nbsp; It's hardly surprising that whatever careers work does somebody finds something wrong with it - the practicalities of careers work are contested.&nbsp; Meanwhile the challenge for students and clients is be ready-for-anything.&nbsp; Careers work is confronted with the need somehow to reconcile all this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not easy.&nbsp; An understandable reaction is to wonder why the career-learning caf&eacute; makes things so complicated.&nbsp; The following five paragraphs explain why.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center">careers work needs your say about this&nbsp;<br /><br />sign up on the right and blog at the foot of the page</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><br />change</strong></p>
<p>What is going on now has effects at least as far-reaching as what was seen through the first telescope, or found in the first printed book, or experienced in the first urban factories.&nbsp; And the causes and consequences of such changes stretch from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; At each stage we can have little idea what results to expect, but we can know that nothing will be the same again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviews below ask whether careers work can survive contemporary change by doing the same again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>risk</strong></p>
<p>Contemporary change is multi-layered, mounting all its challenges at the same time.&nbsp; Commerce is more demanding, it's technologies pervade how we all live, and the cultures they nurture are deferential to neither &eacute;lite or expertise.&nbsp; All of this poses risks for careers-work credibility.&nbsp; Policy, commerce, media and anecdote throng with ready-made demands of careers-work practice, throwing it into continuous dispute. &nbsp;The causes of all this are multi-layered and their consequences seem to be irreversible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviews ask whether the risks pose existential threats to careers work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>response</strong></p>
<p>Long ago careers work gets started by concentrating on a self hopefully searching work categories for opportunities that match hopes.&nbsp; Early on just how much choice is available to that self is in doubt.&nbsp; And, soon after, the thinking acknowledges how the attachments and loyalties of social background figure in what the self does about career.&nbsp; As the navigation of that complexity and accelerating change become more demanding careers work looks to stage-by-stage learning - enabling the self to make useful sense of confusing, chaotic, and misleading experience.&nbsp; The growing need to respond to points-of-view in a social world means that recounting narrated sequences works better than scanning ready-made categories.&nbsp; It also accords with neurological findings which show how multi-layered learning so entwines feelings-and-thoughts to make a self capable of fruitful self contradiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;reviews ask how readily careers work is responding to this continuing expansion of the idea of self.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>location</strong></p>
<p>A 'self' may be understood psychologically, economically and neurologically; but a career-managing self must also be understood as socially situated.&nbsp; Work is done with and for other people. &nbsp;Careers work is adept at understanding career management in its national and global contexts.&nbsp; But causes-and-effects in village, neighbourhood and network need to be understood in these particular social-and-cultural locations - where self-awareness is infused with an awareness of other people.&nbsp; Whether in postcode, url or appointments diary, these contacts are experienced as close-up encounters with people who are readily recognisable, understood, valued - and, therefore, trusted. &nbsp;That experience is invested in locations called 'social enclaves' which frame and shape what people do - including what they do about work-life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviews point to enclaves ranging from what people might claim is 'our-cosmopolitan-set' to what people might feel is 'our-side-of-the-street'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>practicality</strong></p>
<p>Concerns for practicality appear to ask 'how well does it work?'.&nbsp; But where different enclaves attribute different meanings to different experience the question becomes 'who does it work for?'.&nbsp; And that is a question of ownership not efficiency - practice must belong to the people it serves.&nbsp; There is a wide range of expectations for what benefit careers work should bring.&nbsp; The spectrum of claimants ranges from shareholders to stakeholders. &nbsp;And the way their influences are levered is meant to determine the direction that practice takes - and sometimes it does.&nbsp; Whether voiced on behalf of nation or families there are underlying oppositions between shareholder and stakeholder voices.&nbsp; The former claim most to value economic success, competitive achievement and libertarian freedom.&nbsp; The latter claim most to value personal-and-social fulfilment, fair access to opportunity and critical independence.&nbsp; Each different position takes a different interest in what voices are heeded, what research is commissioned and therefore what practice is favoured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviews show what practice works for stakeholders - and what does not.</p>
<p>They follow below, each updating caf&eacute; material on one or more of the five challenges to contemporary careers work.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Career learning is how clients and students take on their own career management.&nbsp; The career-learning caf&eacute; is a place where their helpers take on the issues.&nbsp; And that work needs to be independent of professional and careers-service interests. &nbsp;It also needs to stand aside from political and commercial influences.&nbsp; So the caf&eacute; has no sponsors.&nbsp; It carries no advertising.&nbsp; It welcomes debate. &nbsp;And, as events unfold, it changes its thinking.&nbsp; You are invited to take part in that process.</p>
<p>This blog sets out the most recent contributions to that process.&nbsp; You can get the preceding account <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/CafCLN17.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp; But, now, both education in general and careers work in particular need to go into how technological and cultural change is raising urgent issues for voice, interests and hope.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;policy&nbsp;issues. &nbsp;The account probes the political causes of career-management effects.&nbsp; It finds that big data and sociology are at odds on that.&nbsp; It shows why the future of career needs re-envisaging. &nbsp;And it probes what, in all this, yesterday's theory has to do with tomorrow's practice.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic defenders of careers-work may not like it.&nbsp; But that's a good reason for studying it.&nbsp; A thinker's best friends are opponents, because not facing what goes wrong is a highway to failure.&nbsp; And all aspects of public-service education are facing that possibility.&nbsp; This is a sequence of signposts to new ways forward.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->new questions demand new answers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There's no shortage of reports urging the recovery of public-sector careers-work.&nbsp; The arguments are strong, but contemporary politics is not listening.&nbsp; It is the politics of individual responsibility, for achieving economic gain, by participating in a market place. &nbsp;It seeks private-sector solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a backstory.&nbsp; The global commercial-and-political consensus entertains the possibility of unfettered economic growth.&nbsp; The damaging consequences range from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; Policy characterises such damage as 'creative destruction'.&nbsp; The caf&eacute;'s evidence is that valued and viable small businesses are lost, citizenship and worker rights are undermined, careers and social services are captured, the compliant are rewarded, the critical are dismissed, and society fragments.&nbsp; It is private-sector interests that are served.&nbsp; And the trend is accelerating.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8484">education and policy - changing attitudes</a></strong><br />This is a detailed run-down on why public-sector careers-work is in such a fix.&nbsp; The article examines the interests influencing policy, the appeal to simple-mindedness, the confusion of reality with myth, the fragmentation of society, and the recognition of who is most at risk.&nbsp; It also suggests how fear can be transformed into hope. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8466">what education gets from politics</a></strong><br /> The article examines what policy does and what it fails to do for learning services.&nbsp; It separates stakeholder from shareholder interests, and it explains why it is stakeholder voice that careers work should heed.&nbsp; It wonders why so much of career talk is metaphorical, and how the images shape perceptions.&nbsp; It uses these insights to show how stakeholder interest are voiced.&nbsp; It describes how student voice is central.&nbsp; It shows how educator voice connects to students.&nbsp; And it sets out how community voice can be activated with or without policy support.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8226"><strong>is careers work distinct or extinct?</strong><br /> </a>This is a short introductory article linked to a monograph examining how public-sector careers work can thrive alongside a global multi-billion-dollar private-sector career-coaching industry.&nbsp; The article begins by facing up to the bad news - diagnosing the threat of extinction.&nbsp; It moves on to examine how careers work can make a new start.&nbsp; It points to careers-work thinking, which careers coaching has done little more than cherry-pick.&nbsp; And that gives careers work an opportunity to start again - from scratch.&nbsp; It has done it before, it can do it again.&nbsp; The article points to the opportunity to re-imagine an altogether more inclusive, substantial and distinctive service.&nbsp; It is needed to enable people to manage the precarious work-life that is becoming the norm - people ready for anything in what is partially a foreseeable and but increasingly an unforeseeable future.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">change in politics and education</a> </strong><br /> A careers work whose leadership fails to engage with change cannot survive.&nbsp; This monograph goes into detail on the realities of change.&nbsp; And it sees a way forward in a strategic repositioning of careers work in its communities.&nbsp; In particular it shows how local stakeholder interests can outflank shareholder interests.&nbsp; It examines the ways in which student-educator-community conversations can outshine any hokum.&nbsp; And it sets out how authentically credible voice will attract more constructive attention than merely plausible ploys.&nbsp; The argument is that such a re-negotiated way of working with students and clients in their communities will forge a more sustainable grounding for help.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">which way is forward for students their educators and the business-world?</a></strong><br /> Is there a business-world attempt to capture the careers-work curriculum? &nbsp;If there were, then no educator could afford to ignore it.&nbsp; This article faces the possibility, documenting how such attempts work, and pointing to the unresolvable conflicts that result.&nbsp; It cites and links to examples.&nbsp; And it documents how a prominent careers-work think-tank failed to recognise the danger.&nbsp; But the article also finds a stronger basis for partnerships between students, educators, and employers.&nbsp; And that means setting the partnership in a social-world.&nbsp; It reports how business interests are acknowledging that need.&nbsp; There are no heroes or villains here, just causes worth identifying and effects to be dealt with.&nbsp; One of the most telling conclusions is that genuine partnerships work best, not with 'how-to-do!' prescriptions, but with 'what-went-wrong?' diagnoses.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->enclaves and cities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Collections of statistics which can analyse and order wide-ranging findings are called 'big data'.&nbsp; They are commonly used to track national trends used to influence governments.&nbsp; Among their uses is the backing they give to complaints that access to services is a post-code lottery. &nbsp;And in a sense it is.&nbsp; But such massive generalisations need to assume that what applies anywhere applies everywhere.&nbsp; And, in another sense, it doesn't.</p>
<p>There are realities that big data fails to find.&nbsp; They can only be detected up-close.&nbsp; Sociological observations find that what is welcomed in one neighbourhood falls flat in another. &nbsp;Where that is so there is no 'best practice', there is what local people recognise as relevant, useful and possible where they live.&nbsp; What serves some neighbourhoods harms others.&nbsp; These are post-code realities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sociological term for such realities is 'enclaves'.&nbsp; An enclave is where what the people believe, value and expect belongs to that location, and need not belong to any other. &nbsp;Inside the enclave understanding is shaped by that experience.&nbsp; Outside it is misunderstood.&nbsp; This is not economics, it's culture.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf">enclaves and voice</a></strong><br /> This monograph examines how geography influences life chances. &nbsp;It is because what people mean by winning respect, or gaining self confidence, or experiencing freedom are understood differently in different locations.&nbsp; Each location frames its own memories, expectations &amp; voice.&nbsp; And each has its own way of realising a stake in society.&nbsp; And of not realising such a stake.&nbsp; The monograph sets this thinking in relation to an extensive range of careers-work sociology.&nbsp; And it uses that mapping as a platform for suggesting research and development which must be made to work locally.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8787">while nations fail and cities liberate it's shock that sets the agenda </a></strong><br /> The article examines a new perspective on the importance of locality.&nbsp; It reviews fast-emerging thinking on the potential dynamism of city-grounded reform.&nbsp; It looks at the differences between how nations and cities develop policies.&nbsp; It cites evidence on why nations so frequently fail and cities increasingly succeed.&nbsp; It shows how any careers-work leadership needs better to understand what's going on.&nbsp; The article probes what politicians do, why they disappoint, and how to test them for trustworthiness.&nbsp; It also shows why raising aspirations is the most demanding test for any education policy.&nbsp; But this means being open to the arresting meanings found in the resulting narratives.&nbsp; And it is that shock that opens minds to needed change.&nbsp; The article unfolds a dynamic radicalism which can carry education reform farther and faster.&nbsp; But it needs city specificity rather than national generality.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>Careers theory is an applied not a pure discipline. &nbsp;Its ideas are, at best, second-hand - imported from original sources, largely in economics and psychology.&nbsp; Early-days UK thinking drew on a handful of US adaptations of such basic research.&nbsp; If UK careers work has a distinctive position it is because it reaches beyond psychological characteristics linked to economic possibilities.&nbsp; The UK account develops an understanding of career management as grounded in economic, social and cultural conditions.&nbsp; This is a distinctively wide-ranging explanation of what people do about work.</p>
<p>Any theory is conventionally validated by the reliability of its research.&nbsp; There is an array of methodological validity tests.&nbsp; But the only test that matters asks whether the reported causes have the predicted effects.&nbsp; And that is not found on library desktops, it is found in immediate observations.&nbsp; The grounded understanding of how and why things work is called catalytic validity.</p>
<p>The importance of the test is heightened where what is found is found on-line.&nbsp; Careers workers have attempted a colonisation of the net by exporting their ready-made theory-based techniques.&nbsp; The more impressive and more worrying career sites are unhampered by any attempt at theoretical justification.</p>
<p>Careers work makes itself most useful by closing all these gaps between thinking about causes and acting on effects.&nbsp; It means never talking about research without saying something about development.&nbsp; The unified concept of research-and-development makes educators and researchers mutually-dependent partners.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497">what educators can do</a></strong><br /> The caf&eacute;'s use of the unified term 'careers work' replaces the divided term 'careers education' and 'guidance'.&nbsp; The unified term undermines the possibility of making either activity ancillary to the other.&nbsp; And could there be some residual clinging to the idea that it is guidance that holds the core careers-work expertise?&nbsp; Such a belief would locate a teaching staff's command of learning disciplines as lesser than a person's hold on a limited application.&nbsp; This article argues that contemporary conditions demand the breadth and depth of both the disciplines and the application.&nbsp; It does that by signposting the untapped relevance to students' lives of so-called 'academic' knowledge.&nbsp; This account of what educators can do identifies and links to sources on how curriculum can enable students to navigate their path through a fulfilling work-life.&nbsp; It rebalances the relationship between curriculum and guidance.&nbsp; And, while the article acknowledges that not all teachers are up to shaping curriculum to such purposes, it also shows that some are ready - and that careers work only needs some.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/NICECHit&Myth.pdf">on-line careers work as hit &amp; myth</a> </strong><br /> This fully-references journal article examines what on-line careers work does well, the 'hits', and how some sites mislead and damage life chances, with 'myths'.&nbsp; It shows how educators are well placed to enable students to deal with on-line sources.&nbsp; There are three key concepts: helping students to &lsquo;grasp&rsquo; understanding, which means enabling critical thinking; while extending student's &lsquo;reach&rsquo; means enabling students to transfer on-line finds into off-line life; and &lsquo;embodiment&rsquo; means the direct-and-personal contact needed to incorporate on-line learning into off-line identity.&nbsp; The article sets out a partnership between what can only be offered through face-to-face guidance and what can only be delivered through stage-by-stage curriculum.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6571">careers education in schools</a></strong><br /> A review, linked to its source, of one of the most influential publications on careers education.&nbsp; Written by David Andrews it sets out a past, present &amp; future for careers education in schools.&nbsp; His key distinction is seminal - it is between learning about something and learning for something.&nbsp; On the one hand students can &lsquo;learn about careers and work', on the other they can  &lsquo;learn for careers and work&rsquo;.&nbsp; The distinction deserves close attention.&nbsp; It opens possibilities for education, showing that it is about more than competing for up-coming placement, but can also explore unforeseen possibilities.&nbsp; David Andrews puts a finger on what kind of mutually-respecting partnership there can be between guidance and curriculum.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8509">what's the use of impartiality?</a></strong><br /> The article wonders whether careers work's claim to impartiality are credible.&nbsp; It finds an impressive definition in Canada: impartiality acts &lsquo;without fear, without favour and without affection&rsquo;.&nbsp; The article wonders if any Canadian or Brit can sustain the belief that careers work has been so unshakably impressive.&nbsp; It also suggests that it might not matter, because it finds, documents and links to a bigger and more independent education professionalism.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUW8V7Jupns&feature=youtu.be">theory and practice</a></strong><br /> This video shows me under interrogation concerning what a century of&nbsp;careers-work&nbsp;thinking has done for careers-work&nbsp;practice.&nbsp; My interrogator is pushy on whether the thinking is for description or for prescription. &nbsp;I'm also asked what is a theory anyway? &nbsp;I have a go at explaining why theories change.&nbsp; And I try to say why the difference between a professional's work on career-development needs to be distinguished from student's action in career-management.&nbsp; The interrogator allows me to track thinking, from career matching, into community interaction, and onto learning theory and critical thinking.&nbsp; When asked 'what next?' I say why I think it's the careers-work's uses of narrative.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6540"><strong>why we need a career-learning theory  and now?</strong><br /></a>The text of a lecture, with links to its sources, sets out operational steps to enabling learning-to-learn, as part of a programme of life-relevant learning.&nbsp; It probes what the theories say.&nbsp; It locates learning theory in the mel&eacute;e of career thinking.&nbsp; It acknowledges that the disturbances of critical thinking may be counter cultural.&nbsp; But It also illustrates how critical thinking is necessary to any conversation about working life.&nbsp; And it shows how that kind of conversation equips a student for control in the navigation of a path through working life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6973">narrative as a critical voice of experience in contemporary career management</a></strong><br /> The text of this fully-referenced and linked lecture identifies the uses of narrative in commerce and in politics.&nbsp; It argues for the various ways in which careers work can also draw on the dynamics of narrative.&nbsp; It uses 'storyboarding', a technique with a wide range of applications, as an example.&nbsp; The thinking hinges on a distinction between analysis and narrative.&nbsp; The former appears to draw on scientific expertise, the latter is a natural human approach to understanding.&nbsp; There are issues concerning reliability and practicality to resolve.&nbsp; But that resolution is handed to community stakeholders and their partners in education, rather than to remote theorists or political interests or commercial shareholders.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7681">the uses of narrative</a></strong><br /> The article sets out the material used in a research-and-development workshop on the uses of narrative.&nbsp; It examines how displaying careers-workers' expertise needs to be balanced by engaging the authority of clients' and students' experience.&nbsp; What careers workers know is modified by what students know, and narrative is the medium for recognising that reality.&nbsp; There is a link to the presentation used at the workshop as well as to the monograph which underpins the work.&nbsp; The workshop invites educators into partnerships with careers workers.&nbsp; It encourages the different members to group and regroup in their search for an approach to using narrative which promises to be useful to their work.&nbsp; They look for how they can shape these uses so that they best engage student learning.&nbsp; The assumption is that no one way of doing this will be found - indeed more than one way must be found. &nbsp;All of the issues and findings are documented and subsequently made available to the whole group.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.cegnet.co.uk/blog/peter-daws">trail-blazing thinking for UK careers work</a></strong><br /> An educator who changed the direction of my life was Peter Daws; he died this year. &nbsp;But it was Peter who laid the foundations for a distinctive UK careers work. &nbsp;Nonetheless, Peter was no out-and-out defender of careers-work institutions. &nbsp;Long ago he wrote an article on its iatrogenic effects.&nbsp; He argued that enthusiasts need to consider the possibility that careers work can harm as well as help.&nbsp; The task is not to defend what it actually done but to figure out what needs to be done - and that makes the ideas, not the institutions, the priority.&nbsp; Ideas and institutions are not the same thing.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A recurring distinction here is the Career-learning Caf&eacute;'s distinction between career development and career management. &nbsp;The former is what educators do to help. &nbsp;The latter is what students and clients do about it. &nbsp;The one rarely exactly corresponds to the other. &nbsp;In a changing world maybe we should worry when it does. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Educators and careers workers, their managers and their leaders, need to catch up with the sense student and clients are making of their experience of learning and work. &nbsp;There is no simple answer to any of the questions, neither is there is any single answer. &nbsp;But any answer must take account of the politics of whose voices are heeded, what interests are served, and who can afford to hope. &nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>This blog gets it start from a detailed account of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">change, politics &amp; education</a>.&nbsp; It's a long account because there's a lot going on - the account speaks for people establishing movements, posing questions and taking stands.&nbsp; It finds a lot of ways to value learning.</p>
<p>This argument looks to a future where, world-wide, cities are taking on education reform - and its shock that proves to be the driver.&nbsp; It examines...</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>politicos</strong> - what are politicians trying to do and why?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>motives</strong> - are we entirely fair to politicians?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>tests</strong> - how do we know what is fact, pretense, or authentic?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>perspectives</strong> - in such complexity can we find a political focus?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>narratives</strong> - what are the stories and what is their meaning?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>shocks</strong> - why would educators sieze on what is shocking?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>cities</strong>&nbsp;- what cities have that nations lack and reform needs?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is for educators looking for how reactionary shock-jocks don't have all the good moves.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>politicos</strong></p>
<p>A globally influential account of how politics works, and fail to work, is set out by Brazilian politician and philosopher&nbsp;<a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/807-politics">Roberto Mangabeira Unger</a>.&nbsp; He argues that the failure of politics, is a failure to 'provoke the imagining and realisation of new possibilities'.&nbsp; He rejects obstruction by political small-mindedness, looking for immediate answers to run-of-the-mill questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is strong stuff: reform, he says, is what we do about shock.&nbsp; We need politicians vigorous enough to live dangerously.&nbsp; And that means their stepping far enough back from the routine to be able see around conventionally shallow-and-narrow thinking. &nbsp;This sounds to me like a conversation for students and their educators to get involved in.</p>
<p>Because the fusion of political experience and philosophical challenge explains a world-wide rejection of politicians.&nbsp; They are increasingly held in contempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://theconversation.com/the-politics-of-disillusionment-can-democracy-survive-6073">The surveys</a>&nbsp;vary only on the strength of that disillusionment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the reality is complicated.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true, there are politicos who are merely angling for next-election success.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;d be surprised if you&rsquo;ve not found any trying to get something worthwhile done.&nbsp; Politicos are not all the same.&nbsp; You may even be able to think of some who come across most immediately as razzle-dazzle-&lsquo;em performers.</p>
<p>So should we be reframing politicos in at least three groups? - there are politicians, there are policy makers and there are performers.&nbsp; Students and their educators would need to tell when they are dealing with...</p>
<ol>
<li>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electioneering?</li>
<li>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; policy making?</li>
<li>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show-biz?</li>
</ol>
<p class="dent">You may well know about 4, 5 and 6 political doings.&nbsp; But you get the point - despite rumours to the contrary, politicians are not all alike.</p>
<p class="dent" align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>motives</strong></p>
<p>So can that mean that educators, like the disillusioned, dump politics?&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe, but not before we've take on-board more of what we would be turning our backs on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more complicated reality is that no politico is so narrow-and-shallow never to be able to rise above mere electioneering.&nbsp; Unless you know one.&nbsp; Politicos have it in themselves at times to be electioneers, at times reformers and at times performers. &nbsp;Their politics move back-and-forth across a spectrum and over time - she did that then, he's doing this now, but does that have to mean that we can't count on them ever to do better?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It puts political action in varying episodes rather than categories on a list.&nbsp; It would be a mistake to categorise them in a type-by-type analysis. &nbsp;They are actually characters in episode-by-episode narratives.&nbsp; Though, let's face it, some don&rsquo;t vary that much.</p>
<p>A serious policy-maker, of any political colour, can shelve electioneering in the interests of doing something worthwhile.&nbsp; Some of these are working on education.&nbsp; It is good when educators and their students are in a position to converse with them.&nbsp; They deserve to be heeded, they also need to be questioned.</p>
<p>That conversation needs a congenial space, not overlooked by political and lobbying interests.&nbsp; Claims are made for the big society.&nbsp; This is false - it is small government reducing expenditure by unloading onto volunteers.&nbsp; Education's congenial home is in civil society - a locally-supported mutuality, free of political and commercial control.&nbsp; It makes curriculum community property, not a happy hunting ground. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The story moves on.&nbsp; Some UK politicians are learning to manoeuver&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/29/nhs-hospitals-hand-over-mutuals-francis-maude">mutuality into privatisation</a>. &nbsp;While a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/01/new-breed-shareholder-activists">new breed of shareholder</a>&nbsp;is bravely positioning itself to protect civil rights. &nbsp;There's no shortage of what to hear, to probe and to narrate.&nbsp; The challenge for educators and their students is find the questions that test for what to heed.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>tests</strong></p>
<p>Politicians are displaying an interest in raising working-class aspirations.&nbsp; It's in day-by-day press-releases.&nbsp; What progressive educator could be against that?&nbsp; But, before the cheering starts, we might ask what that politics means.&nbsp; Asking 'who?' and 'why?' often suggests meaning.</p>
<p>We're talking about an economy where growth does not mean more jobs. &nbsp;And that can mean that a gain for a bright working-class family means a loss for a less-bright middle-class family.&nbsp; So here are the questions: who would want the brightest to be made ready for work? - and why would they want that?&nbsp; The 'who?' could be business, rather than a middle-class electorate.&nbsp; The 'why?' could be for economic, rather than egalitarian value. &nbsp;The meaning could be&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">curriculum capture</a>, rather than community property.&nbsp; Which would make the aspirational press-releases a handy bit of news management.</p>
<p>Well, it's possible - though you'd have to stand back a bit to see it.&nbsp; If I've stood back too far it will come out when the politicians are found to be rooting for a person's aspirations to be a good out-of-work dad?&nbsp; I'm in more trouble when policy accepts that aspirations can include quitting work to put an end to stress.&nbsp; And I will have fatally failed when politics accepts aspirations to oppose the economic growth that damages the planet, ruins neighbourhoods and humiliates the work force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A politician can win approval by promising &lsquo;justice available to all&rsquo;.&nbsp; And there are some politicians who have earned that applause.&nbsp; But there are more than enough conflicting interests in politics to allow the suspicion that &lsquo;justice&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t always mean what you think it means.&nbsp; Neither does &lsquo;available&lsquo;.&nbsp; Nor does &lsquo;to all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Aspiration is about chances in life - in the economy yes, but also protecting the family, nurturing the neighbourhood, supporting colleagues and respecting the planet.&nbsp; Some politicians live dangerously by acknowledging all of this, but some put on a performance to disguise other priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Politics is not show business and its consequences are not a lot of laughs, not in Sunderland, anyway.&nbsp; So, if anything can bring credible hope to Alice in Sunderland, it will be interrogated policy - &lsquo;heeding whose voices?&rsquo; - &lsquo;recognised by what stakeholders?&rsquo; and &lsquo;acting in whose interests?&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Was there ever a time when such an interrogation of politics raised more of an issue for what students learn and how educators help them? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>perspectives</strong></p>
<p>The contradicting, overlapping and unresolved perspectives in the political discourse might be called 'argy-bargy'. The term 'complexity' does it less than justice.&nbsp; Some punters take cover under a claim that they have found a resolution which is 'as simple as that'.&nbsp; But it never is. &nbsp;I think we may need the term 'argy-bargy' as a piece of sociological jargon.&nbsp; I've heard worse. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Contrary to the assertions of narrow-and-shallow politics, there are rarely simple solutions to complex problems - have you looked under the bonnet of your car lately?&nbsp; The twenty-first century needs better than the simple-minded politics of something-must-be-done.&nbsp; It's the equivalent of hitting the engine with a hammer - which, once-upon-a-time, occasionally worked.&nbsp; The political version is 'say anything'.&nbsp; Its press release concludes with vacuous variations on '...and this is why the government is doing what we just said we would be doing'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On-line life further complicates the complicated. &nbsp;It makes social-networking politicos much more visible - but not always more accessible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do citizens know what to heed as reliable fact, what to ignore as electioneering pretense, and what to respect as authentic perspective?</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<em>Prospect Magazine</em>&nbsp;publication,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/free-download-poverty-in-the-uk/">Poverty in the UK</a>, makes a start on mapping what all this is doing for aspiration.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how seventy pages could have packed in more argy-bargy. &nbsp;They reveal how what is supported by one constituency is opposed by another.&nbsp; They find no bases for disentangling the complexity. &nbsp;They reveal no clearly agreed action.&nbsp; In argy-bargy-land all the targets are moving targets.</p>
<p>A significant feature of contemporary policy is speed of change. &nbsp;And things changed before&nbsp;<em>Prospect&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;ink was dry.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s out-of-date on bishops and popes; and on what people do in the name of religion.&nbsp; Neither has it caught up with the economics of debt, or on-line predators, or economic myths.&nbsp; And, perhaps because Roberto Mangabeira Unger has not yet come into view it&rsquo;s well behind the curve on the philosophy of recognising a fact, uncovering a pretense, and respecting the authentic.</p>
<p>Education needs to deal with such complexity because the curriculum is not government&rsquo;s property, nor shareholders&rsquo;, nor educators&rsquo; nor even students&rsquo;.&nbsp; It is managed by stakeholders on behalf of communities.&nbsp; And it must be returned to its owners.</p>
<p>And, so, ideas like those in the&nbsp;<em>Prospect</em>&nbsp;publication will always be longer on opinion than on evidence. &nbsp;Nonetheless, It is enough, for now, that it bumps into most of the perspectives that Alice-in-Sunderland needs to probe, when she's navigating her journey through that changing complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>narratives</strong></p>
<p>A journey is a narrative.&nbsp; Narratives assemble facts, pretensions and perspectives into sequences.&nbsp; They speak of one thing leading to another.&nbsp; And so a sequence has opening scenes, leading to turning points and towards closures. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">Narrative</a>&nbsp;is our species' most-used way of making sense of experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Career narratives are populated by acquaintances, are set in locations and express interpersonal exchanges.&nbsp; But there are also meta-narratives - backstories with enough breadth to speak of national participation, in global settings, and telling of long-term causes and consequences. &nbsp;Meta-narratives stand back.</p>
<p>Few better understand the learning usefulness of narrative than educators. &nbsp;I'd urge every education outfit to work on its meta-narrative.&nbsp; The sequence tells all. &nbsp;Here's one...</p>
<p class="denthead" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>an education meta-narrative</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>unfettered growth driven by accelerating technology damages lives in ways ranging from the personal to the planetary</li>
<li>while on-line off-shoots of these technologies strengthen global commerce and weaken national governments</li>
<li>but it's true that commerce and its technologies can both help and hinder access to opportunity and the personal fulfillment it offers</li>
<li>while on-line and social life can persuade people that they are free of control and living according to how they make sense of things</li>
<li>but these attitudes work out differently in different backgrounds enough to make neighbours strangers to each other</li>
<li>so group and family allegiances fragment society meaning that what is favourable to some is unfavourable to others</li>
<li>and that shapes aspiration differently in different settings so that what is welcomed by some is rejected by others</li>
<li>but nothing is inevitable because all of this comes with people's consent and withdrawn consent changes everything</li>
</ul>
<p>A meta-narrative does for an organisation what a narrative does for a student - it sets out a reason to be.&nbsp; I'd say it's of more practical use to an education outfit than a mission statement, a vision, or a list of targets.</p>
<p>So where do students figure in meta-analyses.&nbsp; A meta-analysis is not Alice's story, it's everybody's story. &nbsp;But it speaks of where she will make her sense of how things are.&nbsp; And she will do that by assembling the story of her part in it.&nbsp; What the meta-analysis is finding in her Sunderland is as much Alice's business as it is anybody's.</p>
<p>So Alice and her educators need to hear from each other on this.&nbsp; All education outfits have enough people and material to help her figure how her story and all the stories belong to each other. &nbsp;It's where she makes her claim on her membership of that society. &nbsp;It may even enable some families to take an interest in other people's children.&nbsp; Would that count as an aspiration?</p>
<p>There's no disguising the complexity, contradiction and confusion in all of this - the term 'chaos' crops up.&nbsp; But the term is of no use to a sense-making processes embedded in shared and personal narratives. &nbsp;Indeed, seemingly chaotic complexity, contradiction and confusion are the stuff of that process - there is no useful learning that has not worked its way through the discomfort of that kind of questioning.&nbsp; Enabling such&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">critical thinking</a>&nbsp;is what education is for - enabling Alice in her society to deal with what's going on, and not to be dealt with by it.</p>
<p>A narrow-and-shallow search for simplicity ducks all this.&nbsp; It is also ducks surprise.&nbsp; And it is surprise that brings Alice to her turning points.&nbsp; All that is creative, reforming and progressive in learning comes from welcoming surprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there is shock, which is more than surprise.&nbsp; And, according to Roberto Mangabeira Unger, no surprise provokes more that is creative, reforming and progressive than shock.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>shock</strong></p>
<p>I suppose there are professionals so committed to public service-education that they believe they can count on government support - if not now, some time and indefinitely.&nbsp; Defenders of careers work are among the believers in strong argument bringing government riding to their rescue.&nbsp; But hope that a neo-liberal government will forever defend public-services is turning out to be the latest scene in a sad saga of professionals being stood up by politicians.&nbsp; It must come as a shock.</p>
<p>All the more shocking because there is, world wide, no shortage of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">evidence on public service education (p.16)</a>&nbsp;making the professionals' case.&nbsp; Public-service education helps to maintain social stability.&nbsp; The more open and responsive its institutions the greater their value to society.&nbsp; The imposition of ready-made ideas for structure, curriculum and method narrows perspectives and causes able people reluctantly to give up on public services.</p>
<p>There are profits to be made from what most people think of as public services.&nbsp; And, world-wide, national governments are not resisting privatising interests moving in on public-service institutions.&nbsp; The career-coaching industry is taking over from public-service careers work.&nbsp; In the UK education front-benchers are openly urging infusing fee-paying practices into public-service education.&nbsp; And compliant educators are taking the bait.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not always clear whether a government can't resist global economic pressures, or whether it just won't.&nbsp; Either way we are entitled to wonder whether the curriculum, which is community property, is safe in any government's hands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this shocking enough to provoke &lsquo;the imagination of new possibilities'?&nbsp; And what possibilities could there be for finding more reliable support?&nbsp; The Royal Society of Arts has a long-standing interest in education reform.&nbsp; And it is now coming up with seriously radical proposals.&nbsp; They are that city governments are better placed than national governments to offer reliable support to education.&nbsp; Is it possible that Sunderland can do more than Westminster for Alice on her journey?</p>
<p>She may see the point.&nbsp; National governments are too big to really understand local damage, and too small to resist global trends.&nbsp; Would educators ever agree that a city can be more alert to that reality, and more agile in that response?</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>cities</strong></p>
<p>The RSA is looking for what it calls&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal">The Power of Cities</a>&nbsp;(journal #3).&nbsp; Its argument starts from the fact that around half the world&rsquo;s population lives in metropolitan areas.&nbsp; The numbers are increasing &ndash; Alice&rsquo;s Sunderland is among them.</p>
<p>In cities people learn to live with other people - all kinds of other people.&nbsp; City dwellers are visible to each other - less likely to be strangers.&nbsp; Cities each have their own account of how things are changing.&nbsp; People can grasp what&rsquo;s going on well enough to suggest realistic responses.&nbsp; And a city can readily canvass more than one way of responding to those voices.&nbsp; All of this is why RSA-chief Matthew Taylor (p.5) recognises cities as a promising new setting for reforming education.</p>
<p>It's not flaky thinking.&nbsp; Political scientists (pp.20ff) find four kinds of gain.&nbsp; Cities have (1) a wide-enough range of sources to draw on, (2) a great-enough range of ideas to engage with, (3) a willingness to let go of what no longer works, and (4) an ability to make sense of what is up-close but fragmented experience.&nbsp; Cities thrive on each their own version of these complexities, potentialities, priorities, and sense-making.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">evidence on reform (pp. 21-25)</a>&nbsp;includes accounts of how, in cities, centralised uniformity is replaced by creative and reforming progression.</p>
<p>This is bigger than local government.&nbsp; Every city has a hinterland of neighbourhoods, suburbs, outlying villages and settlements.&nbsp; As populations migrate towards cities few out-lying locations are left out of urban reach.&nbsp; Most cities can reach out by encouraging networks of local and scattered stakeholder groups. &nbsp;And each outlying group can identify needs and propose action calling for city support.</p>
<p>The independence of cities can be sustained by their freedom to look outside of central government for funding.&nbsp; Economists (pp.10ff) have tracked city use of alternative funding from charitable agencies, which make grants with no arbitrary strings attached.&nbsp; Some business-world voices (pp.32ff) welcome this trend as independent of commerce and state, and fostering change which is both owned by communities and developed on a human scale.&nbsp; This is civil society.</p>
<p>The RSA reports positive results.&nbsp; Cities move quickly into locally-relevant crime-control measures, transport-management and health-and-safety programmes.&nbsp; They develop rapid responses on climate change.&nbsp; They are well placed to undermine international trafficking of both people and of drugs. &nbsp;And short lines of communication get timely responses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any policy sphere needed this kind of grasp and flexibility it is policy for education.&nbsp; Metropolitan smarts hold out hope of replacing national politicking and outflanking global power.&nbsp; But Matthew Taylor advises patience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He's right - this is a long-term trend and vulnerable to capture by market players.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/03/british-developers-new-york-manhattan">city governments already in the hands of commercial interests</a>.&nbsp; But there are also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/aug/03/rochdale-economic-recovery-challenge-hi-tech">cities whose best hope is to take control of their own future</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSA&rsquo;s proposals succeed if they liberate education reform from both global and central control.&nbsp; And that would require the consent and support of educators - well, maybe all educators is too much to hope for, but the consent and support of enough educators.&nbsp; You?&nbsp; You'd need to be shocked enough?</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />Before you make your move understand that I am not impartial about this.&nbsp; Is anybody?&nbsp; Better to declare the favouring of critical enlightenment above arbitrary power.&nbsp; That may not be impartial but neither is it arbitrary.&nbsp; It opposes regimes - the world over - which control populations with ill-founded and misleading beliefs, driving disapproving wedges between the accepted and the excluded, using the resulting conflicts as opportunities for take-over, putting the biosphere at risk, and demanding that their posturing is transmitted as education - while dismissing the rest as irrelevant or foolish.</p>
<p>And there are no clearly identifiable opposing protagonists and antagonists here.&nbsp; What we are facing is a criss-cross of causes and effects driven by conflicting interests and shifting alliances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it is not to say that, in the midst of all this, an enlightenment-driven politics has made no mistakes or committed no transgressions.&nbsp; But it is to say that there is hope in learning from both.&nbsp; You find out most about how your car works when it breaks down.</p>
<p>The issue is imperative, because the criss-cross of global change is not cyclic.&nbsp; There's will be no recovery to restore a temporariiy lost normality.&nbsp; What we are facing has been characterised as&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/blogs/jonathan-derbyshire/crisis-without-end-a-conversation-with-andrew-gamble">crises without end</a>&nbsp;- because it's hard to see how they will be resolved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Educators must be involved because the crisis is anti-educational.&nbsp; So what are they dealing with?...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>politicos</strong>&nbsp;- what are politicians trying to do and why? -&nbsp;educators need to find the other-than-self-interested&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>motives</strong>&nbsp;- are people entirely fair to politicians? -&nbsp;they need to scan political narrative for episodes revealing authentic voices</li>
<li><strong>tests</strong>&nbsp;- how do we know what is fact, pretense, or authentic? -&nbsp;educators can find talk of raising aspirations a particularly telling test of authenticity</li>
<li><strong>perspectives</strong>&nbsp;- in such complexity can we find a political focus? -&nbsp;people see curriculum as community property not government's or commerce's</li>
<li><strong>narrative</strong>&nbsp;- what are the stories and what is there meaning? -&nbsp;educators can develop their localities' backstories so that their students can extend them</li>
<li><strong>shocks</strong>&nbsp;- why would educators sieze on what is shocking? -&nbsp;they can join students in moving from shock to the imagination of new possibilities</li>
<li><strong>cities</strong>&nbsp;- what do cities have that nations lack and education reform needs? -&nbsp;educators work with cities on complex, potential, prioritised sense-making</li>
</ul>
<p>That reform can be implemented with or without government support.&nbsp; And the nations' different histories of monarchy have shaped different attitudes to centralisation.&nbsp; Some can see central government as protector.&nbsp; The Anglo-American history of monarchy has deeply embedded distrust of government.</p>
<p>The question underlying all talk of aspiration and equaiity is 'who gets to do what in this society?'. &nbsp;I find it hard to think a more important question for social policy.&nbsp; And there is no outfit better placed to take it on than an educator's.&nbsp; But the call for reforming research-and-development on education calls for more than educators' abilities, it needs their time and their courage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not to dwell on a failed past, or to take comfort in a plausible present, it is to take on a future struggle.&nbsp; Because nothing is inevitable - not for governments and cities nor for reactionaries and progressives.&nbsp; And also because, in all political systems, the withdrawal of consent changes everything.</p>
<p>But what part can Alice in Sunderland have in that movement, if her educators take no part at all?</p>

              <title>students, their educators and the business world - which way is forward?</title>

<p><strong>Bill Law<br /></strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Business-world proposals for curriculum need a long hard look.&nbsp; Educators can't afford to ignore what seem to be attempts at curriculum capture. &nbsp;The curriculum is community property - and not for takeover.</p>
<p>It's true that students need to see how they can join the labour-market, but that's not all they need to understand in order to navigate working life.&nbsp; I find some consensus about that in the proposals.&nbsp; But there are also blind alleys, and unresolved issues, and some agencies that can't deal with them - or won't.&nbsp; A prominent careers-work think-tank features in this.&nbsp; Making useful sense of it all means stepping back - to get wider perspectives on partisan interests and pervasive influences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is addressed to educators.&nbsp; I say 'educators' because students learn, not just with teachers and lecturers, but with a range of on-line and community-based helpers - including some business people.&nbsp; That works well when help is based on a credible understanding of what's going on, and what can be done about it.&nbsp; And the business world has some of that cred - but not all of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In any event, I see little point in looking for heroes to be lauded and villains to be condemned.&nbsp; Working out what to do means examining causes worth identifying and effects to be dealt with.&nbsp; This is about escaping capture and building informed, useful and genuine business-education partnerships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, here's the grit, it turns out that partnerships don't so much need 'how-to-do!' prescriptions, they need 'what-went-wrong?' diagnoses.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>finding consensus</strong></p>
<p>A reality everybody must face is successive governments embracing neo-liberal capitalism. &nbsp;Its claim is that education must support commerce by readying students for working life.&nbsp; Actually you don't need to be a capitalist to see that the more students know about working life the better.&nbsp; So there could be the makings of a consensus here.&nbsp; There's certainly enough going on in contemporary working life to attract the interested attention of educators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there's also this: the declared objectives of dominant business voices are wholly economic.&nbsp; The Educator and Employers Taskforce has sponsored a well documented programme for <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/.U5ljkBaZahM">employer engagement</a>.&nbsp; It's designed to increase students' future earning capacities.&nbsp; Anthony Mann's and Christian Percy's (2013) research for the programme looks for correlations between programme participation and subsequent earnings.&nbsp; It's an economics-driven move on curriculum.&nbsp; And capture would limit the curriculum's ability to probe the range of work-life performance, well-being and fulfilment. &nbsp;And how far any of these are found in working life - or not found. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Declarations for new programmes usually rest on a claims that the future can improve on the past. &nbsp;And there is a past.&nbsp; Most schools and colleges have set up some combination of work-related learning activities.&nbsp; They include work experience, work-place visits, enterprise activities, conversations with visitors, mentoring, cv and interview workshops, classroom discussions, careers fairs and face-to-face help.&nbsp; Students also learn from the recounting of acquaintances' work-life experience as well as in part-time and voluntary work.&nbsp; Some students are also carers.&nbsp; Informal learning gathered from their own people, and in their own neighbourhoods, can be more compelling than formal programmes.&nbsp; A good educator can enable students learn from that mix.&nbsp; And make useful sense of it - whether for approach or avoidance.</p>
<p>There's evidence that students do not generally find formal programmes useful (<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.edge.co.uk/research">YouGov, 2008</a>).&nbsp; And reported experiences of and reactions to careers work are variable.&nbsp; Anecdotal evidence is easy to dismiss, but much of it accords with careers work's struggle to deal with massive change with minimal resources (<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf">Bill Law, 2013</a>).&nbsp; It has seemed safer to try to repair, refurbish and re-assert what careers work once did.&nbsp; The trouble for careers work is that twentieth-century answers do not cope well with twenty-first century questions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This may be why the Mann-Percy proposals outflank conventional careers work, by calling for 'mainstream educational experiences'. &nbsp;But their readiness to work with curriculum-wide possibilities need to be negotiable.&nbsp; Attempts at capture will lead nowhere - there's no shortcut to consensus.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>avoiding blind alleys</strong></p>
<p>Programme correlations do not necessarily point to programme effects; intervening variables distort the numbers. For example, some reports come from students predisposed to agree, or disagree; there are some who readily adapt to dominant voices, or don't.&nbsp; Now agreeableness, argumentativeness, adaptability and bloody-mindedness are not necessarily good news, or bad.&nbsp; But, one way or another, they can each account for how much a person earns. &nbsp;Mann and Percy find other statistical distortions: wealth, ambition, gender, ethnicity and location can each account for high earnings, whatever careers-work activities a person might have engaged in.&nbsp; It's selective state schooling which turns out to be the most prevalent predictor of high earnings.&nbsp; For Mann's and Percy's purposes these are all blind alleys.</p>
<p>The Mann and Percy research is based on data, recording effects which can be counted or measured and then used to justify action.&nbsp; After taking account of possible blind alleys, their data were gathered from 169 individuals, aged between 19 and 24.&nbsp; They were asked:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how frequently they have taken part in any of the listed careers-work activities</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how much they now earn</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how useful to their future career plans they find the careers-work experiences</li>
</ol>
<p>The data appear to show that every time an activity puts a student into contact with an employer that student's earning potential is increased by &pound;900. &nbsp;The programme justification is 'learn more get more'.&nbsp; The learning is said to be like 'a penny dropping'. &nbsp;We'll come back to that.</p>
<p>For the moment it's worth setting the programme in a wider frame, and then asking the researchers...</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; are new jobs created for promising students?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; do other students earn less because participating students earn more?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; can other institutions join the scheme in order to level the field?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; is the research able to detect any hard-to-quantify features of these gains?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; can it tell if it works by actual talent or by symbolic qualification?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; any ideas about questions that this research cannot answer?</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually Mann and Percy do have such ideas - more about that later. &nbsp;But they entirely overlook the widely-discussed <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/improvement-by-degree-or-natural-talent/2014079.article">talent-or-qualification</a> issue.&nbsp; It is far from clear whether people are favoured for what they've learned, or for what their qualification signals. &nbsp;Neo-liberal policy favours signals.&nbsp; So there's a question for Mann and Percy - are they really cranking-up wages, or just making selection easier in a market-place? &nbsp;Or, maybe, neither of these? - we'll see.</p>
<p>People of 19-24 have seen enough work-life to have noticed all of these causes and effects.&nbsp; It's true, finding out what they know would need more expensive research.&nbsp; But its questions are worth posing, because there are critical zero-sum issues here.&nbsp; One person's plus can be another's minus - the one career displacing the another, but adding nothing to the economy.&nbsp; And when all institutions join the scheme to give their students a fair shot, all advantage is neutralised - and adds nothing.&nbsp; If this is so the programme is either unfair or pointless. &nbsp;Another blind alley?</p>
<p>Right now student and teacher feedback is positive.&nbsp; But gratitude for gifts is not the same as learning for life.&nbsp; Standing back for a wider perspective shows the programme to be surrounded by complexities, blind spots and distortions. &nbsp;What they need is more conversation not more counting. &nbsp;And partnership works on agreement about what questions are worth asking.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>reaching turning points</strong></p>
<p>Mann and Percy themselves pose the question.&nbsp; And there's a shift of focus&nbsp;in their answers -&nbsp;from the individual to the collective.&nbsp; The idea of social capital figures prominently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's the past that gets questioned. &nbsp;During the 1990s the <a href="http://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/publications/2010/?page=4">Confederation for British Industry</a> (CBI) published a series of good-looking-and-gratis booklets arguing that the interests of students, employers and nation are as one.&nbsp; In a decade of cheers for business all we had to do is wait for its trickled-down success.&nbsp; A lot of people are still waiting.</p>
<p>The CBI series kicked off with a call for 'a stronger partnership between business and education',&nbsp;it confidently looked for 'a skills revolution', in a 'skills decade' it bravely set out 'an employer's view of careers education and guidance', it mapped 'routes to success' documented by a 'skills passport', looking beyond careers work it set out priorities for 'the future curriculum', and it put the term 'employability' on everybody's lips.&nbsp; That zeitgeist was strong enough that the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) could be persuaded that careers education and guidance can deliver economic benefits to the nation (Chistopher Ball, 1993).&nbsp; It was all hard to ignore. &nbsp;I tried, and that was a mistake.</p>
<p>The National Institute for Careers Education and Counselling was a player then, and still is - a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nicec.org">NICEC seminar</a>&nbsp;is never a waste of time. &nbsp;Following its 1975 foundation it earned a reputation for reliable research-and-development leading to new thinking.&nbsp; Ideas were trialled and revised in conversations with practitioners at several bases throughout the UK.&nbsp; This was a pre-internet careers-worker network. &nbsp;It might have been expected to argue that careers work changes things, but it also argued that careers work itself needed to change. &nbsp;Much of its material was diagnostic for improvement. &nbsp;Prescriptions outlining careers-work achievements were more popular.&nbsp; Ready-made prescriptive messages also go down well with politicians seeking closure, speed and action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But politicians need evidence; and they contract r&amp;d outfits like NICEC, as well as think-tanks, consultancies and NGOs.&nbsp; These&nbsp;contracts&nbsp;are prestigious, and winning them can mean framing-and-shaping reports to be as welcome as possible to politicians.&nbsp; In the worst cases the evidence does not shape the conclusions, the conclusions shape the evidence. &nbsp;The risk is real, and monitored by a <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://static.squarespace.com/static/52e1f399e4b06a94c0cdaa41/t/536a108ee4b0e77a5729562c/1399459982820/How Transparent are Think Tanks (Transparify 07May2014).pdf">transparency-monitoring organisation</a>.</p>
<p>NICEC has, over time, redefined itself as a policy-research institute. &nbsp;An effect is an understandable tendency to underline the value of careers-work - its usefulness, its expertise, its impartiality and its economic significance.&nbsp; None of these claims have been convincingly substantiated.&nbsp; Though, to be fair, there are correlations between careers-work activity and student employability (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2014.918934">Anthony Richard Taylor and Tristram Hooley</a>,&nbsp;2014).&nbsp; These correlations get as close as any to validating careers-work expertise. &nbsp;But, as the task-force enquiry has illustrated, data-based correlations overlook social complexities. &nbsp;Taylor and Hooley are right to advise caution in interpreting their data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These complexities become more visible when we stand back in order to look wider.&nbsp; It reveals a zeitgeist celebrating the individual in pursuit of the economic. &nbsp;That cuture visualised a free-standing person cultivating personal qualities which can be linked to work opportunities. &nbsp;This is fit-and-match career management, simple because its conducted in a social vacuum. &nbsp;It's supporters can still be heard to declare 'it's as simple as that!'. &nbsp;As most of the sources cited here confirm, it never is.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>comfortably prescribing and uncomfortably diagnosing</strong></p>
<p>Mann and Percy have stepped back far enough to see what went wrong with the CBI campaign.&nbsp; They diagnose a lack of a social theory. &nbsp;The theory calls on the idea of <a href="http://infed.org/mobi/robert-putnam-social-capital-and-civic-community/">social capital</a> - published in&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone">Bowling Alone</a>&nbsp;</em>(Robert Putnam, 2000). &nbsp;Social capital is a currency gathered in social encounters, not in trousered cash.&nbsp; It is the social contacts a person makes.&nbsp; More contacts brings more social capital, yielding more options for action. &nbsp;Less brings less. &nbsp;Robert Putnam sees social capital as a carrier of national economic recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The explanation may still be in economics, but it's no longer individual.&nbsp; Mann and Percy find that the past failure to recognise social realities explains the failure of CBI's pursuit of employability.&nbsp; They also see the task force's present pursuit of individual earning-potential as risking failure. &nbsp;The key factor is social engagement. &nbsp;And the findings are not prescriptive of what goes right, they are diagnostic of what goes wrong.</p>
<p>Hearing somebody say what went wrong feels bad, listening to what can be done feels better.&nbsp; So what feel-good thing can we do? - better quality standards? - some 'how-to-do' guidelines? - more force from the task-force? &nbsp;- All of these? - Other? &nbsp;How would anybody know? &nbsp;Diagnosis doesn't find&nbsp;that-went-wrong-so-let's-do-this solutons, it is useful in another way, it locates the problem. &nbsp;And that calls for better than knee-jerk responses.</p>
<p>During the decades following that early-days CBI optimism, but before Mann-and-Percy provoked a rethink, we had <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/register/sure-start-childrens-centres.htm">SureStart</a>.&nbsp; In its time it provided widely-available and locally-rooted places of accessible help for young families bringing up their children.&nbsp; Each was open to the two-way links which, at their best, educators make with their communities.&nbsp; Looking out for other people's children needs a network.</p>
<p>It also needs some serious thinking.&nbsp; And SureStart thinking was at least as much diagnostic as prescriptive.&nbsp; It invited community workers and educators to find how locally-useful reform can be realised.&nbsp; Principles were set out in a government publication <a href="https://www.education.gov.uk/consultations/downloadableDocs/EveryChildMatters.pdf"><em>Every Child Matters</em></a> (DfES, 2004).&nbsp; It proved to be the first in a series on what hinders children's learning and thriving.&nbsp; It stood back enough to track causes and effects in global economic forces, the technologies they engage, and the cultural changes that brings.&nbsp; It particularly tracks the causes of damage, loss and unfairness.&nbsp; And it seeks more than economic effects - as much concerned for personal-and-social fulfilment and well-being.</p>
<p>The argument was linked to the <a href="http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/5956/">Connexions</a> programme, also set up by government.&nbsp; It still is a national network relying on the inventiveness of locally-rooted providers of career-management help.&nbsp; Help is offered in the context of each student's family and community experience.&nbsp; This socially-situated perspective means that what is happening in the career management can be understood as part of what is happening in the life. &nbsp;Most resources are to be dedicated to those most in need of help.</p>
<p>SureStart anticipated Mann's and Percy's thinking: the diagnosis of conventional careers work's failure is that it lacked scope.&nbsp; It was not in enough of a position to deliver fit-and-match career development.&nbsp; It was in no position at all to deal with global trends, or unlock national wealth. &nbsp;But, most of all, it was out-of-tune with the changing way social-and-cultural dynamics figured in student's lives. &nbsp;Careers work needed to change. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students - learning to map change, to make sense of it, and to navigate it - need the space and progression afforded by curriculum.&nbsp; The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA, 2004) proposed such a forward-looking reform of curriculum. &nbsp;It found plenty going wrong: education is too fragmented, the burden of assessment too great, and staying-on rates too low. &nbsp;Too little is done to support well-being or to evoke a love of learning &nbsp;The QCA called for blue-sky thinking on the issues.&nbsp; Part of that thinking was published as a case for Life-role Relevance in Curriculum - <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/caflirric.html">LiRRiC</a> (Bill Law, 2006).&nbsp; It came up with principles, for...&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>relating formal learning to the local-and-social world in which students informally learn for themselves</li>
<li>with enough space and time to engage students in making their own sense of that experience and its complexity</li>
<li>linking academic learning to students' present and future life-roles to signal its learning-for-living usefulness</li>
<li>embedding academic learning in a subject-with-subject coherence which makes it both memorable and motivating</li>
<li>making learning transferable by reminding students of their lives so that their lives remind them of their learning&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every academic teacher would be up for this, but not all would be needed.&nbsp; It's enough that every education outfit has enough people who can win trust, fire-up interest and have enough command of their subjects.&nbsp; Learning for living needs to attract the interested attention of the best educators.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf">record</a> (Bill Law, 2013) suggests that the careers-work leadership response to&nbsp;<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Every Child Matters</em>&nbsp;reform was conditional.&nbsp; The fast-developing technologies were seen as opportunities to disseminate existing material.&nbsp; What was thought to matter to every child was what careers work was already doing.&nbsp; There were fears of a dilution of careers-work expertise. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In any event, the reforms were overtaken by a different politics, giving careers workers more to worry about - and, I don't know, some reappraisal of how every child matters.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>questioning proposals</strong></p>
<p>The employers' task-force proposals promise a 'fully facilitated' programme, with business 'at the centre'.&nbsp; They are aimed at having students 'work-place ready', and with an 'appetite for working-life'. &nbsp;This is not an isolated initiative, there are wider resonances. &nbsp;<a href="http://lsect.co.uk/where-is-careers-advise-going.pdf">Securing our future talent</a> is an on-line argument for linking business to careers work.&nbsp; Commercial logos and endorsements lay the ground for 'good practice'. &nbsp;Similar claims are made in a business-led prediction of <a href="http://lsect.co.uk/where-is-careers-advise-going.pdf">where careers work is going</a>.&nbsp; And what about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.balticpublications.com/Changingcareers/2014issues/cc36/index.html?utm_source=Changing+Careers&utm_campaign=fbfbf4be0b-Changing_Careers_August8_7_2012&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_4733e52c05-fbfbf4be0b-412228749">changing careers</a>?&nbsp;a career-coaching site cheerfully urging job seekers to fit-and-match to an unproblematic labour market. &nbsp;Wider afield, there are reports of celebrities helping to finance business-friendly <a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6434251">agendas for education</a>.&nbsp; And then there is a politico lining up a commercialised education for <a href="http://www.policy-network.net/publications/4695/Mending-the-Fractured-Economy">mending a fractured economy</a>.&nbsp; Now, what could be wrong with any of that?&nbsp; Careers-work leaders think little, a fair few have signed up in the endorsements.</p>
<p>It's not surprising to find businesses externalising labour costs.&nbsp; Shareholders want as much as possible off their balance sheets.&nbsp; So it's worth noticing how carefully the proposals are managed. &nbsp;They feature more prominent celebrities than informed academics. &nbsp;The business-lists omit G4S, Serco, Capita, Atos, Wonga, News International and any other outfits that mislead, defraud and exploit for as long as they can get away with it. &nbsp;There are no investment-bank logos. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A careers-work leader might welcome the flattering attention. &nbsp;An educator might wonder whether the popular, plausible and rich are able to camouflage, entice and capture. &nbsp;If so, they might also wonder what they and their students can do about it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There's lot for students to wonder about: by probing inside tracks to high-status jobs, by interrogating employment and remuneration conditions, by researching the consequences of unlimited growth, by questioning how private commerce relies on public investment, by digging into the polarisation of salaries and tax avoidance, by examining the transfer of global capital, by probing the commercial canvassing of power.&nbsp; I don't know how much of what they find would be counted as 'labour-market information' in conventional careers work. &nbsp;But that's what it is.</p>
<p>Students need to talk directly with working people at all levels in a working life.&nbsp; They need to know what's happening to the small firms where most people look to get started.&nbsp; They may be allowed to know about <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jul/01/children-colliery-towns-not-learn-miners-strike">wars and royals in history</a>, but not the work-life of their families (Geoff Bright, 2013).&nbsp; They need to understand why there is decay in some local neighbourhoods and exclusion in others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's easy to wind people up with free 'information, inspiration and advice' - but is it education?&nbsp; Or is education what faces evidence, outlines argument, invites questions, acknowledges doubts, recognises points-of-view and sees alternatives? &nbsp;Because that is where nothing is ready-made, and nothing is inevitable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's no way back.&nbsp; Contemporary social attitudes are formed by different memories, attributing different meanings, stirred up by different politics.&nbsp; The conventional wisdom is that promotions have upbeat prescriptions of good-news possibilities.&nbsp; But the reality is that our students are in safer hands with educators who can enable diagnostic questioning of 'what went wrong?'&nbsp; Failure is endemic to the human condition.&nbsp; We will all fail again, but we can all learn to <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/s/samuel_beckett.html">fail better</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>working with educators</strong></p>
<p>The human condition being what it is, the more we find out the more we realise how little we know.&nbsp; There's a lot more to know about how social capital is acquired and how students can use it. &nbsp;So what can educators make of these social causes and effects?...</p>
<ul>
<li>learning is not just what students find out it's how collectively they make sense of it</li>
<li>educators need better to understand why students do what they do about learning</li>
<li>we all learn best from surprising and disturbing processes</li>
<li>career management is usefully understood not as a routine to follow but as a story to relate</li>
<li>in a changing world there's no way back but there are new ways forward</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>finding out and making sense:</strong>&nbsp; In education ideas about prescribed-knowledge and diagnosed-failure belong to a long-standing distinction between <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/moving on/cafcpibrief.pdf">content and process</a>.&nbsp; Educators and employers may grab centre-stage on the content, but when it comes to making sense of it educators have no more than bit-parts. &nbsp;Tick-box evaluations don't detect this. &nbsp;Some educators, including some from business, never know what's going on.&nbsp; Not knowing what students are making of learning is a catastrophic deficit.</p>
<p>Alert educators understand how those hidden complexities, undisclosed confusions and private conflicts are part of learning. &nbsp;But how does <em>social</em> capital come into that?&nbsp; The idea of <em>cultural</em> capital gets closer.&nbsp; The keep-it-simple brigade won't like this, but 'social' and 'cultural' are not the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>who students are and what they do:</strong>&nbsp; Words are important; and what we now know has needed that other term,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212956.Language_and_Symbolic_Power">cultural capital</a>,&nbsp;much used by sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1991).&nbsp; His research crops up a lot in career-management thinking.&nbsp; It focuses on how dispositions are acquired from upbringing, and how attitudes are differently cultivated in different communities.&nbsp; Each community forms the culture which collectively makes sense to its inhabitants.&nbsp; And that sense is reflected in habits-of-mind expressed as beliefs, values and expectations.&nbsp; Pierre Bourdieu speaks of &lsquo;habitus&rsquo; simultaneously referring to the inhabited-collective and the habits-of-mind it cultivates.&nbsp; It is both a shared identity and a group's way of seeing - the who-we-are which explains why we do what-we-do.&nbsp; Educators frequently bump into cultivated collectivities.&nbsp; And they are missing too much if they miss its range - from inner-city have-nots to cosmopolitan have-yachts.</p>
<p>There are tough questions here - less about how much capital to onload, more about how much habitus to disturb. &nbsp;It asks how much of what students bring in is it good for them to carry away? &nbsp;Working on the answer is where hidden complexities, undisclosed confusions and private conflicts become visible.</p>
<p>The process evokes a real-time real-place remembering of promises made, models admired and possibilities recognised - and all in people encountered in the group - and, with a more chance of surprise, outside.&nbsp; Career management is negotiated with, for and in response to other people.&nbsp; Those social facts call up thoughts-and-feelings ranging from loyalty to suspicion. &nbsp;And that needs to be resolved by how much to hold-onto and how much to let-go <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf">(Bill Law, 2009)</a>.</p>
<p>There's no know-more-get-more formula here.&nbsp; Pierre Bourdieu makes much of the way people talk.&nbsp; Actually, in curriculum that conversation is more likely to be soliloquy.&nbsp; But, whether in disclosure or inner-life, there are no ready-made outcomes. &nbsp;This is is disturbing. &nbsp;But if education is not going to disturb anything why would anyone bother?</p>
<p><strong>troublesome surprises: </strong>&nbsp;There's education-research evidence for the value of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pzr00">disturbing learning</a> (podcast).&nbsp; A surprising experience releases more learning potential than a routine one (Annette Karmilloff, 1992).&nbsp; The findings are documented as <a href="http://www.scaruffi.com/mind/karmilof.html">unexpected learning</a>.&nbsp; From infancy, more sustained learning has avoided fixed patterns, predictable movements and bemusing scenarios.&nbsp; Rather, it comes from being troubled, getting surprised and tracking change.&nbsp; We like the safe, the assured and the comforting, but they don't do much for learning.</p>
<p>Between them Pierre Bourdieu and Annette Karmilloff characterise learning as a shared and disturbing process in which students make sense of causes, and get a grip on effects. &nbsp;This is good news. &nbsp;Fit-and-match self-marketing works well for the plausible by deceiving the credulous.&nbsp; Troubling-and-disturbing nuisances are more likely creatively to expand business possibilities. &nbsp;They also lift education out of keep-'em-quiet child minding, don't-bother-me-routine, and jobs-worth compliance. &nbsp;It is altogether more interesting, possibly enough that fewer able teachers will quit their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>career-management narratives:</strong>&nbsp; Information about experience, habits, points-of-view, surprises and change-of-mind can readily be recounted as narrative. &nbsp;And there's a lot of interest in how to do that.&nbsp; Some want homilies - tales with ready-made meanings.&nbsp; But the educational <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">uses of narrative</a> draw on rounded stories which provoke who-what-where-when-how-why questioning. &nbsp;They do not so much whizz people along, as draw people in.&nbsp; That causes a person to wonder about more-than-one possible outcome. &nbsp;Career management could do with some more surprising closing scenes.</p>
<p>And any curriculum is packed with such narratives. &nbsp;A study of their educative use (Bill Law, 2012) shows how a rounded story does not impose meaning but invites response.&nbsp; Meaning comes not from the author's prescription but from the student's diagnosis. &nbsp;Career management becomes an open-ended story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where Mann's and Percy's penny drops. &nbsp;Narrative thinking calls it 'turning point'.&nbsp; And that moment of insight belongs to a longer, and sometimes troublesome, will-I-won't-I story.&nbsp; Much of what's important in learning about work is important because change is fraught.&nbsp; It needs educators who can work with students on questioning those hidden complexiities, undisclosed confusions and private conflicts - becoming ready for navigating change. &nbsp;And it's that process that unsticks the penny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using narrative in education is no narrowly-framed process, eliciting rushed answers, with no time to explore. &nbsp;Its processes enable students to take command of their own lives.&nbsp; That quest was never more demanding.</p>
<p><strong>new ways forward:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;There's an account of&nbsp;what the quest demands in <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">education for change</a>.&nbsp; It's a long list: resisting impulse, strengthening resilience, developing concentration, feeling pleasure, becoming mindful, being optimistic, maintaining relationships and finding meaning - all get a mention.&nbsp; The outcomes are variously claimed to win competitiveness, to support well-being, to bring fulfilment and to permit flourishing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interest in the list is growing.&nbsp; A recent source claims this search for underlying causes to be <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Flourish.html?id=ng7RJW-udoQC">unprecedented</a> in education.&nbsp; But that claim overlooks the decades-earlier examination of the many ways in which we can take care of how every child matters.</p>
<p>An attempt to reflect the breadth of thinking uses the imagery of buoyancy (Bill Law, 2014). &nbsp;It lists what is needed to stay afloat, as a precondition for navigating the surge. &nbsp;It also lists what is less frequently mentioned by others - critical thinking.&nbsp; Critical thinking is what students do to retain informed control of their own lives.&nbsp; It is how they question, interrogate and scrutinise - separating the credible from the merely plausible.</p>
<p>It's prominent in the LiRRiC proposals. &nbsp;Examples of how it can work are set out in <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">career-learning thinking</a> (Bill Law, 2010).&nbsp; It calls on what the best of educators do best. &nbsp;It enables students for engaging with the 'honesty, authenticity and modesty' which business partners claim.&nbsp; There are here the makings of a three-way partnership - giving voice to students and their families, educators and their managers, and business partners and their shareholders. &nbsp;They are all stakeholders in any partnership. &nbsp;(But let's not go into why some interests are wary of critical thinking which is capable of asking awkward questions.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critical questioning does not assume that commercial conduct is self-interested, only that some might be.&nbsp; Not that careers-work leadership is blind, only that it miscalculated risk.&nbsp; Not that all educators are ready or willing, only that enough are. &nbsp;Not that selection is corrupt, only that curriculum can be reduced to a selection process.&nbsp; Not that all fit-and-match thinking is pointless, only that it is not the whole point. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Partnership needs no heroes or villains, it needs a grasp of the causes and effects which can inform shared action. &nbsp;And so the conversation begins; and the essence of conversation is that change-of-mind is possible.&nbsp; There's no last word on education.</p>

              <title>policy, politics - and show-biz</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8544</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8544</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is an extract from a call for urgent action on <a title="part two" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8528" target="_blank">the politics of education</a>. &nbsp;It says that it's shock that stokes the energy needed to reclaim curriculum.&nbsp; Shock can live dangerously enough to step outside the shallow and narrow manipulation of opinion.&nbsp; It's small-mindedness that puts the future of education at greatest risk. &nbsp;And its big thinking that will bang on the doors of show-biz politicians.</p>
<p>The starting point is that the UK electorate mistrusts politicians - some hold them in contempt.&nbsp; Politicians may not deserve this; but surveys vary only on the extent to which they show it. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s easy enough to find politicos doing nothing more impressive than angling for power. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;d be surprised if you&rsquo;ve not also noticed some trying to get something worthwhile done. &nbsp;And then we have the razzle-dazzle-&lsquo;em performers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe we should be thinking of politicos in three groups: politicians, policy makers and performers?:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electioneering politicians</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serious policy makers</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show-biz performers.</p>
<p>But is every politico only one these?&nbsp; Surely they move there-and-back across a range of standpoints?&nbsp; That movement would make each position an episode in a story, rather than a category on a list. &nbsp;Mind you, some politicos don&rsquo;t move their standpoints very much.</p>
<p>Much of politics deserves to be dismissed.&nbsp; But the serious stuff is where policy makers genuinely try to do something worthwhile with education. &nbsp;And they deserve respect. &nbsp;They also deserve to be interrogated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take, for example, policies to &lsquo;raise aspiration&rsquo;. &nbsp;And who could be against that?&nbsp; But, before the cheering starts, let's ask the questions. &nbsp;Are we rooting for aspirations to be a good out-of-work dad?&nbsp; &nbsp;Do we favour aspirations to quit work and end that stress?&nbsp; Suppose it were an aspiration to oppose the economic growth that damages the planet and ruins the neighbourhood? &nbsp;And, even if any of these get a political cheer, who would make sure that the neglected poor are in on this aspiration thing? &nbsp;A politican can win applause for a claim to &lsquo;justice available to all&rsquo;. &nbsp;But there&rsquo;s enough argy-bargy among the sources cited here to show that &lsquo;justice&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean what you think it means.&nbsp; Neither does &lsquo;available&lsquo;.&nbsp; Nor does &lsquo;all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Policy for aspiration is about people&rsquo;s chances in life - far too important to be left to politics, and certainly not to show-bizz. &nbsp;It's not a lot of laughs, not in Sunderland, anyway. &nbsp;So, if anything can help Alice in Sunderland it will be policy&nbsp;interrogation&nbsp;- acting in whose interests? - heeding which voices? - driven by what stakeholders?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<em>Prospect Magazine</em>&nbsp;monograph,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/free-download-poverty-in-the-uk/">Poverty in the UK</a>, makes a good start on policy.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t know how its seventy pages could have packed in more disagreement about what it should be.&nbsp; Never a dull moment.</p>
<p>And, of course, things changed before&nbsp;<em>Prospect&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;ink had dried.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s out-of-date on bishops, popes and action in the name of religion.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t caught up with what&rsquo;s happening on wages, debt, predators, and economic myths. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s behind the curve on the philosophy of &lsquo;what's fact?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what's knowledge?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;what's valuable?&rsquo;. &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s longer on opinion than on evidence.</p>
<p>But it bumps into all the influences on Alice&rsquo;s life chances.&nbsp; And it surprised and provoked me into trying to get the argument for progressive education into something like a narrative form.&nbsp; A narrative needs a starting point leading to a turning point.&nbsp; Does this?</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; fast-growing technologies mean that unfettered growth is damaging the planet &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; those technologies are also strengthening commerce and weakening government  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; and they&rsquo;re bringing both help and harm to people&rsquo;s personal and social well-being</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; so people can think for themselves about what they believe, value and expect &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the thinking is located in communities that become strangers to each other &nbsp;</p>
<p>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which means that each community makes a different demand on education</p>
<p>... &nbsp; &nbsp;no resolution of this is inevitable it persists with consent and withdrawn consent changes everything&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a narrative if it sets out one thing leading to another. &nbsp;It's like a journey, moving on from the starting point and coming across the turning points. &nbsp;A turning point often surprises and sometimes shocks. &nbsp;And either can lead to unanticipated change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are surprises coming to educational professionals - especially if they are so convinced of their righteousness that they've waited for politicians to ride to their rescue. &nbsp;But they've been&nbsp;stood up, so should they withdraw consent? &nbsp;The planet has enough examples of withdrawn consent for people to wonder whether the days of national politics are numbered. &nbsp;Some of the people are brits. &nbsp;And some of those are students</p>
<p>Could it be a turning point for 'provoking the imagination and realising new possibilities'? &nbsp;And how crazy is it to wonder that, if educationist can't rely on national government, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea to look around for what might be more reliable?</p>
<p>This blog&rsquo;s evidence show that a national government stability depends on inclusive and responsive institutions.&nbsp; It documents policy which excludes open institutions. &nbsp;It quotes&nbsp;global commerce's&nbsp;unresponsive scripts for education. &nbsp;There are, of course, denials; but the evidence is that commerce is moving in on education and policy is not obstructing it.</p>
<p>And so the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) is sticking its neck out. &nbsp;It wants national governments to back off. &nbsp;National governments are too big to grasp locally variable experience, and too small to protect that experience from globally-generated damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSA looks instead to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal">The Power of Cities</a>&nbsp; (journal #3).&nbsp; For a start, it requires us to rise above the show-biz clowns in charge of some of our cities.&nbsp; The more important reality is that around half the world&rsquo;s population is living in metropolitan areas.&nbsp; Sunderland is among them.&nbsp; And the numbers are increasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cities people need to learn to live with all kinds of others. &nbsp;They are close enough to the action for people to know what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;And cities are big enough for them to find more than one way of dealing with things. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why RSA-chief Matthew Taylor (p.5) recognises cities as a promising new setting for designing education policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are significant advantages. &nbsp;A city can develop a network of local stakeholder organisations, reaching to all its neighbourhoods, outlying villages and other settlements. &nbsp;Few locations are entirely out of urban reach. &nbsp;Those that are choose to be.</p>
<p>Political scientists (pp.20ff) find four upsides. &nbsp;Cities have: (1) a wide-enough range of sources to draw upon; (2) a great-enough range of ideas to engage with; (3) a willingness to let go of what no longer works; and (4) an ability to re-integrate the insights that large-scale clumsiness has fragmented. &nbsp;They&nbsp;see cities as thriving on that scope and complexity rather than relying on the bogus persuasiveness of the narrow and shallow.</p>
<p>There are exceptions but, world-wide, cities are gathering approving coverage. &nbsp;The records show that they can act quickly on dealing with the consequences of global warming. &nbsp;They are well placed to undermine trafficking in flesh and drugs.&nbsp; They are moving into locally-relevant crime-control measures, traffic-management schemes and health-and-safety programmes. &nbsp;And no policy needs this combination of local responsiveness and wide-ranging scope than a policy for education.</p>
<p>And cities do not need to be dependent on commercial and government funding; indeed, they really need to be looking elsewhere.&nbsp; Economists (pp.10ff) have tracked city-based capacity for gaining alternative funding with fewer strings attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also business-world voices (pp.32ff) that can see how such trends are usefully getting organised independently of commerce and state.&nbsp; They are seen to be fostering change that is owned by communities and is developed on a human scale. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Metropolitan smarts seem to hold out a hope of dumping national politicking and outflanking global power. &nbsp;But Matthew Taylor advises the hopeful not to hold their breath: it&rsquo;s going to take time. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s right: there are logistical issues for anchoring civil society to metropolitan areas; market players try to eliminate competition not encourage it; and transatlantic trade agreements already protect them. &nbsp;Matthew Taylor is talking about policy, and policy takes time to be realised. &nbsp;It will need persistent stakeholder action to neutralise shareholder guile.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a long haul. &nbsp;It won&rsquo;t be completed in a parliament - I doubt in my lifetime.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m betting it will happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a narrative that is relatively easy to talk about.&nbsp; And a backstory that is not. &nbsp;Education needs the bigger story...</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; civil society is bigger than the big society  because it gets organised for coordinated action</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stakeholder&rsquo;s interests are wider than shareholder&rsquo;s  because they work with the people whose lives are affected</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; citizen voice is bigger that consumer demand  because it knows how a local past, present and future belongs to local people</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conversation is bigger than commissioned consultancy  because it voices both expertise and experience&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning for action is bigger than winning an argument  because it understands the narrative in order to change it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the backstory. &nbsp;It makes the promise possible. &nbsp;The evidence is that without informed resistance to the hegemonic power that it reveals there can be no progressive education. &nbsp;It shows that the resulting promise can be kept with or without national government support. &nbsp;It believes that nothing is inevitable and that withdrawn consent can change everything.&nbsp; It holds to the stakeholder interests and voice that can make change happen.&nbsp; And it insists that education is community property and must be returned to its owners.</p>
<p>Alice will believe none of this unless her educators do.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Bill Law<br /></strong> <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p><strong>on causes-and-effects</strong></p>
<p>Political influences have been famously characterised by a UK prime minister as &lsquo;events, dear boy, events&rsquo;.&nbsp; He also confessed that politics are &lsquo;the art of the possible&rsquo;. &nbsp;His remarks display a genteel modesty about power.&nbsp; It was long ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The political management of events and possibilities has since been seriously weakened.&nbsp; This account shows how increasingly powerful and globally-situated commercial interests besiege domestic politics.&nbsp; Part of the political response is to concede to those interests, and some of these concessions relate to education. &nbsp;But there are conflicts of interest and frustrations of intention embedded in all of this.&nbsp; The politics of all colours sometimes seem to call less on genteel modesty than on futile desperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet government needs to be able plausibly to declare that it can make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives. &nbsp;And so where it finds itself a global loser, it looks for domestic wins. &nbsp;The bigger reality is that issues for contemporary society reach from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; But plausible politics contains attention, keeping it close to home. &nbsp;And education is close to everybody&rsquo;s home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the evidence here is that education is close to home in a sense that central governments are in no position to manage.&nbsp; The dynamics&nbsp;found here&nbsp;of how people learn are precarious, complex and local.&nbsp; Their causes and effects play out differently in different neighbourhoods. &nbsp;Central claims to educational solutions can be made to sound plausible, but this evidence shows them rarely to be credible.</p>
<p>Central directives cannot accommodate local variability. &nbsp;Claims to be acting in everybody's interest do not stand up. &nbsp;This section includes evidence that what is proposed for education-for-all actually works well in some localities, but is demonstrably damaging in others.</p>
<p>Government needs a narrative for education. &nbsp;But it's the backstories, reaching wider and probing deeper, that point to hope. &nbsp;They lift education above government press releases of the narrow, the shallow and the easier to take on board. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The politically neglected particularly need the backstory if their needs are to be understood. &nbsp;And there are out-of-power and opportunistic politicians claiming to understand those neglected interest. &nbsp;The political landscape is being reshaped.</p>
<p>It would be understandable were preoccupied educators to overlook it. &nbsp;But it would be a mistake. &nbsp;Prevailing political narratives shape the future of education in the interest of the constituencies they serve. &nbsp;The backstories are essential to an understanding of how any of those futures will play out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This section revisits the art of the possible and its events, searching among backstories for leads on progressive action. &nbsp;There's no shortage of troublesome news here. &nbsp;The challenge is to make good use of bad news. &nbsp;The section searches for what educators need to understand in order to set up credible causes of needed effects which ignite realisable hope.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; causes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/freedom-for-sale-by-john-kampfner-1784894.html">Freedom for Sale</a> - think-tank based analysis, illustrating how world-wide global corporations gain control of national governments - it describes how weakened governments pump up domestic anxieties, notably concerning health and education - their promises of liberation camouflage the realities of a global capture of governments, and the services they commission</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators working with students and stakeholders need a voice speaking deeply and widely enough to tell of global pressure in terms of local needs</p>
<p><a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Restating_the_State.html?id=mbHpaptI7CwC&redir_esc=y">Restating the State</a> - collection of articles by politically-sophisticated authors, showing that repeated attempts to reduce the size of the state have failed - this is a failure of both the political right and left - the failure includes various attempts to reduce the costs of education - the collection examines the state&rsquo;s weak relationship with market forces, but concedes the relationship as necessary - however it also argues that a sustainable future needs a clear idea of what makes a public good - that means reconciling public ownership with individual rights, a renewed sense of citizenship, and a commitment to personal-and-social well being - the articles assume that solutions will be found in the generalised processes of national politics, it therefore speaks in largely abstract terms</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->education stakeholder groups are not political abstractions but&nbsp;organisers of informed&nbsp;action&nbsp;that is&nbsp;concrete, operational and locally-recognisable</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6344672">Is PISA flawed?</a> - education journalist&rsquo;s report on doubts about the international politics of education - the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has world-wide influence on the politics of education - but statisticians claim that its methodology is misleading - its host, the Organisation for Economic and Cultural development (OECD), shows more interest in setting out clear results for besieged politicians than in disentangling the complexities of education&rsquo;s causes and effects</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders can work on research data in conversation with the people in all education institutions who understand research methods</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/11/why-nations-fail-acemoglu-robinson-review">Why Nations Fail</a> - journalist&rsquo;s review of a world-wide academic explanation of why national survival depends on what kind of political institutions they set up - it characterises some political institutions as &lsquo;extractive&rsquo; because they exclude from benefit all but the few, that is themselves and their closest supporters - the explanation contrasts these with &lsquo;inclusive&rsquo; institutions, which distribute the benefits of action to the many, that is most or all of their citizens - the explanation also shows how history documents the prevalence of these competing orientations - and it shows how, over time, control of technology and science have change the balance of power in favour of exclusion - that trend is discrediting politics, undermining governments and causing political collapse</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders groups need to include both reliable expertise and authentic experience in education if they are to neutralise politicised exclusion&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/29/europe-british-politicians-stand-up-anti-eu-populism">Beware this populism sweeping across Europe</a> - journalist&rsquo;s review of professor of politics&rsquo; account of populism in politics - following the explanation of &lsquo;Why Nations Fail&rsquo;, it argues that institutions once set up for informed debate are being invaded by the political stoking of emotional heat - the resulting intentions are contained inside a narrow scope, where easy conclusions can be reached from short statements - the tactic often invites anxiety, provocation and blame - a consequences is that the extent and complexity of conflicted political realities are overlooked - the overall argument points to the dangers to democracy in seeking only for political advantage - such politics lacks the courage of leadership which brings people to where they can claim citizenship, grasp realities, find social membership, and value education</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders are at the crossroad between popular-and-plausible and informed-and-authentic but will readily recognise which way is forward</p>
<p><a href="http://www.compassonline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/COMJ501-Elephants-in-the-room-WEB.pdf">&lsquo;...where does political vitality come from?...&rsquo;</a> - collection of short articles each outlining an unresolved issue for the future of education - it examines the shifting relationships between what is happening in welfare, identity, immigration, human rights, liberty, economy and ecology - each brings changing, complicated, uncomfortable and yet vital consequences into people&rsquo;s lives - dealing with such big issues must therefore be thought of not as a destination but as a journey - and education must be a part of learning to navigate that journey</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->students with their educators and other stakeholders need a shared conversation to get big issues ready for local action</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Schumpeter.html">Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</a> - scholarly definition of the neo-lib theory which is increasingly embraced by national governments - it argues for &lsquo;creative destruction&rsquo; which allows businesses that are not growing to collapse, so that they can be replaced by enterprises seeking growth - but neo-lib thinking ignores the many ways in which a settled business can be valued by&nbsp;its community - and so its thinking demands that effective local education must be scaled up, so it become more generally and commercially marketable - but this the right-wing hijacking of a left-wing theory - creative destruction was&nbsp;first&nbsp;designed to reinvigorate useful local businesses - and that is what neo-lib economics fails to do</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->local education means by definition not to be scaled-up and its stakeholders are there to invigorate what is at its best scaled-down&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/09/labour-unite">&lsquo;...Unions aren&rsquo;t influential enough...&rsquo;</a> - economic commentator&rsquo;s argument that the voice of working people has been suppressed by a closed circle of corporate power and political establishment - the argument is that experience of work-life, and the agencies that support it, are not represented in the UK parliament - nor in any other fairly-reported part of public life</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->progressive educators are close to worker representation&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;where both are committed to people&rsquo;s fulfillment and well-being&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jul/24/charities-voluntary-sector-five-years-existence">&lsquo;...we&rsquo;ve got five years left...&rsquo;</a> - journalist&rsquo;s report of think-tank research into the future viability of &lsquo;third-sector&rsquo; charities and volunteering - the research is illustrated by anecdotal reports on what active members of society think of government appeals to &lsquo;the big society&rsquo; - those appeals are for the third sector to meet the demands that first-sector policy and second-sector commerce cannot or will not supply - this is neo-lib thinking, supportive of private-sector commerce and committed to reducing public-sector spending - but community-based educators are part of the third-sector and, as charitable or voluntary outfits, they are not commercially motivated - neither do they see themselves as agencies of the state - the title of the report reflects widespread pessimism concerning the future of genuinely charitable and voluntary helping agencies</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators and their stakeholders need to be able to call on locally-rooted third-sector outfits for their hands-on understanding of local needs&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2013/05/britain-can-prosper-understanding-how-germany-succeeds">&lsquo;...We need to rediscover the need for each other...&rsquo;</a> - professorial account of how governments can reconcile the uses of capital with the dignity of labour - it sets out thinking successfully applied in post-war Germany and originated with the help of a left-of-centre UK government - it asserts the mutual dependence of management and labour - their shared institutions continuously review and creatively replace how things are done - the account shows how management acts in agreement with labour - neo-lib economics, which is concerned only with what can be monetised, has no way of understanding such solidarity - Germany&rsquo;s difference from the UK is said to be its unwillingness to value everything only in terms of profit, whether in firms, in banks and even (by some accounts) in football clubs - that unwillingness can also be found among its educators</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->there can be no unthinking importation of culture but local stakeholders can outflank shallow and narrow thinking by finding like-minded thinking abroad</p>
<p><a href="http://www.conlaw.org/Intergenerational-II-2.htm">&lsquo;...the stewardship doctrine...&rsquo;</a> - legal account, well-linked to its sources, of the different ways that citizenship can be framed - it sets out a disagreement, deeply rooted in UK history, and having consequences for how a society educates its people - the questions are 'do we prioritise the rights of the living individual?', as does radical left-wing support for revolution - or 'have we wider commitments embraced by right-wing politics?', where membership of society is a contract with those who have gone before, those who are living now, and those who are yet to be born?</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators and their stakeholder need no cut-and-dried politics of left or right but a left-right conversation can map scope for imaginative learning</p>

<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; voices</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7207.html?wknews=05152013">&lsquo;...servant leadership...&rsquo;</a> - long-overdue business-world acknowledgement that leadership is to improve the lot of &lsquo;followers&rsquo;, not the status of &lsquo;leaders&rsquo; - it is fashionable to attribute outstanding qualities to leaders, though there is little evidence in education to support that claim &ndash; this is plea for others to be heard and heeded</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholder voice means that useful, valued and often informal leadership can be found at all hierarchical levels in education</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6343932">&lsquo;...a union for school students...&rsquo;</a> - education journalist&rsquo;s account of how students are engaging with the politics of education - there are proposals to catch up with an international trend to unionise UK secondary school students - it will form a partnership with higher education&rsquo;s National Union of Students - worker representation is a third-sector activity and part of civil society - this is a proposal for solidarity</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->students are educators&rsquo; prime stakeholders and links with their unions strengthens a shared voice for well-being and fulfillment&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.teachers.org.uk/campaigns/curriculum">&lsquo;...curriculum concerns contact...&rsquo;</a> - website, run by a teachers&rsquo; union, carrying a day-by-day social commentary for educators - visitors share information, voice concerns, compare perspectives, canvass for improvements and petition for change - the teachers&rsquo; union hosting means that the commentaries refer to professional interests - but the internet has other links drawing on research, notably the <a href="http://www.localschoolsnetwork.org.uk/about-us/">Local Schools Network</a></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholder groups gain from links to on-line education commentaries which are important channels for educator voice&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/13/sweden-social-democrats-stefan-lofven">&lsquo;...bringing the left in from the cold...'</a> - journalist&rsquo;s report of how a social-democrat movement is working with trade unions and employers - the group also has links to left-of-centre politics - the initiative is characterised as part of an international trend to restore working people&rsquo;s voice in the pursuit of human rights - these concerns link work rights with rights to education</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholder voices are stronger where they are in concert with assonant voices from elsewhere</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/30/workers-role-global-middle-class-revolutions">&lsquo;...workers role in &ldquo;middle-class&rdquo; revolutions...&rsquo;</a> - journalist&rsquo;s survey of growing international resistance to political and commercial exploitation of working people - it describes the way working people are taking initiatives which would formerly have been pursued by middle-class people trying to act in their interests - claiming the right to education is part of the process</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->comparing one culture&rsquo;s stakeholding with another's is useful because &lsquo;who knows England who only England knows&rsquo;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>on results</strong></p>
<p>Why are arguments about politics, once started, so hard to stop? &nbsp; It's not hard to see why some people get started - they're looking for the point.&nbsp; But it's not always easy to find. &nbsp;And even harder to agree what it should be.</p>
<p>Much depends on what sort of results people want to see. &nbsp;Are they a return on investment?&nbsp; Is that the tax we pay?&nbsp; Should we be getting at least as much out as we put in? &nbsp;Suppose it's more like a fee? &nbsp;Would that be like an admission charge for membership of society? &nbsp;Suppose some people can't afford it? &nbsp;Could the payoff be held in common ownership? &nbsp;Would we then let people draw on it just because they need it? &nbsp;How would we know?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And why would anyone see it one way and dismiss all others?&nbsp; Is it because, as a species, we each protect our own's best chances to survive and flourish? &nbsp;Do we extend that protection to people we like? &nbsp;And who are like us? &nbsp;They and their children? &nbsp;People we've never met.&nbsp; Other people&rsquo;s children? &nbsp;Is this getting out of hand?</p>
<p>And where do we find these people? &nbsp;Citizens on the street? &nbsp;Workers in the economy ?&nbsp; Claimants on benefits? &nbsp;Grandparents in care. &nbsp;Immigrants at the airport? &nbsp;Subjects of the queen? &nbsp;Should different roles have different rules?</p>
<p>Such talk is full of contradiction, complexity and confusion.&nbsp; Never let anybody tell you &lsquo;it&rsquo;s as simple as that!&rsquo; - they don&rsquo;t know that they don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;I suppose that's why it&rsquo;s hard to bring a political argument to an end - there&rsquo;s too much to disentangle, much of it irreconcilable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This material finds why it is that claim the political high ground. &nbsp;It also finds what kind of evidence points to that claim being a fact, or an opinion, or a lie. &nbsp;The argument here is that there is no more important task for educators than enabling that critical thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evidence stems from three question to be put to any education programme:&nbsp;</p>
<ol><ol><ol>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->interests</strong> does it serve?&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->voices</strong> should it heed? &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what can <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders</strong>&nbsp;do about it?</li>
</ol></ol></ol>
<p>The questions locate education policy where it can be done with or without the support of party politics.&nbsp; Education policy has no need to be tied to a party, but it does need to be established as a movement. &nbsp;That means taking a stand on pressures and priorities. &nbsp;Which means looking wider and deeper than where party politics is prepared to go. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outcomes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jun/30/population-growth-wipe-out-life-earth">&lsquo;Humans are the real threat&rsquo;</a> - statistical mathematician&rsquo;s estimates of what he takes to be the most pressing priorities for government action - he calculates the probabilities that what any organisation can do about anything will be curtailed most by its damaging impact on the biosphere and the diminishing availability of resources&nbsp;- in a range of issues for education, stretching from the personal to the planetary, there is no more basic voice for policy than that&nbsp;- it makes the neo-lib pursuit of unlimited growth non-viable - educators, acting independently of the interests of commerce and government, can develop informed, authentic and constructive ways of enabling students to work on these base-line realities</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators and their stakeholders can see unrestrained growth as an issue for the well-being of students&rsquo; and for the children they have and will have&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/9365">&lsquo;...Rescuing the enlightenment...&rsquo;</a> - review of a free-thinking publication, arguing that there can be no idea more significant for education than &lsquo;enlightenment&rsquo; - it originates in the politics of resisting control by crown and mitre - it values well-being and fulfillment above obedience and salvation - it is contentious, arguing that the right to independence can be curtailed by the powerful - and also that control is as much asserted by background and culture as by nation and state - wherever it focuses, the thinking is rejected by some who see it as an instrument of western intellectual imperialism - but enlightenment offers no guarantee of either truth or progress, it thrives on argument - and similar stands have, in both medieval North Africa and in modern Europe, made educational progress possible - the enlightenment&rsquo;s part in education would be to engage students in the value of critical thinking concerning control by political power, by religious belief or by monetary wealth - and it would enable students to act on that independence</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->there&rsquo;s no escape from competing claims on education so its stakeholders need to know where to take a stand</p>
<p><a href="http://helenaroy.wordpress.com/2012/10/27/review-justice-whats-the-right-thing-to-do-by-michael-sandel/">Justice - What&rsquo;s the Right Thing to Do</a> - commentator&rsquo;s review of an ethics publication arguing that values are what a society says they are - this may be because they are convenient to some dominant interest - but it may also be because they accord with what most people can recognise as, in some sense, &lsquo;good&rsquo; - goodness can attach to a handed-down belief about what is honorable, virtuous or safe - it can move into the protection of a person&rsquo;s right to act on behalf of self and those close to self, the self responsibly accepting the consequences of the resulting action - but values can move farther into the justice of protecting people&rsquo;s well-being, not because they are thought of as deserving or responsible but because they belong to a shared humanity - an outcome of education is, then, the enablement of students to take a defensible position, while offering the same respect for others as they would argue for themselves - there is no greater demand on imagination than picturing what you would wish from a society if you did not yet know where, with what, and to whom you will be born - and there are few issues which call more widely or deeply on what a good education should promise</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators and their stakeholders are part of a civil society independently voicing the values and interests of people engaging with living together</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/19/richard-hoggart-virtue-and-reward-review">Virtue and Reward</a> - journalist&rsquo;s review of a scholarly reappraisal of &lsquo;The Uses of Literacy&rsquo; - it is a book setting out learning as enabling &lsquo;working-class&rsquo; people usefully to examine critical issues - the learning does not lead to ready-made answers, nor is it materialistic, and it is worked out with others in a community, sharing a culture - the re-appraisal contrasts then with now - in contemporary cultures literacy is found to be for asserting opinion, urging &lsquo;have your say&rsquo;, &lsquo;get your message across&rsquo; and &lsquo;win attention&rsquo; - there is less interest in what &lsquo;The Uses of Literacy&rsquo; takes to be &lsquo;respectable&rsquo; or &lsquo;responsible&rsquo; thinking - and, it&rsquo;s true, such old-fashioned talk is now unlikely to impress - it should, however, be possible to ask that learning is &lsquo;informed&rsquo; and &lsquo;thought-through&rsquo;, and to hope that learning can enable people for reflective as well as assertive conversations - such a society would then be equipped to undermine what is shallow and narrow - and learning would enable people to change their minds - the review raises political issues, including the effects of close links between the US and UK - but the reappraisal doubts that the politics of education can do much about any of this - yet government needs to know how lost reflectiveness and contemporary assertiveness is reshaping what&rsquo;s left of progressive policy - the reflective uses of literacy were never more needed - and, if government can&rsquo;t see that, education&rsquo;s stakeholders can</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->a society relies for its survival on educators enabling people to deal with issues in ways that are informed and thought through</p>
<p><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/807-politics">Politics - the Central Texts</a> - annotated link to publications on progressive politics - the focus is on the neglected needs and lost potential of the excluded - the publications are broad-based, drawing on philosophy, social theory, economics, law and politics - they set out what needs to be done to raise hopes for establishing a full and democratic life - this is argued to require developing a pragmatic and comprehensive alternative to neo-liberalism - the starting point is a diagnosis of limited political imagination - it makes politics arbitrary and haphazard - but the reality need not be chaotic where members of a society can reconceive, reform and rebuild it - and&nbsp;nothing is inevitable concerning&nbsp;property, democracy and wages - but what influential interests institutionalise curtails all such possibilities, and much of human potential is being lost - these documents argue that things will remain like this until members of each society are surprised by events which provoke the imagining and realising of new possibilities - the breadth and depth of the intellectual sources informing this argument call for big thinking, developing a broader and deeper understanding of what's going on than is commonly understood</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->education thinking needs to be wide enough to connect and open enough to explain so that purposes are imaginative enough to make a difference</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>policy, politics - and show-biz &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This final section is allowing itself to be surprised by events that 'provoke the imagining and realisation of new possibilities'.&nbsp; That shock lives dangerously, by stepping outside the shallow and narrow. &nbsp;The assumption here is that it's small-mindedness which poses the bigger risk.</p>
<p>The starting point is that the UK electorate mistrusts politicians - some hold them in contempt.&nbsp; Politicians may not deserve this; but surveys vary only on the extent to which they show it. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s easy enough to find politicos doing nothing more impressive than angling for power. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;d be surprised if you&rsquo;ve not also noticed some trying to get something worthwhile done. &nbsp;And then we have the razzle-dazzle-&lsquo;em performers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe we should be thinking of politicos in three groups: politicians, policy makers and performers?:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electioneering politicians</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serious policy makers</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show-biz performers.</p>
<p>But is every politico only one these?&nbsp; Surely they move there-and-back across a range of standpoints?&nbsp; That movement would make each position an episode in a story, rather than a category on a list. &nbsp;Mind you, some politicos don&rsquo;t move their standpoints very much.</p>
<p>Much of politics deserves to be dismissed.&nbsp; But the serious stuff is where policy makers genuinely try to do something worthwhile with education. &nbsp;And they deserve respect. &nbsp;They also deserve to be interrogated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take, for example, policies to &lsquo;raise aspiration&rsquo;. &nbsp;And who could be against that?&nbsp; But, before the cheering starts, let's ask the questions. &nbsp;Are we rooting for aspirations to be a good out-of-work dad?&nbsp; &nbsp;Do we favour aspirations to quit work and end that stress?&nbsp; Suppose it were an aspiration to oppose the economic growth that damages the planet and ruins the neighbourhood? &nbsp;And, even if any of these get a political cheer, who would make sure that the neglected poor are in on this aspiration thing? &nbsp;A politican can win applause for a claim to &lsquo;justice available to all&rsquo;. &nbsp;But there&rsquo;s enough argy-bargy among the sources cited here to show that &lsquo;justice&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean what you think it means.&nbsp; Neither does &lsquo;available&lsquo;.&nbsp; Nor does &lsquo;all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Policy for aspiration is about people&rsquo;s chances in life - far too important to be left to politics, and certainly not to show-bizz. &nbsp;It's not a lot of laughs, not in Sunderland, anyway. &nbsp;So, if anything can help Alice in Sunderland it will be policy&nbsp;interrogation&nbsp;- acting in whose interests? - heeding which voices? - driven by what stakeholders?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <em>Prospect Magazine</em> monograph, <a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/free-download-poverty-in-the-uk/">Poverty in the UK</a>, makes a good start on policy.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t know how its seventy pages could have packed in more disagreement about what it should be.&nbsp; Never a dull moment.</p>
<p>And, of course, things changed before <em>Prospect&rsquo;s</em> ink had dried.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s out-of-date on bishops, popes and action in the name of religion.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t caught up with what&rsquo;s happening on wages, debt, predators, and economic myths. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s behind the curve on the philosophy of &lsquo;what's fact?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what's knowledge?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;what's valuable?&rsquo;. &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s longer on opinion than on evidence.</p>
<p>But it bumps into all the influences on Alice&rsquo;s life chances.&nbsp; And it surprised and provoked me into trying to get the argument for progressive education into something like a narrative form.&nbsp; A narrative needs a starting point leading to a turning point.&nbsp; Does this?</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; fast-growing technologies mean that unfettered growth is damaging the planet &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; those technologies are also strengthening commerce and weakening government  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; and they&rsquo;re bringing both help and harm to people&rsquo;s personal and social well-being</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; so people can think for themselves about what they believe, value and expect &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the thinking is located in communities that become strangers to each other &nbsp;</p>
<p>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which means that each community makes a different demand on education</p>
<p>... &nbsp; &nbsp;no resolution of this is inevitable it persists with consent and withdrawn consent changes everything&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a narrative if it sets out one thing leading to another. &nbsp;It's like a journey, moving on from the starting point and coming across the turning points. &nbsp;A turning point often surprises and sometimes shocks. &nbsp;And either can lead to unanticipated change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are surprises coming to educational professionals - especially if they are so convinced of their righteousness that they've waited for politicians to ride to their rescue. &nbsp;But they've been&nbsp;stood up, so should they withdraw consent? &nbsp;The planet has enough examples of withdrawn consent for people to wonder whether the days of national politics are numbered. &nbsp;Some of the people are brits. &nbsp;And some of those are students</p>
<p>Could it be a turning point for 'provoking the imagination and realising new possibilities'? &nbsp;And how crazy is it to wonder that, if educationist can't rely on national government, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea to look around for what might be more reliable?</p>
<p>This blog&rsquo;s evidence show that a national government stability depends on inclusive and responsive institutions.&nbsp; It documents policy which excludes open institutions. &nbsp;It quotes&nbsp;global commerce's&nbsp;unresponsive scripts for education. &nbsp;There are, of course, denials; but the evidence is that commerce is moving in on education and policy is not obstructing it.</p>
<p>And so the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) is sticking its neck out. &nbsp;It wants national governments to back off. &nbsp;National governments are too big to grasp locally variable experience, and too small to protect that experience from globally-generated damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSA looks instead to <a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal">The Power of Cities</a>&nbsp; (journal #3).&nbsp; For a start, it requires us to rise above the show-biz clowns in charge of some of our cities.&nbsp; The more important reality is that around half the world&rsquo;s population is living in metropolitan areas.&nbsp; Sunderland is among them.&nbsp; And the numbers are increasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cities people need to learn to live with all kinds of others. &nbsp;They are close enough to the action for people to know what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;And cities are big enough for them to find more than one way of dealing with things. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why RSA-chief Matthew Taylor (p.5) recognises cities as a promising new setting for designing education policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are significant advantages. &nbsp;A city can develop a network of local stakeholder organisations, reaching to all its neighbourhoods, outlying villages and other settlements. &nbsp;Few locations are entirely out of urban reach. &nbsp;Those that are choose to be.</p>
<p>Political scientists (pp.20ff) find four upsides. &nbsp;Cities have: (1) a wide-enough range of sources to draw upon; (2) a great-enough range of ideas to engage with; (3) a willingness to let go of what no longer works; and (4) an ability to re-integrate the insights that large-scale clumsiness has fragmented. &nbsp;They&nbsp;see cities as thriving on that scope and complexity rather than relying on the bogus persuasiveness of the narrow and shallow.</p>
<p>There are exceptions but, world-wide, cities are gathering approving coverage. &nbsp;The records show that they can act quickly on dealing with the consequences of global warming. &nbsp;They are well placed to undermine trafficking in flesh and drugs.&nbsp; They are moving into locally-relevant crime-control measures, traffic-management schemes and health-and-safety programmes. &nbsp;And no policy needs this combination of local responsiveness and wide-ranging scope than a policy for education.</p>
<p>And cities do not need to be dependent on commercial and government funding; indeed, they really need to be looking elsewhere.&nbsp; Economists (pp.10ff) have tracked city-based capacity for gaining alternative funding with fewer strings attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also business-world voices (pp.32ff) that can see how such trends are usefully getting organised independently of commerce and state.&nbsp; They are seen to be fostering change that is owned by communities and is developed on a human scale. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Metropolitan smarts seem to hold out a hope of dumping national politicking and outflanking global power. &nbsp;But Matthew Taylor advises the hopeful not to hold their breath: it&rsquo;s going to take time. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s right: there are logistical issues for anchoring civil society to metropolitan areas; market players try to eliminate competition not encourage it; and transatlantic trade agreements already protect them. &nbsp;Matthew Taylor is talking about policy, and policy takes time to be realised. &nbsp;It will need persistent stakeholder action to neutralise shareholder guile.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a long haul. &nbsp;It won&rsquo;t be completed in a parliament - I doubt in my lifetime.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m betting it will happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a narrative that is relatively easy to talk about.&nbsp; And a backstory that is not. &nbsp;Education needs the bigger story...</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; civil society is bigger than the big society  because it gets organised for coordinated action</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stakeholder&rsquo;s interests are wider than shareholder&rsquo;s  because they work with the people whose lives are affected</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; citizen voice is bigger that consumer demand  because it knows how a local past, present and future belongs to local people</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conversation is bigger than commissioned consultancy  because it voices both expertise and experience&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning for action is bigger than winning an argument  because it understands the narrative in order to change it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the backstory. &nbsp;It makes the promise possible. &nbsp;The evidence is that without informed resistance to the hegemonic power that it reveals there can be no progressive education. &nbsp;It shows that the resulting promise can be kept with or without national government support. &nbsp;It believes that nothing is inevitable and that withdrawn consent can change everything.&nbsp; It holds to the stakeholder interests and voice that can make change happen.&nbsp; And it insists that education is community property and must be returned to its owners.</p>
<p>Alice will believe none of this unless her educators do.</p>

<p class="qote" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>asked to suggest a university mission statement, a philosophy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;professor suggested &lsquo;analysing concepts for our region&rsquo; </em></p>
<p align="right">urban myth?</p>
<p>Philosophy poses the most basic of questions - &lsquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo;, &lsquo;how do we know?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;why does it matter?&rsquo;.&nbsp; They often-enough need some kind of answer before anybody does anything about something.&nbsp; The trouble is that they rarely get quick-and-easy answers; they get what the professor calls &lsquo;concepts&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My shot at seeing how educators work on such questions is set out in an <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497">account of what educators can do</a>.&nbsp; It shows a lot going on, much of it is based on little more than opinion, and all of it is fiercely contested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Politicians also lay claim to similar what-how-why questions - they need to say what they&rsquo;re doing, how they go about it, and why it&rsquo;s a good idea. &nbsp;This blog takes a look at the opportunities they grasp, the connections they make,&nbsp;the options they find, the complexities they navigate, and the gains they make.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be a quick and easy read; nobody can deal with it in one take. &nbsp;But nobody needs to.&nbsp; So scan the pages to find what your work can act on. &nbsp;Skip what looks as though it can safely be ignored.&nbsp; Then figure what sort of political support education on your particular patch needs.&nbsp; No two are the same.</p>
<p>But mark this: one of the reason why proposals don&rsquo;t deliver is because something else needed to be done first.&nbsp; And that sometimes means recovering the at-first-ignored and making it the now-reconsidered.</p>
<p>I somehow doubt that the philosophy professor&rsquo;s suggestion galvanised those bosses into reconsidering the organisation&rsquo;s mission statement.&nbsp; But educators don&rsquo;t need a script; this is a range of starting points for thought and action. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Like earlier blogs, each step suggests action by students working with their educators, and by the stakeholder groups representing local interests in education.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on mood</strong></p>
<p class="text">Phrases like &lsquo;sea-change&rsquo;, &lsquo;its time has come&rsquo;, and &lsquo;cometh the hour&rsquo; reflect a belief in the importance of political timing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an ability to shape and catch a nation&rsquo;s mood. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s still about what, how and why to make a move - but it's also about when.</p>
<p class="text">Good timing can be no more than piggyback opportunism - today&rsquo;s headline becomes tomorrow&rsquo;s &lsquo;what teachers must do!&rsquo;. &nbsp;Politicians quickly learn not to waste a crisis. &nbsp;Managed well, good timing can transform a minority myth into a majority belief. &nbsp;This is not recommending that.</p>
<p class="text">But clever political timing sees education as a happy hunting ground for claims that politics can improve electorate's lives.&nbsp; And the claims often turn out to be ignorance of what has already been tried and discredited.&nbsp; Doesn't this mean that educators must get involved in understanding the mood they're dealing with?</p>
<p class="text">But it can't mean following any socio-political consensus. &nbsp;The search here is for durable springs for sustainable action.&nbsp; Like philosophy it's searching for underlying realities, for their reliability, and for their value.&nbsp; So how do we attract a contrary mood's&nbsp;interested attention in that? &nbsp;The way things are changing makes that an interesting question for educators and their studetns - and vital to how they learn from each other.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on connections</strong></p>
<p class="intro">If other peoples' timing can damage education then educators' timing can progress it.&nbsp; Timing takes hold of connections in the comings-and-goings of what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; It may link to the unfamiliar, and that may be unwanted by some.&nbsp; An exploratory brit careers-work programme was significantly entitled &lsquo;Connexions&rsquo;.&nbsp; But influential professional voices chose to canvas its imperfections. &nbsp;Might such resistance be habits-of-mind dressed up as professionalism?</p>
<p class="intro">Changed connectedness moves professionalism on, reframing conversations about what needs to be done.&nbsp; It pushes the questions beyond &lsquo;what to do?&rsquo; and &lsquo;when to do it&rsquo;.&nbsp; They are now about &lsquo;whom do we listen to?&rsquo; and &lsquo;who do we need to listen to us?&rsquo;&nbsp; These are questions of trust.</p>
<p class="intro">The slowest reader of political economy will soon come across complaints that &lsquo;nobody&rsquo;s listening!&rsquo;. &nbsp;But is it possible to listen to everybody?&nbsp; And what if the cry &lsquo;listening is what it&rsquo;s all about!&rsquo; turns out to be the right-foot left-foot politics of the hokey-cokey? &nbsp;</p>
<p class="intro">And so connectedness is complexity: customers are not always right; deals are struck both over the counter and under it; wanting is not the same as needing; claims are not invariably justified. &nbsp;All may demand a hearing. &nbsp;But not all can be heeded; or should be.</p>
<p class="intro">Shaping the connectedness of progressive education is the work of its stakeholder groups.&nbsp; Their links range from local-and-informal communities to established-and-institutionalised organisations.&nbsp; It means not just allowing things to take their course; it needs a tough-minded deliberate positioning of communities and organisations.&nbsp; It reaches outward to the experience it serves, and inward to the expertise it offers. &nbsp;At it's best it is a nicely-timed and appropriately-connected conversation.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on complexity</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Policy should be informed by expertise.&nbsp; In education it&rsquo;s hard to avoid the claims of psychology and economics.&nbsp; But there are also the social sciences and cultural theory.&nbsp; All of this is complicated enough, but it is further complicated by doubtful claims, maneuvering&nbsp;for position and as-yet unresolved issues. &nbsp;Whatever you want to urge on politics, Google can inform a&nbsp;plausible&nbsp;but&nbsp;bogus opponent.</p>
<p class="text">The journey is as much a literary as a scientific one.&nbsp; Null hypotheses are hard to formulate; there is too much going on in learning for anybody to be able to say what is never the case.&nbsp; And, anyway, education is a search for what might be so as much as an account of what might not. &nbsp;There is no last word on education.</p>
<p class="text">For most people the need to make sense of education is urgent. &nbsp;And complexity confuses.&nbsp; This attempt to say something useful about education is not inventing complexity where there is none, it is recognising the complexity that is out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">As a species we need to make sense of things, and confusion gets in the way.&nbsp; For some it can mean caving in to what appears to be chaos.&nbsp; That surrender doesn&rsquo;t say that education can be anything we want it to be; it says that education may be nothing at all.&nbsp; Some students agree - and some of them have a point.</p>
<p class="text">But facing complexity means you're still interested, and if you&rsquo;re not confused then you&rsquo;re just not paying attention. &nbsp;Enabling people to tell the difference between which of this is plausible and which is credible is what educators do. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">And there is also this: the more anybody can take account of complexity, then the more ways that person has of figuring out what to do about it. &nbsp;It's a repertoire which can say 'if this won&rsquo;t work, what about that?'.&nbsp; Repertoires have survival value; they make complexity&nbsp;a solution,&nbsp;not a problem. &nbsp;They mean that nothing is inevitable. &nbsp;Taking some complexity on board could keep you and your work afloat. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">All of this makes complexity a starting point, not a place to jump ship.&nbsp; Actually the discomfort of saying &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know where this is going!&rsquo; energises the pursuit of meaning, and finding meaning gives purpose to action.&nbsp; But all of this comes while dealing with complexity, not while evading it.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on beliefs</strong></p>
<p class="text">Complexity and confusion are troublesome.&nbsp; Is it so hard to understand why people are more likely to spend their energy on dealing with the urgent simplicities of day-on-day survival?&nbsp; The contemplation of the complexities of long-term hope gets squeezed out. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">But education needs to be convincing about hope. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a promise, and to break it is to invite rejection.&nbsp; And that turning away can be to where people find their simplest beliefs confirmed.&nbsp; Among the simplest of beliefs are to be quick in instinct, fierce in competition, and strong in retaliation.&nbsp; They may not feel like aberrations to avoid; they&rsquo;re as likely feel like models to emulate. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s education that can feel like the aberration.</p>
<p class="text">The signs of turning away include classroom phenomena: fidgeting with devices, camouflaging comics, gazing out of windows.&nbsp; And there be media giants out there. &nbsp;Media distractions can feel more real than lessons.&nbsp; They include the adoration of the famous, which can breed dependence.&nbsp; And there is also the rage against everything else, and that can breed fear. &nbsp;The media have a strong narrative; it recounts how &lsquo;we bring you closer to what you hope for, and we defend you from what you&nbsp;hate&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">That may be the story, but there is an undeclared back-story. &nbsp;It's about people becoming believers in what politics and commerce want them to believe.&nbsp; It's the backstory which has the greater impact on their chances in life: anybody who can capture beliefs is well on the way to being in charge. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">The backstory is both complicated and inconvenient to dominant interests. &nbsp;So it gets little attention in the media. &nbsp;It can exasperate people attending to filleted versions of the news. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s not too hard to label anyone who tries to draw attention to that as the true outsiders. &nbsp;Informed educators may qualify for the label. &nbsp;Wear it with pride.</p>
<p class="text">But few educators can be surprised to find cynicism among their students.&nbsp; So, is there a way forward? &nbsp;There's no shortcut; the evidence here is that students need to be drawn into a conversation, and that it must start from what they believe. &nbsp;And that may mean working with impulse, suspicion and hate.</p>
<p class="text">So, let's ask ourselves, &lsquo;is academic learning any good at thinking about such things?' and 'do its exams measure how well people are getting on with it?&rsquo;. &nbsp; On the first, our brains discard redundant learning. &nbsp;People quickly forget what they do not get a chance to use. &nbsp;You may have noticed that. &nbsp;On the second, the disappointed are entitled to their doubts about exams.&nbsp; We have not evolved to waste energy on pointless striving. &nbsp;That too?</p>
<p class="text">All of this leaves academic educators holding an awkward student question: &lsquo;but miss, why are we doing this?&rsquo;. &nbsp;Making &lsquo;because it&rsquo;s in the exam&rsquo; the end of the matter positions educators as running the most expensive selection system ever devised.&nbsp; Worse than that, it cops out of the promise.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">The needed conversation may start cynically. &nbsp;But it's actually about finding personal fulfillment, claiming social membership, earning economic independence, and counting on planetary well-being. &nbsp;And all of that makes the interest of the &lsquo;shirkers&rsquo; and &lsquo;strivers&rsquo; as one - indivisible.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Evading the issues insulates education from all but commercial and political concerns.&nbsp; It makes learning a closed system.&nbsp; And it makes what people will wind up believing a foregone conclusion. &nbsp;Some people like that idea. &nbsp;Not progressive educators.</p>
<p class="text">Any understanding of democracy demands that everybody involved in education is clear about where it stands on working with belief. &nbsp;&lsquo;Everybody involved&rsquo; is commerce and politics, it&rsquo;s education and it&rsquo;s stakeholders, and - most of all - it's students. &nbsp;&lsquo;Being clear&rsquo; means declaring what beliefs are worth airing and whether any doubts should be suppressed.&nbsp; The more genuinely inclusive is that appeal then the stronger its narrative.&nbsp; And that narrative determines who gets into bed with whom, and who gets kicked out.</p>

<p class="qote" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>I'd rather leave the job I love than teach the government&rsquo;s propaganda</em></p>
<p class="qote" align="right"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/may/18/gove-leaving-teaching-curriculum-changes-history?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487">the secret teacher</a></p>
<p class="main">The secret teacher speaks for himself; we don't know how many other teachers and lecturers would endorse this condemnation of curriculum abuse.&nbsp; But he may well get a cheer from educators who would not call themselves &lsquo;teachers&rsquo; or &lsquo;lecturers&rsquo;.&nbsp; Education has agencies other than schools-and-colleges.&nbsp; Every locality has some such free-standing voluntary agency or social enterprise. organising help in what is called &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="main">My shot at explaining all this is set out in an earlier <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8484">account of education and policy</a>.&nbsp; I examined influences on education, the beliefs they call upon, and the risks they pose.&nbsp; Here I ask how education can respond to those pressures, by forming and activating stakeholder groups as part of civil society.&nbsp; Civil society, by definition, acts independently of commercial and political pressures.&nbsp; And stakeholder groups give voice to that independence.&nbsp; This blog asks what kind of conversations about education that independence sets up.&nbsp; It means probing what different groups want from curriculum, what commitments they each seek, and what varied outcomes they try to realise.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">The possibilities are far-reaching, especially when education for selection is set alongside education for well being.&nbsp; I look for what gets argued when education for competitiveness is set alongside education for fulfilment.&nbsp; The term &lsquo;learning-for-living&rsquo; crops up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">Curriculum development needs all the independent support it can find in schools and colleges.&nbsp; But an independent education may need civil society more than is yet obvious, even to the secret teacher and his allies.&nbsp; This blog faces the probability that education will be privatised; government is in no position to resist the leverage of commercial interests looking for new markets.&nbsp; Thinking about the future of education needs, then, to grapple with all the possibilities - if not in the public service then in civil society.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">It&rsquo;s a long-term project - bigger than a parliament.&nbsp; But Labour is calling for local communities, in partnership with businesses, to be free of arbitrary demands for unsustainable growth, and working for locally-valued outcomes.&nbsp; Those calls resonate with the forward-looking possibilities signposted here.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on priorities</strong></p>
<p class="intro">Most people can answer to their own satisfaction the question &lsquo;what&rsquo;s education for?&rsquo;.&nbsp; Everybody has some experience to go on.&nbsp; But agreement in a group is less likely - people have different experiences.&nbsp; Some claims are at such levels of word-playing malleability to be useless: talk of &lsquo;inspiration&rsquo;, &lsquo;confidence&rsquo;, &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo; and &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; can obscure more than it illuminates.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not easy for stakeholders to get enough detail on the action that such claims call for.&nbsp;&nbsp; They need to get to grips with how far such underlying priorities can stretch...</p>

<p class="sub"><strong>education, interests and 'noises-off'</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/education-a-very-short-introduction-by-gary-thomas/2002267.article">Gary Thomas</a> has distilled curriculum thinking into an hour-or-so of reading.&nbsp; He maps a six-thousand-year history of education.&nbsp; I find his account riveting - it&rsquo;s of a struggle.&nbsp; In the blue corner, an insistence on the need for formal and reliable facts.&nbsp; In the red, trust in the case for an open and progressive process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, before the bruising starts, it&rsquo;s a pointless match - have you ever come across an unprocessed fact? or a fact-free process?&nbsp; So we should be able to find a consensus.&nbsp; But it's hard to find.&nbsp; Educators and their stakeholders need to understand why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author helps by taking a close look at pragmatics, constructivism and marketisation.&nbsp; I've tried here to take account of all that.&nbsp; But I can't help noticing that the author leaves out pretty-well all of what neurology, the social sciences and cultural theory bring to an understanding of curriculum.&nbsp; So where are the clues to understanding?&nbsp; Are they in what we can see included? or in what we can't see because something's left out?&nbsp; We'd have to ask who ignores what?&nbsp; And why would they do that?</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve managed to set out here, I find it hard to lose the suspicion that this is not really a debate about ideas, it&rsquo;s about whose interests are being served.&nbsp; A content-driven factual understanding of how things are suits some, and they are glad to see it included.&nbsp; A process-driven curriculum addressed to critically scrutinising how things got this way will upset some apple-carts</p>
<p>Assembling this account of what educators can do has repeatedly come across those conflicting interests.&nbsp; Any claim made, or research reported, or policy announced stands in a frawework of one set of interests or another...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>neo-lib&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; shareholder &lt; &gt;&nbsp; cosmopolitan&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; street-level&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; civil society&nbsp; &lt; &gt; stakeholder</strong></p>
<p>It also finds the interests managed in a range of settings...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>systemic&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; institutional &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; conversational</strong></p>
<p>Some of this is &lsquo;noises-off&rsquo; - hard-to-decipher murmers of what is somewhere being canvassed, or the wangling of manoeuvres, or - eventually - what turns out to have been downright misleading.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found some of what is signposted here in the news, but the news can also be a daily parade of immediate events, short-term consequences and facile solutions.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s too little time, space or attention-span to pose uncomfortable questions - just enough for evasive answers.&nbsp; Claims to transparency are so narrowly framed as to be laughable.&nbsp; Education needs larger frameworks, demanding disclosing answers.&nbsp; Am I paranoic to sense that there's some probing to do here?</p>
<p>And probing done before any compromises are made.&nbsp; A resolution can only be negotiated from what is put on the table.&nbsp; There's no compromise with absolute beliefs.&nbsp; And compromise with partial disclosure is a commitment to little that's worth having.&nbsp; Garry Thomas&rsquo;s story is in part an account of what kind of limp resolutions are left dangling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educators are not responsible for any of this, but neither can they afford to ignore it. This account of what they can do is widely-enough framed to take account of the gamut of interests and the reach of exchanges.&nbsp; So there&rsquo;s a lot here.&nbsp; But the more educators take into consideration, the more bases for action they can search.&nbsp; And this blog has argued that the action can include root-and-branch curriculum reform - with or without the support of the 'noises off'.</p>

<p class="main" align="right"><a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-times-they-are-achangin-lyrics-bob-dylan.html">Bob Dylan</a></p>
<p class="main">This is not about acoustic and electric guitars.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more important even than that.&nbsp; This is about change - from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; And the times they are a-changin&rsquo; alright, but more than Bob knew.&nbsp; More than anybody could know.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">He held out hope for a generation; but no generation gets the last word on anything.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s little consensus on what anybody can do about what's happening.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy enough to trot out vague promises - &lsquo;more choice&rsquo; is popular, &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo; might get applause, and &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; a murmur of approval.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re pretty fluffy concepts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m suggesting that they camouflage more than they illuminate.</p>
<p class="main">I&rsquo;m thinking about the way influence is exerted, how it fragments societies, whether myths can easily posture&nbsp; as reality, why there are so few whistle blowers, and the risk all of this poses for us all.&nbsp; Growing fear needs transposing into sustainable hope.&nbsp; Educators are in no position to fix that; this is about how students will figure it for themselves.&nbsp; But this is pragmatic, it signposts what can help.</p>
<p class="main">It is a companion piece to an earlier blog - &lsquo;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8466">what education gets from politics</a>&rsquo;.&nbsp; If it feels a bit scowling-grumpy, ask yourself whether we've passed the limits of what smiley-nice can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">It's addressed to education&rsquo;s stakeholders.&nbsp; These are the families, educators, voluntary groups and social enterprises concerned for what students can gain from education.&nbsp; It signposts useful ideas, arguments and evidence.&nbsp; Each source is followed by an item for a stakeholder agenda.&nbsp; Education doesn&rsquo;t need shareholders looking for a pay-off, it needs stakeholders probing who is getting what out of education, and whether its stakeholders need to do something about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff here, because there&rsquo;s a lot going on.&nbsp; It may be best to start from the signposts which point to your work now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll update the list as things change - and they will.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll also open up other areas of enquiry.&nbsp; You can track this, and other news, by dropping in on <a title="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/billaw" target="_blank">my Twitter page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub">I don&rsquo;t want to be unfair to Bob Dylan - I don&rsquo;t dare.&nbsp; But the issues are too troublesome for uplifting inspiration.&nbsp; The point is this: stakeholders need students to get more from education than they&rsquo;ve so-far been in a position to realise.&nbsp; Boundaries need to be pushed.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on influence</strong></p>
<p class="text">Should the wishes of the rich-and-powerful prevail?&nbsp; Are the people who most need help least likely to get it?&nbsp; Should we be surprised that there is little resistance?&nbsp; Is there damage that is not being openly confronted?&nbsp; And, if any of this is so, how does education resist being bounced into compliance with it?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s evidence on all of this, showing the interplay between politics and commerce - and its consequences for how we live together.&nbsp; Or don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on fear-and-hope</strong></p>
<p class="intro">An informal but prevalent script for learning is "tell 'em, and then they&rsquo;ll know".&nbsp; It&rsquo;s implicit in media claims about what teachers should do on issues ranging from love-life to bullying.&nbsp; A more sophisticated script is that education should pass on to each new generation &lsquo;the best that has been thought and said&rsquo;.&nbsp; And that view sees students as vessels waiting to be filled with golden wonders.&nbsp; The trouble with both theories is that students come to educators already full of learning.&nbsp; It is experience-based learning, and experience can be a convincing teacher.&nbsp; So whatever is taught must find a place, if it can, among what is already believed.&nbsp; And whatever comes out of that mix will not correspond with what the media or the &eacute;lite think desirable - never exactly, sometimes not at all.&nbsp; Learning is a back-and-forth process: educators wondering what students are taking from it, students wondering what it has to do with them.&nbsp; The only sense that matters is the sense that students make of it: &lsquo;what&rsquo;s going on and what can I do about it?&rsquo;, &lsquo;is this good for me, or bad?&rsquo;, &lsquo;do I approach, or avoid?&rsquo;, &lsquo;must I fear, or can I hope?&rsquo;.</p>

<p>There is a salutary tale here.&nbsp; It concerns an aspect of education fully enmeshed in these issues.&nbsp; Careers work is about who gets to do what in society.&nbsp; It has a century of research-and-development to draw on.&nbsp; It assiduously canvasses policy support.&nbsp; The commercial world can be counted on to take an interest.&nbsp; It has had some kind of representation in most education settings.&nbsp; Yet it is struggling to secure its own future.&nbsp; What went wrong?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible that it defended a past rather than reaching for a future?&nbsp; That would explain why it ran out of recognisably useful things to say.&nbsp; That retro-thinking was framed by a psychologically-understood individualism, linked to economically-understood opportunity.&nbsp; Such simplicity was, for a time, convenient to both commerce and politics.&nbsp; But it has little place in a privatised, digitised and globalised world.&nbsp; And it has no room for the social-and-cultural complexities of a fragmented, polarised and damaged social world.&nbsp; It has produced not so much inspiration as desperation - and the confusion seems to have taken refuge in what is called &lsquo;career-chaos theory&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But students don&rsquo;t need to be told about chaos.&nbsp; It they are to find meaning and purpose in confusion, it will need more time and space where students can learn about what&rsquo;s going on, and how they can&nbsp; make sense of it.&nbsp; Little of that can be done in hit-and-run careers interviews.&nbsp; This is not to say that face-to-face help is not necessary, but it is to say that it is not sufficient.&nbsp; Careers work has never found the need to draw on the full range of processes available to a well-constructed curriculum.&nbsp; It needs to do that now.&nbsp; The whole of what is set out here need the full scope of a curriculum designed to deliver learning for living,</p>
<p>This website is about innovation.&nbsp; And innovation means the 'creative destruction' of what can no-longer help.&nbsp; Should that be a lesson to us all?</p>

              <title>what education gets from politics</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>What education needs from politics is much less control and a whole lot more imagination.&nbsp; I try here to say something useful about how things got this way.&nbsp;&nbsp; My conclusion is that the way things are demands more than an adjustment here, a fix there and a re-launch sometime.&nbsp; I'm arguing for mind-boggling imagination, in support of learning-for-living usefulness, based on root-and-branch innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>stakeholder voices</strong></p>
<p>The way things are is not a happy story.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s certainly not hard to find reports that politics is remote from experience.&nbsp; People's life-and-work is changed for the worse by politicos claiming to be acting for the better.&nbsp; The people I&rsquo;m thinking of are <em>students</em>, in the <em>communities</em> where they and their families live, with their <em>helpers</em> in schools and colleges and in civil society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All three groups are stakeholders - a term which includes shareholders, but reaches far beyond them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll talk a lot about stakeholder voice - how different people, in different groups, differently voice their interests in education.&nbsp; Each speaks with an indispensable authority of the sense they make of their experience.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s more leadership for education than its designated leaders necessarily know about.&nbsp; There are also more conflicts of interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, the most pressing need has to do with the way in which students now need to navigate a path through accelerating change - a journey too-often signposted for manipulation, deceit and predation.&nbsp; Educators cannot ignore this.&nbsp; But stakeholder responses vary: some see market opportunities, some wonder what markets do for social well-being or personal fulfilment, and some argue for critical thinking to enable students to deal with whatever is thrown at them.&nbsp; I try to show how and why politics shows an active interest in some of this, promises but does not deliver on some, and largely ignores some.&nbsp; Educators are bound to wonder why.</p>
<p class="text">There's plenty here for you to disagree with - and plenty of opportunity for you to say why.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>abstractions and metaphors</strong></p>
<p class="text">But there&rsquo;s no quick-and-easy way to talk about education.&nbsp; Attempts at any length resort to abstract nouns.&nbsp; Various stakeholders variously call on such concepts as...&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="text">&lsquo;achievement&rsquo; - &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; - &lsquo;fairness&rsquo; - &lsquo;fulfilment&rsquo; - &lsquo;progress&rsquo; - &lsquo;self&rsquo; - &lsquo;well-being&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">They&rsquo;re rarely defined in ways that everyone accepts.&nbsp; Some get regularly redefined.&nbsp; And when any of them are loaded into a conversation about accelerating change, a person can get lost.</p>
<p class="text">It gets worse.&nbsp; As politics turns to education for responses to its own problems, the list lengthens, to include for example...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;aspiration&rsquo; - &lsquo;career&rsquo; - &lsquo;choice&rsquo; - &lsquo;citizenship&rsquo; - &lsquo;employability&rsquo; - &lsquo;enterprise&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">They&rsquo;re pretty fuzzy concepts.&nbsp; Some are demonstrably meaningless.&nbsp; But some people&rsquo;s interests find one or more term compelling - even compulsory.</p>
<p class="text">When definitions don&rsquo;t help, metaphors sometimes can.&nbsp; They substitute abstract talk with talk of the tangible.&nbsp; Metaphors conjure images which can be visualised as part of a narrative.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s possible to talk of education...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote">as if it recounted <em>&lsquo;a journey&rsquo; - </em>or<em> - &lsquo;a race&rsquo; ........ </em>or as if featured<em> - &lsquo;a trap&rsquo; - </em>or<em> - &lsquo;a key&rsquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">Such images matter.&nbsp; And narrative seems to be the species&rsquo; default way of making sense of what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; It gives voice to experience...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>what did he say? - why&rsquo;s that so important to her? - </em><br /><em>what can she do about it? - he won&rsquo;t like that!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">Ministerial pronouncements and stakeholder response can be narrated in such terms.&nbsp; But education can&rsquo;t rely wholly on such talk - it can deceive.&nbsp; Thinking about education can use narrative, but it needs hard evidence.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>imagination and reality</strong></p>
<p>I've put in links to imagery that stakeholders might find worth engaging.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the first...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote">Imagine no possessions<br /> I wonder if you can<br /> No need for greed or hunger<br /> A brotherhood of man<br /> Imagine all the people sharing all the world</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text" align="right">John Lennon</p>
<p class="text">John Lennon bequeathed <a title="hope" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnlennon/imagine.html" target="_blank">hope</a>, not least to young people.&nbsp; He sees young people as moving on together, as if on a shared journey.&nbsp; He avowedly does not see them as being taken in one-by-one, as in a trap.&nbsp; He wrote this when an economy, culture and technology made such western-hemisphere hopefulness seem possible.&nbsp; Contemporary experience needs a different narrative - not least for students, with their educators, and in their communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>student voice</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">So what kind of narrative might resonate with students these days?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no hope in a story of entrapment, but it might be worth wondering about the attractions of racing imagery - where people can be winners...&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose students mainly value education to help them be winners?</li>
<li>so that they seek coaching? - to get ahead of the pack? - finding an inside track? - to the finishing line?</li>
<li>might that mean that giving way to others is believed to be weakness?</li>
<li>what about if the belief were that losers have only themselves to blame?</li>
<li>would anybody then expect that excluding others from the game is how the competitive win?</li>
</ul>
<p>Are students finding such talk any more &lsquo;hard to do&rsquo; than John Lennon found in his imagining?&nbsp; Probably not: such competitiveness is not hard to understand in a stagnant economy, where one person's gain will be another's loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a lot of issues embedded here.&nbsp; There is evidence that finishing-line learning gets lost when the race is thought to be won.&nbsp; It's learning for a result, not learning for life.&nbsp; But the beliefs, values and expectations associated with such a story can, nonetheless, embed in the culture of a school, a college or a project...</p>
<ul>
<li>how far would education be valued for the advantages it gives to &lsquo;me&rsquo;, over &lsquo;others&rsquo;?</li>
<li>are relationship increasingly valued for their &lsquo;worth-knowing&rsquo; networking?</li>
<li>and about the excluded, who do they believe they can most count on when it matters? - day-on-day? - in a crisis?</li>
<li>do such outsiders have any value to the advantaged - worth talking to? - caring about? - given as much as a nod?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">This may not be what John Lennon calls &lsquo;brotherhood&rsquo;.&nbsp; And there is some evidence of loss of eye-contact in competitive cultures.</p>
<p class="text">Such issues are not intended for research schedules; they are the makings of fuller conversations.&nbsp; For the helpers these are listening conversations - helpers need to know what sense students are making of their experience of education.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">So what about John Lennon's talk of &lsquo;possessions&rsquo;? - among which socially-isolating on-line devices may be significant...</p>
<ul>
<li>are there possessions that are more valued than, say, on-line devices? - like what?</li>
<li>do we know what such feelings-for-things are about? - fun? - contacts? - status? - what else?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s fun, would that be exciting? - impulsive? - dramatic? - extreme? - dangerous? - what more could it be?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s about contacts? - does that mean with people whom &lsquo;I like&rsquo;? - or are &lsquo;like me&rsquo;? - what&rsquo;s most to like? - what people? - found where? - valued why? - something else?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s about status, would that have anything to do with expensive stuff? - up-to-date? - looking good? - feeling good? - having followers? - what else?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s plenty of room for imagination here, but it&rsquo;s not John Lennon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If educators find any trace of a &lsquo;me-now-and-fun&rsquo; culture, is it showing any traces of what some call &lsquo;immature&rsquo; - and some would call &lsquo;infantilised&rsquo;.&nbsp; There's evidence, and not only among young people. &nbsp; A second bit of imagery:&nbsp; Aldous Huxley attributes such attitudes to most of us, in his ironic <a title="huxley" href="http://classiclit.about.com/od/bravenewworld/fr/aafpr_bravenew.htm" target="_blank">imagining</a> of a <em>Brave New World</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s no limit in such talk to why-is-this-important-to-anybody questioning.&nbsp; Neither is there any limit to what-can-anyone-do-about-it hope.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>educator voice</strong></p>
<p class="text">Inserting words like &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo;, &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; and &lsquo;choice&rsquo; into a message captures comfortable compliance.&nbsp; Other words, like &lsquo;entrap&rsquo;, &lsquo;impulse&rsquo; and &lsquo;infantilise&rsquo; feel more like uncomfortable warnings.&nbsp; But both sets of terms belong to each other, like the conflicted dialogue in a well-told story.&nbsp; Educators do not come empty handed to that conversation.&nbsp; Engaging imagery, tracking sense-making and questioning meaning - that's what educators do.&nbsp; Whatever trap-door may be slammed shut, educators can find a key.</p>
<p class="text">Maybe.&nbsp; But what if education were favourably enough disposed to government to be itself susceptible to capture?</p>
<ul>
<li>is it worth asking how favourably disposed to government educators want to be? - need to be? - are?</li>
<li>what if prevalent social attitudes are more inclined to trust governing voices?</li>
<li>and suppose governmental and commercial priorities were to become interchangeable with each other?</li>
<li>would it then be possible that terms like &lsquo;markets&rsquo;, &lsquo;brands&rsquo;, &lsquo;customers&rsquo;, and &lsquo;choice&rsquo; meld education's aims with political and business-world claims? - okay with that?</li>
<li>if these are trends, then should educators be using on-line sources to track them? - and any place for &lsquo;professional&rsquo; and &lsquo;popular&rsquo; journalism?</li>
<li>and how much of this do government&rsquo;s &lsquo;expert&rsquo; advisers illuminate? - or do its commercially-based lobbyists?</li>
<li>should any of this be a concern of educators? - and would that be only if it concerns education and assessment? - or if it affects student&rsquo;s chances in life? - or because it has broader stakeholder significance? - like what?</li>
<li>but what if such trends are already shaping stakeholders attitudes? - how, then, is any of this making learning-for-living more accessible to some people? - and less to others?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">If any part of this line of conversation seeks to maintain independence then it is more than about skills and theory, it's about ethics.&nbsp; It seems to me to be easier to make ethical claims in mission statements, than to demonstrate ethical commitments in a crisis.&nbsp; There is here the makings a conversation for educators, their mentors, trainers, associations and theorists to get into.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Because the situation is critical, an independent education service faces formidable issues...</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose educators are asked to treat what students bring out of art, work and creativity as no more than saleable commodities?</li>
<li>what if history were to become a feel-good account of a great nation&rsquo;s leaders?</li>
<li>on another tack, would it matter if an uncomprehended &lsquo;nudge&rsquo; supplants any need to understand the whys-and-wherefores for taking action? - or if back-of-the-envelope &lsquo;tips&rsquo; were thought to be enough to guide what people need to do?</li>
<li>and what if, then, any resulting self-confidence and positive thinking become the prime outcomes of education? - and if not that, something more troublesome? - like asking awkward questions - or dissent?</li>
<li>would it matter if any me-and-mine individualism tightened its hold on curriculum? - setting aside the sense people make of their experience in their neighbourhoods? - about their inheritance and upbringing? - among their connections? - and their attachments to others?</li>
<li>would psychology then be strong enough to carry the explanatory freight concerning what people learn? - and what they do with the opportunity to learn? - rather than an understanding social-and-cultural-group influences on their attitudes?</li>
<li>and would any loss of the sense of living-with-others mean that local and systemic influences on learning are down-played? - allowing the need for socially-located help to be curtailed? - and, despite policy-and-commercial claims to &lsquo;openness&rsquo;, not open to scrutiny?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">There is evidence that political pronouncements shape prevalent attitudes.&nbsp; But policy promises of &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; might not be freedom as most people think of it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s freedom for families to manoeuvre into high-rated schools, and for commerce to edge education towards privatisation.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not freedom for families get their kids into a local school which they have come to think of as theirs.&nbsp; Nor for independently-minded teachers to escape derogatory labelling.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s certainly not a freedom that John Lennon imagined &lsquo;would make the world as one&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="text">A third piece of imagery: are there any traces here of George Orwell&rsquo;s <a title="orwell" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087803" target="_blank">nightmare</a>? - take control of the language, substitute belief for reality, re-write the past.&nbsp; Evidence of social control includes reports of clever news management neutralising what policy does not want heard, smothering it with press releases which are cut-and-pasted into news items by compliant journalists.&nbsp; The media gain is to capture attention and extend the reach of advertising.&nbsp; Popular demands for satisfaction make for a headline-driven curriculum requiring educators to come up with solutions to situations where they can have no control.&nbsp; And much of each requirement is written by politicos, their advisers and lobbyists.&nbsp; Some of it is lies.</p>
<p class="text">There are different interests at stake here - different students, different educators, in different communities, differently benefit - and are differently harmed.&nbsp; But independent educators make a different use of the headline-driven curriculum: enabling a critical grasp of what the media claim, engaging students in asking on what evidence?, on behalf of whom?, and why?&nbsp; How many politicos have you noticed asking for such disturbance?</p>
<p class="text"><strong>&nbsp;<br /></strong></p>
<p class="text"><strong>community voice</strong></p>
<p class="text">The politics of promise rests on a belief in the possibility of unlimited growth.&nbsp; The evidence is that the economics of such beliefs is unreliable, especially concerning the risks and costs of collateral damage.&nbsp; And that damage ranges from the personal-and-frightening, to the planetary-and-catastrophic.&nbsp; People need a new narrative, making new sense and based on sane assumptions.</p>
<p class="text">Isn&rsquo;t that what education is for?&nbsp; It would be surprising to find that no teacher wanted to help with any part of the processes suggested here.&nbsp; A tough test is the purest of all disciplines - maths (said to be god's language).&nbsp; The most basic grasp of probability undermines the most plausible of bogus promises.&nbsp; That educator needs only to understand that this is not just about acquiring skills for an examination, it&rsquo;s about transferring learning into life.</p>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s much talk of curriculum reform; a lot of it about the needs of the economy and the usefulness to employers.&nbsp; That story needs retelling...</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose we start from an assertion that a pressing need for education is to enable the navigation of a path through change? - how far would the features of that challenge be to deal with overload? - confusion? - deception? - risk? - and what more?</li>
<li>would that mean enabling people to probe and interrogate every promise, enticement and manoeuvre?</li>
<li>and how far do they need to be able to do that as individuals? - with friends? - in groups? - on-line?</li>
<li>do current conditions need an increased ability to scrutinise, probe and interrogate persuaders? - does the phrase &lsquo;critical thinking&rsquo; convey any of this?</li>
<li>if so, is enough attention given to critical thinking in calls for reform from policy? - commerce? - the media? - religion? - if not, is it up to educators to do more about it? - and students? - and other stakeholders?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">Not all educators will say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to all of this.&nbsp; But this reform doesn&rsquo;t need all educators.&nbsp; The need is for independent educators.&nbsp; Who work with the voice of stakeholders.&nbsp; With their ethics in good order.</p>
<p class="text">The issues raised here are locally experienced, but they are globally generated.&nbsp; The planet is peppered with regimes who find it easier to nudge, entice, cajole and threaten people into compliance than to educate them into autonomy.&nbsp; They breed dependence on dominant and controlling voices.&nbsp; They feed into every conflict, fear and risk that we all face.&nbsp; It justifies violence against outsiders and breeds docility in the group.&nbsp; Educators were never more deeply and urgently implicated.&nbsp; Not least in the UK.</p>
<p>A fourth piece of imagery: John Lennon, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell each rates his mention.&nbsp; But so does Norman <a title="Jewison" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZFaPezzM4k" target="_blank">Jewison</a>, for his movie <em>Rollerball</em> (since disastrously re-made).&nbsp; It tells of a world where global commerce has become the government, shaping what people are to believe, value and expect.&nbsp; The instrument of control is the game - fast, extreme, where winning and losing has life-and-death significance - and, it seems, is impossible to resist.&nbsp; It seems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>why so much detail?</strong></p>
<p class="text">Is there too much to bother about here?&nbsp; Some say so.&nbsp; But the evidence is that the more ideas we take on board the greater our repertoire for action.&nbsp; Complexity is not necessarily the problem, in some form it's necessary to the solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is certainly much more going on in teaching-and-learning than is immediately obvious.&nbsp; Anyone who wants not to be bothered by complexity should stay away from curriculum.</p>
<p class="text">The task of reform is, then, demanding.&nbsp; A sane understand must explain uncomfortable causes-and- effects if we are effectively to deal with crises concerning our economy, technology and security.&nbsp; What we do about education is doubly important: for how educators help students now, and for how students go on learning - life-wide and life-long.</p>
<p class="text">The enemy of all this is not &lsquo;what-if&rsquo; thinking.&nbsp; The biggest danger is &lsquo;if-only&rsquo; thinking.&nbsp; I doubt that there has been a reform movement that has not been colonised by such single-minded claims...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>if only we could get back to... - if only they had more... - if only somebody would...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">It&rsquo;s people zeroing-in on the opportunity to get their idea, or interest, or programme on-board.&nbsp; The argument is, often enough, that...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>there&rsquo;s no need to start again, we know what we need to do</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">But we don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Education is in unprecedented crisis.&nbsp; The economic, technological and cultural trends move at an accelerating rate, and on a global scale.&nbsp; They are invading &nbsp;students, their helpers and their communities with what are, at times, unmanageable demands. &nbsp;We may not be able start again, but we are able to imagine - and to imagine what it would be like to start from scratch...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>knowing what we know about how things are - and if we were building a new education service - what would we build in?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">This is not colonising the action with ready-made proposals.&nbsp; But neither is it discarding all the proposals that are within reach.&nbsp; If we can agree about what&rsquo;s going on, in all its complexity, then we can trawl proposals that can be adapted to those needs.&nbsp; And the more we&rsquo;ve got to go on, the better.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">This innovative strategy does not start with provision but with need.&nbsp; The perspectives which inform the process are not from institutions but from more widely-rooted stakeholders.&nbsp; It is, then, a process of letting go and holding on.&nbsp; It discards what is no longer appropriate, useful or tenable.&nbsp; And it turns to what is.&nbsp; This is what needs mind-boggling imagination, enables learning-for-living usefulness, and calls on root-and-branch innovation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve framed the issues outside dominant interests.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s why you can reframe them.&nbsp; I want you to.&nbsp; There are some issues on which I would be pleased to be proved wrong.</p>
<p>I'll follow this up shortly, with the ideas, argument and evidence that inform what I've set out above.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m collating it now, and a link will appear here.&nbsp; It will go into detail on both...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>what does education get from politics?<br /></strong>and<br /><strong>what does education need from politics?</strong></p>
<p class="text">It will cover...</p>
<ul>
<li>what's to be done about competitiveness - commerce - fragmentation - blame - values - infantilism - exclusion - fear-and-hope</li>
<li>how educators can be ready - getting results - working with stakeholders - re-structuring activity</li>
<li>what politics can do in localities - seizing opportunities - re-connecting to localities - facing complexities - becoming authentic - being fair - acknowledging failure - re-thinking bases - offering leadership</li>

              <title>David Andrews on Careers Education in Schools</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com" target="_blank">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>A question...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;what is the relationship between careers education and guidance?&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Some terms, like &lsquo;CEIAG&rsquo;, suggest - in one breath - a unity.&nbsp; Such talk implies that&nbsp; 'careers education' and 'information-advice-and-guidance' share expertise, and call for the same qualifications. The one might even be thought to contain the other - a dominant partner, and its ancillary support.&nbsp; A consequence could be that anybody with a lot to say about &lsquo;IAG&rsquo; would not know that there was much more to say about &lsquo;CE&rsquo;.&nbsp; They would be unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>We are at a stage in the history of careers work where that relationship needs to be sorted.&nbsp; And David Andrews helps to explain why it hasn&rsquo;t been - and helps us to see how it can be.&nbsp; The author is well positioned to do this.&nbsp; Like few others - Anthony Barnes is among the few - David's own career includes year-on-year experience of listening to students, designing programmes, developing material and managing classrooms.&nbsp; You need that kind of grasp on the reality to make sense of careers education's tangled history.&nbsp; His chronology sets out the twists-and-turns - from its twentieth-century hope, to its twenty-first-century condition.</p>
<p>The book treats careers education as having a distinct professionalism.&nbsp; At its best careers education has its own...</p>
<ul>
<li>rationale - its justifications for existence are its own</li>
<li>objectives - it enables a distinctive range of learning outcomes</li>
<li>methods - it characteristically manages stage-by-stage learning</li>
<li>research - it rests on its own assembly of enquiries into how learning works</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that so many prominent commentators miss so much of this.&nbsp; There is a lot to know - and more to know that we don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>the history</strong></p>
<p>This is how David Andrews' exhaustive, closely-observed and well-organised gathering of information helps.&nbsp; There are run-downs on government reports, significant organisations and influential voices.&nbsp; They form a chronicle of the coming-and-going of objectives, frameworks, roles, training, material, standards, requirements, monitoring and evaluation.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s riveting stuff - some policy initiatives coming two-at-a-time and pointing in different directions.&nbsp; Expectations range over national economic performance, across equal opportunities, and into personal-and-social well-being.&nbsp; Some initiatives originate in the public sector, yet others as private enterprises.&nbsp; The account sets out careers education&rsquo;s relationships with parallel initiatives - such as Personal Social and Health Education, the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative, the National Curriculum, Education for Citizenship, and Connexions.</p>
<p>The author acknowledges parallel work.&nbsp; And it's true that there have been other chronologies setting out the story of careers services, though careers education barely gets a mention.&nbsp; And there have been other examinations of the contested pressures on careers education, but with too little on the changing contexts in which it sinks or swims.&nbsp; It's also true that there are other initiatives which share careers education&rsquo;s commitment to life-relevant learning, but they often have more to say about how to do it than whether it&rsquo;s worth doing.</p>
<p><em>Careers Education in Schools</em> shows the work is bounced around by pressure, repositioning and compromise.&nbsp; It documents the results as being at times integrated, at times competitive, and at times splintered.&nbsp; It is merciless in its scrutiny of both the events and the wider contexts in which careers education flourishes and founders.&nbsp; Both its devils and its angels are in that detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>a critical examination</strong></p>
<p>No aspect of careers work can be understood except in relation to its changing economic, cultural and political contexts.&nbsp; Every time anyone opens their mouth to speak about any aspect of careers work some allusion to that context comes out.&nbsp; Those conversations are with students, their families, politicians, colleagues, programme managers, business people, theorists and philosophers.&nbsp; This critical examination signposts the issues.&nbsp; They are for...</p>
<ul>
<li>stakeholders - who has an interest in careers education?</li>
<li>interests -&nbsp; what is it that they seek from it?</li>
<li>dissonance - can careers education hope to deliver on everything?</li>
<li>credibility - what is supported by convincing evidence?</li>
<li>ideology - with what underlying beliefs about what is valuable?</li>
<li>dominance - what are the most influential interests?</li>
<li>fairness - how do they affect those who most need career help?</li>
<li>location - where in an overall programme can such learning be realised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Understood like this careers education is not merely a welfare service in schools - handed to some kindly person who happens to be available.&nbsp; And this book's middle section provokes more demanding questions concerning...</p>
<p align="center"><em>...who gets to do what?</em><em><br />...on whose say-so?<br />...in whose interests?</em></p>
<p>They are not questions about how careers education can be saved, but an underlying search for what is worth saving.&nbsp; There shouldn't be many thinking teachers who would not be interested in that.</p>
<p>And I doubt that there are many aspects of schooling which are more exposed to such probing.&nbsp; Careers education must be among the most researched, scrutinised and manipulated in any curriculum.&nbsp; Whatever attitude other thinking teachers may take, careers educators would be crazy not to learn from that experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>looking to the future</strong></p>
<p>This third section sets up a distinction between...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;learning <strong>about</strong></em><em> careers and work&rsquo;<br />and<br />&lsquo;learning <strong>for</strong></em><em> careers and work&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>It deserves close attention.&nbsp; It raises questions about the value to students of not just competing for up-coming placement but also of exploring for unforeseen possibilities.&nbsp; And this helps to sort out where each of these most belong in the IAG-CE tangle.</p>
<p>Nobody was in any position to know what to expect of policy when, in 2011, the book was published.&nbsp; As it turned out not even the minister was.&nbsp; We know better now about how radically policy is prepared to reduce careers work and reframe schooling.&nbsp; The position of careers education in schools may well be weaker than it was in 1965.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need the account in <em>Careers Education in Schools</em> to show what has been tried, what has worked well, and what has failed to deliver.&nbsp; The book also shows how careers education was never as strong as it deserved to be.&nbsp; I wonder whether that has anything to do with its apparently ancillary role, which was never going to attract enough interested attention from the ablest in the teaching profession.</p>
<p>But we are where we are.&nbsp; And the book examines current policy statements which promise a liberation of schooling - both in its structures and its programmes.&nbsp; That gives careers education something to play for.&nbsp; But it won&rsquo;t play well unless it understands what is proposed, why, and where the levers for action are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me that, if careers workers are to take their future into their own hands, the outcomes will depend more on the level and quality of professional commitment, and less on compliance with statutory requirements.&nbsp; For any education professionals who take this prospect seriously David Andrews&rsquo; account is a unique resource.&nbsp; Each chapter is a rounded story.&nbsp; The references in each are themselves the products of assiduous search.&nbsp; The index is excellent.</p>
<p>An appendix sets out options for the future organisation of careers education.&nbsp; I don't know that I would recommend showing it to senior managers - they already have enough problems.&nbsp; But every school has colleagues who can be interested in the uses of education that this book describes.&nbsp; And it has enough scope to interest a teacher of any subject.&nbsp; So, instead of trying to distract pre-occupied bosses, look for a friend, get something going that looks more like a solution than a problem, and show them that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If professional freedom means anything it means the ability to do that.&nbsp; It puts us in a new situation.&nbsp; It gives professionalism a new place to start.</p>
<p>Would you call that 'innovation'?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ___________________________</p>

              <title>change and careers work - a paradigm shuffle?</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Career-learning Caf&eacute;</em></a></p>
<p>The opening paragraph in an article on change, like this one, is where you can expect to read about unfulfilled predictions of change.&nbsp; They are blind alleys, such as these...</p>
<ol>
<li>an anticipation that came to nothing;</li>
<li>an innovation that turned out not to be new;</li>
<li>a social change that petered out;</li>
<li>a warning dismissed as fraudulent;</li>
<li>some engineering that wobbled or collapsed;</li>
<li>some science that was never replicated.</li>
</ol>
<p>They make popular stories because they are reassuring.&nbsp; The doom-mongers were wrong.&nbsp; So were the romantic optimists.&nbsp; Life goes on.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re still struggling, but we&rsquo;re still here...</p>
<p align="center"><em>plus &ccedil;a change, plus c&rsquo;est la m&eacute;me chose</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a comfort.&nbsp; And - in case you need it - this article makes six attempts to get you out of that comfort zone.</p>
<p><strong><em>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an anticipation that is dangerously right</em></strong></p>
<p>Social ethnographer Gillian Tett is among the few commentators to predict the credit crunch.&nbsp; The few documented risk-avoidance in financial services.&nbsp; But the many took no notice, because the anticipation didn&rsquo;t fit with neo-liberal assumptions - about commercial expansion making everything possible.&nbsp; So the few were set aside.&nbsp; But they were right.</p>
<p>The consequences for work-life are out-of-control.&nbsp; And the damage to government budgeting is making public-service careers work close-to-impossible to maintain.&nbsp; Indeed, private careers-coaching is taking over - it&rsquo;s already a big-dollar global industry.&nbsp; Would you say that any of this is worth our professional careers-work attention?</p>
<p><strong><em>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an innovation that changes how people learn</em></strong></p>
<p>Practically everything is getting digitised - from friendship to fine art.&nbsp; We can digitise relationships, games, and subversion.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s wrong with that?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s how people find out what&rsquo;s going on, and figure out what to do about it.&nbsp; They can update by the hour - and often need to. &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s easy to think of all this as no more than a useful tool - nothing to worry about, more of an opportunity than a challenge.</p>
<p>And, for a time careers work colonised it, exporting what it does into its new handy formats - word-processors, data-bases, spreadsheets.&nbsp; But people may well feel now that they&rsquo;re getting as much information and advice as they need - and in interactive formats.&nbsp; And that digital territory is not only occupied by inhabitants, it is invaded by predators.&nbsp; Professional careers workers can best help by enabling them critically to interrogate the information and influences they find.&nbsp; Time, do you think, to nail the myth that the digitised can replace the direct-and-personal professional?</p>
<p><strong><em>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a social change that brings cultural turbulence</em></strong></p>
<p>In a stagnant economy opportunity becomes a zero-sum game - one person&rsquo;s gain is another&rsquo;s loss.&nbsp; Life gets more competitive.&nbsp; People pull back into a protected spaces.&nbsp; We become strangers to each other.&nbsp; Experience is documented as turbulent - unconnected, uncivil, unpredictable, and unsafe.&nbsp; &Eacute;lites become suspect:&nbsp; politicos, attorneys, academics, and even medicos are second-guessed.&nbsp; But we like to remember that we are social animals.&nbsp; So, no worries, it&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;re good at adapting to necessity.</p>
<p>But surely work-life is nothing if not social.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it done with, for and in response to other people?&nbsp; Yes, but with a tighter and more immediate focus - &lsquo;me&rsquo;, &lsquo;my family&rsquo; and &lsquo;our kin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Conventional career-planning doesn&rsquo;t fit to that. &nbsp;And the background turbulence - some say &lsquo;chaos&rsquo; - seems to undermine the possibility of a plan.&nbsp; Well, maybe not entirely; but, if not, isn&rsquo;t it time to re-think what we can offer?</p>
<p><strong><em>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warnings that we dare not ignore </em></strong></p>
<p>The most persistent warnings we hear concern well-being and risk - for communities, species and the biosphere.&nbsp; But such warnings are easily neutralised - by well-placed outfits whose interests are threatened.&nbsp; Anything can be rubbished by drawing on sponsored research, yielding large-sample &lsquo;significance&rsquo;, promoted by client-compliant consultants.&nbsp; The issues get ducked.</p>
<p>Is it possible that careers work colludes with some of this?&nbsp; The diagnostic apparatus of employability plays to the interests of competitive marketing.&nbsp; And labour-market information doesn&rsquo;t include ratings of work-life&rsquo;s carbon footprints.&nbsp; And this is not just about emissions.&nbsp; Damage is done to African villages, developing-world sweatshops, and home neighbourhoods - where lives are blighted and people are discarded.&nbsp; Careers work deals in such consequences - from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; Any need, might we wonder, to re-think what we mean by independent assessment and impartial information?</p>
<p><strong><em>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; engineering that changes more than we think</em></strong></p>
<p>Alan Turing invented what we now call the computer.&nbsp; He also designed a test for knowing whether computers are intelligent - a test that no computer has ever passed.&nbsp; But global corporations use the technology to transfer gazillions of dollars from one side of the globe to the other - in micro-seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, as you may have noticed, the same technology can quickly off-load any risk.&nbsp; But global corporations smile the same smiles, and make the same promises.</p>
<p>Corporate wealth can exceed government wealth several times over.&nbsp; And the processing speed and power of computers explains much of that policy weakness and corporate strength.&nbsp; The rebalancing of power is transforming the working world - access to markets, cheap labour, polarised incomes, economic migration and global shifts in dominance.&nbsp; Would that kind of information be of any use or interest to your students and clients?&nbsp; Would it still be careers work?</p>
<p><strong><em>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; science that changes everything</em></strong></p>
<p>For the big scientific news we need to go back to Charles Darwin.&nbsp; His ideas never supported crude doctrines for the survival of the fittest.&nbsp; But genetics and neurology has transformed psychological, sociological and economic thinking.&nbsp; Nonetheless, at first his book <em>The Origin of Species</em> was thought to be useful to pigeon fanciers but ecclesiastically unacceptable.&nbsp; A kindly man, he had a bad time with it.</p>
<p>But he changed how we know ourselves - and knowing ourselves is a central careers-work concern.&nbsp; The behaviour sciences that Charles Darwin has most influenced are the three that careers work most persistently calls on.&nbsp; Genetics is transforming the way we can talk about consciousness, freedom and autonomy.&nbsp; None can any longer mean what we used to mean by decision-making.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re catching-up - but slowly.</p>
<p><strong><em>where do we go from here?</em></strong></p>
<p>Those times, they were a-changing - more than Bob Dylan, and a lot of other people, ever knew.&nbsp; The most dangerous negations of change rely on habits-of-mind - which are as dangerous for the future of careers work as for any.&nbsp; We need to re-shape our expertise and re-state our credibility.&nbsp; Might that mean....&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;re-positioning ourselves in relation to government and corporate interests?</li>
<li>&nbsp;shifting focus from an authoritative content to a questioning process?</li>
<li>establishing the social enterprises needed following world-wide privatisation?</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be a start on a radically changing story.&nbsp; And we need that story to be distinctive - separating us from predation and constraint, and pursuing ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;career&rsquo; offers such a narrative.&nbsp; It means both &lsquo;race&rsquo; and &lsquo;journey&rsquo;.&nbsp; Two stories, but one has the bigger and more distinctive idea.&nbsp; The clue is this: we can interrupt a journey with a race, but we can&rsquo;t interrupt a race with a journey.&nbsp; The smaller idea can be carried by the bigger one.</p>
<p>And the only possible format for setting out a journey is a narrative.&nbsp; So, are you sitting uncomfortably?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve guessed that I doubt that we&rsquo;ve done enough on extending the careers-work story.&nbsp; There have been, it&rsquo;s true, one or two attempts to characterise careers-work development as a paradigm shift.&nbsp; But they are exaggerated: more-of-the-same, but decorated with flattering bells and enticing whistles.&nbsp; A paradigm shift is a lot more troublesome than that.&nbsp; Charles Darwin finally faced it.&nbsp; <em>The Descent of Man</em> doesn&rsquo;t do much for pigeon fanciers - but it changes everything else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll find out soon enough whether or not we are facing a paradigm shift.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re bound to notice.&nbsp; My bet is that, at the very least, we&rsquo;re on a paradigm shuffle.</p>

              <title>The Changes and Challenges of Open Practice in the UK (panel discussion)</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6231</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Panel: Craig Mahoney (Higher Education Academy); David Mossley (Higher Education Academy); Jonathan Darby (SCORE); Megan Quentin Baster (University of Newcastle Upon Tyne)</p>
<p>CM: This is a turbulent time for education, but also a creative time with enormous opportunity. &nbsp;We need to rethink and repurpose the didactic model of higher education which is prevalent in UK universities. &nbsp;OER is going to be a part of this. &nbsp;But we need policy leadership in universities, who are often unaware of how OER can be used and promoted. &nbsp;There are examples of good practice, but they tend to be isolated and sometimes unsupported. &nbsp;We need to rethink the way we make use of resources in constructive and critical ways if we are to encourage lifelong learners. &nbsp;The Open University is the leader in the UK: &nbsp;all the others are playing catch up.</p>
<p>DM: The HEA has produced a number of resources for senior mangers and policymakers, including a toolkit (http://bit.ly/H5NEf5). &nbsp;The approach of the programme has been diverse and student-focused (including an NUS survey). &nbsp;Iniital results suggest that students respect academic who share. &nbsp;The future is about enriching the student learning experience by going beyond the point of contact.</p>
<p>JD: The OU has changed the way it communicates and educates, sharing content in new ways (including 40 million downloads on iTunesU). &nbsp;The OU has been a 'giver' rather than a sharer, historically speaking. &nbsp;Now, when new courses are created in a structured way it makes it easier for OERs to be created: &nbsp;sharing is embedded into the process. &nbsp;The OU is also thinking seriously about incorporating OER into course delivery rather than creating everything from scratch, though progress could be made in this area. &nbsp;One area where OER has made a difference in OpenLearn, which uses OER to attrach potential students at a 75% saving on recruitment cost.</p>
<p>MQB: Academics and institutions are worried about legal implications of being open. &nbsp;Attribution is particularly tough with teaching materials. &nbsp;Publishers are interested in working with HE institutions to be open, but in practice little has been delivered. &nbsp;Negotiations can also be slow, meaning that academics often just act without securing legal permissions. &nbsp;We need risk management tools and effective policies for the ways we reuse and remix content. &nbsp;Furthermore, the publishing model is changing, with power shifting to resellers like Amazon.</p>
<p>Jackie Coulter (JORUM) asked about policy leadership and lessons learned. &nbsp;CM said that there is a lack of convergence between political and institutional drivers which threatens the future sustainability of the sector as a whole. &nbsp;JC responded by saying that we need to be better about collecting evidence about the successes and importance of using OER. &nbsp;JD said that policy should be about removing barriers to being open, not about directing others. &nbsp;(Tacitly, this suggests that openness is a default behaviour which takes over once barriers are removed.)</p>
<p>Antonio Mart&iacute;nez-Arboleda&nbsp;Leeds&nbsp;University and&nbsp;SCORE) asked about the Research Excellence Framework (REF) which does not seem to make provision for OER. &nbsp;MQB said that she had raised this with REF panels, who said that they already had their work cut out and wouldn't be considering teaching materials at this time. &nbsp;But activities surrounding enhancement might use open licensing in the future. &nbsp;More importantly, authors need to start expressing a strong preference for being open in order to bring about change in research-led organizations.</p>
<p>The discussion went on to cover the possible role of top-down leadership (e.g. the Bologna process). &nbsp;There was a suggestion that we need both top-down and bottom-up processes with policies that are not overly prescriptive, but can be endorsed by leaders.</p>
<p>MQB mentioned the way that institutions like the Wellcome Trust are moving to open access models, showing how change might come from open research rather than OER. &nbsp;Judith Murray (Thompson University) wondered whether there are policy tools that could enable other types of open activities. &nbsp;Cable Green (Creative Commons) noted that OER should be understood as having&nbsp;no cost at the point of &nbsp;access and affording thelegal rights to make modifications. &nbsp;He reiterated the basic policy principle that any publicly funded resources should be openly available resources, a principle which he hopes will be endorsed at the forthcoming UNESCO meeting in Paris.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Richardus Eko Indrajit (ABFI Institute, Perbanas, Jakarta) - Developing the Open Education Ecosystem: based on the study of 350 higher learning institutions</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Eko's keynote presentation ahs been brought forward from day 3 because the original speaker is unwell.<br /><br />Universities in Indonesia are distributed unequally, meaning that opportunities are also distributed unequally. &nbsp;This is at least partly down to it being an archipelago; in smaller islands, fewer people are educated. &nbsp;There are also not enough professors and experts available to teach. &nbsp;Only 0.5% of universities are in the top category (world-class). Almost a third fail to meet minimum standards.</p>
<p>A new paradigm is emerging in learning, one that makes good use of information technologies. &nbsp;The proposed solution, based on 5C (competition, collaboration, compliance, comprehensive, coordination) principles:</p>
<p>* increase access</p>
<p>* share resources</p>
<p>* promote and enforce collaboration</p>
<p>* utilise technology</p>
<p>* institutionalise open educatyion as a national initiative</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Indonesian government has been buying (K12) IP and making it available on a general basis. &nbsp;Open architectures are also being developed. &nbsp;Universities remain responsible for their own innovation and assessment. &nbsp;350 institutions are involved in research to uncover issues that are thrown up: people, process, content and tools.</p>
<p>Infrastructures in almost all universities are linked to a central IT service which avoids connectivity problems. &nbsp;However, investment, policies and incentives are lagging behind. &nbsp;Similarly, many professors lack IT skills, despite the fact that Web 2.0 is already integrated into Indonesian culture. &nbsp;SImilarly, many show a reluctance to share content, even though much of it is already digital. &nbsp;(Indonesia is moving towards measuring academic impact rhrough Google presence rather than other metrics.)</p>
<p>Indonesian culture relies on governmental decree as a driver for change, so there is a need for government to show leadership in this area. &nbsp;A roadshow travels the country to stimulate change in attitudes among faculty and students, encouraging them to be more open in teaching, learning and management.</p>
<p>Benefits include improving access and quality of education by making better use of resources. &nbsp;But Indonesia needs help in terms of developing open courses, collaborating in teaching and research, methods for transferring accreditation and earning study credits abroad, sharing learning resources and scholars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eko finished by sharing the way in which he learned English by listening to records (uncluding The Beatles) which his grandmother had given him... inventive use of a record as an OER?</p>
<p>In the Q&amp;A Eko said that 20% of Indonesian expenditure is ring-fenced for education, with 25% of that going to higher education and the remainder going to primary and secondary education.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>this is part five of a five-part keynote presentation to the 2011 annual conference of the ICG<br />the series starts at <a title="part one" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5868" target="_blank">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5868</a></p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; pushing the boundary -&nbsp; managing control and finding space </strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that boundary setting can be a covert form of control.&nbsp; It is true that setting limits on what we do is a practical necessity, but it is also true that the way those limits are set can circumscribe our independence.&nbsp; It curtails our basis for knowing what to support - and what to oppose.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>the personal and the planetary:&nbsp;</strong> If students-and-clients are to narrate what they learn from experience, should there be limits to what they relate?&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp; But what links are appropriate and what are not?&nbsp; Everybody links working to shopping - the one permits the other.&nbsp; And the work that a person takes up is linked, not just to their own life chances, but the lives of any dependents they have - or ever will have.&nbsp; And people increasingly voice concerns for work-life balance.&nbsp; They also see the impact of work on quality-of-life as it links both to local neighbourhoods - even to African villages.&nbsp; Indeed, those impacts are seen as linking to the survival of species and the habitability of the biosphere - work has a carbon footprint.&nbsp; The links that people make to working life extend between <em>the personal and the planetary</em>.</p>
<p>They extend well beyond limits set by recruitment-and-selection interests.&nbsp; And also beyond the market thinking of neo-liberal policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>students and clients pushing back boundaries:</strong>&nbsp; Influential interests set limits on career talk.&nbsp; And that goes against wide-spread contemporary personal-to-planetary interests.&nbsp; The trends are well-documented by political commentators, sociologists, counselling-advocates, labour economists and behavioural psychologists.&nbsp; And our own research accords with the trends, it finds <em>students and clients pushing back boundaries</em>. &nbsp;It also finds people who see child care as a form of work, and who are wondering about work that endangers the planet.</p>
<p>None of this means that careers are boundaryless - if &lsquo;career&rsquo; means everything then it means nothing.&nbsp; But that is not what happens: people directly relate their concerns to labour-market experience.&nbsp; To pre-empt the expression of these concerns would limit the disclosure&rsquo;s they make, the extent of what we learn from each other, and the help we are - therefore - able to offer.&nbsp; They would also curtail the interests we feel able to support - and resist.&nbsp; It would diminish us</p>
<p><strong>whether the big society is big enough:&nbsp;</strong> Such thinking re-locates careers work in other-than-commerce and other-than-government alliances.&nbsp; Does that leave anywhere worth going?&nbsp; The big society is urged as a way of taking on group action which government is not able, or not willing, to take on.&nbsp; The idea is much derided; but there is a more robust concept - &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;.&nbsp; Civil society is characterised as social action which is neither commercial nor political.&nbsp; Voluntary agencies, charities and bona fide non-government organisations are - in varying degrees - examples.&nbsp; So are family, local, social and religious affiliations.&nbsp; There are tensions, take-overs and changing alignments: association football was once part of civil society.&nbsp; Professional associations still may be.&nbsp; Together the agencies and affiliations of civil society weave a social fabric which supports the way we live together - locally and on the planet.&nbsp; And so, it should be possible to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to a question about <em>whether the big society is big enough.</em>&nbsp; Is it a natural position for careers-work professionalism?&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are called &lsquo;bottom-line&rsquo; interest in careers work are actually commercial interests of shareholder.&nbsp; Civil society represents stakeholder interests.&nbsp; And all of the agencies and affiliations concerned with the social fabric have a natural interest in what careers workers do.&nbsp; It calls for multilateral, rather than bilateral, partnership agreements.&nbsp; Multi-laterality comes as no surprise to committed careers advisers and socially alert educators.&nbsp; The mapping of their links is as diverse as any in civil society.&nbsp; We need that independent positioning institutionalised.&nbsp; And a natural home for the institution is not the employer of careers workers - who may well defer powerful policy and commercial interests.&nbsp; The natural home for the institution of careers work is in civil society.&nbsp; Because the future is multilateral.</p>
<p>Practical questions for that reality are...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;who has a stake in careers work?&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;which of their interests should be our interests?&lsquo;<br />&lsquo;how do we manage those boundaries on what we do?&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p>Late twentieth-century careers-work has been a story of repeated crisis.&nbsp; The crises have usually been on the back of head-lined events.&nbsp; And the events have usually been outside our control.&nbsp; Headlines aside - the hyper-active manipulation of how we live together by commerce and policy is becoming widely suspect.</p>
<p>Along with many others, in all kinds of societies across the globe, we can think of re-positioning ourselves in relation to policy and commerce.&nbsp; The careers profession alliance is well placed to work on this.&nbsp; If not through the alliance, then I believe we will do it - belatedly - in some in some other way.</p>
<p>We need to do things differently.&nbsp; And it will take time.&nbsp; The task is innovation deeper and wider than careers work has ever taken on.&nbsp; It is for careers workers to take charge of their own future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who better?</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp; enlarging the role - integrating learning for integrated lives?</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that careers-worker professionals know more than they are in a position to use.&nbsp; Enlarged career studies means that careers workers are constantly becoming more able to help.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s good; what is not good is that time- and target-constraints give them little opportunity and freedom to the put that ability to good use.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong><strong>earning space for useful action:&nbsp;</strong> Career studies is applied learning - what is learned is intended to be used in people&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; It requires transfer-of-learning - acquired in one setting, used in another.&nbsp; And that means that people&rsquo;s learning reminds them of their lives, so that their lives remind them of their learning.</p>
<p>But it does not come easily.&nbsp; It needs <em>learning space for useful action</em> - big-enough that learning can be probed, tried out, adapted and embedded.&nbsp; Applied learning is not like academic learning - useful transfer-of-learning needs more than acquisition, record-making and assessment.&nbsp; And it will not fit into the marginal slots that an academic curriculum reluctantly concedes to &lsquo;careers education and guidance&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>finding meaning and purpose:</strong>&nbsp; As a species we look for meaning: long ago, when the leaves rustled, we wondered &lsquo;what&rsquo;s that - predator or prey?... mate or competitor?... us or them?&rsquo;.&nbsp; It ascribes meaning, and an ascribed meaning is a basis for purpose.&nbsp; We wonder &lsquo;... so, what shall I do - move or be still?... run or hide?... approach or avoid?&rsquo;.&nbsp; There have always been versions of this in career-management: what-to-do? and why-bother? - a purpose, and an underlying meaning, giving the purpose its point.&nbsp; Learning-for-living is <em>finding meaning and purpose</em>, &nbsp;</p>
<p>And what people informally find may not be misleading - even gossip can offer useful and authentic exchanges of experience.&nbsp; But not all of informal learning is like that - some borders on superstition.&nbsp; There is nothing that professionals can do - or should do - to displace such experience-based learning.&nbsp; But they can help in two ways.&nbsp; They can expand the experience to make more comparisons possible.&nbsp; That means making new contacts - we could call that thinking &lsquo;community-interaction theory&rsquo;.&nbsp; And they can enable the probing, scrutinising and interrogation of what people find.&nbsp; That means engaging people in critical thinking - we could call that thinking &lsquo;career-learning theory&rsquo;.&nbsp; Those two activities - widening the perspectives on meaning, and enabling the interrogation of purpose - are what careers workers do best.</p>
<p><strong>employability a by-product: </strong>&nbsp;Both activities are process driven - not so much about what people learn, more about how they learn it.&nbsp; But there is no process without content.&nbsp; And keeping up with content is becoming a serious problem: the understanding of facts and factors influencing career has expanded beyond our reach.&nbsp; We need, more than ever, to turn elsewhere for reliable and up-to-date content.&nbsp; And there is no part of any curriculum which is incapable of finding that content and applying it to life.&nbsp; There are educators who know more than we can know - ranging from the dynamics of encounter to the reliability of probabilities.&nbsp; It needs teachers - for example in drama or maths - who are ready to start a scheme with &lsquo;this will be useful in your life when...&rsquo;, and to wind up with &lsquo;...let&rsquo;s go over life situations where you can use this learning&rsquo;.&nbsp; Transfer-of-learning needs that kind of embedding.&nbsp; And, so embedded, it is a life-wide and life-long gain.</p>
<p>It is integrated learning for integrated lives.&nbsp; It is not cross-curriculum infusion: it does not seek a lot of, often half-hearted, curriculum links.&nbsp; Instead it looks for a few able partners - maybe in drama, and - if not welcome there - maybe in maths.&nbsp; What we most need is not comprehensive coverage, which is unattainable anyway.&nbsp; We need to find genuine expertise and experience which can deal with any question, from whatever direction it comes, and who can fire up curiosity - developing the habit of seeing learning as a map, not a hurdle.&nbsp; We need those people to understand the importance of enabling ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; To enable learning in these terms makes <em>employability a by-product</em>.&nbsp; An able educator, helping students to find meaning and purpose in life, does not need to see this in any other way.&nbsp; The best of educators do not care to see themselves as setting in motion a procedure to be completed by recruitment and selection.&nbsp; Education is intrinsically valuable - it is not an agent for other people&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p>Practical questions include...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;is a what-to-do gain all that is asked for - or needed?&rsquo;<br /></em><em>&lsquo;how do we best help with seeking meaning and purpose?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;what can we do about negotiating an integrated curriculum?</em></p>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp; sharpening the image - developing a narrative of what we do</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that careers work is in danger of being marginalised in its own field.&nbsp; Agents who offer short-cut answers to urgent questions will attract plenty of clients.&nbsp; Careers work is talking about a more demanding task - both for ourselves, and for our clients and students.&nbsp; We can work with bigger, and more challenging, ideas.</p>
<p><strong>the &lsquo;race&rsquo; is only part of the &lsquo;journey&rsquo;:</strong>&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a challenge: &lsquo;career&rsquo; is not a thing, like a slice of chocolate-fudge cake; it&rsquo;s an abstraction, like marriage.&nbsp; Abstractions are harder to define in a way that everybody accepts.&nbsp; Metaphors can help, by appealing to visual imagery.&nbsp; And &lsquo;career&rsquo; is already a metaphor - actually, it&rsquo;s two metaphors.&nbsp; In its origins the word spoke sometimes of &lsquo;a race&rsquo;, sometimes of &lsquo;a journey&rsquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not so hard to visualise either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But try this: can you see a person interrupting a race to take part in a journey?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; So try visualising a person interrupting a journey to take part in a race.&nbsp; If that&rsquo;s easier, it makes journeying the bigger idea, and the bigger can contain the smaller.&nbsp; It means we can say that <em>the &lsquo;race&rsquo; is only part of the &lsquo;journey&rsquo;</em>.&nbsp; A journey can be life-wide and life-long.&nbsp; It is not surprising, then, to find that students are more interested in the race.&nbsp; But there are indications that educators are at least as likely to see learning as a journey.&nbsp; Journeying is the stronger image for conveying the causes of career.&nbsp; And, if we are to avoid being marginalised, we need to do more with it.</p>
<p><strong>a person, encountering others, in a sequence</strong>:&nbsp; What we do with the imagery needs to connect with what people do with it.&nbsp; It means facing up to distinctions - between &lsquo;career development&rsquo;, &lsquo;careers work&rsquo; and &lsquo;career management&rsquo;.&nbsp; Career development is our facts-and-factors expertise.&nbsp; Careers work is what we do to help students and clients with what expertise shows.&nbsp; Career management is what they do about it - with or without our help.&nbsp; We need, then, to find the careers-work <em>activities</em> which connect career-development <em>expertise</em> to career-management <em>experience</em>.</p>
<p>Experience is best set down as a narrative - in a story the images are of <em>a person, encountering others, in a sequence.</em>&nbsp; People are not short of career-management narratives - communicated in peer-group and face-book gossip, recounting both direct and on-line experience.&nbsp; Exchanging those stories is a place to start.&nbsp; And we have plenty of narrative-based careers-work activities to engage it - ranging from constructivism to narrative-based websites.</p>
<p><strong>re-balancing face-to-face and stage-by-stage learning: </strong>&nbsp;Inviting people to exchange their stories is a place to start.&nbsp; But it is only a place to start, because narratives are anecdotes - they are not expertise.&nbsp; No story can speak for everybody, each is one-person&rsquo;s experience.&nbsp; So narrative is not a well-sampled diagnosis, it is a living impression.&nbsp; It is not labour-market information, it is labour-market experience.&nbsp; And there are aspects of career management that only narrative can recount: stories can show different points-of-view, things going well and going badly, attributions of meaning, turning-points, the consequences for me and others, and change-of-mind.&nbsp; Such a well-rounded narrative has an authenticity and a spontaneity which facts-and-factors can&rsquo;t convey.&nbsp; It is why a well-rounded narrative draws people in.</p>
<p>But narrative is not quick-and-easy work - the useful recounting of, and reflection on, experience needs interactive stage-by-stage learning.&nbsp; So how do we work with people on linking the story of their experience to the story of our expertise?&nbsp; At our best, our story is&nbsp; engaging, provocative and dynamic.&nbsp; But making the connection means <em>re-balancing face-to-face and stage-by-stage learning</em> - guidance works with a face-to-face agenda, curriculum is a stage-by-stage progression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Practical questions call for a re-thinking of the partnership between guidance and curriculum...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;in how many ways is career management a </em><em>life-wide life-long journey?&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;how do we use narrative to connect our expertise to that experience?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;what does that mean for re-balancing face-to-face and progressive learning?&rsquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp; enlarging the role - integrating learning for integrated lives?</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that careers-worker professionals know more than they are in a position to use.&nbsp; Enlarged career studies means that careers workers are constantly becoming more able to help.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s good; what is not good is that time- and target-constraints give them little opportunity and freedom to the put that ability to good use.</p>
<p>learning space for useful action:&nbsp; Career studies is applied learning - what is learned is intended to be used in people&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; It requires transfer-of-learning - acquired in one setting, used in another.&nbsp; And that means that people&rsquo;s learning reminds them of their lives, so that their lives remind them of their learning.</p>
<p>But it does not come easily.&nbsp; It needs <em>learning space for useful action</em> - big-enough that learning can be probed, tried out, adapted and embedded.&nbsp; Applied learning is not like academic learning - useful transfer-of-learning needs more than acquisition, record-making and assessment.&nbsp; And it will not fit into the marginal slots that an academic curriculum reluctantly concedes to &lsquo;careers education and guidance&rsquo;.</p>
<p>finding meaning and purpose:&nbsp; As a species we look for meaning: long ago, when the leaves rustled, we wondered &lsquo;what&rsquo;s that - predator or prey?... mate or competitor?... us or them?&rsquo;.&nbsp; It ascribes meaning, and an ascribed meaning is a basis for purpose.&nbsp; We wonder &lsquo;... so, what shall I do - move or be still?... run or hide?... approach or avoid?&rsquo;.&nbsp; There have always been versions of this in career-management: what-to-do? and why-bother? - a purpose, and an underlying meaning, giving the purpose its point.&nbsp; Learning-for-living is <em>finding meaning and purpose</em>, &nbsp;</p>
<p>And what people informally find may not be misleading - even gossip can offer useful and authentic exchanges of experience.&nbsp; But not all of informal learning is like that - some borders on superstition.&nbsp; There is nothing that professionals can do - or should do - to displace such experience-based learning.&nbsp; But they can help in two ways.&nbsp; They can expand the experience to make more comparisons possible.&nbsp; That means making new contacts - we could call that thinking &lsquo;community-interaction theory&rsquo;.&nbsp; And they can enable the probing, scrutinising and interrogation of what people find.&nbsp; That means engaging people in critical thinking - we could call that thinking &lsquo;career-learning theory&rsquo;.&nbsp; Those two activities - widening the perspectives on meaning, and enabling the interrogation of purpose - are what careers workers do best.</p>
<p>employability a by-product: &nbsp;Both activities are process driven - not so much about what people learn, more about how they learn it.&nbsp; But there is no process without content.&nbsp; And keeping up with content is becoming a serious problem: the understanding of facts and factors influencing career has expanded beyond our reach.&nbsp; We need, more than ever, to turn elsewhere for reliable and up-to-date content.&nbsp; And there is no part of any curriculum which is incapable of finding that content and applying it to life.&nbsp; There are educators who know more than we can know - ranging from the dynamics of encounter to the reliability of probabilities.&nbsp; It needs teachers - for example in drama or maths - who are ready to start a scheme with &lsquo;this will be useful in your life when...&rsquo;, and to wind up with &lsquo;...let&rsquo;s go over life situations where you can use this learning&rsquo;.&nbsp; Transfer-of-learning needs that kind of embedding.&nbsp; And, so embedded, it is a life-wide and life-long gain.</p>
<p>It is integrated learning for integrated lives.&nbsp; It is not cross-curriculum infusion: it does not seek a lot of, often half-hearted, curriculum links.&nbsp; Instead it looks for a few able partners - maybe in drama, and - if not welcome there - maybe in maths.&nbsp; What we most need is not comprehensive coverage, which is unattainable anyway.&nbsp; We need to find genuine expertise and experience which can deal with any question, from whatever direction it comes, and who can fire up curiosity - developing the habit of seeing learning as a map, not a hurdle.&nbsp; We need those people to understand the importance of enabling ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; To enable learning in these terms makes <em>employability a by-product</em>.&nbsp; An able educator, helping students to find meaning and purpose in life, does not need to see this in any other way.&nbsp; The best of educators do not care to see themselves as setting in motion a procedure to be completed by recruitment and selection.&nbsp; Education is intrinsically valuable - it is not an agent for other people&rsquo;s interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Practical questions include...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;is a what-to-do gain all that is asked for - or needed?&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;how do we best help with seeking meaning and purpose?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;what can we do about negotiating an integrated curriculum?</em></p>

<p>a pdf version of the entire five-part text...<br /><a title="entiretext" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafpropositions.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafpropositions.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; winning credibility - earning trust</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that credibility cannot be claimed, it must be earned.&nbsp; And that means being open to challenge from the very people whose trust we seek.&nbsp; It is not how we see them that matters, it is how they see us.</p>
<p><strong>culture and its enclaves:&nbsp;</strong> We are not our clients&rsquo; and students&rsquo; only sources of learning for career management - they learn in other ways.&nbsp; That means that they do not come to us empty-handed - they come with beliefs, values and expectations, which they gather from their experience of <em>culture and its enclaves.</em> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those sources of learning are massively expanding through globalisation and its technologies.&nbsp; Everyone has plenty of informal ways of finding out what is going on, and working out what they can do about it.&nbsp; And they find those sources in both friends-and-family, and on-line.&nbsp; But this is learning in enclaves - it increasingly belongs to post-coded attitudes reflected in googled urls.&nbsp; Those geographically located cultural backgrounds are becoming better markers for work-related attitudes than any twentieth-century definition of social class can any longer show us.&nbsp; Different groups, in different positions, with different experiences, learn different things about career.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>contested claims:&nbsp;</strong> And, so, there is always more than one way of thinking about working life.&nbsp; Ideas about career are constantly reorganising how we understand what people do.&nbsp; Words like &lsquo;skill&rsquo;, &lsquo;employability&rsquo;, &lsquo;confidence&rsquo;, &lsquo;experience&rsquo;, &lsquo;allegiance&rsquo; and &lsquo;motivation&rsquo; crop up differently in different accounts.&nbsp; They express <em>contested claims</em>: whatever anybody says about career, somebody else can say it differently.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve ever compiled a career-management essay or case study, you may well have wondered how to be sure that you have covered the ground. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But my reading of the evidence is that there is something like a consensus about the value of careers work.&nbsp; However much they may vary in other ways, in certain conditions students and clients agree about us.&nbsp; They approve of us when...: they know what they want to do; they are facing short-term action; and they are looking for hard information.&nbsp; We shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised by the modesty of these accolades.&nbsp; In work as complex and dynamic as ours, the best we could ever reasonably have hoped for is that we help some people, on some issues for some of the time.&nbsp; And that is pretty-well what the evidence shows.</p>
<p><strong>enl</strong><strong>arged expertise:</strong>&nbsp; The evidence shows something else: when it comes to reflecting on why to move on in one direction rather than another, that&rsquo;s when people go to other people for informal help - not to us.&nbsp; They turn to people they know, and who know them - people they feel they can trust.&nbsp; And it is on that &lsquo;why&rsquo; question that they look elsewhere.&nbsp; We increase our credibility by working with people, not just on how to do things, but on why to bother.&nbsp; It means being strong both on career and on the causes of career.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t have that understanding: we are expanding our career studies continually - drawing on psychology, economics, and sociology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;career studies&rsquo; is useful, because it speaks less of some wholly-owned careers-work discipline, more of an examination of rigorous disciplines which expand our understanding.&nbsp; The history of careers work is a history of that kind of intellectual exploration and importation.&nbsp; It brings us an <em>enlarged expertise</em>: constantly taking us into unfamiliar pathways, collecting from emerging sources, and discovering new ways of understanding what is going on.&nbsp; A recent example is how culture and neurology interact.&nbsp; It expands our scope for evoking possible selves in possible futures. &nbsp;And that offers people a deeper and wider hold on working life. &nbsp;We will know that it has earned credibility when more people, from more backgrounds, want to discuss more of their lives, with more of us, for more of the time.</p>
<p>Practical questions for winning that kind of credibility include..</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;who collates our understanding of career - and the causes of career?&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;how do we best connect that expertise to client and student experience?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;how do they know us - and become known by us - enough to trust us?&rsquo;</em></p>

              <title>riots 2011 - unspoken quotes and thresholds of help</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br />the career-learning caf&eacute;<br />www.hihohiho.com</p>
<p>An earlier <a title="the poor don't listen" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5322" target="_blank">blog</a> examines &lsquo;why the poor don&rsquo;t listen to us&rsquo;.&nbsp; It finds that the comfortably-off don&rsquo;t understand the priorities of poverty.&nbsp; And it shows how that puzzlement spills over into disapproval.&nbsp; The conflict comes to a head in a crisis.</p>
<p>The August &lsquo;riots&rsquo; are no easier to understand.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve already been labelled as criminality...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;pure and simple&rsquo;<br />'to be confronted and defeated'<br />&lsquo;in an all-out war&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s troublesome enough.&nbsp; But vested interests are also out in force, with their claims...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;if-you&rsquo;d-only-listened-to-us&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;and supported our programme&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;while following our lead&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Careers workers can understand that no explanation of what people do is ever that simplistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From its beginning careers work has negotiated a threshold between what we can work with and what must be controlled. Every teacher faces it every day.&nbsp; So does every parent.&nbsp; And every policeman.&nbsp; They can...</p>
<p>...<strong>work with people</strong> when they recognise an outcry - and the possibility of communication - with people engaged in a search for a way forward - ready to take hold of something with promise.</p>
<p>But they must...</p>
<p>..<strong>hand over to control</strong> when they know there&rsquo;s no more they can do - recognising dangers and damage - to other people and to their clients - standing aside as helper to make way for sanctions.</p>
<p>Having to resort to control is always a failure.&nbsp; To take pride in its advocacy diminishes the advocate.&nbsp; The harder but more promising task is to find a threshold for help.</p>
<p><strong>thresholds</strong><br />People do not always tell us what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; One of the reasons - as the earlier blog shows - is not seeing any point in bothering to explain yourself to people who are not going to understand.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a sort of exasperation.&nbsp; It needs alert, patient, and observant attention to clues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the clues are set out below - as if they are quotes.&nbsp; (You might copy-and-paste the list, to compare reactions from colleagues and students.)&nbsp; It invites a response to each &lsquo;quote&rsquo; by asking...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is this a careers-work concern?&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>underline it</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...can we work with it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>tick it</strong></p>

<p>Two careers work comfort zones here:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no underlining</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not a careers-work concern, no need to get involved<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; no ticks</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing we can work with, leave it to the courts</p>
<p>Reform is not a comfort zone, but it means we have something to offer.&nbsp; To settle for &lsquo;no need to get involved&rsquo; leaves us empty-handed.&nbsp; It means we can only seek support for doing what we have been doing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a limp response to change - expected, unimpressive, dismissible.&nbsp; But acknowledging the need for reform is strong - unexpected, constructive, promising.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember hearing any of these &lsquo;quotes&rsquo; on any of the streets.&nbsp; I don't recall seeing them on any banners or posters.&nbsp; They came up later, usually from <a title="kidscompany" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/camila-batmanghelidjh-caring-costs-ndash-but-so-do-riots-2333991.html" target="_blank">people in a position to speak for them</a>.&nbsp; The looters were not seeking our understanding.&nbsp; They know about the futility of explanation.&nbsp; These are, then, &lsquo;unspoken quotes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They are an attempt to reflect an tacit inner life.&nbsp; If we can gather no clues to those thoughts and feelings we&rsquo;d underline nothing and tick nothing.&nbsp; Is that it?</p>
<p>People who break the law should be arrested, tried and sentenced by the same rules as all criminals.&nbsp; It's a civil right - justice, not populist retribution.&nbsp; In a law court, not a &lsquo;reality&rsquo; tv show. &nbsp;The risk is that once people have offloaded their anger onto a punishment that satisfies them, they can be persuaded &lsquo;job done!&rsquo;.&nbsp; It would be a collective failure.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>in politics</strong><br />So, was this not political?&nbsp; It was not done in the name of Mark Duggan - not his cause.&nbsp; But politics played a hand.&nbsp; In global conditions governments are weak. &nbsp;What they can do about anybody&rsquo;s chances-in-life is constrained by the consequences in massive monetary shifts.&nbsp; So they look for compensating feel-good domestic policies.&nbsp; It means attending to the electorally and economically strong.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t know how many of the rioters see themselves as part of any of those constituencies.&nbsp; But where there are no votes there&rsquo;s weakened political interest.&nbsp; That means that strong constituencies can capture government. &nbsp;And that can consign the poor to the margins.&nbsp; The rioters might have considered campaigning against the politics that fails them.&nbsp; But they didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Though it is failing them.</p>
<p><strong>in education</strong><br />Some of this might have been examined at school - in &lsquo;citizenship&rsquo;.&nbsp; Great teachers know that effective learning has to relate to experience.&nbsp; Students are certainly helped to fit into their experience.&nbsp; But the poor experience is that the world they are asked to fit into already belongs to other people.&nbsp; Teachers call it learning for cooperation, but it feels like compliance - more like jumping through hoops than useful learning.&nbsp; Useful learning is working out how to change things.&nbsp; And the looters seemed capable of doing that.&nbsp; The riots are not a failure of wit or energy.&nbsp; Let them find something they can see is really worth doing, and then try to stop them!&nbsp; Some of the people on those Blackberries are able seriously to out-manoeuvre the police.&nbsp; What a waste of talent.</p>
<p><strong>in culture</strong><br />Commerce has been able to push consumer choice to the top of the policy totem pole.&nbsp; But some commerce is worried about the riots.&nbsp; It looks as though it will recover from the loss; but some is reported to be worried about damage to product images.&nbsp; Many of the looted products are associated with crime, not because of the riots, but because of the promotional iconography.&nbsp; They are sold as &rsquo;up-for-it&rsquo; - tough, independent, ruthless, bold... like ex-cons.&nbsp; Such imagery shapes a culture - feeding into what people believe, value and expect in their lives.&nbsp; It becomes part of a media-branding complex, with media able to capture audiences - with cool, celebrated, rap-and-gossip - and media then able to promote influential interests to whatever audience they have been able to capture.&nbsp; Some of the riots had family support; but why assume that the adults-at-home are any less influenced by that m-b complex than their children?&nbsp; The government says it can&rsquo;t be on every corner, but the m-b complex is on every corner.&nbsp; And it needs its customers to forget the violent imagery built into product branding.&nbsp; So watch out for posters and press releases, disentangling those brands from that imagery.&nbsp; As failures go, this is spectacular.</p>
<p><strong>in community</strong><br />The term &lsquo;broken society&rsquo; is, itself, badly damaged.&nbsp; It labels as &lsquo;bad influences&rsquo; people who are, often-enough, heroically dealing with bad influences.&nbsp; But - with so much innocent suffering, crime and heart-break - being able to punish somebody can be a slight compensatory comfort.&nbsp; And that needs a clear separation between &lsquo;them&rsquo; and &lsquo;us&rsquo; - maintaining that &lsquo;they&rsquo; are not like &lsquo;us&rsquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not universal - we rightly honour the bereaved, magnificently calling for shared restraint.&nbsp; But the us-and-them segregation was there long before the riots.&nbsp; And you don&rsquo;t have to invade the gated communities of the sequestered super-rich to find it.&nbsp; Sometimes the fissure is inside a post-code.&nbsp; But these near but gentrified neighbours face in different direction - buying in different stores, enjoying different venues, send their children to different schools, avoid each other&rsquo;s gaze - strangers to each other.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easier to label a stranger &lsquo;scum&rsquo;, &lsquo;fascist&rsquo;, &lsquo;inhuman&rsquo;, &lsquo;evil&rsquo;.&nbsp; Easier still if convinced of one&rsquo;s own righteousness.&nbsp; But the broom-brandishing will work better when it shares its clean-up with the culprits. &nbsp;It will open a conversation between the perps, the victims and the families.&nbsp; It is what teachers, police and neighbourhoods <a title="restorativeevidence" href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/RJ_full_report.pdf" target="_self">are finding effective</a>.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t repair what is broken by bearing down on it.&nbsp; Is a word we have so-far not heard enough of &lsquo;healing&rsquo;?&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">________________________</p>
<p>This is political, but not like SOLIDARNOSC or the Jarrow March.&nbsp; Does citizenship ever mention <em>Lech Wałęsa</em> or Ellen Wilkinson?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that part of its students&rsquo; story?&nbsp; Do they know that they&rsquo;ve got one?</p>
<p>Speaking of class - I suppose it&rsquo;s not out of the question that some rioter from a middle-class home has been asked...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;get me a Breitling' - nothing too gross!&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>If and when we get the demographics we&rsquo;ll know better about that.&nbsp; But, for the moment, much of what we are witnessing is the poor trying to compensate themselves.&nbsp; I doubt they see it as immoral - some take their allegiance to each other to be moral.&nbsp; As many other people do.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the rioters have made it harder-than-ever for anybody to defend for their interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the call is for &lsquo;a single minded crime-fighter - to lead the Met.&nbsp; The call doesn&rsquo;t speak to me of the breadth-of-mind we need. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s harder-than-ever to hold people&rsquo;s interest in that kind of understanding.&nbsp; But it has never been more necessary to try.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s a critical challenge for careers work.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it <a title="professionalism" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" target="_self">careers work&rsquo;s task</a> to enable people to take hold of their stake in society?&nbsp; It needs to be...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;tough on career - tough on the causes of career&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Suppose &lsquo;unspoken quotes&rsquo; offered a basis for working with these young men and women.&nbsp; The probability is that it will be in schools.&nbsp; Although that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it is only for students.&nbsp; School&rsquo;s can and should be accessible to anybody, at any stage in life.&nbsp; It would mean seeing our work in a changing relationship with both policy and commerce. This would unfold an appreciation of the subtle and pervasive influence of culture and society.&nbsp; That would re-work our partner- and stakeholder-networks.&nbsp; There would be a new basis for research-and-development and for exchanging feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And also for attracting support. &nbsp;But if the support we seek is for what we have been doing, then we&rsquo;ll be dismissed as predictable, unimpressive, self-serving.&nbsp; But to set out proposals for a comprehending reform of our work, that will invite interest in what is engaging, constructive, promising.</p>
<p>It means understanding not only that the poor don&rsquo;t listen to us - but that they don&rsquo;t much want to talk to us.&nbsp; But, as long as we can underline and tick some &lsquo;unspoken quotes&rsquo;, we can learn to hear what they are not yet saying.</p>
<p>Is that possible?&nbsp; If so, what an agenda for careers-work innovation.</p>]]></description>

              <title>careers work in civil society</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3821</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>A policy commitment to an all-age careers service will get a lot of favourable attention from our people.&nbsp; But there are underlying issues.&nbsp; One of the most pressing is about how any service is best located in relation to its users.&nbsp; It calls for designing a service in terms of...</p>
<p align="center"><em>how people become aware of it,<br /></em><em>how easy it is to get to,</em><em><br />how it looks-and-feels to its users,</em><em><br />how it attracts the people who most need it,<br /></em><em>how it ensures that a good start leads naturally to on-going use,<br />and how it gets located in people&rsquo;s natural networks.</em></p>
<p>These are features of accessibility and credibility.&nbsp; And most people don&rsquo;t get any kind feel for them solely on claims to operational expertise or evidence of training.&nbsp; They want to know about who they are dealing with.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why rates-of-use depend on how the service inhabits its society.&nbsp; People need to recognise it as belonging to them - linked to their lives.</p>
<p>Most people have links to schools - whether in past-experience or through current family-and-neighbourhood.&nbsp; A good many of our schools have worked hard to offer a comprehending and welcoming ambience.&nbsp; And, for a time, it looked as though guidance workers would be based in schools.&nbsp; But it's hard to see what can happen now.</p>
<p>This blog takes a look at the background dynamics of this situation.&nbsp; It considers what seems likely in restructuring schools and reforming curriculum.&nbsp; But, most importantly, it looks for consequences in the ambience of schools.&nbsp; If, because of these developments, we cannot see how innovative careers work can be located in schools, then we are not going to give up.&nbsp; We will go elsewhere. &nbsp;So we now need to stand back, and look around.</p>
<p>The government claims that it&rsquo;s restructuring of schooling will liberate us all.&nbsp; But what we know of the US and Swedish experience suggests that such reforms offer freedom only to those in a position to grasp it.&nbsp; These dynamics will exclude too many who are not in that position, and who do not see things that way.</p>
<p>However, it is not structures but curriculum which will - for good or ill - do most to re-shape life-chances.&nbsp; Ministers plainly favour a subject-based, content-driven curriculum - dedicated to rising standards.&nbsp; It accords with the use of curriculum as a means of maximising competitive advancement.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a narrow basis for working with schools.&nbsp; Any progressive idea, that curriculum is to enable people in their management of a pressurised life in a changing world, needs more - linking subject-to-subject, school-to-community, and learning-to-life. &nbsp;The organisations supporting such movement in curriculum are being dismantled.</p>
<p>And what of ambience?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too soon to say what the effects will be of the take-up on new structures and reformed curriculum.&nbsp; And, so, we can&rsquo;t yet know what that will do to management style, staff commitment and student engagement. The rhetoric of reform is for a releasing local innovation.&nbsp; But, as innovators, we are entitled to our doubts.&nbsp; Can narrowly conceived, cash-strapped and risk-averse schools be drivers of the kind reform which will welcome inventive and inclusive careers work?</p>
<p>Time to step back, and wonder &lsquo;which way is forward?&rsquo;.&nbsp; Knowing why any careers-work initiative is &lsquo;a good idea&rsquo; has never been that obvious.&nbsp; And, for more than two decades, the most pressing answers to the question have been tied to policy - its frameworks, its performance indicators and its funding streams.&nbsp; Careers work has been an enthusiastic player.</p>
<p>At the same time links to commerce have tightened.&nbsp; Schooling has long been under pressure to supply the qualities needed for &rsquo;a job of work&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, for most people, work never was a way of matching self to personal fulfillment.&nbsp; And now less than ever.&nbsp; A consequence is that we have lost chances to learn how to work with a wider range of culturally-rooted ways of seeing how life, work and self are brought together differently in different localities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, speaking of commercial pressures, education is increasingly seen as a marketable product.&nbsp; And who knows how far that trend will go?&nbsp; Or how a school-based careers service would stand in relation to it?</p>
<p>Too many open questions here.&nbsp; But underlying all of them are the dynamics of who, in the future, will have the stronger pull on schooling - national government or global commerce?&nbsp; It is certainly too soon to say how changes in structure, curriculum and ambience will manage things. &nbsp;But we would be foolish to allow ourselves to be nudged into whatever marginal space that resolution assigns us.</p>
<p>So what else is there?&nbsp; &lsquo;The big society&rsquo; is urged where individuals make government smaller - through individual volunteering, and by a responsible citizenry.&nbsp; But individuals already have roles in government - as voters and constituents.&nbsp; And in commerce - as shoppers and investors.&nbsp; The &lsquo;big society&rsquo; is a weak answer to a tendentious question.&nbsp; We may wonder whether its grand-parentage is Lady Bountiful or Reaganomics.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean that we should dispose of the case for strengthening what is much more usefully understood as &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Civil society is where a person finds life-roles outside of what markets might urge or policy might require.&nbsp; They are in family and neighborhood attachments, in cultural and working affiliations, in sporting allegiances and leisure pursuits.&nbsp; We all do it: rich and poor, tough-minded 'maximisers' and easy-going 'sufficers', the 'included' and the 'excluded'.</p>
<p>None of these commitments need call up political or commercial interests.&nbsp; And we all learn in them all.&nbsp; Indeed - before the industrial revolution, and after it - civil society was, and is, education&rsquo;s natural home.&nbsp; At the extremes it can mean &lsquo;de-schooling society&rsquo;.&nbsp; Though, more probably, it means finding too much of schooling too narrowly constrained to be useful for more than front-loading into recruitment and selection.&nbsp; Whatever we find, the greater the squeeze on natural, informal and recognisable locations for life-relevant learning, the more we should work with them.</p>
<p>The squeeze is intensifying.&nbsp; The boundaries between commerce, civil society and government have never been secure.&nbsp; Pincer-pressure from commerce and government is relentless - it&rsquo;s what they are there to do. &nbsp;But something else is happening: educationists are occupying and refurnishing a reclaimed civil-social space.&nbsp; A growing number of voluntary, social-enterprise, and charitable organisations are:</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vigorously consulting with local government - on which initiatives its neighbourhoods need to be established, protected and extended;<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; firmly voicing resurgent professional concerns for the future of education - to the point of blocking government requirements;<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authoritatively rescuing proven ideas for useful curriculum reform - in defiance of government rejection;<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; widely coordinating curriculum development - for consortiums with shared programme intentions;<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creatively setting up community-based programmes of learning, particularly in learning-for-living - moving from personal health to the protection of the environment.</p>
<p>Oh! and:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; constructively canvassing innovative ideas for careers-work action - working them into useful and effective programmes for contemporary careers work.</p>
<p>As you can see, this is no rag-bag movement.&nbsp; All are developing new lines of interactive exchange; opening up new settings for reform; and engaging helpers, learners and stakeholders in new partnerships-for-learning.&nbsp; All can work with schools and colleges - or without them.</p>
<p>Neither is this an escape into nostalgia - there is no way back.&nbsp; And - anyway - it is impossible to see how the fast-moving and adaptive exchanges we now need can be enabled except through the internet.</p>
<p>Progressive advance needs progressive energy.&nbsp; Where it can be found in schools, good.&nbsp; Where it can&rsquo;t, we must look elsewhere.</p>

              <title>Q5: Web 2.0 tools for building &#39;pedagogical wraparounds&#39; in OERs?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2777</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2777</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>A culture of sharing and building more context around OERs were among the key and core tasks that are perceived as critical to meeting the needs of students, according to forty leaders in open education and technology who met in Barcelona on October 19-20, 2009, at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://openedtech.org/">Open EdTech Summit</a> sponsored by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.uoc.edu/">Open University of Catalunya</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmc.org/">New Media Consortium. </a></p>
<p><em>Creating the university of the future</em> was the title of the summit and the question is how and whether Open Educational Resources (OERs) are also examples of creative use of Web 2.0 in a higher education context.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://oet.wiki.nmc.org/CallToAction">Call to Action summarizes</a> the major findings of the 2009 Open EdTech Summit; Of those, point 5 is of particular interest:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Content producers and users alike must embrace strategies (reflective blogging, metadata, documentation of process, visualization of learning, etc.) for linking content generation to "pedagogical wraparounds" that embed context within effective learning practices. Such strategies would ensure that the focus remains on learning objectives and process, rather than on the technology used to deliver the learning materials.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What tools, platforms and environments are available and have been a success thus far in this respect? </li>
<li>What are the barriers for embedding such context? </li>
<li>technical literacies, time commitments? </li>
<li>what are the ways to inter-connect pedagogies around OER use? </li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This strategy sets out the steps that we are taking to ensure that every young person, wherever they live and whatever their talents, receives excellent IAG. It builds on our Schools White Paper1 where we said that it was both a moral and an economic imperative to ensure every young person turns 18 with the knowledge, skills and qualifications to give them the best chance of success in adult life in the 21st century. Those students who started secondary school this September will be the first to stay in learning until 18. High quality IAG will be essential in enabling these young people to make the most of the new opportunities that will be available to them.</p>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2295</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Bridging the gap between policy and practice: a reflective review and looking forward to the future Session: e-learning as policy for education.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Without a doubt e-learning is now truly embedded in all educational institutions; from the provision of an appropriate technological infrastructure to support teaching, research and administrative activities in the institutions through to the innovative use of technologies for learning. National and international policies in the area reflect this and are filled with rhetoric about the potential technologies offer for education &ndash; personalisation, flexibility, adaptively, lifelong learning and engaging authentic and immersive environment. However, closer inspection suggests that there is still a gap between the promises inherent in the policy rhetoric and actual use in practice. The talk will focus on a e-learning timeline, mapping the shifting directions of policy perspectives and their subsequent impact on practice. It will reflect on implications for the future.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some of the key questions for me are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the current e-learning policy drives/agenda?</li>
<li>To what extent is policy impact on practice?</li>
<li>How much are newer social and technological trends being reflected in e-learning policy? </li>
<li>How wide is the gap between policy and actual practice?</li>
<li>What interventions might be put in place to narrow the gap between policy and practice?</li>
</ul>
