              <title>SAT: Break Out of the Box! How you can use xAPI to free in-house staff development (Katherine Hinchey)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>You learn by doing and collaborating, watching videos, accessing just-in-time information from your mobile device, mentoring, and more. Why, then, does the Human Resources department only give you slides to learn from?</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s workers and corporations are united in wanting more access to the formal, non-formal, and informal learning needed to support an increasingly skilled workforce (The Education Commission, 2016; Pew Research Center, 2016a and 2016b). However, today&rsquo;s corporations largely store their learning resources in virtual learning environments (VLEs) that have adopted a uniform way of storing content. This uniform way, called SCORM, was incredibly helpful when it was designed nineteen years ago, and it still has an important role to play today. When SCORM was created, computer-based training was relatively new and organisations needed a single way to store and track training. For a time, innovation in elearning stopped at the known, established boundaries of the VLE (Weller, 2014, p. 194).</p>
<p>Now, a new need has developed: a way to store and track learning when it occurs on mobile devices, or through social and collaborative activities, or offline by reading a book or engaging in stretch assignments, or when participating in simulations or augmented and virtual reality programmes.</p>
<p>An innovation that meets that need was first released in 2013, and had its last planned update in 2016. It is the Experience API (xAPI). xAPI provides a common format for capturing data from today&rsquo;s distributed learning landscape (Rustici Software, n.d.). With xAPI in place, you can free staff development from the confines of SCORM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rely less on elearning courses designed from slides and more on learning experiences;</li>
<li>Recognise learning from formal and informal or non-formal activities (Downes, 2015);</li>
<li>And track not only clicks and views but also correlate learning with performance (Torrance, 2016).</li>
</ul>
<p>Managers and other decision-makers within learning departments and organisations are at a critical point. They need a source from which to gain a high-level, jargon-free understanding of the benefits of xAPI, common applications and uses of xAPI to support learners as they access modern and innovative learning opportunities, best practices and lessons learned, and information they should provide to their learning development and learning technology teams to prepare for implementation of xAPI (HT2 Labs, n.d.).</p>
<p>In my conference presentation, I will discuss and share a workshop created to meet those needs. The workshop helps managers, even those without extensive technical backgrounds, to be prepared to move forward with discussions and decisions about xAPI within their organisation. My presentation will show some of the workshop features and provide attendees with tools they can take with them, for use in their future endeavours.</p>

              <title>WED: How can Next Generation Digital Learning Environments fulfil the promise of online education? (Elizabeth Ellis)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10197</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10197</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This multimedia poster session on the theme of Innovation will ask, &lsquo;How can Next Generation Digital Environments embody and execute the promise of online education?&rsquo; As the higher education sector comes to terms with the idea that there is probably not a single &lsquo;solution&rsquo; to the problems inherent to virtual learning environments (VLEs), the term NGDLE is starting to creep into horizon scanning conversations among learning technologists.</p>
<p>A product of their time, VLEs are increasingly problematic in a more socially networked and digitally confident world. VLEs can often be passive repositories of learning material and grades, guilty of simply putting the offline online, rather than providing immersive personalised learning environments - teaching spaces with their own methods and approaches taking advantage of what the digital world has to offer students.</p>
<p>Now that we are in a Teaching Excellence Framework landscape, how should NGDLEs effectively help students succeed in their academic and professional careers? By providing them with personalised learning experiences and the acquisition of lifelong learning skills (HEFCE, 2016)? Should NGDLEs drive behavioural change in our students and our teaching staff? How can we easily identify the user requirements of an NGDLE?</p>
<p>An ongoing consultation challenge from Jisc poses the question, &lsquo;What should the next generation of digital learning environments do?&rsquo; (Jisc, 2016)</p>
<p>Online learning continues to be highly emotive, with those who use technology to teach online often being accused of trying to delete or diminish the human element of learning. Particularly with learning analytics becoming increasingly more mainstream, and the conflation of learning analytics with personal data and privacy concerns, educational technology is under scrutiny from the academic and student communities.</p>
<p>This session will ask:</p>
<p>1) What are NGDLEs?</p>
<p>2) What do NGDLEs mean for online education, and what does it require of it?</p>
<p>3) How can NGDLEs be a vehicle for the best parts of online education: the open web, co-creation, student engagement, technology, and digital capability?</p>
<p>4) What does student success look like in an NGDLE?</p>
<p>5) What do NGDLEs signify about innovation in online education?</p>
<p>Even if there is no single technological leap forward with regards to digital learning environments, NGDLEs could represent a disruptive or incremental innovation in online learning and teaching. As we challenge our students to take more ownership through participative learning, as we encourage our students to become more digitally confident and creative, as we provide our students with the tools for deeper engagement with learning materials and new strategies for immersive learning, and as we continue to help them battle with the ongoing curse and joy of collaborative learning, taking an active stance with regard to the development of future digital learning environments can help improve trust between online learning and teaching evangelists and sceptics, and ultimately improve student attainment, progression and retention.</p>

              <title>A well-designed VLE or LMS can support any kind of online learning activity, so there is no need to use web tools for learning.</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I participated in two teaching/learning conferences where presentations included a fairly equal mix of LMS/VLE and web 2.0 activities; a fair number included a 'mash up' of both. Stories were told in hallways about institutions requiring the use of the 'official' learning technology, while in some sessions participants were launched straight into the cloud with no visible means of support.</p>
<p>Technology-enhanced learning and practice is in a volatile state, and everyone seems to have an opinion about the relative merits of an institutional LMS or VLE vs the cloud, with 'mash-ups' of both technologies widespread. Is compromise a real solution, or should we commit to one or the other?</p>
<p>It has been suggested that a well-designed VLE or LMS can support any kind of online learning activity, so there is no need to use web tools for learning. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>]]></description>

<p>Where:&nbsp;<strong>The Hub, Medlar and Juniper Rooms, Walton Hall</strong></p>
<p>Time: <strong>12th&nbsp;October 2010, 10.00-12.00</strong></p>
<p>Presenters: <strong>Will Woods (IET), Barbara Poniatowska and Liz Burton-Pye (LIO)</strong></p>
<p>This event&nbsp;focused on the future visioning work and explained the developments planned within the current &ldquo;Roadmap Acceleration Programme&rdquo; as well as discussing requirements for the future VLE. Participants&nbsp;were asked to speak up on what they want (and really, really don't want) in the next generation OU VLE.&nbsp; They also&nbsp;heard more about the Roadmap Acceleration Programme and future learning systems.&nbsp;See also&nbsp;the <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/oulife/podcast-626" target="_blank">Future of the VLE</a> podcast from David Wilson to learn more about what is being planned.</p>
<p>Participation took the form of a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.peopleandparticipation.net/display/Methods/World+Cafe" target="_blank">World Caf&eacute;</a>&nbsp;style session. This invited attendees to write on tablecloths at themed table&nbsp;to indicate their support for (or aversion to) particular aspects of key developments around &ldquo;User Generated Content&rdquo;, &ldquo;Personalisation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Joining up&rdquo; (how we can mix the informal and formal learning environments, including how we join up our OER&rsquo;s with VLE and other repositories). Attendees'&nbsp;ideas and their how they see the various aspects of the OU's future learning system co-existing were&nbsp;a focus for the event.</p>

I am a Support for Learning Teacher in   Midlothian and I am just coming to the end of the first year of my EdD   with The Open Univeristy. The focus of my research has been to   investigate what teachers think about glow. What is its purpose? Is it   fit for purpose? How are teachers using it.&nbsp; As part of my research I   asked teachers across Scotland to complete a survy in surveymonkey. Well   the report is finally written and I&rsquo;d like to share my results with   you. I am also hoping that once I recover from the last month and the   hectic write up phase that I will be also able to use this blog to help   my research.

              <description><![CDATA[As an alternative to a three-day residential school, this course offers an online equivalent in which students not only work on the same group task – developing a business case – but run through a sequence of activities to establish their ability to work as a team in the online environment.

Across an 18 day period, the students first learn to make their thinking explicit through activities such as deciding as a group whether each of a set of statements is true or false. Next they discuss and propose solutions to work-based problems. Only after that do they start work on the business case for an imaginary company – the scenario being designed to be too big for any student to complete on their own, requiring them to divide up the tasks.
 
As a final stage, the students review the business case they have produced, their team processes, and the exercise as a whole.

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/275</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This law course had a problem with poor student performance in a compulsory introductory module which was supposed to establish basic factual knowledge and reasoning skill. Student feedback showed that they often did not understand what was expected of them until their assessment.
<p>
So the lecturer created a series of online quizzes to provide formative assessment throughout the module. The immediacy of the feedback compensated for its necessary brevity and generic nature, and a study found that those students who took the quizzes did better in all aspects of the final examination, including higher order cognitive skills such as synthesis and evaluation.

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/271</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[Higher order professional skills, such as critical thinking and problem solving, need either a practice environment or a rich scenario for their development, and preferably also a community of fellow professionals.

This postgraduate certificate course for university staff uses multimedia case studies of two fictional universities – ‘Crumpton’ and ‘Mullock’ – featuring realistic scenarios presented in cartoon form. Online communication tools allow learners to discuss the problems raised and recommend solutions, linking into face-to-face classes for those able to attend them.

              <description><![CDATA[Students often progress at different speeds, for example where theoretical concepts are concerned, but contact time with teachers is limited – especially when students are attending college on a day-release basis, as on this course.

Here, the leader of a course on gas services installation and maintenance assembled VLE resources – such as notes and handouts, diagrams, photographs, and videos – to allow students to reinforce difficult concepts at their own pace and then follow them up in class. The VLE also delivers practice assessments and mock exams.

              <description><![CDATA[Critical use of sources by professionals usually involves repeated reading and consideration of many possible meanings. Courses which aim to develop this skill should therefore not be assume that students will make only one reading, but rather encourage them to return to sources in different contexts.

This course on Western Civilisation seeks to teach historical skills and understanding through study of discrete topics, rather than systematic knowledge of 350 years of European history. Students given access to hypermedia (eg web-based) resources are found to return to them much more often than those using equivalent printed resources; having the resources “just a click away” makes re-reading easier. However, it’s significant that the assessments are designed so that re-use of resources obviously improves the students’ submission.

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/264</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[Working at dissertation level requires students to be capable of independent study and critical use of primary source material. However, students may need scaffolding to develop these skills, and a collection of primary sources in printed form can be limiting.
<p>
This design proposes the creation of an online database of about 200 wide-ranging primary sources. As an assessed activity, students will select one document and use the VLE to write a critical comment on it. They also write a comment on the commentary of another student in their tutor group, and respond to comments on their own commentary. Later, they will use primary sources from the database to answer a set question for their end-of-course assessment.

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/240</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<strong>When students need to master a large body of knowledge quickly, computer-marked assessment can give them regular, rapid feedback.</strong>

<p>Students of accounting, like many professional disciplines, have to acquire a large body of technical knowledge very quickly and thoroughly. Computer-marked assessment is widely regarded, in both the accounting profession and HE, as the most effective way for students of this subject to obtain regular, quick feedback on their learning.
<p>
This course has six interactive computer marked assignments (iCMAs) during the 13 months course: two in each of the three units or blocks. Each iCMA has 100 objective questions, with answers being multiple choice or simple text entry (eg filling in gaps). These iCMAs are formative assessment – for students to identify their own strengths and weaknesses and to allocate time in classroom teaching; summative assessment is by separate assignments and exams.
