              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Multimedia Poster</h2>
<p>For an introduction to the project presentation please see the >multimedia poster</a> . I have also created an >accessible version</a> of my poster for people with sight challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Social exclusion has continued to be an enormous issue despite the increase in technologically rich learning platforms on the internet. A lot of those who use mobile technology have access to the internet but are unaware of the existence or use of OER (Online Educational Resources) and so they are being left behind.</p>
<p>My project is focus on the adaptation of OER for English language teachers. The essence of the project is to provide help to ensure the provision of learning materials to the marginalised teachers in the developing world, especially those in sub-Saharan African countries such as Nigeria.</p>
<p>The project will sensitise the teachers and help them acquire information and knowledge on OER. The English language teachers on the project will discover alternative ways of demonstrating what they know, and this will lead to a change in their classrooms as they begin to challenge their learners in more productive ways using materials from the OER sites.</p>
<p>Most teachers in Nigeria use mobile technologies and are on social media app networks such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram. This project will empower the teachers and improve their access to professional development and education available via OER sites (See O&rsquo;Connor, 2000). OER offers a plethora of choices.</p>
<p>My presentation will consider how systems can be created for teachers to have access to OER repositories. In recent times, there has been an increase in internet-based network of freely available online resources for learning and teaching. These open educational resources include highly interactive and innovative curricula, visualizations, simulations and lesson plans. There are features that support the use of real-world resources (see McArthur &amp; Zia 2008; Zia, 2001; Borgman et al., 2008). These increasingly available online resources are infrastructure available for teachers to use, access, and share, connect, create and adapt resources in ways that can change their practice (Borgman et al. 2008).</p>
<p>In the presentation, I will demonstrate that the use of social media technologies has an essential place in teacher professional development because teachers learn voluntarily. Teachers use forums to reflect on own practices and exchange ideas with colleagues (see Marcia &amp; Garcia, 2016). So, instant messaging software have helped teachers to adapt information, to re-conceptualize and to make information much more functional for their contexts (Cranefield &amp; Yoong, 2009). In very recent years, mobile learning devices have offered a variety of learning opportunities (see Macia &amp; Garcia, 2016; Rambe &amp; Bere, 2013; Cakir &amp; Arslan, 2013; Hwang, Huang &amp; Wu, 2011).</p>
<p>Given that WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook stand out in many studies as effective tools and applications used by many people and available in mobile devices. It is easy to create online community of practice using WhatsApp, Telegram or Facebook (see Baran &amp; Cagiltay, 2010; Wesley, 2013) and many teachers all over the world use WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook for social and learning purposes.</p>

              <title>FRI: Bridging The Employability Gap (Bernadette Laffey)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bridging the Employability gap: Development of a workshop to support widening participation students to use social media effectively for career planning and job search.</p>
<p>Widening participation initiatives by government have focused on making higher education accessible to students who are at risk of social exclusion for a range of reasons, including economic hardship, disability, caring responsibilities, ethnicity and being the first in family to go to university.</p>
<p>While initiatives have been successful in attracting widening participation students into higher education, it is still the case that widening participation students are at greater risk of not completing their studies, and are less likely to secure the best graduate jobs. (Budd, 2017). As an example, just 57% of state school educated graduates are recruited into graduate schemes though they make up 90% of undergraduates and under half of disabled undergraduates secure graduate jobs (Ball and Hooley, 2018). This is the employability gap.</p>
<p>Reasons for this disparity are complex but include the following: Lack of social capital, lack of cultural capital, low confidence and lack of resources. Many widening participation students do not have the safety net of parents who can subsidise their study, and often work long hours to support families and cover living costs. They are unable to undertake unpaid internships and less likely to have the time to attend professional networking events. They do not have a ready-made network of contacts to help them access work experience opportunities.</p>
<p>Social media has become an increasingly important tool used by employers to advertise vacancies, search for candidates, and vet applicants. Consequently, careers services run social media workshops and signpost students to online resources to help them develop their digital identity, and professional networks, as part of career planning and job search.</p>
<p>A recurring theme of one to one career interviews with widening participation students has been students&rsquo; lack of confidence in using social media for professional reasons. Many students have a LinkedIn profile, but there is an unrealistic expectation that the LinkedIn profile alone will enable employers to find and recruit them. They are less clear about the long-term benefits of active professional networking online and how to present themselves online. They lack &lsquo;digital wisdom&rsquo; (Sutherland and Ho ,2017).</p>
<p>A follow up survey was conducted with 30 first year students and confirmed that they are most concerned about how to build their profile and engage appropriately online. Their preferred source of support was a face to face workshop, followed closely by peer support. Other research has shown how business students need more classroom support to develop effective digital identities (Slone and Gaffney, 2016).</p>
<p>This informed the decision to develop a face to face workshop which would include collaborative working, and which could be adapted for different subject groups. The conference presentation will review the key features of this resource. It will also examine whether using online professional networks fulfils the promise of building social capital, helping widening participation students to compete more equitably in the graduate job market.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>You learn by doing and collaborating, watching videos, accessing just-in-time information from your mobile device, mentoring, and more. Why, then, does the Human Resources department only give you slides to learn from?</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s workers and corporations are united in wanting more access to the formal, non-formal, and informal learning needed to support an increasingly skilled workforce (The Education Commission, 2016; Pew Research Center, 2016a and 2016b). However, today&rsquo;s corporations largely store their learning resources in virtual learning environments (VLEs) that have adopted a uniform way of storing content. This uniform way, called SCORM, was incredibly helpful when it was designed nineteen years ago, and it still has an important role to play today. When SCORM was created, computer-based training was relatively new and organisations needed a single way to store and track training. For a time, innovation in elearning stopped at the known, established boundaries of the VLE (Weller, 2014, p. 194).</p>
<p>Now, a new need has developed: a way to store and track learning when it occurs on mobile devices, or through social and collaborative activities, or offline by reading a book or engaging in stretch assignments, or when participating in simulations or augmented and virtual reality programmes.</p>
<p>An innovation that meets that need was first released in 2013, and had its last planned update in 2016. It is the Experience API (xAPI). xAPI provides a common format for capturing data from today&rsquo;s distributed learning landscape (Rustici Software, n.d.). With xAPI in place, you can free staff development from the confines of SCORM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rely less on elearning courses designed from slides and more on learning experiences;</li>
<li>Recognise learning from formal and informal or non-formal activities (Downes, 2015);</li>
<li>And track not only clicks and views but also correlate learning with performance (Torrance, 2016).</li>
</ul>
<p>Managers and other decision-makers within learning departments and organisations are at a critical point. They need a source from which to gain a high-level, jargon-free understanding of the benefits of xAPI, common applications and uses of xAPI to support learners as they access modern and innovative learning opportunities, best practices and lessons learned, and information they should provide to their learning development and learning technology teams to prepare for implementation of xAPI (HT2 Labs, n.d.).</p>
<p>In my conference presentation, I will discuss and share a workshop created to meet those needs. The workshop helps managers, even those without extensive technical backgrounds, to be prepared to move forward with discussions and decisions about xAPI within their organisation. My presentation will show some of the workshop features and provide attendees with tools they can take with them, for use in their future endeavours.</p>

<p>Livestream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn35Ueu7DSs</p>
<p>This talk will present the early findings of a project which conducted research into the anonymous social media platform Yik Yak over 2016/17. Yik Yak was a location-based social media app, launched in 2013, which very quickly became ubiquitously adopted by students on university and college campuses in the US and the UK. It allowed users located within the same geographical area to create and respond to short, anonymous posts, and quickly emerged as an often-controversial space in which candid and dynamic issues were raised and discussed by young users, alongside much-publicised incidents of hate and victimisation.</p>
<p>Over the period of the research, Yik Yak shifted from being a vibrant community platform for undergraduates at Edinburgh, to a rapid decline in use and final closure in May 2017. This talk will discuss what we can learn about the value of anonymous social media through the death of this platform and the student community and network which inhabited it. It will suggest that universities need to ask serious questions about their duty of care toward students in social media, the sociotechnical &lsquo;imaginaries&rsquo; which we use to understand platforms, and the need to support ongoing research on student social media use.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3>Joel Kerr&rsquo;s design narrative: Secret Belfast</h3>
<h4>Narrator</h4>
<p>Having just moved to Belfast after three years of university in England I wanted to know more about what the city was about. There was plenty of publicity for the commercially viable activities but I had heard Belfast had a particularly vibrant &lsquo;underground&rsquo; social scene and I wanted to learn more about that.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Situation</h4>
<p>As I was new to the city I had no contacts that could teach me accepted practises of the social scene or introduce me to the community so I realised social networking would play a key role.</p>
<p>Following a few failed attempts at websites and blogs I discovered a Facebook group called &lsquo;Secret London&rsquo; which aimed to unearth the lesser known locations and events in London. I decided to set up a similar group for Belfast. After a few friends joined and a link to the group appeared in their activity feed, friends of friends joined out of curiosity. The group soon went viral and membership grew in thousands.</p>
<p>The description in the Facebook group was to share your Belfast secrets so we could learn from one another. Very soon members were posting news of events, favourite restaurants, creative groups and other projects. They were starting their own discussions in the forums and my role went from influencer to moderator, as the group took on a life of its own.</p>
<p>Due to press interest my role further evolved to organiser as I went from someone on the periphery of Belfast to someone who was considered an expert on what was going on. I got the opportunity to work with local creatives to organise events unearthing talent or activities in &lsquo;secret&rsquo; locations. The group moved from Facebook to include Twitter, a blog and a YouTube channel.</p>
<p>The common goal of each of the key players was to facilitate innovation within Belfast and foster creativity in it&rsquo;s many forms. We each had something unique to offer and we learnt from one another to advance ideas as opposed to achieving goals.</p>
<p>Everyone played a role whether they were an expert in their field, someone who like to spread the word or simply someone who wanted to do something a bit different.</p>
<h4>Task</h4>
<p>The aim was to learn what was unique about Belfast. Every city has big shopping centres, nice restaurants and trendy night spots but they do not contribute to the personality of the location.</p>
<p>Success would be knowing <em>all </em>the things to do and the people involved with them.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Actions</h4>
<p>The actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Curiosity</li>
<li>Experimentation</li>
<li>Discovery of an existing practise that could be replicated</li>
<li>Taking action. <em>This can cause embarrassment as you might mess up through trial and error or people question your motives and laugh at your efforts. Keep plugging on!</em></li>
<li>Successful implementation <em>The project was much more successful than I had anticipated. It required a lot of time and effort in moderating forums, answering questions, facilitating debates, speaking to the press and reacting to peoples requests for collaboration</em></li>
<li>Growth <em>There were a number of additional social channels that I could take advantage of in order to engage more people</em></li>
<li>Collaboration <em>The project would&rsquo;ve fallen flat on its face without enlisting expertise from existing projects, and organisations.</em></li>
<li>Innovation <em>In order to continue engaging people I had to come up with ideas to spark their interest</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The obstacles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Abuse <em>Giving people open access can lead to inappropriate posts. I found that a few sharp words was a better alternative to deleting the posts. It soon stopped</em></li>
<li>Spam <em>Popular online forums are susceptible to unwanted sales pitches. Eventually I had to lock down access and approve people who genuinely had something to share</em></li>
<li>Expertise <em>Because it was my group people assumed I had all the answers so I had to enlist relevant experts</em></li>
</ol>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>Expected outcomes:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn more about the personality of the city</li>
<li>Learn about the lesser known events and activities</li>
<li>Meet the people involved in these events and activities</li>
</ol>
<p>Unexpected outcomes</p>
<ol>
<li>Expertise in using social media</li>
<li>Expertise in organising events and promoting them via social media</li>
<li>Experience dealing with the media</li>
<li>Learning new skills from local experts (videography and audio production)</li>
<li>The ability to quickly launch new projects using my acquired knowledge and influence</li>
<li>The ability to help other creatives promote themselves for free</li>
</ol>
<h4>Reflections</h4>
<p>By acting on my initial curiosity I not only learnt about the city I live in, I became proud to be associated with it and found myself in a position to influence its development from a grass roots level.</p>
<p>I have replicated the process a few times to varying degrees of success. Each time I used the same format:</p>
<ol>
<li>An intriguing title</li>
<li>A focused message</li>
<li>A manageable use of social media</li>
<li>The right tone of voice</li>
<li>The ability for users to actively influence the progress</li>
</ol>
<p>The one obstacle I haven&rsquo;t managed to overcome is people&rsquo;s suspicion at why Secret Belfast is free for them to use, they assume there will be hidden costs.</p>]]></description>

<p>Chairs: Maarten de Laat, Caroline Haythornthwaite, Shane Dawson &amp; Dan Suthers</p>
<p>Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS) 47,</p>
<p>January 6-9, 2014, Waikoloa, Big Island, HI</p>
<p><strong>PAPERS DUE: June 15, 2013</strong> via the HICSS conference system</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu/hicss_47/47cfp.pdf">http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu/hicss_47/47cfp.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Social Media &amp; Learning</strong></p>
<p>This minitrack calls for papers that address leading edge use of technology, research methods and system design to analyze and support learning in social networks. The ability to generate and maintain rich networked connections through social media, social networking, crowdsourcing, cloud technology, and social computing has a profound impact on the way we solve problems, learn, innovate and develop our identities, and the value this creates for individuals and groups. This minitrack will bring together state of the art research that furthers social theories of networking and learning, such as networked learning, collaborative learning, viral learning, and social capital, in combination with for example social and learning analytics and social network analysis to help visualize, develop and facilitate formal, non-formal and informal networking and learning settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We call for papers that use, analyze and/or develop technology and online tools to examine social networking and learning phenomena through social media. We specifically welcome papers that address new and exciting areas of research in the networking and learning potential of social media or the potential value social media creates for connectivity, development, and growth. Some of this work might be driven by social media and networking research in relation to education, organizations, gaming, simulation and 3d worlds. We encourage papers that address learning and value creation through social media in any setting: education, work, daily life, home, and &lsquo;serious leisure&rsquo;. Appropriate social media and learning behavior ranges from same-time, same-place to anytime, anywhere that increases interactions among participants via social media in formal and informal learning settings and mixtures thereof, and may include collectives from learning crowds to communities, teams and networks of practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We envision that papers will:</p>
<ul>
<li>examine the foundations for social media and learning in online networks, crowds and communities;</li>
<li>analyze and/or support the role of social media and networks in learning;</li>
<li>address value creation in social media and online communities and networks;</li>
<li>develop methods for analyzing social media and learning;</li>
<li>implement social network analysis to reflect social media, networking and learning processes;</li>
<li>address awareness and visualization of social networks and communities;</li>
<li>develop metrics for characterizing and following social networking and learning trends;</li>
<li>implement and develop tools for automated data capture and data analytics on social networking and learning;</li>
<li>discuss empirical trends in social networking and learning on and through the Internet, including issues and opportunities relating to information literacy, literacy and new media, ubiquitous learning, viral learning and entrepreneurial learning;</li>
<li>examine economic models, trends and markets for social media and learning, including open source and open access and viral models;</li>
<li>examine the design and facilitation of social media and learning in online networks, crowds and communities;</li>
<li>show development and use of new social media tools, devices (laptops, mobiles, OLPC ), and spaces and their networking and value creation potential; or</li>
<li>discuss ethical issues relating to learning online, including issues relating to data capture, analysis and display, and learning about controversial subjects or anti-social activities.</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I didn't really get this but spent a lot of time trying to understand. I found some of the instructions/ advice contradictory and couldn't figure out what a concern was and how it differed from a force until I had spent really 2 or 3 hours reconfiguring things. The thinking through was useful in that it helped me think about additional personas or actors in this project and therefore additonal challenges. But as with "rich pictures" in soft systems I just don't find this useful or natural to do. Anyway, I have uploaded a Force Map to google docs. Don't know how to embed here so see link.</p>
<p>Hoping for more success with this week's challenge and lots of help from my team mate.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Deborah Arnold: Dream 1: revamping online course / Dream 2: improving staff development programme</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7226</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7226</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dream N&deg;1 : online course on social media for learning</strong></p>
<p>I currently teach a 12-week totally online module on social media for teaching and learning, on the<a title="Description of AIGEME Master" href="http://www.univ-paris3.fr/master-2-aigeme-ifd-br-applications-informatiques-gestion-education-aux-medias-e-formation-br-i-parcours-ingenierie-de-la-formation-a-distance-i--26468.kjsp" target="_blank"> AIGEME Masters course</a> for Universit&eacute; Paris 3 Sorbonne-Nouvelle, with an international French-speaking intake of students. I co-teach this module with a great colleague based in Morocco. Until recently, the course was split in two parts, web 2.0 and analysis of educational media.</p>
<p>This year we have revamped the course to improve the integration of the two parts and to get the students using a specific Twitter hashtag for the course combined with content curation via <a title="Scoop.it topic for AIGEME module on social media for learning" href="http://www.scoop.it/t/master-aigeme-web-2-0-et-usages-dynamiques" target="_blank">scoop.it</a>. This revamp was the result of a joint reflection between my colleague and myself, but I would now like to apply what we will be learning in the OLDSMOOC to validate and improve these design choices. I suppose what I'm really looking for is a solid framework and for exchanges with others involved in a similar process.</p>
<p><strong>Dream N&deg;2: improve our staff development programme in teaching and learning innovation through the use of learning technology.</strong></p>
<p>When I arrived at the University of Burgundy a year ago, there was a sound staff development programme already in place, but for the areas dealt with by my department, the focus was mainly on tools (Moodle, podcasts, webconferencing..). We are gradually shifting the focus to 'pedagogical use' and have developed a course we co-run with the pedagogical innovation department, in which the starting point is the pedagogical scenario (project-based learning, collaborative learning...), bringing in the technology as a way of supporting these approaches. The first session is to take place on January 31st, so we still have a bit of time to refine the design, and this is where I hope the OLDSMOOC will come in handy! It will also help us in the evaluation stage. So again, if anyone else is working on staff development programmes in the field of learning technology, then let's team up!</p>

              <title>RadioActive: Informal Learning and Employability through Internet Radio and Social Media</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6360</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6360</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This research and development project is a new approach to conceptualising, designing and developing social media for informal learning within &lsquo;lived communities&rsquo;.&nbsp; It embodies the key pedagogical ideas of Paulo Freire and his notion of transformational (or emancipatory) learning through lived experience.&nbsp; These are applied to promote <em>the engagement, informal learning and employability of disenfranchised young people through internet radio and social media.</em> The project is also inspired by musical revolutions as varied as the birth of blues, punk, hip-hop and acid-house, and what Orson Welles called &lsquo;the confidence ignorance&rsquo;.&nbsp; Exploring rich and varied personal and community identities, and promoting their articulation, expression and positive transformation, are pivotal to RadioActive. It embodies a new approach to social media design - that is conceived as an intervention in existing digital and mixed-reality cultures. The fundamental idea is to catalyse, organise and legitimise the digital practices, content production and critical and creative potential of disenfranchised young people to provide a new and original community voice. This voice will combine the intimacy, relevance and &lsquo;touchability&rsquo; of local radio with the crowd sourcing power of social media. Critical and creative cultural development, embracing the underground and challenging the status quo through the expression of lived experience are all at play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under</em>&rdquo; (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, 1982).</p>
<p>This talk will:&nbsp; describe the rationale and pedagogical approach to design; the methodology for developing the RadioActive platform; our experiences and insights from a pilot project and a larger project (funded by Nominet Trust); and the broader implications for this and similar projects, when we consider the reality of designing learning for &lsquo;lived&rsquo; communities cultures.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Twitter: Why you need Twitter for study and research</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5944</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5944</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>If you are not using Twitter for study, here are five reasons why you should give it some serious thought:</p>
<p><strong>1 &nbsp; You get access to different points of view </strong>First, the value of your Twitter experience will depend largely on  the people you follow. Search Twitter for people in your field, authors, experts, practitioners. You will often see links to the author's Twitter feed on blogs, news stories and elsewhere. If they interest you, follow them. Once you have started following, say, 20 people, try searching all of the people they follow and connect with even more contacts in your field or area of interest.</p>
<p><strong>2&nbsp;</strong> <strong>The people you follow will point you to great resources you might not find otherwise </strong>Blogs are only one source of information. For emerging developments, trends, news and information about day-to-day events and practice, Twitter is an invaluable source. White and Green Papers, changes to legislation, book launches, new articles, upcoming conferences and events: these are all things you might expect to come across (via the people you follow) in an average day.</p>
<p><strong>3&nbsp; </strong><strong><strong>Y</strong>ou can consult your followers (and others in the Twitter community)&nbsp;</strong>Your peers are a rich resource for study and research, for testing opinions and your own hypotheses. You can also ask straight questions and seek advice from people with experience and knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>4 Twitter is a constantly updating search engine</strong> To find Tweets on subjects that interest you and to connect with the people who are talking about things you are interested in, try searching Twitter for key terms, as you would any other search engine.</p>
<p><strong>5 Twitter helps you build study and professional networks</strong> You will see some words have the # symbol in front of them, e.g. #highered (or higher education). These are hashtags. You can search Twitter for hashtags to find people who are tweeting on subjects you are interested in. Use them yourself (e.g. #K802) and it helps others to find and connect with you.</p>

              <title>Healthcare and social  media: lower costs and better outcomes?</title>

<p>One of the claims made most commonly about  social media is that it lowers costs and improves outcomes for  patients/service users. (Similar claims are often made for elearning.)  HSC practitioners need access to information and research if they are to  verify such claims. Currently, most of the available sources point to  the benefits; this is one example, '<a href="http://www.hpminstitute.org/Era_of_Twitter">Healthcare performance management in the era of Twitter</a>' from the Healthcare Performance Management Institute. It cites a number of case studies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Department of Veterans Affairs VistA  healthcare system,  which doctors used to communicate online  to coordinate care for three  million  members. Use of VistA cut healthcare costs by 30 per cent per  patient on average, by engaging patients in care regimens, by providing  care in a timely manner,  and thereby avoiding the cost of unnecessary  tests and procedures.</li>
<li>Toms River School District in New Jersey, which opened an employee  health  clinic and saved an average of $1,950 per head in  the first  three  months of operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>'The bottom line is that when patient information is more  tansparent, it enhances the delivery of healthcare, reduces costs and  improves quality. The information is also valuable for measuring what  forms of treatment work well and achieve the most successful outcomes.'</p>
<p>Of course, these claims reflect the interests of those who make them.  HSC practitioners need to be aware of these claims and able to assess  them using appropriate sources; and HSC students need to develop the  critical skills necessary to evaluate the impact on services of social  media.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<div>
<p>I've started tracking examples of social media  use in health and social care contexts. One thing that is clear is that  self-reported patient information on social networks may be used with  proper safeguards as research data. Two recent examples:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.plosone.org/search/simpleSearch.action?from=globalSimpleSearch&filterJournals=PLoSONE&query=patientslikeme&x=15&y=11">PloS One</a> (the peer-review and publishing site) is carrying a study of data submitted by members of <a href="http://www.tudiabetes.org/">TuDiabetes</a> (an international network of diabetes sufferes), which finds that  online social networks 'may comprise efficient platforms for  bidirectional communication with  and data acquisition from disease  populations.&nbsp; Advancing this model for  cohort and translational science  and for use as a complementary  surveillance approach will require  understanding of inherent selection  and publication (sharing) biases in  the data and a technology model that  supports autonomy, anonymity and  privacy.'</p>
<p>A similar study in the <a href="http://www.jmir.org/2010/2/e19/">Journal Med Internet Research</a> last year looked at <a href="http://www.patientslikeme.com/">Patientslikeme</a>, an  online quantitative research platform  where patients report on their  conditions and treatment, connect with other patients with similar  demographic and clinical characteristics, and learn from the  aggregated  data reports. The study considered the possible advantages of the  network in terms of treatment decisions, symptom management, clinical management, and outcomes. 'We have established that members  of the community reported a range of  benefits, and that these may be  related to the extent of site use. Third  party validation and  longitudinal evaluation is an important next step  in continuing to  evaluate the potential of online data-sharing  platforms.'</p>
<p>In other words, both studies indicate that social media offer a  viable source of data for health and social care research, but that care  is needed when collecting, verifying, interpreting and sharing this  category of information. There is scope here for us to refer module  teams to this potential of social networks, and to support them in devising suitable activities based on HSC-related networks. HSC students need certain skills in order to engage effectively with social networks in their  professional practice.</p>

These new tehnologies can stimulate discussion, open gateway through knowledge, promote creativity and innovation for effective learning. Teacher and also students should have an entitlement to safe internet access at all times. Pulling Piaget and Papert , the use of participatory media tools in education is typically geared towards, creating a more student centered, adaptive environnement where learners can contribute to the course material, formulate and express their own insights and opinion, construct their own understanding of material by connecting concepts, to personal experience or current events, and learn from one another in collaborative environments . Web 2.0 , social media and other digital and information tehnologies are powerful and interesting tools, which open up new opportunities for everyone and for this reason teachers and students must know how to use it nowadays in a safety mode.

              <description><![CDATA[<h4><strong>Andrew Ravenscroft, &nbsp;Steven Warburton, &nbsp;Stylianos Hatzipanagos,</strong><strong>and Gr&aacute;inne Conole&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<p>Although the widespread use of social media reflects how Web 2.0 technologies have become embedded in our lives, there are still significant challenges in harnessing these and their related practices for learning. One expectation is that they will provide the means to reconcile informal and formal learning to allow for a more seamless transition between meaningful activity inside and outside of educational institutions or the workplace. But how do we support such processes or progressions? The approach adopted in this symposium is to see <em>design</em>, or <em>learning design</em>, as the key paradigm to address this challenge. But designing for this constantly evolving technological landscape creates new problems and complexities. This symposium will present different approaches to design from experts who specialise in the field of social software for learning, and who are concerned with both bridging informal and formal learning and questioning what we consider to be legitimate learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Will design really make a difference to practice?   
<ul>
<li>Role of theory?   
<ul>
<li>Tensions with practice?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are your own experiences of using social media for learning-teaching?</li>
<li>What social media tools do you use in your practice?</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>In this presentation I will explore the changing landscape of Web 2.0 practices. I will look at the shift from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and more user-centered, participatory Web practices. I draw on a recent review of Web 2.0 practices in HIgher Education and present a typology of Web 2.0 tool types. I will argue that there are also both advantages and disadvantages to these tools and will illustrate this point by exploring how Twitter and SecondLife are being used in an educational context. I then consider the implications for education, focusing on four themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital literacy skills</li>
<li>The importance of context</li>
<li>Institutional barriers</li>
<li>Digital identity</li>
</ul>
<p>I conclude by putting forward a series of recomendations at three levels: teachers, institutions and national.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>"E-learning has become popular among educationists because of the inherent strengths and advantages it provides to the instructional process. Through e-learning initiatives in India dates back to 1999, it is in its infancy as not many institutions have jumped into the bandwagon. Many also cite the Internet penetration in the country as the cause of the current situation. At Staff Training and Research Institute of Distance Education (STRIDE), Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), we believe and understand that technological infrastructure alone is not sufficient for success of e-learning, through it may be a necessary pre-condition. Therefore, we have been engaged in dialogue, discussion and debate about the potential capabilities, strengths and limitations of online technologies in educational programmes. We have also been conducting training programmes on e-learning since July 2001. The <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Handbook</em> is our humble effort to put 'learning' before 'technology' in e-learning endeavours. We expect this <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Handbook</em> to be a starting point and reference guide to new as well as seasoned teachers to use e-learning in their teaching and learning, <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->both</em> at face-to-face and at a distance".</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.cudenver.edu/Academics/CUOnline/FacultyResources/Handbook/Pages/Handbook2009.aspx" target="_blank">CU Online Handbook 2009</a> is edited by Patrick R. Lowenthal, David Thomas, Anna Thai and Brian Yuhnke and is integral part of the activities to support faculty in using technlogy at CU Online. This new ebook aims &ldquo;to provide faculty an opportunity to engage in the scholarship of teaching.&rdquo;, mainly taking care of &ldquo;growth in own teaching&rdquo; and &ldquo;dialogue with colleagues about teaching and learning&rdquo;.<br /><br />In the introduction the authors state: <br />&ldquo;This handbook consists of four different sections. The first section is about<br />trends and issues with online learning. The second section is about technology in action.<br />The third section includes a brief summary of 25 different new emerging tools and<br />applications. The last section includes different resources that you might use in your<br />online classroom. Put together we hope to turn the CU Online Handbook into an<br />annual publication, a guide to what is new, a celebration of what works and a toolkit for<br />exploring new territory. Online education holds the promise to change the world. We&rsquo;re<br />excited about that future and looking forward to learning the hardest thing of all: How<br />to teach differently&rdquo;.</p>]]></description>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->A multiliterate teacher understands the many ways that technology interacts and intertwines with academic and interpersonal life, and actively learns how to gain control over those aspects impacting teaching, social, and professional development. Multiliterate individuals are aware of the pitfalls inherent in technology while striving for empowerment through effective strategies for first discerning and then taking advantage of those aspects of changing technologies most appropriate to their situations. These strategies include managing, processing, and interpreting a constant influx of information, filtering what is useful, and then enhancing the learning environment with the most appropriate applications.</p>

              <title>Q5: Web 2.0 tools for building &#39;pedagogical wraparounds&#39; in OERs?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2777</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2777</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>A culture of sharing and building more context around OERs were among the key and core tasks that are perceived as critical to meeting the needs of students, according to forty leaders in open education and technology who met in Barcelona on October 19-20, 2009, at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://openedtech.org/">Open EdTech Summit</a> sponsored by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.uoc.edu/">Open University of Catalunya</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmc.org/">New Media Consortium. </a></p>
<p><em>Creating the university of the future</em> was the title of the summit and the question is how and whether Open Educational Resources (OERs) are also examples of creative use of Web 2.0 in a higher education context.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://oet.wiki.nmc.org/CallToAction">Call to Action summarizes</a> the major findings of the 2009 Open EdTech Summit; Of those, point 5 is of particular interest:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Content producers and users alike must embrace strategies (reflective blogging, metadata, documentation of process, visualization of learning, etc.) for linking content generation to "pedagogical wraparounds" that embed context within effective learning practices. Such strategies would ensure that the focus remains on learning objectives and process, rather than on the technology used to deliver the learning materials.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What tools, platforms and environments are available and have been a success thus far in this respect? </li>
<li>What are the barriers for embedding such context? </li>
<li>technical literacies, time commitments? </li>
<li>what are the ways to inter-connect pedagogies around OER use? </li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2710</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>In the kick-off meeting, we had some discussions on how we can use technology to support intercultural competence assessment. We would build further on the WebCEF assessment tool (http://www.webcef.eu).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do we see the platform as a place where learners can reflect on their intercultural competences? Is it, on the other hand, an environment where communication between peers, learner and expert, etc. is supported and the assessment itself is made (as in WebCEF)? Is it both? :-)</p>
<p>It was also generally agreed that the application should also be accessible in more open environments such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Ning, etc. How can you include social aspects to intercultural competence assessment? What are the consequences of this for reliability, usefulness, privacy, access,...?</p>

              <title>Self-directed learning vs. formal/informal/non-formal learning</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2679</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2679</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://janeknight.typepad.com/socialmedia/2009/11/social-media-for-learning-part-2.html" target="_blank">blogpost </a>by Jane Hart, she suggests another way of categorising learning situations/contexts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rather than use the broad categories of formal and informal learning - terms which I think are&nbsp; pretty difficult to grasp, and which are being confused and abused if phrases I have read like "managing informal learning information" are anything to go by! - I have decided to categorise the use of social media in the following 5 different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>IOL - Intra-Organisational Learning</strong> - how social media     tools can be used to keep employees up to date and up     to speed on strategic and other internal initiatives</li>
<li><strong>FSL - Formal Structured Learning </strong>- how educators (teachers, trainers, learning designers) as well as students can use social media within education and training - for courses, classes, workshops etc</li>
<li><strong>GDL - Group Directed Learning</strong> - how groups of individuals     - teams, projects, study groups etc - can use social media to work     and learn together (a "group" could just be two people, so coaching     and mentoring falls into this category)</li>
<li><strong>PDL - Personal Directed Learning</strong> - how individuals can     use social media for their own (self-directed) personal or     professional learning</li>
<li><strong>ASL - Accidental &amp; Serendipitous Learning</strong> - how     individuals, by using social media, can learn without consciously     realising it (aka incidental or random learning)</li>
</ol>
<p>It may well be that these categories will need tweaking or even overhauling completely, but here is my first attempt at how social media can be used in these 5 categories, which will be a work in progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harold Jarche takes these thoughts and puts them in a diagram in a follow-up <a href="http://www.jarche.com/2009/11/social-media-and-self-directed-learning/" target="_blank">blogpost</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This had me thinking about how best to explain these categories to clients and folks not immersed in social media and learning. I started by looking at it as a 2&times;2 matrix, but of course there are five categories, so that wouldn&rsquo;t work. However, the axes of the amount of direction versus group size made sense to me, so I created the diagram below. What jumped out at me after the fact, and I&rsquo;ve highlighted in red, is that social media for learning requires a lot of self-directed learning, either individually or as a participant in a group/organization. Externally directed learning (FSL) is only one of five possibilities. Good food for thought on the future role of the &ldquo;training&rdquo; department, isn&rsquo;t it?"</p>
</blockquote>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Thurs, 1st Oct 2009, Venue Design Observatory, Venables Building OU.</p>
<p>A gathering to discuss the connections amongst the various OER and web 2.0 projects existing in the university took place.&nbsp; Representatives from projects such as OLnet, Atelier-D, OpenLearn, SCORM, LDI, iSpot, the TERG&nbsp;research group&nbsp;and the OU Library.</p>
<p>It's intringuing how using 'conventional media' like pens and images from magazines we managed to visualise and represent Olnet.</p>
<p>Even more interesting were the perceptions of participants and their feedback. I am trying to include some here:</p>
<ul>
<li>How could it link with JISC JORUM initiative and 'community bay'?</li>
<li>how do we improve resource discovery to deliver targetted and appropriate level material for reuse/repurposing? </li>
<li>Meta analysis of use is needed</li>
<li>how do we learn more about the sue of OERs? trough which methods?</li>
<li>OER international: all age groups, different cultures, web 2.0 tools</li>
<li>Are you investigating visualisations of qualitative/quant research data? </li>
<li>Researching 'known unknowns'</li>
<li>Communities of learners, delivery, designing, fostering?</li>
<li>global learning and cultures?</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps OLnet has something to contribute in all four themes that emerged from the workshop including:</p>
<ul>
<li>models of learning</li>
<li>models of communication / in social spaces</li>
<li>models of communication / tools for sharing</li>
<li>models of design </li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><em>What we know about learning<br /></em></p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s complex</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s messy &ndash; don&rsquo;t know what the boundaries are, who is teacher/learner, etc</li>
<li>It varies &ndash; what works for me, might not work for you, different subjects different approaches</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of theories and there are alot of specially built tools to represent this&nbsp; and support the design process such as LAMS, Phoebe etc.</p>
<p><br />But is there an alterative approach - more infomal?</p>
<p><em>What we know about social media?<br /></em></p>
<ol>
<li>&lt;embed&gt;&lt;/embed> is the universal acid of the web &ndash; we should build around it. Embed functions blurs the boundaries between what is content and what is dialogue</li>
<li>Simple with reach trumps complex with small audience</li>
<li>Sharing is a motivation to participation</li>
<li>Start simple and let others build on top</li>
<li>Providing limitations frames input: video site with 12 sec limit, twitter &ndash; 140 characters</li>
<li>Complexity comes from the network and not the app, it&rsquo;s the way users interact with the site that is important</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Some examples</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://trailfire.com/">Trailfire</a>: can create trials across the web &ndash; can embed a tag on every page and comments</li>
<li>9Steps: Limit what people can do, teach everything in9 steps. Series of content, links, videos, discussion points and quizzes. Finishes with an embedded chat tool. Can put together very quickly. Simplicity triumphs over complexit</li>
<li><a href="http://www.instructables.com/">Instructables</a>: sharing informal knowledge around things</li>
</ul>
<p>Other examples: Playlists and SocialLearn:</p>
<p><em>Questions: <br /></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a tradeoff between simplicity and shareability worthwhile? </li>
<li>Is this a false dichotomy?, </li>
<li>The Knowledge management lesson &ndash; complex systems were developed and never used, people now using simple tools such as YouTube and Twitter as informal knowledge management systems, </li>
<li>Can you generate complexity/variation through bottom up? </li>
<li>Only good for zombies?</li>
</ul>
