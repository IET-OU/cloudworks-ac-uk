              <description><![CDATA[<p>Keynote by <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/ben/" target="_blank">Ben Shneiderman</a>, University of Maryland</p>
<p>Solving the immense problems of the 21st century will require ambitious research teams that are skilled at producing practical solutions and foundational theories simultaneously &ndash; that is the ABC Principle: Applied &amp; Basic Combined. Then these research teams can deliver high-impact outcomes by applying the SED Principle: Blend Science, Engineering and Design Thinking, which encourages use of the methods from all three disciplines. These guiding principles (ABC &amp; SED) are meant to replace Vannevar Bush&rsquo;s flawed linear model from 1945 that has misled researchers for 70+ years. These new guiding principles will enable students, researchers, academic leaders, and government policy makers to accelerate discovery and innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Biography</strong></p>
<p>Ben Shneiderman is a Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Computer Science, Founding Director (1983-2000) of the Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory and a Member of the UM Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) at the University of Maryland. He is a Fellow of the AAAS, ACM, IEEE, and NAI, and a Member of the National Academy of Engineering, in recognition of his pioneering contributions to human-computer interaction and information visualization. His contributions include the direct manipulation concept, clickable highlighted web-links, touchscreen keyboards, dynamic query sliders for Spotfire, development of treemaps, novel network visualizations for NodeXL, and temporal event sequence analysis for electronic health records. Ben is the co-author with Catherine Plaisant of Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction(6th ed., 2016). With Stu Card and Jock Mackinlay, he co-authored Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think (1999). His book Leonardo&rsquo;s Laptop (MIT Press) won the IEEE book award for Distinguished Literary Contribution. He co-authored Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL (Morgan Kaufmann) with Derek Hansen and Marc Smith. Shneiderman&rsquo;s latest book is The New ABCs of Research: Achieving Breakthrough Collaborations (Oxford, April 2016).</p>

</ul>
<p>Pressures on working life are intensifying &amp; attitudes are changing.&nbsp; There is an accelerating growth of formal &amp; informal ways in which people find out what is going on &amp; figure out what they can do about it.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>If people are changing the ways they engage with work then careers workers need to reform the help they offer.&nbsp; There are few twenty-first-century answers to twenty-second-century questions.</p>
<p>There's a lot to catch up on.&nbsp; Key areas of careers-work thinking need updating. &nbsp;The links to the thinking include the originals, so that you can track the background for reform.&nbsp; The new thinking is re-aligned to an increasingly commercial world, driven by a disturbingly clever information technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other links feature a widening range of new &amp; radical ideas for supporting the reform and expansion of careers work.&nbsp; All accommodate new thinking for twenty-first century reform.</p>

              <title>holding on and letting go</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9272</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9272</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>People are changing the way they manage their lives.&nbsp; Careers work cannot afford to neglect the news.&nbsp; But it comes with a <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/nicecspace&place.pdf">warning about priorities</a>&nbsp;- should careers work embed prevailing expertise, or rebuild it in response to change?&nbsp; It's a balancing of convention and reform - guess which is a way foward and which a blind alley?</p>
<p>Reform needs new ideas.&nbsp; The new idea here understands contemporary career management as a process of 'holding on' and 'letting go'. &nbsp;The idea cropped up first in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbnarrative.pdf">narrative thinking</a>.&nbsp; It can connect to policy, professionalism and practice.&nbsp; It would expand the careers-work repertoire. &nbsp;More importantly, it can position clients and students as agents of change.</p>
<p>To get anywhere with this means documenting how a person <em>holds on</em> to friends that matter, to assumptions that feel right, and to privileges that stand a person in good stead.&nbsp; But people might instead&nbsp;<em>let go</em> of friends, or assumptions or privileges if they are found to obstruct what that person finds important.</p>
<p>Navigating the pushes and pulls of these dynamics is among the most significant features of contemporary career management. &nbsp;Knowing when to hold-on and when to let-go enables people for ready-for-anything flexibility. &nbsp;Was there ever a time when that was more needed?</p>
<p>Much of the evidence and analysis here is heavy-duty - with occasional tongues-in-cheek. &nbsp;It will stand some back-and-forth revisiting. &nbsp;The analysis is illustrated with examples of useful encounters, materials and practice. &nbsp;The evidence uncovers five dimensions...</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1: &nbsp;<strong>connection</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; finding links to what's happening and with whom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->reach</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;developing ready-for-anything flexibility<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->buoyancy</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; making good use of bad news<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->grasp</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;establishing learning for life-long living<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->direction</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; realising independent critical-thinking and creativity</p>
<p align="center">_______________________________________________</p>
<p align="center"><em>careers work needs your say on this&nbsp;</em><br /><em>sign up on the right and blog below</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>a shorter but fully referenced version of this appears&nbsp;</em><br /><em>in the&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.nicec.org/html/journal.html">The NICEC Journal</a> for Autumn 2015</em></p>
<p align="center">_______________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1: &nbsp;CONNECTIONS</strong></p>
<p>There are causes-and-effects, there are meanings a person attributes to those events, and there are purposes set in motion by those atrributions. &nbsp;Defnding convention or pursuing reform, careers work needs to <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">track those links</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The possibilities are varied, dynamic and expanding.&nbsp; In one way or another people are connected to family, friends and school-or-college contacts.&nbsp; There are neighbourhoods, where communities can link to locally-based agencies. &nbsp;Links to shops, bars, advertisers, stylists and media are constantly appearing - both off-line and on.&nbsp; Connections to politics, campaigns and demonstrations are being forged and broken as you read this. &nbsp;All raise question about what's worth holding-onto and what can be waved goodbye.&nbsp; People&nbsp;act on and&nbsp;live by their answers - they move and shake.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>move or shake</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf"><strong>professional thinking</strong></a> has a spectrum of links that clients and students deal with. How much of it can you and your colleagues recognise as significant in their lives?...</p>
<p><strong>there's what everybody seems to know...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>people act on <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->instinct</strong>&nbsp;- impulsively looking for immediate pay-offs</li>
<li>they are most aware of their <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->individuality</strong>&nbsp;- at the extreme as though in a social vacuum</li>
<li>but lives are also&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->situated</strong>&nbsp;- what people do reflects where they live</li>
<li>and there is&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->background</strong>&nbsp;- where people learn how people-like-us manage all this&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;no big surprises so far, but more to say about social settings</strong>...</p>
<ul>
<li>individuals are located as a members of a <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->community</strong>&nbsp;- with its agreed way of doing things</li>
<li>it is also where <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->attachments</strong>&nbsp;are forged - shaping give-and-take relationships,&nbsp;loyalties and aspirations</li>
<li>and each locality nurtures a <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->culture</strong>&nbsp;- with its shared beliefs, values and expectations</li>
<li>social <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->enclaves</strong>&nbsp;are formed - each with its own set of&nbsp;sympathies, tolerances and hostilities</li>
<li>the dynamic of such social life is <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->habitus</strong>&nbsp;- where the inhabited culture shapes habits-of-mind</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;political influences rate more attention...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>social <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->polarisation&nbsp;</strong>builds over time - separating into 'like or not like us', valued or disdained, becoming strangers to each other</li>
<li>by contrast a <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->nudge</strong>&nbsp;is immediate - reinforcing behaviour which serves such interests as market, profession and business</li>
<li>while <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholding</strong> is deeper - more than shareholding, it represents the interests of customer, citizen and worker</li>
<li>among those&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->interests</strong>&nbsp;- are some people's beliefs in the certain deserving of one's own success, and the probable deserving of other people's failure</li>
<li>more inclusive interests voice <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->identity politics</strong>&nbsp;- opposing discrimination on&nbsp;gender, race and sexuality although, though less on class &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;change provokes fast-developing accounts of career influences.</strong>..</p>
<ul>
<li>influences are defended in <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->political theory</strong>&nbsp;- voicing beliefs, interests and evidence ranging from economic necessity to planetary survival</li>
<li>people are increasingly asked to show <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->resilience</strong>&nbsp;- seen as a 'good' upbringing for building character</li>
<li>and <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->intuitions </strong>are not lightly to be dismissed - our brains know more than we know they know and that insight can be worth heeding</li>
<li>but ideas of <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->enlightenment</strong>&nbsp;oppose entrenched interests - urging independence-of-mind, and expecting to be taken seriously in education</li>
<li>enlightenment also signposts <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->critical thinking</strong>&nbsp;- which undermines arbitrary controls by developing reliably-informed progression</li>
<li>and <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->creativity</strong>&nbsp;takes a similar stance - refusing to settle for how things are with an&nbsp;inventiveness which reconnects how &nbsp;life is experienced</li>
</ul>
<p>Reality&nbsp;is muddier than analysis. &nbsp;Instinct and intuition are not easy to tell appart. &nbsp;Impulse can both trap and liberate. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/review-how-good-we-can-be-by-will-hutton">claims of stakeholders</a>&nbsp;are contested. &nbsp;But what are their drivers? - different <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5322">interests</a> (pragmatically served) or different <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/enlightened_citizens_vs._moral_sheep/">philosophies</a> (epistemologically&nbsp;scrutinised)? &nbsp;Some interests are rooted in the memories of a <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/opinion/can-higher-educations-golden-age-of-plenty-continue">privileged</a> and&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/review-baby-boomers-and-generational-conflict-jennie-bristow">ageing generation</a>.&nbsp; And the&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/journals/rsa-journal-issue-4-2014/">polarisation</a>&nbsp;of interests&nbsp;can thwart reforming zeal in all but the bravest (pp.20ff). &nbsp;So independence-of-mind calls on <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/CCREAD/etscc/kant.html">courage</a>.&nbsp; And, full circle, some of the <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=7Ze0ohBVFY0C&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=samual+oliner+pearl+oliner+altruistic+personality&ots=wo1b6PwfL2&sig=6ZyWjC2DJtr4ZMD65_zGQDp9nLY#v=onepage&q=samual oliner pearl oliner altruistic personality&f=false">bravest political action</a> is rooted in upbringing.</p>
<p>Links in all directions - and few certainties. &nbsp;There's no straightforward conversation to be had about holding-on-and-letting-go. &nbsp;But how refreshing to find <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2015/02/17/martin-sheen-tells-pupils-to-walk-with-him-to-social-activism.aspx">a celebrity</a>&nbsp;recognising students changing the world. &nbsp;And what more-important education agenda could there be?</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>who shaking what</strong></p>
<p>It's an education agenda, but it's also political - about who who gets to do what in society. &nbsp;Politics is <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094">getting clever</a>&nbsp;about this - enough to lead and mislead. &nbsp;A&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n20/owen-hatherley/who-will-stop-them">framework for action</a> is based on three elements. &nbsp;Firstly, any dominant group is an 'establishment'.&nbsp; It is supported, secondly, by 'outriders' - research-and-development outfits capturing connections for the establishment. &nbsp;Some of these are&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8875">careers outfits</a>. &nbsp;Thirdly, all politicking needs to persuade people about 'what everybody knows', and that frames an 'overton window'.&nbsp; Named for its inventor, it contains what people can be persuaded to believe - and that need not be truthful. &nbsp;The products appear daily in the media. &nbsp;And students who know how politics works can outflank it.&nbsp; There is such&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/04/russell-brand-changes-mind-about-voting-and-urges-support-for-labour">student politics</a>. &nbsp;Does it count as education for citizenship?</p>
<p>Students and their helpers never more needed to engage politics.&nbsp; There's no shortage of&nbsp;<a href="http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/">myths and findings</a>&nbsp;to probe. &nbsp;The evidence is that however much <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview">a politico thinks he knows</a> he&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/31/finnish-teachers-special-train-teach">probably doesn't</a>.&nbsp; So there is a <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1014635203149#page-1">world-wide search</a>&nbsp;for people ready to deal with politics in their own terms.&nbsp; But how many regimes can you list where the population is schooled in superstition, myth and compliance, rather than educated for independent and critical creativity? &nbsp;I can't help wondering whether you listed any part of the UK.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p><strong>2: &nbsp;REACH</strong></p>
<p>People are developing their own ways of dealing with work-life. &nbsp;They reach beyond career development and its&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.teachingtimes.com/articles/iag-strategy-question-answer.htm">information, advice and guidance</a>&nbsp;(IAG). &nbsp;They reach towards career management - which is&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUW8V7Jupns&feature=youtu.be">not the same thing</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time political interests are becoming more of a problem. &nbsp;They talk of individuals making economic decisions based on <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8509">impartial information</a>. &nbsp;It's narrow thinking, fitting into an overton window framing business interests, political time-lines and habits-of-mind.</p>
<p>Time is up on both IAG and impartiality.&nbsp; Neither deal with the accelerating&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">change and complexity</a>&nbsp;of contemporary lives. &nbsp;Research into <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf">work-life experience</a> speaks of a search for work-life balance and a rejection of arbitrary demands. &nbsp;It intensifies pressure on education, looking beyond self-advancement and towards <a href="http://eax.sagepub.com/content/2/1/63.full">finding meaning</a> in their lives. &nbsp;It calls for a hold-on-let-go career conversation - and bigger windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>career conversations</strong></p>
<p>Talk of IAG&nbsp;conjures&nbsp;two favourite words: 'choice' and 'decision'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Choice speaks of acting on 'this-or-that?', decision on now-or-when?'.&nbsp; Both lurk in this conversation between questions and answers...<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">'does it have to be sciences or arts?'<br /><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'no, you can get a better deal from the college'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">'suppose I just can't face any more exams'<br /><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'there are jobs where your personality will take you a long way'</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">'if I don't grab it now do I lose the chance?'<br /><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not necessarily, the firm might respect you asking for time to think'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Such conversations go down well with some interests. &nbsp;They attend to what evaluators need. &nbsp;They get frequent airings in the literature. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/moving on/cafcurriculum.pdf">influential approve</a> - including politicians, employers and conventional leaders. &nbsp;But something gets lost in the applause...&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>'you can get a better deal from the college'<br /></em>'so what makes it better?'<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>There's surprise, puzzlement and <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20159814?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">ambivalence</a>&nbsp;here. &nbsp;Research suggests it's what drives creative change. &nbsp;But convention has little to say about change-of-mind. &nbsp;So reform needs a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">counter-narrative</a> featuring departures, turning-points and new-horizons. &nbsp;Reform calls for an expanding dynamic of change rather than a narrowing settlement of choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wide-ranging talk like this can shake confidence - conventionally upheld as a condition for success.&nbsp; It's true that positive&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview">talk of confidence</a>&nbsp;comes across well. &nbsp;But <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.tesdigital.com/magazine">evidence suggests</a> that the habitual use of rewarding talk can hold back learning (17/07/2015 pp.12-13).&nbsp; And there are&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/people-are-overly-optimistic-about.html?m=1">well-documented</a> accounts of over-confidence, misleading confidence and deluded confidence. &nbsp;They identify&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/NICECSbEnlarge.pdf">self-contradicting</a> and <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf">self-serving</a> beliefs.</p>
<p>These exchanges feature conflicting interests. &nbsp;Some attempt to&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">capture education</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Stakeholders&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/30/ofsted-learn-instead-alternative-inspections-headteachers-schools-naht">reach for release</a>. &nbsp;Either way, they raise hold-and-let issues - with degrees of not necessarily helpful confidence. &nbsp;Somebody once mentioned how a <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.tes.co.uk/teaching-resource/the-beatitudes-cartoon-6070434">reach for the meek</a> will get things right.&nbsp; The evidence on confidence suggests that he had a point - or she.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>affect and effect</strong></p>
<p>A long-standing account of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf">learning from experience</a>&nbsp;illustrates the affective dynamics of conflicting interests. &nbsp;And, on top of everything, career management is a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">response to change</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;charged with affect. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcegs.pdf">Clinical evidence</a> sets out a spectrum of affect.&nbsp; It starts from fight-or-flight instinct.&nbsp; It moves into an account of approach-or-avoid emotion.&nbsp; It settles on a sustained feeling about how things are. &nbsp;But it has all has been lumped togather as 'emotional intelligence' - said to be good for personal development. &nbsp;And, while that supplies a conventional account of what works well or needs help, reform needs an account of what transforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf">professional thinking</a>&nbsp;</strong>sets out a three-fold spectrum of career-management affect. &nbsp;What sense do your students make of it?&nbsp; And recognise in their experience?...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;thinking on feeling-good in upbeat experience...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->self-esteem</strong> - widely thought to be necessary to achievement</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->confidence</strong> - said to be needed for risk-taking</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->ambition</strong> - held to be made possible by both</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;thinking on demanding attention is less upbeat than astringent...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->self-regulation</strong> - appeals for a disciplined state-of-mind</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->character</strong> - deals with difficulties and obstacles</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->resilience</strong> - is a bouncing-back response to loss or failure</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->mindfulness</strong> - a special focus on here-and-now reality</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;thinking on transformation engages the excitement of change...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->independence of mind - i</strong>nterrogating and confronting arbitrary influences</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->critical-thinking -</strong> an unwillingness to settle for the way things are</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->creativity&nbsp;</strong>- transforming how people see reality and how they will now live in it</li>
</ul>
<p>There's <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497">no consensus</a> here. &nbsp;There are view-points reflecting mixed feelings, different interests, and conflicting priorities.&nbsp; It is a narrative. &nbsp;And in a narrative nothing need be unchallenged, or under control, or believed without doubt. &nbsp;The thinking speaks of a <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/sbjournalarticle.pdf">rounded story</a>&nbsp;which has&nbsp;muddles to unpick, bad news to confront and minds to change. &nbsp;Nothing is taken for granted.</p>
<p>Careers work has plenty to consider - ranging from <a href="http://www.hse.ru/data/2013/01/28/1304836059/Standing. The_Precariat__The_New_Dangerous_Class__-Bloomsbury_USA(2011).pdf">precarious employment</a>, through&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21648627-controversial-new-book-says-islam-must-change-five-important-areas-thoughts-its">arbitrary religious demands</a>,&nbsp;to <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/12/sure-start-childrens-centres-face-worst-year-of-budget-cuts">neglected child care</a>.&nbsp; It brings&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.localschoolsnetwork.org.uk/2015/04/time-to-put-an-end-to-excessive-testing-of-our-children/">stress-related anxiety</a>&nbsp;where bad feelings can bury everything.&nbsp; It's hard to know where 'passion' belongs on this spectrum. &nbsp;But suppose it were a willingness to risk, endure, and suffer for something <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.allaboutjesuschrist.org/the-passion-of-jesus-faq.htm">bigger than self</a>? &nbsp;Wouldn't that change some minds? &nbsp;</p>
<p>And there's no ready-made script here.&nbsp; It's a hold-and-let-go process reaching beyond feel-good, and beyond demanding-attention, and leading to start-again transformation. &nbsp;Ready-for-anything flexibility is attainable when nothing is thought inevitable.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p><strong>3: &nbsp;BUOYANCY</strong></p>
<p>The idea of self-regulating character has a tough 'get-over-it' tone.&nbsp; As a teacher and lecturer I never found such 'pull-yourself-together' talk doing much to help angry or panicky students.&nbsp; And, these days, there's plenty to be angry and panicky&nbsp;about. &nbsp;There are also ways of making&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">good use of bad news</a>, and that's part of what I'm calling&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">buoyancy</a> - staying afloat in turbulent conditions. &nbsp;It's learned in day-by-day encounters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf"><strong>professional thinking</strong></a>&nbsp;takes account of such encounters. &nbsp;Your colleagues will recognise them. &nbsp;But which do they think it worth strenthening as links?...</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;the most basic learning encounters are inter-personal...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->families facing tough times</strong> - for whom coping is a priority and who may prioritise a shared sense of what's right-and-proper</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->privileged families</strong> - whose wealth and contacts mean that they can expect success, protect these advantages and share them with chosen beneficiaries</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->neighbourhoods</strong> - where shared&nbsp;experience unites people, but when little is shared people become strangers to each other</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;locally-learned like-mindedness forms groups...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->gangs</strong> - where insiders display loyalty and allegiance, and outsiders are treated with hostility</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->devout</strong> - valuing what is thought of as spiritual and sometimes looking for religious obedience</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->associations</strong> - loosely organised clubs, societies and websites where people follow shared interests</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;institutions shape and frame resources for learning...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->organisations</strong> - with rules and roles like those of sport, clubs, cadets, leisure centres and scouts</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->schools and colleges</strong> - valued for what is examinable, but also for meeting your mates</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->businesses</strong> - where learning needs to be about customers, effort, costs and supply-and-demand</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->services&nbsp;</strong>- such, as careers and youth work, where people learn to deal with what's going on in neighbourhood and officialdom</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->officialdom</strong> - both nationally and locally shaping who gets access to what learning services and opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>Conventional thinking has developed&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hecsu.ac.uk/current_projects_graduate_market_trends.htm">a lot to say</a>&nbsp;iabout 'me-and-my-plan'. &nbsp;But wondering about which these locations are serving whose interests is a reforming conversation. &nbsp;Different locations, differently understood, make different sense of that.&nbsp; And&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf">community-interactive</a> talk signposts its possible breadth.&nbsp; While other evidence speaks of students&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30210514?SThisFB">learning from each other</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And so reform talk is shared, exploratory and releasing. &nbsp;It includes explaining to herself how she manages her life, or why his children are so precious, or how they feel about the invasion of change.&nbsp; And an employer at the civilised end of the commercial spectrum can recognise the value of that learning. &nbsp;So there can be plenty of hold-and-let&nbsp;reform talk. &nbsp;Conversation is buoyant when it lifts people, to where they can see how things are, and what needs changing, and where to make a start.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>education for a change</strong></p>
<p>Dealing with change can be thought to depend on character.&nbsp; Causes and effects then tidily fall into place: character comes from 'good' upbringing, and 'bad' upbringing causes failure. &nbsp;Research&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/psychological-perspectives-poverty">probes the thinking</a>,&nbsp;exposing it's self-serving unfairness. &nbsp;The poor are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/rethinking-unemployment-and-the-work-ethic-beyond-the-quasi-titmuss-paradigm-by-andrew-dunn/2017770.article">deprived</a>&nbsp;by an officialdom which chooses to see them as authors of their plight. &nbsp;While educators are vulnerable to attempted capture as <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=2017752">agents of control</a>. &nbsp;Snobbery is a prototype of such discrimination, laying blame where no blame belongs. &nbsp;The damage is at its greatest when provoking anger about who is worth holding onto and who can go and fuck themselves. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever those feelings are, that is an educator's starting point - the opening of a conversation.&nbsp; Educators need to hear talk of 'where we live', 'what it's like' and 'how we feel about it'. &nbsp;They also need to hear about 'who we know', 'how they are respected', and 'why they can be trusted'. &nbsp;So how do educators rate in this exchange? &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's worth asking what teacher-talk gets as much as a nod...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'learning gets you ready to claim your place in society'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'that means your work-life and citizenship'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'there's no hope in giving up on either'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not for you and not for anybody you care about'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'a free society means people have the right to live by their beliefs'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;'but nobody has a right to impose their beliefs on you'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not the people who treat you badly'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not the people who are close to you'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>'we all need each other's help in finding how things can be better'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not forgetting the past but not living in obedience to it'&nbsp;<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'you and your people can be bigger than that'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'learning how big you can be is what education is for'</em></p>
<p>Would they know what this teacher is talking about? &nbsp;Anything to say to each other? &nbsp;Worth setting down? &nbsp;Suppose they come up with another version - by making a movie, showing others and hatching a plan? &nbsp;So they are revisiting remembered experience, but attributing new meaning, and finding reformed purpose. &nbsp;That can become self-propelled hold-and-let. &nbsp;Then it's buoyancy.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>what's left of rights</strong></p>
<p>Not everybody sees education that way; and it really is vulnerable to <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">capture</a> by dominant interests.&nbsp; A much-canvassed interest in education is for employability. &nbsp;But employability is a moving target - not a cause of anything, but a wavering effect of recruitment rates. &nbsp;Nonetheless it's pushed by commerce, majorities and convention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's put to a test by the idea of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/RARDM2ETwdWn9euNSmdV/full#.VNC8R0Ik-JU">career image</a>&nbsp;- looking good to recruiters in...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'appearance' --- 'attractiveness' --- 'self-presentation'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call it the cosmetic curriculum. &nbsp;And the best career work in the world can't jig it to create jobs or improve conditions. &nbsp;What it can do is change the pecking order for available work.&nbsp; But that doesn't favour ability, it favours people&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/128348-sincerity---if-you-can-fake-that-you-ve-got-it">who can fake</a> it, because recruiters are <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jasp.12157/abstract">not hard to deceive</a>. &nbsp;Is this what convention means by employability: business assigning success to image? faces-that-don't-fit discarded? myth excluding reality?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are faces-that-don't-fit all over:&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/02/many-pupils-are-expelled-illegally-and-not-as-a-last-resort-charity-alleges">students who kick over tracers</a>, <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/comment/opinion/the-big-grants-the-big-papers-are-we-missing-something/2017894.article">independent researchers held back</a>,&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.socialsciencespace.com/2014/12/ref-an-idea-whose-time-never-came/">dissenting educators supressed</a>, <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/10/what-would-you-pay-to-be-happy">compliance commodified</a>,&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=11006155">the erosion of student rights</a>. &nbsp;At the same time the idea of <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/mkngtwork/cafimages.pdf">competitive employability</a>&nbsp;fails to understand work-life motivation.&nbsp; Workers in demanding jobs find <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0511.pdf">monetary rewards a disincentive</a>.&nbsp; They look for <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://deliveringhappiness.com/the-motivation-trifecta-autonomy-mastery-and-purpose">meaningful work satisfactions</a>,&nbsp;which - as it turns out - prove impossible to fake.</p>
<p>The cosmetic curriculum will collapse - it loses its edge when everybody learns to do it. &nbsp;It's a product of playground economics and will be displaced by a&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.neweconomics.org/blog/entry/labours-living-standards-index-does-it-go-far-enough?&utm_medium=email&utm_source=nefoundation&utm_content=3+-+Labours+living+standards+index++and+our+&utm_campaign=Feb-eletter-2015&source=Feb-eletter-2015">reliable account</a>&nbsp;of how things are. &nbsp;It has nothing to say about issues ranging from work-place well-being to planetary survival. &nbsp;&nbsp;But suppose it survives? &nbsp;You'll notice compliant workers, uniform in 'appearance, attractiveness and self-presentation'. &nbsp;While reforming independence-of-mind, creativity and critical thinking will have their unfit faces excluded. &nbsp;Try to imagine that.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p><strong>4: &nbsp;GRASP</strong></p>
<p>Dealing with the realities of career management calls for what I'm calling reach and grasp. &nbsp;I mentioned reach earlier - learning that helps here-and-now action. &nbsp;But reach needs grasp - carrying learning to some there-and-then action. &nbsp;Any hold-and-let process needs breadth in reach and strength in grasp. &nbsp;And in any collection of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30210514?SThisFB">education aims</a>&nbsp;that grasp is part of meta-learning - learning to learn. &nbsp;It is knowing what to do in who-knows-what futures. &nbsp;It is not learn-and-score now, it's learn-as-needed later. &nbsp;The more unexpected the later the greater the need for grasp. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's no quick-fix. &nbsp;Meta-learning's grasp is engaged stage-by-stage: from getting a sense of what's going on, through sifting that into useful order, onto focusing what matters, to getting an understanding of the causes-and-effects to be managed. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">career learning</a>&nbsp;research sets out how to practice the process so that it becomes second nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But most learning is forgotten - because it's disposable, out-of-date, not used or inconvenient. &nbsp;Meta-learning thrives when it reminds students of their lives so that their lives remind them of their learning. &nbsp;This learning is then transferred from where it's gained to where it's used. &nbsp;It's&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">learning for living</a>, it's&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf">infinitely reusable</a>, and it's ready for anything.</p>
<p>Enabling grasp is no pushover.&nbsp; Few are in a better position than <a href="https://www.tesdigital.com/magazine">educators to do it</a> (23/01/2015 pp. 26-29).&nbsp; But convention pushes them for prescribed performance, and meta-learning doesn't lead to ready-made prescriptions. &nbsp;Indeed, students - having learned hold-and-let processes - might let convention go.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>meta conversation</strong></p>
<p>So - with no ready-made answers, to unforeseen futures, in ready-for-anything flexibility -&nbsp;how can the conversation go? &nbsp;A conversationally-worded version of <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">career-learning</a> opens up some wondering...</p>
<p>in <strong>finding out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what's going on?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'am I being pushed?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'held back?'</em></p>
<p>in <strong>sorting out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'why does it matter?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'what can I be sure of?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'who's involved?'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in <strong>checking out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'who and what is important?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'why?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'what can anybody say and do about this?'</em></p>
<p>in <strong>figuring out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what will I say and do about it?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'with who and about what?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'how will that work out?'<br /></em></p>
<p>There's no prescripted endpoint here. &nbsp;But that doesn't exclude evidence of outcomes. &nbsp;A feature of <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8844">creativity</a>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;unwillingness to allow the past to control the future. &nbsp;And some versions of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/01/long-term-thinking-investment-internet-age">resilience</a>&nbsp;thinking show how impatience damages the process. &nbsp;Similar losses are found in work-life where there is&nbsp;<a href="http://asq.sagepub.com/content/60/2/189.full">unresisted control</a>. &nbsp;And creativity is found to depend on the very ambiguity that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20159814?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">impatience represses</a>.&nbsp; In positive terms this means that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-organized-mind-by-daniel-j-levitin-1408137852">new thnking is enjoyable</a>.&nbsp; So, could joyousness be an <a href="http://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/2014/06/24/ctq_faridi_finland.html">outcome of education</a>? &nbsp;The question is worth asking because teachers are reported to find the curriculum '<a href="https://www.tesdigital.com/magazine">staggeringly dull</a>'&nbsp;(17/07/2015 pp. 6-7). &nbsp;I wonder whether Ofsted knows about this. &nbsp;Or whether a conversation about grasping uncertain futures with no prescribed anchorages calls for a greater breadth of mind.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>grouded help</strong></p>
<p>And having no ready-made endpoint does not consign grasp to a social vacuum. &nbsp;Meta-learning works in social settings - agency, church, museum and more. &nbsp;It is a grounded network where people apply grasp to life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf"><strong>professional thinking</strong></a> can here re-examine the help it offers as part of a range. &nbsp;But what most count are students' ideas about who in that range is worth calling on - or not...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;there are formal outfits claiming trained expertise...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->careers services </strong>- often what people first think of, but seriously under-resourced, providing information to identify work-life possibilities</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->careers education </strong>- delivered as 'lessons' in schools and colleges, though variable in materials and in designated staff</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->mainstream education</strong> - where educators get to know students over a prolonged period, including the few who can link learning to experience</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->colleges, apprenticeships and universities</strong> - offering opportunities to compete for improved life chances, and for adventures with new people</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;in some outfits the offer is supplementary to core commitments...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->churches, mosques, synagogues and temples</strong> - based on deeply-held and detailed principles, and sometimes more diffusely spiritual</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->community agencies</strong> - often with links to education and sometimes voluntary, with an understanding of local conditions and experience</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->libraries, museums, galleries and collections</strong> - where visitors gaze at what fascinates, look for more, find surprises and buy reminders</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;some <strong>on-line outfits are&nbsp;</strong>professional, some fun, some irresponsible...&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->career websites</strong> - often careers-education-based and digitising its material, some of it interactively diagnostic</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->dedicated websites </strong>- setting out specific aspects of career experience, usually in narrative form and for interactive use</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->social media</strong> - on-line exchange of impressions and advice, including career concerns, which may be poorly informed</li>
</ul>
<p>Different sources are familiar to different people.&nbsp; But each is <a href="https://berarespectingchildren.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/bera-fair-equal-final.pdf">designed to help</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;formally or informally. &nbsp;Some do more harm than good. &nbsp;Some are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/jul/23/museums-should-charge-entrance-fees">under threat</a>. &nbsp;So students need to be savvy in their use.</p>
<p>This is not comfort-zone stuff. &nbsp;Nothing moves until students find help worth holding onto or contacts needing to be let go. &nbsp;And that's&nbsp;troublesome, because it turns things on their head - whatever information, advice and guidance there may be is conceived by students and offered to helpers.&nbsp; This is not convention: meta-learning enables students in a life-long grasp of agency - and that agency can be for reform. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5: &nbsp;DIRECTION</strong></p>
<p>Change is not what it used to be. &nbsp;Once upon a time humanity learned to live with change brought about by such innovations as migration,&nbsp;cities, telescopes, print and industry. &nbsp;Each brings crisis, and we deal with it by seeing things differently - and doing accordingly. &nbsp;But that <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->was</em> change-after-change, this <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->is</em> change-upon-change. &nbsp;Today's crises simultaneously ride on massive increases in commercial leverage, dizzying technological advance, and constantly repositioning cultures. &nbsp;It's been called a '<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/03/britain-economic-crisis-public">crisis like no other</a>'. &nbsp;Sociology characterises it as <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/cafculture.pdf">liquid modernity</a>&nbsp;- the imagery is of evidence drowned by celebrity, reflection sinking in impatience, and producing a pathetic splash compared with consuming. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The imagery of clinging on was never more apposite. &nbsp;It's true that we&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094">mostly learn from failure</a>, and that now means learning to stay afloat in the backwash of change. &nbsp;Careers work cannot, so to speak, duck this. &nbsp;And in the resulting conversation convention will find few twentieth-century answers to twenty-first-century questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>finding chaos</strong></p>
<p>There's no shortage of career conversations - lots of talk. &nbsp;Conventional wisdom positions walking-the-walk ahead of talking-the-talk. &nbsp;It's wrong - we need the talk to signpost the walk. &nbsp;So what might students find worth talking about? &nbsp;Careers work has a good lead on this; looking for student's signposts by inviting them to talk about...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'...songs, movies and stories - I'll never forget'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...memories - that bother me'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...dreams - that keep coming back'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'...experiences - that surprise and excite me'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...what somebody said - that makes me think again'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...surprises - I find hard to forget'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'...people I've met - like I've never met before'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...new possibilities - that have just come into view'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...pressures - that are hard to resist'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'...people - that I could never let down'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...relationships - that I'm beginning to question'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...promises - that I won't break'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until such talk been heeded the conversation has no starting point.&nbsp; Listening to <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/JVB Feb 11 YJVBE2475.pdf">what is going on in a life</a> belongs to thoughtful careers work.&nbsp; But not to all of it - and there is some jostling for position. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/07/eyond-mindfulness-horse-riding-eating-greens-walk-depression-anxiety-cbt">Cognitive behaviour therapy</a> and its variations pursue one-off mind control rather than enduring understanding. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/NICECCoach.pdf">Career coaching</a>&nbsp;speaks only of individuals and winning.&nbsp; <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000187910900058X">Psychological constructs</a>&nbsp;use expert insights to shape individual memories. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://careersintheory.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/applied-chaos/">Chaos theory</a>&nbsp;is a newcomer, boldly taking on change, but bolstering practice in an alliance with psychological constructivism. &nbsp;The publication of that chaos-alliance has been welcomed as&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H6NP9v6KNVIC&pg=PR2&lpg=PR2&dq=savikas+chaos+the+theory+we've+been+waiting+for&source=bl&ots=_CXIerGtix&sig=YSo7qFAnL9hFqqXs7zVHMT2MWyk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GzsRVfzqJ5OP7AbohoCYCA&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=savikas chaos the theory we've been waiting for&f=false">'the book we've all been waiting for'</a>. &nbsp;Not by me.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>managing chaos</strong></p>
<p>When psychologists run out of things to say about career they'd do better turning to sociology than to chaos theory.&nbsp; Physics increasingly sees <a href="http://gu.com/p/49mht">chaos theory as a fad</a>. &nbsp;And, anyway, the unpredictable is not necessarily chaotic and feeling chaotic is not the same as being chaotic. &nbsp;But the chaos-alliance plot-line wins converts - chaos feels like hell and psychological constructs look like salvation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But it ain't necessarily so. &nbsp;There's no case for upgrading chaotic feelings to chaos theory. &nbsp;The alliance is right to acknowledge chaotic feelings.&nbsp; But the narrative needs more than psychological constructs offer.&nbsp; A <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">convincing narrative</a> speaks of both individual and shared experience. &nbsp;Chaotic feelings stem from a spectrum of the who-what-how-when-and-why of what's going on. &nbsp;And there are people in there, doing their thing. &nbsp;So both psychological and social constructs must feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But social constructs can't count on a good press - identity politics don't like them.&nbsp; Anyone defending the rights of gender, race and sexuality see social influences as <a href="http://oakes.ucsc.edu/academics/Core Course/oakes-core-awards-2012/laura-flores.html">entrapment</a>. &nbsp;Actually the evidence is better balanced -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf">socially acquired beliefs</a> are not bound to mislead, and <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/careerlearning.html">individually held beliefs</a> are not bound to be reliable. &nbsp;Emerging&nbsp;evidence shows how we need to be clearer about race and <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1111/hequ.12074?r3_referer=wol&tracking_action=preview_click&show_checkout=1&purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED">class interaction</a>. &nbsp;Some&nbsp;dangerously&nbsp;dare to confront the confusion of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://vimeo.com/79811169">race and class</a>. &nbsp;Too dangerously? &nbsp;Worth talking about? &nbsp;Because any conversation coming out of this spectrum must face the pushes and pulls of all its dynamics. &nbsp;</p>
<p>None of this can bring a halt to change-upon-change or dissolve chaotic feelings. &nbsp;But it can release the depth and breadth of an independently-minded, critically-thinking and creatively-engaged humanity. &nbsp;And that will call on both psychological and <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://thegreatrefusal.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/bourdieu-deviance-from-constructionism/">social constructs</a>. &nbsp;The conversation then becomes less about experts developing career, and more about&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUW8V7Jupns&feature=youtu.be">students managing career</a>.&nbsp; The insights that count speak of the feelings they start from, the hope they look for, and the purposes they find.&nbsp; Their management of these let-go-hold-on processes transforms entrapment into release. &nbsp;Students become their own life-enhancing&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www2.mmu.ac.uk/mcys/">researchers</a>&nbsp;- as well as&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2015/02/17/martin-sheen-tells-pupils-to-walk-with-him-to-social-activism.aspx">agents of change</a>.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>space and credibility</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is no hit-and-run agenda. &nbsp;It expands the reach and grasp&nbsp;of career learning. &nbsp;It confronts chaotic feelings, bad news and deception. &nbsp;It enables the transforming use of all such confusion. &nbsp;It releases independent, creative and critical thinking into a change-upon-changing world.&nbsp; And it processes a troublesome but necessary hold-and-let process. &nbsp;It overtakes convention and engages reform.</p>
<p>This is learning that can only be acquired <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">stage-by-stage</a>.&nbsp; Students trial methods, gaining a tangible sense for what needs to be done.&nbsp; Real-time practice connects learning to living.&nbsp; Rehearsed tactics gather feedback to sharpen ready-for-anything flexibility. &nbsp;These are heavy-duty demands on educators, who need to be in position to design programmes and make them happen.&nbsp; It means establishing credibility with colleagues and students, and alertness to the significance of students claiming their rights and finding fulfillment.&nbsp; Not every teacher is like that.&nbsp; But this work doesn't need a recruited many, it's looking for a committed few - with their expanding repertoire for action.</p>
<p>This reform is widely applicable. &nbsp;The hold-and-let process may be most engaged by the <a href="http://shop.niace.org.uk">decade-upon-decade experience</a> of older people.&nbsp; And it is particularly applicable to people for whom&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/cafBuonfino.pdf">blame-upon-blame</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2195">squeezed out all ambition</a>. &nbsp;But we must fully round out the range of applications. &nbsp;And that means calling on the future altruism of the self-excluding, whose past engineering has given them&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/31/inheritance-britain-wealthy-study-surnames-social-mobility">minority advantage at majority expense</a>. &nbsp;I think that would count as reform.</p>
<p>This work needs more time and space than convention, from&nbsp;its marginal position, has been able to find. &nbsp;It needs the&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8844">knowledge, commitment and credibility</a> that can only come from mainstream <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/moving on/cafcurriculum.pdf">curriculum</a>.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>sensibility and sense</strong></p>
<p>It's no doddle - this kind of bothersome thinking is best&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">set out as narrative</a>. &nbsp;And educators can find any number of images.&nbsp; The well-written ones intrigue: like the&nbsp;<a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2015/03/cinderella-—-disney’s-newest-“ella”-both-courageous-and-kind">pretty as courageous</a>; the victim who&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392170/">changes everything</a>;&nbsp;bad news as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/24/migrants-leave-home-future-past-borders">loss and gain</a>; entrapment that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.psychotherapy.com.au/fileadmin/site_files/pdfs/TheDoubleBindTheory.pdf">brings release</a>. &nbsp;These are stories that rise above clich&eacute; and engage year-on-year questioning. &nbsp;They belong to a curriculum for reformed careers education. &nbsp;But where in curriculum?&nbsp; Conventional thinking looks for links with science, technology engineering and maths (STEM).&nbsp; But narrative thinking links to&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/cafbiog.pdf">history and literature</a> - history for its cultural perspectives, literature for its personal proximities, both asking...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'...what sense are these people making of their lives?'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...what sense am I making of these people?'</em></p>
<p>Few storytellers better pose such questions than the creator of <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/sense-and-sensibility/">Elinor Dashwood</a>. &nbsp;Her narratives recount cultural and personal sensibilities - telling of a culture that can't let go of gentility, and a gentility that can't take hold of opportunity.&nbsp; For Elinor hope needs unforeseen chance to realise a longed-for-life. &nbsp;The story still works because, in both yesterday's and today's <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">cultural enclaves</a>, there are hold-and-let entanglements. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My early-life theological training drew heavily on history and literature. &nbsp;It persuades me that these two disciplines&nbsp;might be where light is most usefully thrown on what can be learned from religion - and what can't. &nbsp;In all events, history and literature is where curriculum pushes at conventional boundaries, welcomes surprises and risks offence. &nbsp;It's where well-written accounts illuminate experience. &nbsp;And if, for some, it points to STEM then that will be a more reiable signpost - not bowled over by persuasion but realised by discovery.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>which way forward</strong></p>
<p>The chances of <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf">survival</a> rest on two make-or-break questions.&nbsp; From a long-ago savanna to a barely-recognisable high-street people need to know...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what's going on?' ... </em>and&nbsp;<em>... 'what can anybody do about it?'</em></p>
<p>Survival is more likely when causes are identified earlier, so that effects can be based on them later. &nbsp;This is horse-and-cart thinking. - things work out better that way round. &nbsp;But not everybody sees things that way round.&nbsp; People who <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview">think they already know</a> what to do harness their horses to jump the causes and gallop in pursuit of effects. &nbsp;The trouble is that it's the causes that are present realities; the effects are&nbsp;merely future constructs.&nbsp; Any other talk is evasion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And evasion need to be managed - which, the evidence shows, entails <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094">maneuvering</a>.&nbsp; That evidence is of obfuscating facts, capturing support and - if all else fails - telling lies. &nbsp;Part of it recounts devious <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/cafetzioni.docx">economics-politics collusion</a>. &nbsp;Conventional thinking has found <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8875">no way out</a>&nbsp;of the mess. &nbsp;Its allies in commerce and politics trot out answers to questions they've never bothered to ask. &nbsp;This is obstructive and needs to be let go.</p>
<p>Establishments position their influential windows over decades - in the UK the 80's saw a massive and sustained re-alignment of priorities. &nbsp;But there is no correct alignment. &nbsp;The window outlines the sort of society that the politics needs the electorate to favour. &nbsp;This is not rectitude, it's&nbsp;maneuvering.</p>
<p>Reform looks elsewhere - among agencies which are neither politics nor commerce but&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf">civil society</a>. &nbsp;Those interests are best represented by locally-rooted and in-touch <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf">stakeholders</a>. &nbsp;And contemporary stakeholders speak of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/mkngtwork/caffrmwrk.pdf">changing expectations</a>&nbsp;concerning what can and should happen. &nbsp;People are learning to see things differently, triggering new <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf">ways of managing change</a>. &nbsp;And in contemporary change-conditions - needing ready-for-anything flexibility - independence-of mind, critical-thinking and creativity are essential to reform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The argument is an extension of decade-by-decade thought-and-action. &nbsp;A version begins with <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/CPIpdfs/cafcpiz.pdf">matching</a> people to destinations. &nbsp;Its listing of information allows the assignment of an individual to what is judged suitable work.&nbsp; But, early on, thinking acknowledges the dynamics of social groups engaged in <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf">community-interaction</a>.&nbsp; And that calls for an understanding of how social links, set up in families and neighbourhoods, feature in what people do. &nbsp;That thinking then calls for an understanding which can deal with growing complexities, triggering <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnoriginal.pdf">learning theory</a>&nbsp;as a progressive thought-and-feeling process.&nbsp; It enables people for self-propelled career management in finding and negotiating fulfillment in life. &nbsp;But both community interaction and learning theory are most convincingly expressed in <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbnarrative.pdf">narrative</a> terms. &nbsp;People find more sense in recounted stories than in collated lists. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Research-and-development is unstoppable. &nbsp;So we should not be surprised to find a process for interrogated what, in all this, is worth holding onto and what must be let go. &nbsp;Reform is an assembly of thought-and-action in support of ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; And that calls for more than a single test of validity. &nbsp;But, whatever the test, it can only be administered by stakeholders. &nbsp;It's a local call, because the curriculum is community property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thinking poses two supplementary questions concerning community realities and possibilities...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'...what works for how things are?...'<br /></em><em>'...and what does not?'</em></p>
<p>They are hold-on-or-letting-go questions.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Critical issues are being raised for how people are enabled to manage their careers.&nbsp; Some of the most influential voices speak for the Network for Innovation in Careers Guidance and Counselling in Europe (NICE).&nbsp; How the issues are resolved will affect how your students are placed for claiming their rightful place in their societies. &nbsp;No mainstream educator can afford to ignore this.</p>
<p>These are critical times: global commerce is strengthening; politicians are besieged; neighbours become strangers to each other; growth has reached the limits of planetary safety; work-life is riven by opposing interests. &nbsp;Careers work inhabits a changing world, posing make-or-break issues for both careers work and education.</p>
<p>The issues are set out in a <a href="http://www.nice-network.eu/fileadmin/erasmus/inhalte/dokumente/NICE_Summit_Canterbury/NICE_Summit_Materials_Onlineversion.pdf">NICE Summit</a> held in Canterbury Christchurch University (NICE, 2014). &nbsp;Its forecasts are not downbeat: they list the strength, coverage and international membership of a movement focused on career guidance and counselling.&nbsp; NICE speaks of citizens, educators and employer as its stakeholders.&nbsp; An organisation's stakeholders are people whose lives are affected by what the organisation does.&nbsp; I'm arguing for a strengthening in the stakeholder position of mainstream educators ready to work on career-management thinking with their students, their families and their communities.</p>
<p>Viable partnerships rely on each understanding what the other can do.&nbsp; A couple of the summit's opening keynotes help.&nbsp; The first sets out a well-documented case for breadth of thinking on 'the story behind work'.&nbsp; The second autobiographically recounts events that shape a professional's informed understanding of career. &nbsp;They both call for wider and deeper career-management thinking.</p>
<p>I'm using the terms 'careers-work' and 'career-management'.&nbsp; The terms 'guidance', 'counselling', 'careers education' and 'guidance' may be more familiar.&nbsp; But they are unreliable: they overlap, shift in definition and are overtaken by new terms - such as 'career coaching'.&nbsp; The field needs more reliable, inclusive and flexible terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>careers-work is what professionals and others do to enable students and clients for what they need to do about working-life</li>
<li>career-management is the sense and use that students and clients are able to find in what careers work does</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot assume that what a career manager does will recognisably play out as careers work suggests.&nbsp; Different people facing the same facts attribute to them different meanings.&nbsp; And the argument here is that testable facts can inform, but it's experienced meaning that gives action its dynamic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So what meaning do NICE careers workers bring to NICE facts? &nbsp;A full-sized lecture theatre is filled with people ready with probing questions.&nbsp; This blog takes a close look at the answers.</p>
<p>It poses five questions...</p>
<ol>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->what can guidance claim?<br /><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->what roles does it consider?<br /><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->how does background culture figure?<br /><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->what thinking most influences its action?<br /><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->what future possibilities does any of this open up?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" align="center">_____________________________&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->CLAIMS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>NICE is a network organisation.&nbsp; It argues for Europe-wide competencies for guidance professionals. &nbsp;They are to be measurable, based on academic training, and drawing on inter-disciplinary thinking.&nbsp; That thinking is claimed to be distinct, unique and research-based.&nbsp; All are argued to be requirements for the protection of student well-being.&nbsp; The aim is, then, to link research, theory, practice and policy into a unified foundation for professional effectiveness.</p>
<p>There's room for a deeper and wider conversation - questions for an alert educator to pose...</p>
<ul>
<li>is it possible for careers-work thinking to be absolutely distinct? - Isn't much of it imported from economics, psychology and sociology? - and isn't some of that of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator">doubtful validit</a>y?</li>
<li>isn't it true that <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf">labour-market experience</a> is as much a problem as a solution? - what about the need to examine the markets for the way they damage life chances? - don't students need to be enabled to examine, probe and scrutinise them?</li>
<li>isn't it true that any commercial commitment to growth breeds both <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/03/food-shortages-everyones-responsibility">hope and fear</a>? - don't both need an understanding of its historical backstory? - and doesn't the breadth and depth of hope and fear range from the personal to the planetary?</li>
<li>surely a full account of research, theory, practice and policy needs students engaged in <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">critical questioning</a>? - and isn't creativity also an unwillingness to settle for the way things are? - is commerce open enough to people's unwillingness to settle for the way labour markets are?</li>
<li>don't all stakeholders need to know <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/CPIpdfs/cafcpiz.pdf">whose interests are being served</a>? - does careers work know what alert educators learn from students and their family-and-neighbourhood communities? - and what if the volunteers and activists of civil society also claim a stake?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions depends on understandings rooted in the sciences, the humanities and probabilistic mathematics - which are all part of mainstream curriculum.&nbsp; And they raise issues which students also need to engage.&nbsp; They push aims beyond learning-for-assessment; they reach for learning which is useful in students' lives - learning-for-living. &nbsp;I know of no deeper or wider education.</p>
<p>So, what are the possibilities for a careers-work partnership with mainstream education?&nbsp; I don't think it matters what subjects educators bring to it.&nbsp; Whatever their discipline, nobody does better what a good teacher can do about finding a point for learning. &nbsp;And learning for effective career management moves beyond acquiring facts it reaches for future possibilities.&nbsp; And that means asking probing questions and checking the answers.&nbsp; And it moves on by figuring out what causes in people's lives bring about what effects.&nbsp; What in-touch educator wants no part of that?</p>

<p>Over the hundred-or-so years of its development careers work has diversified.&nbsp; From time to time attention shifts on what careers workers do - their roles.&nbsp; The vocabulary shifts.&nbsp; Terms like, 'guidance', 'counselling' and 'coaching' are variously associated with the need for 'empathy' 'information' and 'advice'.&nbsp; Roles can be 'non-directive', 'student-centred', 'infused' or 'integrated' and located in an organisation which is 'public service', 'private enterprise' or 'civil society'.&nbsp; The pursuit of any of this may be towards 'employability', 'competitiveness', 'fairness', 'happiness', 'well-being' or 'fulfillment'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These are not lists of what can be clearly defined, they are features in the comings-and-goings of unfolding narratives.&nbsp; The sociology of careers work has imported features of such <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">narrative thinking</a> - the term 'role' is taken by sociology from the theatre. &nbsp;And, in both the theatre and sociology, a role need not be contained by any ready-made script.&nbsp; In sociology role speaks of an actor positioned for taking on a task arising from a relationship - it speaks of 'being here, getting on with this, together'.&nbsp; And, although sometimes scripted, a role can also be questioned. &nbsp;So in careers work we can think of roles as being ready-made and as being newly-made - <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafsor1.pdf">roles as assigned and achieved</a>.&nbsp; A changing world needs such critical creativity.</p>
<p>NICE has variously mapped 'types of career professionals'&nbsp;(NICE, 2014, pp. 19-20 and 27-29). &nbsp;I think this use of 'types' corresponds with what a sociologist calls 'roles'. &nbsp;The simplest analysis finds three broadly-distinguishable positions...&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>...careers advisers have a basic competence - with a 'level-6' grasp of theories and principles</li>
<li>...careers guidance counsellors have 'level-7' competence - able to work with the more complex, uncertain and multifaceted situations</li>
<li>...career experts have level-8 expertise - in addition to guidance and counselling skills this brings scholarship, integrity, autonomy and inventiveness to the work - it is held by service managers, high-order counsellors and researchers capable of grasping the complexity of the whole field</li>
</ol>
<p>NICE is right to point to the limitations of careers advisers. &nbsp;But I doubt that much of that can be attributed to 'level-6' qualifications. &nbsp;My own experience in education tells me that careers advisers, however able and committed, are limited by institutional mismanagement. &nbsp;The ways careers advisers are casually enlisted, marginally positioned and poorly resourced has doubly damaging effects.&nbsp; They limit what the overloaded can do, and they deter other teachers from getting involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three-fold role analysis is challenged from the summit-conference floor. &nbsp;A good many participants see the three positions as ordered hierarchically - and they don't like that. &nbsp;NICE will sort this out. &nbsp;But NICE can't sort out institutional mismanagement. &nbsp;And so it's unlikely that mainstream educators are dreaming of becoming careers advisers. &nbsp;But that does not mean they have nothing to say...</p>
<ul>
<li>educators make week-on-week relationships with students - not just in classrooms but in the yard, during excursions, at sports events - and over several years &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>every school or college has people that students trust - relationships with professionals and community contacts - ready to work with hopes and fears - about school and about life&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>somebody in a school and its network knows about families who get disconnected from education - the institution feels unfamiliar,&nbsp;remote, daunting - they need somebody to reach out</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking account of these roles needs analysis in more than one dimension.&nbsp; There's a lot to know - where are helpers best located? - how can they be usefully supported in getting on with things? - how does anybody know what help different students and which families need? &nbsp;The answers are as likely to come from up-close experience as from ready-made expertise - whether educator's or careers-worker's.&nbsp; And so, although a good many roles are assigned, this kind of work needs role creation - less waiting for an assignment more volunteering for something more. &nbsp;It works where there's open institutional management. &nbsp;And the role-achievement of staff, by both careers workers and educators, contributes to the making of that openness.</p>
<p>There's a lot for both sides to learn about why careers work and mainstream education need each other. &nbsp;Each needs to know what the other can offer.&nbsp; It requires two-way flexibly, because there's no ready-made way of heeding student- and stakeholder-voice.</p>
<p>It's true that lists and definitions have their attractions.&nbsp; They offer what looks like clarity and feels like solidity. &nbsp;But are careers-work roles best understood as features in ready-made structures, or as elements in steerable dynamics?&nbsp; Should a partnership be dropping a heavy anchor or navigating an energising flow?</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->CULTURE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Talk of what stakeholders need from careers work, and of the roles careers work develops, and of the institutional support those roles get - such talk will, sooner or later, mention culture.&nbsp; It comes up in the first NICE group session I attend. &nbsp;Somebody says that the proposals for reform must not leave out 'the cultural dimension'.&nbsp; She has quite a point: careers work's own thinking understands culturally-rooted <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf">community-interaction</a>&nbsp;to have added a sociological dimension to its psychology-based matching methods.</p>
<p>A culture reflects group assumptions.&nbsp; They convey the way group members tend to agree with each other about the way things are.&nbsp; Its conversations may bring up something about who or what is worth bothering with.&nbsp; And there may be talk of what work prospects there are for people like them.&nbsp; A culture is an assembling of such beliefs, values and expectations.&nbsp; It's rooted in the shared experience, memories and allegiances of the group - and so it is a social phenomenon (Bourdieu, 1991).&nbsp; Whether seen by others as 'posh' or 'common', a culture becomes what the group takes to be 'proper', 'cool', &nbsp;'normal' - or '<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/reallives/cafjoey.html">for the-likes-of-us</a>'.&nbsp; Cultures can inspire, encourage and carry people to doing great things.&nbsp; But, 'posh' or 'common', they can lead bright people into doing something silly, and good people into something bad. &nbsp;The curriculum has examples. &nbsp;So does the daily news. &nbsp;So does the schoolyard.</p>
<p>Cultures are nurtured in both communities and institutions.&nbsp; That summit group-member is right, culture frames and shapes the way organisations and their communities both understand and misunderstand each other. &nbsp;Some social theory rejects the possibility of a shared understanding between the one and the other. &nbsp;But the major premise of reform is that past facts need not predict future possibilities. &nbsp;Partnership work with cultural influences needs shared understandings between helpers in their institutions and stakeholder in their communities. &nbsp;It is not that any reformer can assume first-attempt success - misunderstanding is possible, so is a failure to try to understand, but so is creative persistence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>An analysis of how different nations nurture different cultures is possible. &nbsp;Might it be true that German careers work is more thorough? &nbsp;Brit more direct? &nbsp;American more flexible?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; But the evidence is that there is as much cultural variability within nations as between them. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/nicecspace&place.pdf">differences between cultures are local</a>.&nbsp; In some neighbourhoods a person can notice evidence of different communities while taking a short walk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An authoritative source on school-community cooperation sets out a range of what are cultural assumptions (Munn, 1993).&nbsp; Compiled by educationists, it permits an account of the links between educators and stakeholders - the former in their institutions, the latter in their communities. &nbsp;The study sets out a base-line platform for cooperation, but it also allows for different starting points for action.&nbsp; The base line assumes cultural assonance - it sets out what stakeholders will readily agree.&nbsp; But the study also invites a questioning dissonance - and that allows for reform possibilities that some may not yet have recognised...</p>
<ul>
<li>... there can be agreement about student and family self interests</li>
<li>... but what about interests in the well-being of other people's children?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... there can be agreement about education in familiar settings</li>
<li>... but what about emerging voluntary and community organisations?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... there can be agreement about partnership as a well-established process</li>
<li>... but what about the disturbances by minority points-of-view?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... there can be agreement that 'happiness' is a principal family concern</li>
<li>... but what about the value of competitiveness? or fulfillment? or even resistance?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Munn base-line looks to the future, and is prescient in recognising that institutions may assign to stakeholders roles as 'customers' rather than 'partners'.&nbsp; But stakeholders can resist what institutions assign. &nbsp;It is culture which explains why a programme is welcomed in one community and rejected in another.&nbsp; Institutionalised careers work can usually come up with an account of any programme it propose.&nbsp; And that proposal may well come from what a national government expects.&nbsp; But the evidence (Law, 2013) is that remote expectation is less important than local response.&nbsp; It is more important to appreciate the sense and use that local people are able make of any proposal...<br />if any.</p>
<p>And that needs up-close contact, which is in touch with local stakeholder beliefs, values and expectations.&nbsp; The evidence is sociological; it is that cultures live in 'social enclaves' which are located in neighbourhoods.&nbsp; Different enclaves cultivate different cultures. &nbsp;And the evidence shows that it is <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8787">locally-based networks</a> which are more likely to be understood and acted upon. &nbsp;That evidence is that city-and-regional institutions of work-life and citizenship forge strong links with stakeholders.</p>
<p>Any partnership between careers-work and education rests on two-way trust.&nbsp; Educators can count on careers-workers' understanding of local cultures and their allegiances - in up-close contact careers workers engage with the sense that experience makes of working life. &nbsp;And careers workers can know that educators enable local people to voice that cultural experience and to question it - in stage-by-stage exploration educators enable student recognition of unforeseen possibilities.</p>
<p>Educators are aware that doctrinaire assumptions assign a bad press to cultural studies.&nbsp; I'm not qualified to say much about that.&nbsp; But, until you show me better, I'll stand by this.&nbsp; Students have a right to see beyond their culturally-acquired experiences and memories.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.katsandogz.com/onchildren.html">Upbringing is a beginning not an end</a>.&nbsp; Career management then becomes students settling on what, in upbringing, they will hold onto - but, also, what they will let go.&nbsp; Then they are ready to say how they shape their beliefs, values and expectations.&nbsp; It needs rehearsing with families - both now and one day.&nbsp; Because it is how they, life-long, see how the culture they embrace connects to the institutions they inhabit.&nbsp; And it equips them to act when there is no connection.&nbsp; Cultural studies extend the reach of what we call careers work and citizenship.&nbsp; It opens up the shaping of who gets to do what in society. &nbsp;I can think of no more important task for educators and their partners.</p>

<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->THINKING</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>credibility</strong></p>
<p>An influential voice at the NICE Summit calls on medicine as a professional model for the future of careers work.&nbsp; Can careers work aspire to a status like that of doctors?&nbsp; There are parallels - both deal in consultations, diagnoses and cures.&nbsp; But much is changing, and medicine is developing new and far-reaching repertoires for help.</p>
<p>Part of the trend rests on a well established understanding that prevention is better than cure.&nbsp; And, now, the accessibility of on-line diagnosis is changing the GP conversation.&nbsp; There is also some market manipulation by pharmaceuticals, which can distort doctor-patients relations. &nbsp;But medicine is a resilient profession, and it's finding ways of dealing constructively with change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The trend makes status less of a concern than credibility.&nbsp; And the most adaptive and useful responses to people's needs are not prescriptions but explanations. &nbsp;When compared with treatment, health professionals are recognising the greater usefulness of education.</p>
<p>Why would careers workers imagine that that they are exceptions to such trends?&nbsp; The underlying changes have invaded careers work as much as they have invaded any profession.&nbsp; The trends assemble into an economic, technological and cultural backstory.&nbsp; And that narrative is changing attitudes to all professions - from the media to the clerical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we can't rely on the backstory getting the air-time that it deserves - and the electorate needs.&nbsp; It is curtailed by time-limited broadcasting, flabby news management and camouflaged priorities.&nbsp; There is also a careers-work backstory for NICE to develop.&nbsp; It manifests the background ways in which economics, technology and culture are framing and shaping the possibilities for future careers work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As every historian knows finding and narrating what goes on has never been easy. &nbsp;And the modern apparatus of economics, technology and culture can be used to massage any backstory into a preferred but misleading account. &nbsp;We must hope that neither careers work nor educators are among the culprits.&nbsp; But well-funded and skillfully-managed outfits can re-write, and even eliminate, any backstory that damages their interests. &nbsp;Educators and their students can find examples on a daily basis in news bulletins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of such techniques is unfairly damaging the credibility of public-sector careers workers. &nbsp;Examples appear as unwarranted enthusiasm for private-sector provision and belief in business people as the most effective sources for careers work in schools. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A person might well be able to hunch what interests are most served by such claims. &nbsp;But why should a person have to probe so hard to find and decisively verify the backstory? &nbsp;And, even if a person had the time and made the find, what hope is there in trying to influence hidden interests with&nbsp;rational argument? - the careers-work leadership has tried it to destruction. &nbsp;</p>
<p>None of this argues for backing away. &nbsp;Hiding realities is anti-educational. &nbsp;And is such camouflaged maneuvering&nbsp;impenetrable? &nbsp;We know that independently-minded students learn how to probe distorted backstories. &nbsp;We know that medicos are quick learners. &nbsp;Can we find careers workers and educators who can deal with this? &nbsp;Are they NICE?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->research</strong></p>
<p>The NICE position is that professional credibility comes from a valid research base. &nbsp;At its best research finds what's going on, shows how it gets this way, and identifies what causes bring about what effects.&nbsp; These are the facts belonging to the descriptions, explanations, and anticipations which make effective careers-work possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But research outfits are juggling in an increasingly politicised arena.&nbsp; What politicos seek from research, and the action they take in response, may well demonstrably overlook what is known about how people actually live their lives. &nbsp;I've sat in careers-work research meetings considering invitations to tender for research whose findings are specified in the invitation - 'we want evidence to show that...'.&nbsp; In such a climate winning contracts and reporting results can be opportunistic, or arbitrary or inventive - or all three.&nbsp; That research can obscure more that it illuminates. &nbsp;The obfuscation can be deliberate.</p>
<p>Economics is a noticeable example.&nbsp; It is a core concern of careers work because it researches the labour-market information which underpins careers work.&nbsp; But what if there were evidence of <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/57ba23f8-23a0-11e4-8e29-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3HzpbVdUJ">economists deliberately massaging</a> their findings in order to camouflage the political or commercial interests they see themselves as serving?&nbsp; What would that do to credibility?</p>
<p>So this can't be what NICE is signing up to. &nbsp;Its refusal to do so finds support among professional groups now arguing for <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7540.html">practitioner control of research</a>.&nbsp; They see angling academics as distorting any conversation between policy, profession and research. &nbsp;Careers work and education need research which informs useful action.&nbsp; And that needs researchers who are in ground-level contact with career-management experience, and who are able to formulate proposals that are recognisably practical.&nbsp; Some education professionals are calling for a tightening of the links between research and development. &nbsp;The call speaks of research-and-development in one breath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It needs <a href="http://news.tes.co.uk/b/tes-professional/2014/09/04/take-control-of-your-teaching-by-embracing-research.aspx">research-savvy</a> practitioners.&nbsp; I doubt that careers work needs much of the number-crunching for epidemiological 'big data&rsquo; favoured by politicians.&nbsp; Where causes and effects work out differently in different locations it is ethnographies that promise to be useful.&nbsp; Ethnography is open to all the variability and variation of up-close-and-immediate experience.&nbsp; Educators and careers workers have proven themselves capable of producing such exact accounts.&nbsp; They have a precise kind of validity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But no research has any practical validity until it is tested in use.&nbsp; That test is called 'catalytic validity' (Cohen and others, 2000).&nbsp; It asks whether what the findings anticipate in theory correspond with what happens in reality. &nbsp;Practicality needs that kind of research.&nbsp; It is information which can be grasped, probed and made to work by professionals in conversation with their stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are neglected issues here.&nbsp; They are for how research findings are worded, packaged and made available.&nbsp; Managed well catalytic validity can open up partnerships' r&amp;d conversations. &nbsp;It brings professionals and their stakeholders into shared conversations concerning what's going on, how it gets this way, and what anybody can do about it. &nbsp;It makes research community property.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>qualifications</strong></p>
<p>The NICE conference is part of an on-going on-line <a href="http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/nice/article/view/16726/10556">consultation on competency standards</a> (Katsarov, 2014). &nbsp;Its argument is that careers work needs to provide accounts of qualification so that politicos can understand what policy is being asked to support.&nbsp; The NICE versions of qualifications for careers work list levels of quantifiable competencies. &nbsp;There are other versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A host at the university's welcoming of NICE is the Dean of Education.&nbsp; He remarks that education is more than imparting measureable competencies.&nbsp; He refers to the unquantifiable attitudes which, in any worthwhile learning programme, foster the development of 'creativity' and 'critical thinking'.&nbsp; The two phrases have long-since been linked together as key elements for qualifying as an educator.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/thinking-skills-and-creativity">Anna Craft</a> is the trail blazer (Wegeraf, 2014).</p>
<p>Creativity is more than innovation - 'what's new?' need not be such a big deal.&nbsp; Creativity's bigger deal makes a difference to how things are - a cause with a bigger effect. &nbsp;It has been said &nbsp;(Hyde, 1983) to offer a gift and promise a surprise. &nbsp;And that is a disturbance provoking a special kind of excitement.&nbsp; The effect ranges from remapping the solar system to getting more suck from vacuum cleaners. &nbsp;Both change lives, each in its own way.</p>
<p>And then there is critical thinking, which also makes a difference. &nbsp;But it's more deliberative - a learning process driven by interrogating, probing and scrutinising what's going on.&nbsp; It asks awkward questions. &nbsp;And,&nbsp;when it would be a bad mistake to allow the past to predict the future,&nbsp;that counts for a lot. &nbsp;But it also means that it comes across as disturbing how things are, and that causes discomfort.</p>
<p>Both creativity and critical thinking are an unwillingness to settle for how things are.&nbsp; People may be grateful for the gift, but they won't thank you for being taken out of their comfort zone.&nbsp; And either may be more welcomed by reformers than by the defenders.&nbsp; But, in their different ways, both are necessary responses to change - and when mere innovation won't do.</p>
<p>If he needs it the Dean will find support in the case for <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/partnership-agreements-worthy-pact-or-childrens-charter/2016066.article">authentic learning</a>.&nbsp; This is not compliance with ready-made lists or measurable competencies.&nbsp; Indeed, it sees that as a form of institutional control.&nbsp; Authentic learning lifts candidates above trying to look good enough to comfortably and safely secure an award. &nbsp;Comfort and safety do not work for creativity, they work as marketing ploys.&nbsp; Mere novelty can figure, and that might attract some students and educators.&nbsp; But the movement for authentic learning argues that comfortable and safe breeds dependency, infantilises candidates and undermines any useful understanding of how things are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Significant learning takes risks, it does not play safe; it excites, it does not calm; it works through discomfort, it does not evade.&nbsp; A <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">meta-analysis of career learning</a> tracks what this means for careers work. &nbsp;More recent neurological evidence speaks of how <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pzr00">learning thrives</a> (podcast). &nbsp;The researcher (Karmiloff-Smith, 1992) shows that useful learning needs unfamiliar, surprising and disturbing experiences - so that learners don't switch off, or doze off.&nbsp; And, against the conventional grain, she especially recommends all of this wake-up stuff for watching tv.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;qualifications&nbsp;indicated by such thinking&nbsp;record evidence of ready-for-change independence-of-mind.&nbsp; Playing safe and comfortable would be the most dangerous thing that any learning partnership could do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's true that a person wanting to look good and avoid risk would not immediately be bowled over by what that qualification invites. &nbsp;We are on a journey here, and so an institution's need for reform, fired-up by creativity, informed by critical thinking and leading to authentic learning may not get its first nod before Friday. &nbsp;But the need for all this will become more compelling as change gathers momentum.&nbsp; And it will.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>promotion</strong></p>
<p>Future possibilities for careers work and education must deal with commercial and political interests in careers work. &nbsp;The most influential of them work on a global scale.&nbsp; The backstory is not good news; the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13632434.2013.856294">politicisation of helping agencies</a> has never resulted in reliable support.&nbsp; And, now, careers work is being overtaken by a global <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/how public-sector careers work thrives alongside private-sector career coaching">career-coaching</a> industry, while education is faced by attempts at <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">curriculum capture</a> by commercial interests. &nbsp;The trends put public-sector careers work and education under existential threat.</p>
<p>It's difficult to know how to promote careers work in these conditions. &nbsp;An example not to follow is set out in an <a href="http://adventuresincareerdevelopment.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/was-there-ever-a-golden-age-for-careers-education-and-guidance/">account </a>of careers work's success.&nbsp; It likens being an instrument of government policy as living in a 'golden age'. &nbsp;But that golden memory is not entirely happy.&nbsp; At the time commercial pressure on government is strong; social fragmentation is accelerating; and education is under arbitrary inspectorial attack.&nbsp; And yet the <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf">careers-work response</a> (pp.1-4) shows no interest in mainstream curriculum; has little to say about learning processes; and worries that measures to integrate the excluded will dilute careers-work professionalism. &nbsp;This promotion of a golden age is neither miserably failing&nbsp;nor&nbsp;impressively successful.</p>
<p>Promotion - in advertising, marketing and canvassing - urges success in the past, promise in the present, and trust in the future. &nbsp;There's room for doubt about whether all that jam-tomorrow positivity works. &nbsp;It might impress people who've never had the time, opportunity or inclination to think otherwise. &nbsp;But the evidence is that dedicated positivity&nbsp;ioses opportunities to improve - there is more to gain from diagnosing failure than from promoting success. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be argued that the promotion is for outsiders and the bad news for insiders. &nbsp;But surely we've been talking about bringing outsiders in? &nbsp;And&nbsp;lifting the lid&nbsp;is a lot more interesting than&nbsp;banging the drum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no shortage of evidence on the <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8787">usefulness of bad-news shock</a>. &nbsp;And the reflective wing of the business world has developed various formats for such '<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/12/testing-or-checking/">checking and testing</a>'.&nbsp; It acknowledges the inter-dependence of failure and progress. &nbsp;Critically understanding why the breakdown broke down tells a professional more about how the system and its programmes work; cheering from the rooftops tells the provider nothing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That's for the provider, but self-congratulatory applause holds back user learning by smothering critical voices. &nbsp;Is that what happens in this NICE group session on innovation? &nbsp;A chair-person opens it by listing NICE achievements. &nbsp;But, on closing, the chair's 'summary' pretty-well ignores the group's probing for how to make headway.&nbsp; Instead it repeats the up-beat listing already made. &nbsp;The smothering suffocates when the chair thanks the group for its positive thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education is not exempt.&nbsp; A&nbsp;<em>Times Education Supplement</em>&nbsp;ad (TES, 2014) features two agencies close to government - Pearsons Education publishing and the Confederation of British Industry.&nbsp; In an upbeat opening session business people identify the value of curriculum to commerce.&nbsp; But a downbeat follow-on has many educators countering by pointing to the risks to student well-being.&nbsp; So how is it that the chair feels able to claim inspiration from the resulting consensus?&nbsp; Could it be that promotion needs ready-made applause for ready-made intentions?</p>
<p>From selfies to corporate videos self-promotion is rampant. &nbsp;But the reality is that there is more hope in facing bad news than in faking good. &nbsp;Stepping out of the self-promotional trend may seem like too much of a risk.&nbsp; But <a href="http://www.gertbiesta.com">Gert Biesta</a> (2014) is prominent among the many cited here who show that that facing risk is the immeasurable foundation of all worthwhile learning. &nbsp;Neither careers-work nor education can afford to be distracted by strategies that won't work. &nbsp;And there's little to gain by patting each other on the back.</p>

<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->POSSIBILITIES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Careers work and education share a concern for people's chances in life.&nbsp; The imagery is compelling when it portrays elbowing for an 'inside track' to 'get ahead' by 'overtaking' the 'competition' and being a 'winner'.&nbsp; Such wants are liable to be manipulated by self-serving interests.&nbsp; Students and their educators need to recognise that - whether from politics, commerce, culture, or professions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apparatus of manipulation captures how people think and talk about their concerns.&nbsp; Its imagery erects a boundary around how people see things.&nbsp; A philosophical collation of decades of research into this kind of control has coined the term <a href="http://stephenlaw.blogspot.co.uk">'intellectual black hole'</a> (Law, 2011).&nbsp; At the extreme it sweeps people into wanting what is contrary to their needs. &nbsp;Where 'what I want' is mistaken for 'what I need' then education is failing.</p>
<p>The retort is to demand 'says who!' - who has any right to tell anybody what they need. &nbsp;Getting control means capturing what people sense is worth saying - the language. &nbsp;So should we worry when an interested group pushes terms like 'guidance' and 'career'? &nbsp;We should if it holds back the dynamics of how meanings change as events unfold.&nbsp; And we should worry when the powerful forbid the use of terms like 'guidance' and 'career'. &nbsp;Up-front definitions are at least transparent. &nbsp;But informal reports of elimination are hard to verify - unless you know more than I do.</p>
<p>All such capture pushes unwanted language and probing questions out of reach. &nbsp;The unwary are not bothered.&nbsp; The encircled space can feel safe, and the talk can feel free.&nbsp; Both feelings are deceptive - language, thinking and action have been curtailed.&nbsp; People have been deceived.&nbsp; There is nothing more anti-educational.</p>
<p>And neither is there is anything unfamiliar about this.&nbsp; It features in cleverly constructed press-releases, news separated from its backstory, superficial interviewing, and the terms inserted into commissions-of-enquiry.&nbsp; It's also the scenario for a fair few dystopias - where debate is curtailed, history is re-written, language is manipulated, doubt is punished, questioning ignored.&nbsp; And possibilities fall out of sight. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this is relevant to any outfit which might be a target for capture, or be an inadvertent perpetrator, or be both.&nbsp; The range of outfits which look to the future of careers work include some that lean toward reform, and others toward the promotion of success. &nbsp;Some show controlling tendencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, a resource kit for life-long guidance (ELGPN, 2012) takes a reforming position on enabling career management for a changing labour market.&nbsp; Elsewhere a <a href="http://www.derby.ac.uk/research/icegs/news/2014/icegs-launch-a-beacon-for-guidance.html">'beacon for guidance'</a> (Hyde, 2014) relies on the celebration of past success.&nbsp; Alongside both is a generalised claim to <a href="http://www.suttontrust.com/researcharchive/advancing-ambitions">advance ambitions</a> in an opportunistic attempt to attract favourable government attention. &nbsp;From what we know we can expect signs of control to curtail research.&nbsp; And so it proves. &nbsp;The claim to be advancing ambition by-passes earlier work examining <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5322">careers work's failures on aspiration</a>.</p>
<p>Education is no more immune to attempted capture than careers work.&nbsp; A much-canvassed attempt (Christodoulou, 2014) re-defines and dismisses the underpinning for progressive education.&nbsp; This circling of the semantic wagons pushes 'mythical beliefs' out of sight. &nbsp;But, as independent minds step outside the controlling circle its defences crumble...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>1: the claim is that education should be fact based...</li>
<li>but aren't all facts selected and none of them value free?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>2: the claim is that education should be teacher led...</li>
<li>but who then listens to the sense that students make of learning?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>3. the claim is that education should be traditionally delivered...</li>
<li>but what tradition is that and isn't it better for students to examine any inside rather than outside school?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>4: the claim is that education should direct students to sources...</li>
<li>so where do students usefully learn to find and probe their own sources?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;5: the claim is that education should be prescribed by authorities...</li>
<li>but are not the authorities too high-up and too far-away to understand any lives but their own?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>6: the claim is that education should command attention...</li>
<li>but how does anybody stop students learning what they find interesting and worthwhile?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>7: the claim is that education must meet targets and deliver outcomes...</li>
<li>but when do students learn about who the outcomes most benefit?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daisy Christodoulou's seven headlines signpost dead ends.&nbsp; She's right to raise the issues. &nbsp;They are genuine - anybody with any sustained contact in education has come across head-bangers arguing that all facts are opinions.&nbsp; But we have more than enough careers workers and teachers who know the difference between a fact (like gravity) and a construct (like daleks).</p>
<p>At any rate, students should be giving teachers a run for their money on the issues.&nbsp; And that conversation needs to appreciate that students have many ways to learn, and a fair-few needs for learning. &nbsp;For some it won't be an asked-for 'want'. &nbsp;For some it will feel uncomfortable - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29518319#?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">more like anarchy than education</a>. &nbsp;But it's learning for work-life and citizenship, and poses a crop of questions - the prevailing answers to which shape young lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blandly asking 'how do you feel?' mustn't get in the way of uncomfortably asking 'how do know?' (Williams, 2014).&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>So, is there anything here of any use to reforming careers-work partnerships?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->on expanding claims</strong> - careers work needs to be informed by an inclusive range of stakeholders - their interests extend beyond labour-market concerns - partnerships can realise, support and learn from these wider links</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->on refining roles</strong> - roles need to be acknowledged in both institutional expertise and community experience - sustained conversations are crucial for connecting professional expertise to student, family and community experience</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->on working with culture</strong> - local beliefs, values and expectations influence life chances - careers work is necessary to understanding these cultural influences - learning-for-living needs stage-by-stage work in mainstream curriculum</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->on developing thinking -</strong> credibility is more important than status - it needs reliable research with recognisable applications - and to be accessible to stakeholders - research-and-development can then be brought into community ownership</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->on realising possibilities </strong>- effective and sustainable change needs an account of observable causes and effects - stakeholders and professionals can then work together on how the one brings about the other - questioning failure is more useful than promoting success</li>
</ol>
<p>Education has a distinctive voice on the possibilities.&nbsp; The Royal Society of Arts (RSA) is an agency for mainstream education reform.&nbsp; It has published an <a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal">educator's account of working life</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of it holds no surprises for experienced careers workers.&nbsp; But a 'big-data' report (pp.10-15) goes into some detail on the 'hollowing out' of labour markets, both for the&nbsp;recruitment consequences in the mid-range, and for the rewards of top-range self employment.&nbsp; It welcomes global companies looking to educators to rebalance labour supply.&nbsp; It doesn't say how welcoming educators might be about being assigned that role.</p>
<p>A similarly unsurprising report (pp.16-24) examines the robustness of the demand for interpersonal, creative and digital abilities. &nbsp;And it examines some anticipations concerning the future relationship between automation and recruitment.&nbsp; It also points to how digital technologies may be good news for rich consumers but bad news for less well-off producers.</p>
<p>There are more surprises in a report (pp.21-25) of how people are moving into self-employment.&nbsp; It explains why this is not just a behavioural adjustment by people desperate for any work.&nbsp; It is a structural labour-market change, driven by able people seeking congenial settings for the fulfilment of high-level abilities. &nbsp;But there are issues: capitalising small businesses takes on financial risks.&nbsp; This is not what educators mean by 'learning is risky'- it has consequences for family and community well-being. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the RSA material it is an academic historian (pp.30-35) who gets close to the experience of change in working-life. &nbsp;It illustrates ways in which people are becoming increasingly curious and critical about 'what's going on'.&nbsp; Yet work-life has not adjusted to the way in which that hope is becoming expectation.&nbsp; The author's historical tracking sets out how work connects people to a credible, experimental, conversational and intellectually-engaging experience.&nbsp; The problem is that labour markets cannot accommodate the demand for work offering that kind of fulfillment. &nbsp;Indeed, it finds that work-life routines are too often futile, and sometimes traumatic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Big data rarely reflect enough of what the RSA reports.&nbsp; Alert and trusted helpers might. &nbsp;The historian is most interested in catalysing a congenial conversation. &nbsp;The less congenial scenarios are of low-paid, zero-hours and benefit-dependent working lives. &nbsp;That needs a more fully-equipped partnership response.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p>I leave it to others to detect any shift in some paradigm. &nbsp;Some dust has to settle, some issues revisited. &nbsp;The range of thinking might be something like a copy-and-paste of this scattergram.&nbsp; Some of its terms crop up again and again in earlier pages...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the ideas disturb the relationship between careers work and policy.&nbsp; But they improve the relationship with stakeholders - and stakeholders elect politicians. &nbsp;But this is not arguing for severing relationships with politics.&nbsp; It's arguing for an interactive rather than a dependent relationship. &nbsp;Interactive is more dignified.</p>
<p>I doubt that there's any one place to start. &nbsp;And no sane partnership would try swallow all in one gulp. &nbsp;But, wherever the starting point, it's for educators to fire-up the action.&nbsp; NICE has mapped what careers work can do.&nbsp; It's time for mainstream educators to recognise what they bring to the partnership. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Registering and contributing to this blog would declare that intention - and open the conversation.</p>

              <title>Rob Farrow&#39;s design narrative: Visualising OER Research</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8751</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8751</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title </strong>When is a map not a map?</p>
<p><strong>Narrator </strong>Myself, an education researcher at The Institute of Educational Technology at The Open University</p>
<p>Situation Working as a researcher on the OER Research Hub project, I'm part of a team that collects and reviews evidence about the impact of open educational resources (OER). Evidence about OER impact can be hard to come by: suitable metrics often involve institutionally sensitive information; interventions may not be evaluated consistently; and it can be hard to isolate the particular influence of openness. &nbsp;This can make it hard to draw any conclusions about an overall picture.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task&nbsp;</strong>I worked with a team of researchers and a programmer with expertise in data visualisation to design a data model that would be flexible enough to accommodate diverse evidence types (papers, survey data, infographics, video &nbsp;clips, etc) and help make sense of the bigger picture for a range of different audiences. OER Research Hub is structured around 11 research hypotheses which also must be communicated to non-specialists. This task can therefore be construed as an exercise in learning design.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Actions </strong></strong>I designed a data model which would include the polarity (+/-) of evidence relative to hypotheses as well as the geographical location. This meant that evidence could be recorded on a map and colour-coded to provide more of the metadata. Working with our developer we adapted a Sankey diagram to visualise the evidence base as a whole. Similar visualizations help users to understand the status of each hypothesis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Results </strong>OER Impact Map is part of an ongoing project and still under development, but is already proving to be a useful tool for the research team and the wider OER community. &nbsp;Consciously construing the resource as a pedagogical design enables it to act as such both for the researchers and the community they serve while the map acts as a shared artifact with many different pathways through the data.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong> This example is not taken from the classroom since I am not teaching at the moment, but I do feel it illustrates the importance of learning design for the creation of educational digitial artifacts.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Inquiry of Design for Learning</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6477</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6477</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The overarching aim of the proposed research is to solidify the theoretical foundations of the field of Learning Design, construct a comprehensive methodological framework on these foundations, and develop a set of tools to support this framework.</p>
<p>Learning Design is the act of devising new practices, plans of activity, resources and tools aimed at achieving educational aims. Concepts central to the discussion are context, practice, and change. The context of learning design encompasses the material, social and intentional factors which define the space in which learners and educators operate. Practice includes both epistemic practice (&ldquo;How we learn&rdquo;) and pedagogical practice (&ldquo;how we teach&rdquo;). Finally, design always aims to change existing situations into desired ones. There is a need for formalisms and methodologies that allow a scientific and operational articulation of these elements.</p>
<p>The proposed research will integrate three existing constructs - design narratives, design principles and design patterns, and propose a fourth form &ndash; design scenarios. Design narratives describe a concrete practical challenge in a defined domain, the actions taken to resolve it and their unfolding effects. Design principles are imperative statements which synthesize the findings of scientific research in a manner accessible for practitioners and summarise insights from practical experience to inform scientific discourse. Patterns are generalised narratives, offering a canonical description of a common challenge, the characteristics of the context in which it occurs, and a possible method of solution. Scenarios complete the picture by projecting design claims into the future as hypothesized narratives.</p>
<p>The objectives of this research will include:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Articulating conceptual and operational formalisms for capturing context, epistemic and pedagogical practice, and models of change.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploring methodologies, situated in defined domains of practice, for eliciting such representations and utilising them effectively in supporting educational innovation.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enhancing existing software tools to support these methodologies and facilitate the activity of a vibrant researcher and practitioner community committed to them.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establishing a culture of practitioner design inquiry in TEL, in which educators use the representations, methodologies and tools above to sustain scientifically informed creative practices in their professional context.</p>]]></description>

              <title>managing careers, convenient myths and local voices</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6374</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><em><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com" target="_blank">The Career-learning Caf&eacute;</a></em></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much talk among careers workers of the value of reliable assessment and impartial information.&nbsp; It belongs to ideas about matching the qualities of an individual to the requirements of an opportunity.&nbsp; It draws on knowledge of labour economy and of differential psychology.</p>
<p>Such thinking position careers workers as front-loading into the labour economy.&nbsp; Its leaders see the work as supporting economic productivity.&nbsp; If they are right, the effectiveness of careers work is tested by how fully the outputs of an education become the inputs of the economy.</p>
<p>But it all makes a lot of assumptions; and they are largely mythical...</p>
<ul>
<li>careers work is in no position to accrue a significant net gain for national economic performance</li>
<li>assumptions about such decision-making rationality have little support, even among economists</li>
<li>life chances are as likely to rest on some combination of accidental encounter, well-positioned background and instinctive impulsive</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this pictures a towering individual, freely making independent decisions, based on a balancing of factors. &nbsp;And the idea that what comes out of that process benefits rather than damages the rest of us is pure mythology.&nbsp; Somebody should make an on-line wargame fantasy about it &ndash; somebody probably will.&nbsp; But <a title="professionalismblog" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5873" target="_blank">the evidence</a> tells a different story.</p>
<p>The towering dragons and their sorcerers&rsquo; apprentices probably know they are dishing up myths.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re bright enough to know that these are convenient myths &ndash; rampant individualism is convenient to...</p>
<ul>
<li>leaders who rake in rewards by persuading others that all progress depends on trail-blazing individuals</li>
<li>commerce which flatters consumers, romances candidates, and isolates employees by steering away from the collective and towards the individual &nbsp;</li>
<li>governments which claim that social damage can be fixed by firmly dealing with feckless and undeserving individuals</li>
</ul>
<p>And we need better to understand the to-and-fro between what are internal claims on &lsquo;respect&rsquo;, &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; and &rsquo;confidence&rsquo; and what are external experiences of stress, manipulation and anxiety.</p>
<p>In a sane society the people best placed to work on probing any resulting crock of delusion would be educators. &nbsp;That curriculum deals with the power of contemporary mythology, and the interests it serves. &nbsp;Would that be careers education? &nbsp;&nbsp;Probably not, no time or space for that kind of exploration.&nbsp; And, anyway, it would get minority support &ndash; schools and universities are widely assumed to be for supporting the advertising and propaganda which steers individual employables towards national competitiveness. &nbsp;Is that why teachers become teachers?</p>
<p>A relevant &nbsp;conference has been organised.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<a title="place-spaceconference" href="http://www.esri.mmu.ac.uk/space/index.php" target="_blank">&lsquo;Space, Place and Social Justice in Education&rsquo;</a></p>
<p>Why &lsquo;space and place&rsquo;?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s because the evidence shows how geography relates to chances in life.&nbsp; The ways people experience &lsquo;respect&rsquo;, &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; and &lsquo;confidence&rsquo; are situated.&nbsp; That feeling of knowing you are probably going to be alright is place-related.&nbsp; How you feel belongs to where you are. &nbsp;Geographer <a title="Dorling" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Injustice-Why-Social-InequalityPersists/dp/1847427200/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1340100645&sr=8-2" target="_blank">Danny Dorling</a> is among the few who have thoroughly documented and mapped these realities.&nbsp; He will be at the conference.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="enclaves and systems" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf" target="_blank">My own paper</a> examines the varying terms in which people voice their claims on respect, freedom, confidence.&nbsp; It is, I argue, a marker for their claim to a stake in society.&nbsp; It kicks off from a fundamental question for social justice...</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->who gets to do what in society?</p>
<p>I find it hard to think of a more important issue for social policy. &nbsp;And posing it brings careers work to the heart of that issue. &nbsp;What we do about it will feed into our hopes for social mobility.&nbsp; And, among those who prefer to live with convenient myths, it will feed into the pretensions they use to disguise the reality.</p>
<p>The article shows how the 'who-gets-to-do-what' question must be answered differently in different locations.&nbsp; It examines six manifestations of place.&nbsp; Each of them is differently populated - they are social enclaves.&nbsp; We are social animals and work-life is part of our social membership. &nbsp;In each enclave people are bound together by what shared experience has taught them.&nbsp; And in each there are different beliefs about how things are, different values about what is worth getting, and different expectations about getting them. &nbsp;The voicing of recognition, affirmation and membership is situated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here are some of the ideas that need arguing...</p>
<p><strong>...about experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>what seems real and useful in one place seems alien and irrelevant in another</li>
<li>from early in life, too many people have ambition progressively squeezed out of them, if these are not the ambitions that are locally favoured</li>
<li>that trap can be sprung in a sequestered suburb as much as in a run-down neighbourhood or a remote village</li>
<li>helping action which serves the interests of some can damage the interests of others</li>
<li>programmes that go well in some locations are rejected in others</li>
<li>progress depends less on what leaders claim &ndash; more on who believes them</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>... about what we can and can&rsquo;t know</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>measures of effectiveness assume that we can say in advance what programme outcomes should be</li>
<li>we can&rsquo;t, ready-for-anything flexibility has different starting-points and pursues different aspirations</li>
<li>observations of how people use learning are more useful than measures of what they learn</li>
<li>we don&rsquo;t know in advance how local people will use a programme</li>
<li>discovered usefulness should dispose of ready-made tests</li>
<li>ready-for-anything flexibility is needed by people and community, it also serves commerce and society</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>... about professionalism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ready-made measures originate in commerce and policy</li>
<li>satisfying them is portrayed as a kind of patriotism</li>
<li>an evidence base can only make useful sense one location at a time</li>
<li>It must take account of embedded learning from local experience</li>
<li>parading research findings are secondary to discovering that experience</li>
<li>findings must inform professional and organisational reform as well as programme development</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>... about voice</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center"><em>heeding local voices means excluding ready-made thinking&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise targeted expertise may silence exploratory experience&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp; voice means enabling people to construct their own narratives&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp; narrative and exploration are mutually dependent&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp; narrative starts in a place but does not necessarily stay there&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp; space makes room for realising claims on respect, freedom, confidence, and a fair stake in society &ndash; which is justice</em></p>

              <title>critical realism in education research - can storyboarding help?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6226</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com" target="_blank"><em>The Career-learning Caf&eacute;</em></a></p>
<p>The first prime-ministerial call for an education debate was Jim Callaghan&rsquo;s - in 1976.&nbsp; The debate goes on.&nbsp; Ministers assert their dominance, apparatchiks cast themselves as guardians, academics say it&rsquo;s more complicated, professionals worry it won&rsquo;t work, and the media try to hold people in a state of doubt and fear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any claim is countered with another correlation, opposed by another anecdote, or outflanked by another outlier.&nbsp;&nbsp; And global commerce waits in the wings.</p>
<p>A good many of the underlying questions are variations on...</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what&rsquo;s going on in education?<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what can be done about it?</p>
<p>And a good many people have an answer to both.&nbsp; But they don&rsquo;t agree on what they know.&nbsp; Jim Callaghan&rsquo;s great debate is sinking into a quagmire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the questions keep cropping up.&nbsp; As they do in <a title="storyboarding" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6218" target="_blank">three-scene storyboarding</a>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a narrative process for finding meaning and seeking purpose in people&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; Finding meaning probes what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; Seeking purpose figures out what to do about it.&nbsp; The underlying questions are...</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what&rsquo;s going on in your life?<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what can you do about it?</p>
<p>The answers that storyboarding gets won&rsquo;t resolve the great debate.&nbsp; But they help to explain why nobody else can.</p>
<p>__________________________</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing new about questions rooted in &lsquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo;.&nbsp; Erving Goffman posed it, and Marvin Gaye got a song out of it.&nbsp; These are questions close to the heart of the human condition.&nbsp; Our ability to work with them is our fingerhold on survival - in the savannah, on the street and doing research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So could working with street-level questions qualify storyboarding as research?&nbsp; That would be a sillier question if &lsquo;proper&rsquo; research did not, itself, have methodological issues.&nbsp; They include concerns for both how researchers frame enquiry, and how respondents shape what they say. &nbsp;&nbsp;People can be influenced by the expectations set up by dominant interests.&nbsp; They may want to please.&nbsp; Or to look good.&nbsp; They may even string professionals along.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s not certain that professionals will notice.</p>
<p>All the apparatus of research - framing, gathering, finding, questioning, contextualising, reporting and recommending - must themselves be open to enquiry.&nbsp; We need to look deeper than what is easily or conveniently found.&nbsp; Nowhere more-so than in education.</p>
<p>__________________________</p>
<p>This is where Sue Clegg (2005) joins the debate.&nbsp; She points to failures in educational research and claims that &lsquo;critical realism&rsquo; can help fix things.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m taking &lsquo;critical&rsquo; to mean that we really need to know what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; And &lsquo;realism&rsquo; to mean that findings should be recognisable to the people whose lives they are supposed to improve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would make evidence less than a single determinant of findings.&nbsp; It becomes just one of the tools for probing what might be going on.&nbsp; The claim inserts into the methodology an informed understanding of what that could be.&nbsp; For informed understanding Sue Clegg appeals to education professionals.&nbsp; But Ann Oakley (2000) wants to include the understanding of people whose lives will be affected.&nbsp; Where there is education research which has no such connectedness, Sue Clegg and Ann Oakley insert experience into the methodological mix.</p>
<p>This is not to propose a hypothesis to be retained or annulled, it is to modify how research is conducted.&nbsp; It can know that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but it can also wonder whether that is a surprise worth scrutinising.&nbsp; It would look again at the methodology - perhaps to find knee-jerk, contrived, detached or convenient responses.</p>
<p>The case is that, before anybody gets to making any recommendations, somebody needs to visualise the lives they are to serve.&nbsp; It means knowing something about the locations in which those lives are situated, how things are in those settings, and what each of those populations are in any position to recognise as real.</p>
<p>But locations, settings and populations are plurals.&nbsp; There can be no same-for-everybody answer, leading to a general entitlement to a structure or programme.&nbsp; Indeed the findings of a single study can suggest contradictory recommendations.&nbsp; What is recognisable in some lives is rejected by others.&nbsp; What serves some people's wants denies others people's needs.</p>
<p>Policy, the media and commerce look for clear and immediate answers.&nbsp; Critical realism says they can&rsquo;t have them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>__________________________</p>
<p>Asking &lsquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo; and &lsquo;what can we do about it?&rsquo; can find evidence of impact - the difference made by those &lsquo;goings-on&rsquo; and that &lsquo;do-about-it&rsquo;.&nbsp; Impact research is critical for climate change, energy generation, cloning, stem-cell technology and GM foods.&nbsp; Audiences in government, commerce and society need answers.&nbsp; And they need them quantified, so that what is measured-or-counted justifies action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The impact of education is no less critical.&nbsp; Indeed, it is essential to all those critical issues.&nbsp; But the impact of curriculum is more locally variable - from street to street, and from one end of the village to the other.&nbsp; Curriculum effectiveness is situated - a post-coded phenomenon.&nbsp; And the &lsquo;where?&rsquo; of location, the &lsquo;how?&rsquo; of setting and the &lsquo;who?&rsquo; of position are better understood through narratives than by numbers.</p>
<p>It is why Sue Clegg and Ann Oakley look to ethnography.&nbsp; It is a situated narrative form.&nbsp; <a title="Joey" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/reallives/cafjoey.html" target="_blank">Paul Willis</a> (1977) and Howard Williamson (2004) set out narrative sequences located in background, shaped by attachments and moved on by encounter.&nbsp; Phil Hodkinson (1996) shows career to be punctuated by unpredictably managed turning points.&nbsp; It is possible to count frequencies in such narratives; but they mostly rely on what people show-and-tell.</p>
<p>A critically scrutinised methodology allows that a possible finishing point need not correspond with a documented starting point. &nbsp;Findings need not predict futures.&nbsp; It is necessary to look outside the findings in order to know what kinds of turning point would make anything else possible.&nbsp; But where in the methodology should that search come?&nbsp; Even in ethnography it figures late, and sometimes not at all.&nbsp; It comes late and pessimistic from Paul Willis.&nbsp; Howard Williamson allows findings to speak for themselves.&nbsp; Phil Hodkinson pointedly refrains from linking findings to recommendations.</p>
<p>Ethnographies give voice to students attributions, they are situated, and they vary locality-to-locality.&nbsp; They uncover complexity, ambiguity and inconsistency.&nbsp; That may be why ethnographers hesitate to apply findings.&nbsp; And it is not what audiences for research want to hear.&nbsp; But professional educators, in conversation with their students, can do better.&nbsp; Ethnographies express...</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prevalent positions on beliefs, values and expectations<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; minority positions on this<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; experiences that shape those positions<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sense that people make of those experiences<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how and why that experience connects people to a programme<br />&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how and why it does not</p>
<p>Where students are prepared to share this they are inviting an educationist into a conversation.&nbsp; A storyboard shows what's going on in images, and tells it in dialogue.&nbsp; It is a tool for helping students.</p>
<p>But, in acceptable conditions,&nbsp; it might also provide data for wider use.&nbsp; There may be no measurements.&nbsp;&nbsp; But - put together - a locally-collated collection of storyboards can identify comparisons, find similarities and differences, and count frequencies.&nbsp; And all of those data can be critically scrutinised.</p>
<p>Storyboarding does not compare to ethnography in the depth and breadth of its data.&nbsp; But neither does it deal in what can be easily and conveniently found.&nbsp; And there are enough parallels with ethnography for it to serve as a cost-effective research tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For an educator that research would be programme evaluation.&nbsp; It stands for an unpretentious professionalism; one which understands who it is working with, and how well that working is working.&nbsp; It is connectedness between what educators do and what students learn.&nbsp; And there is no audience for education research who can afford to ignore this - even if that entails taking an interest in the well-being of other people&rsquo;s families.</p>
<p>__________________________</p>
<p>Speaking of interests, and of acceptable conditions, none of this can be done without permission and without being anonymised.&nbsp; It is an ethical issue. &nbsp;One of many.&nbsp; They concern whose interests are being represented in the research.&nbsp; Ethics lifts professionals above arbitrary expectations.</p>
<p>The debate is peppered with such phrases as &lsquo;transparency&rsquo;, &lsquo;impartiality&rsquo; and &lsquo;independence&rsquo;.&nbsp; And those words are needed to scrutinise a good many interests in education - some of them quite arbitrary.&nbsp; All of the data on comprehensives, free schools, academies, curriculum, vocationalism are differently constructed by differently interested groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advice on tracking such interests given to Watergate investigators Woodward and Bernstein is said to have been...</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;follow the money&rsquo;<br /></em></p>
<p>On that basis it is not difficult to document cases where findings are shaped to ready-made conclusions.&nbsp; Sponsorship is a clue.&nbsp; Its overall research agenda is another.&nbsp; It may resort to findings that depend on large-sample probabilities to claim significance.&nbsp; The surreptitious use of median percentages of tiny percentages camouflages miniscule results.&nbsp; Doubtful estimates of impact distracts attention from success criteria.&nbsp; Client-compliant consultants re-shape recommendations to suit dominant interests. &nbsp;Even professional interests may feature when research concludes that what people need is what the profession provides.</p>
<p>But some bias is inadvertent.&nbsp; Findings that are framed entirely by labour-economics cannot be impartial: people act for other-than-economic reasons.&nbsp; And diagnostic methods designed only by occupational psychologists cannot be independent: matching procedures do not work where socially-situated attachments are significant.&nbsp; This is not an intention to mislead.&nbsp; But it is to conduct research inside critically un-scrutinised boundaries (Max Bazerman and Ann Tenbrunsel, 2011).</p>
<p>The base-line ethical principle is that the enquiry is a response to user voice.&nbsp; Voice&nbsp; is futile if nobody listens.&nbsp; It is a critical consideration in situated education - which starts from where people are, but does not finish there.&nbsp; Among the ethical principles arising from this...</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before parading findings we need to know locations, settings, positions<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; findings must be related to the interest of the people whose lives they are supposed to improve<br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connectedness must be&nbsp; understood in terms what might be going on and what might come out of it<br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of this needs to be declaring to the people who are expected to act on it.</p>
<p>Teachers cannot be expected to agree with everything that their students believe, value and expect.&nbsp; If the words &lsquo;transparency&rsquo;, &lsquo;impartiality&rsquo; and &lsquo;independence&rsquo; have any meaning they express mutual connectedness rather than reciprocated compliance.&nbsp; Attending to voice is better than getting down with the kids.</p>
<p>And if there is a universal entitlement to education it is not to be found in any particular structure or programme - it is the right to be heard.</p>

              <title>Twitter: Why you need Twitter for study and research</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5944</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5944</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>If you are not using Twitter for study, here are five reasons why you should give it some serious thought:</p>
<p><strong>1 &nbsp; You get access to different points of view </strong>First, the value of your Twitter experience will depend largely on  the people you follow. Search Twitter for people in your field, authors, experts, practitioners. You will often see links to the author's Twitter feed on blogs, news stories and elsewhere. If they interest you, follow them. Once you have started following, say, 20 people, try searching all of the people they follow and connect with even more contacts in your field or area of interest.</p>
<p><strong>2&nbsp;</strong> <strong>The people you follow will point you to great resources you might not find otherwise </strong>Blogs are only one source of information. For emerging developments, trends, news and information about day-to-day events and practice, Twitter is an invaluable source. White and Green Papers, changes to legislation, book launches, new articles, upcoming conferences and events: these are all things you might expect to come across (via the people you follow) in an average day.</p>
<p><strong>3&nbsp; </strong><strong><strong>Y</strong>ou can consult your followers (and others in the Twitter community)&nbsp;</strong>Your peers are a rich resource for study and research, for testing opinions and your own hypotheses. You can also ask straight questions and seek advice from people with experience and knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>4 Twitter is a constantly updating search engine</strong> To find Tweets on subjects that interest you and to connect with the people who are talking about things you are interested in, try searching Twitter for key terms, as you would any other search engine.</p>
<p><strong>5 Twitter helps you build study and professional networks</strong> You will see some words have the # symbol in front of them, e.g. #highered (or higher education). These are hashtags. You can search Twitter for hashtags to find people who are tweeting on subjects you are interested in. Use them yourself (e.g. #K802) and it helps others to find and connect with you.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The European research project OPULL &ndash; Opening Universities for Lifelong Learning is investigating the possibilities for strengthening lifelong learning at institutions of higher education. This includes opening universities to professionally and vocationally qualified people who are in employment and/or have no academic qualifications as well as to those without higher education entrance certificates. It also involves recognising&nbsp;competencies and skills acquired through non-formal or informal learning towards higher education degrees.</p>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5873</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>this is part five of a five-part keynote presentation to the 2011 annual conference of the ICG<br />the series starts at <a title="part one" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5868" target="_blank">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5868</a></p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; pushing the boundary -&nbsp; managing control and finding space </strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that boundary setting can be a covert form of control.&nbsp; It is true that setting limits on what we do is a practical necessity, but it is also true that the way those limits are set can circumscribe our independence.&nbsp; It curtails our basis for knowing what to support - and what to oppose.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>the personal and the planetary:&nbsp;</strong> If students-and-clients are to narrate what they learn from experience, should there be limits to what they relate?&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp; But what links are appropriate and what are not?&nbsp; Everybody links working to shopping - the one permits the other.&nbsp; And the work that a person takes up is linked, not just to their own life chances, but the lives of any dependents they have - or ever will have.&nbsp; And people increasingly voice concerns for work-life balance.&nbsp; They also see the impact of work on quality-of-life as it links both to local neighbourhoods - even to African villages.&nbsp; Indeed, those impacts are seen as linking to the survival of species and the habitability of the biosphere - work has a carbon footprint.&nbsp; The links that people make to working life extend between <em>the personal and the planetary</em>.</p>
<p>They extend well beyond limits set by recruitment-and-selection interests.&nbsp; And also beyond the market thinking of neo-liberal policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>students and clients pushing back boundaries:</strong>&nbsp; Influential interests set limits on career talk.&nbsp; And that goes against wide-spread contemporary personal-to-planetary interests.&nbsp; The trends are well-documented by political commentators, sociologists, counselling-advocates, labour economists and behavioural psychologists.&nbsp; And our own research accords with the trends, it finds <em>students and clients pushing back boundaries</em>. &nbsp;It also finds people who see child care as a form of work, and who are wondering about work that endangers the planet.</p>
<p>None of this means that careers are boundaryless - if &lsquo;career&rsquo; means everything then it means nothing.&nbsp; But that is not what happens: people directly relate their concerns to labour-market experience.&nbsp; To pre-empt the expression of these concerns would limit the disclosure&rsquo;s they make, the extent of what we learn from each other, and the help we are - therefore - able to offer.&nbsp; They would also curtail the interests we feel able to support - and resist.&nbsp; It would diminish us</p>
<p><strong>whether the big society is big enough:&nbsp;</strong> Such thinking re-locates careers work in other-than-commerce and other-than-government alliances.&nbsp; Does that leave anywhere worth going?&nbsp; The big society is urged as a way of taking on group action which government is not able, or not willing, to take on.&nbsp; The idea is much derided; but there is a more robust concept - &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;.&nbsp; Civil society is characterised as social action which is neither commercial nor political.&nbsp; Voluntary agencies, charities and bona fide non-government organisations are - in varying degrees - examples.&nbsp; So are family, local, social and religious affiliations.&nbsp; There are tensions, take-overs and changing alignments: association football was once part of civil society.&nbsp; Professional associations still may be.&nbsp; Together the agencies and affiliations of civil society weave a social fabric which supports the way we live together - locally and on the planet.&nbsp; And so, it should be possible to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to a question about <em>whether the big society is big enough.</em>&nbsp; Is it a natural position for careers-work professionalism?&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are called &lsquo;bottom-line&rsquo; interest in careers work are actually commercial interests of shareholder.&nbsp; Civil society represents stakeholder interests.&nbsp; And all of the agencies and affiliations concerned with the social fabric have a natural interest in what careers workers do.&nbsp; It calls for multilateral, rather than bilateral, partnership agreements.&nbsp; Multi-laterality comes as no surprise to committed careers advisers and socially alert educators.&nbsp; The mapping of their links is as diverse as any in civil society.&nbsp; We need that independent positioning institutionalised.&nbsp; And a natural home for the institution is not the employer of careers workers - who may well defer powerful policy and commercial interests.&nbsp; The natural home for the institution of careers work is in civil society.&nbsp; Because the future is multilateral.</p>
<p>Practical questions for that reality are...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;who has a stake in careers work?&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;which of their interests should be our interests?&lsquo;<br />&lsquo;how do we manage those boundaries on what we do?&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p>Late twentieth-century careers-work has been a story of repeated crisis.&nbsp; The crises have usually been on the back of head-lined events.&nbsp; And the events have usually been outside our control.&nbsp; Headlines aside - the hyper-active manipulation of how we live together by commerce and policy is becoming widely suspect.</p>
<p>Along with many others, in all kinds of societies across the globe, we can think of re-positioning ourselves in relation to policy and commerce.&nbsp; The careers profession alliance is well placed to work on this.&nbsp; If not through the alliance, then I believe we will do it - belatedly - in some in some other way.</p>
<p>We need to do things differently.&nbsp; And it will take time.&nbsp; The task is innovation deeper and wider than careers work has ever taken on.&nbsp; It is for careers workers to take charge of their own future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who better?</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp; enlarging the role - integrating learning for integrated lives?</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that careers-worker professionals know more than they are in a position to use.&nbsp; Enlarged career studies means that careers workers are constantly becoming more able to help.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s good; what is not good is that time- and target-constraints give them little opportunity and freedom to the put that ability to good use.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong><strong>earning space for useful action:&nbsp;</strong> Career studies is applied learning - what is learned is intended to be used in people&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; It requires transfer-of-learning - acquired in one setting, used in another.&nbsp; And that means that people&rsquo;s learning reminds them of their lives, so that their lives remind them of their learning.</p>
<p>But it does not come easily.&nbsp; It needs <em>learning space for useful action</em> - big-enough that learning can be probed, tried out, adapted and embedded.&nbsp; Applied learning is not like academic learning - useful transfer-of-learning needs more than acquisition, record-making and assessment.&nbsp; And it will not fit into the marginal slots that an academic curriculum reluctantly concedes to &lsquo;careers education and guidance&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>finding meaning and purpose:</strong>&nbsp; As a species we look for meaning: long ago, when the leaves rustled, we wondered &lsquo;what&rsquo;s that - predator or prey?... mate or competitor?... us or them?&rsquo;.&nbsp; It ascribes meaning, and an ascribed meaning is a basis for purpose.&nbsp; We wonder &lsquo;... so, what shall I do - move or be still?... run or hide?... approach or avoid?&rsquo;.&nbsp; There have always been versions of this in career-management: what-to-do? and why-bother? - a purpose, and an underlying meaning, giving the purpose its point.&nbsp; Learning-for-living is <em>finding meaning and purpose</em>, &nbsp;</p>
<p>And what people informally find may not be misleading - even gossip can offer useful and authentic exchanges of experience.&nbsp; But not all of informal learning is like that - some borders on superstition.&nbsp; There is nothing that professionals can do - or should do - to displace such experience-based learning.&nbsp; But they can help in two ways.&nbsp; They can expand the experience to make more comparisons possible.&nbsp; That means making new contacts - we could call that thinking &lsquo;community-interaction theory&rsquo;.&nbsp; And they can enable the probing, scrutinising and interrogation of what people find.&nbsp; That means engaging people in critical thinking - we could call that thinking &lsquo;career-learning theory&rsquo;.&nbsp; Those two activities - widening the perspectives on meaning, and enabling the interrogation of purpose - are what careers workers do best.</p>
<p><strong>employability a by-product: </strong>&nbsp;Both activities are process driven - not so much about what people learn, more about how they learn it.&nbsp; But there is no process without content.&nbsp; And keeping up with content is becoming a serious problem: the understanding of facts and factors influencing career has expanded beyond our reach.&nbsp; We need, more than ever, to turn elsewhere for reliable and up-to-date content.&nbsp; And there is no part of any curriculum which is incapable of finding that content and applying it to life.&nbsp; There are educators who know more than we can know - ranging from the dynamics of encounter to the reliability of probabilities.&nbsp; It needs teachers - for example in drama or maths - who are ready to start a scheme with &lsquo;this will be useful in your life when...&rsquo;, and to wind up with &lsquo;...let&rsquo;s go over life situations where you can use this learning&rsquo;.&nbsp; Transfer-of-learning needs that kind of embedding.&nbsp; And, so embedded, it is a life-wide and life-long gain.</p>
<p>It is integrated learning for integrated lives.&nbsp; It is not cross-curriculum infusion: it does not seek a lot of, often half-hearted, curriculum links.&nbsp; Instead it looks for a few able partners - maybe in drama, and - if not welcome there - maybe in maths.&nbsp; What we most need is not comprehensive coverage, which is unattainable anyway.&nbsp; We need to find genuine expertise and experience which can deal with any question, from whatever direction it comes, and who can fire up curiosity - developing the habit of seeing learning as a map, not a hurdle.&nbsp; We need those people to understand the importance of enabling ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; To enable learning in these terms makes <em>employability a by-product</em>.&nbsp; An able educator, helping students to find meaning and purpose in life, does not need to see this in any other way.&nbsp; The best of educators do not care to see themselves as setting in motion a procedure to be completed by recruitment and selection.&nbsp; Education is intrinsically valuable - it is not an agent for other people&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p>Practical questions include...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;is a what-to-do gain all that is asked for - or needed?&rsquo;<br /></em><em>&lsquo;how do we best help with seeking meaning and purpose?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;what can we do about negotiating an integrated curriculum?</em></p>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp; sharpening the image - developing a narrative of what we do</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that careers work is in danger of being marginalised in its own field.&nbsp; Agents who offer short-cut answers to urgent questions will attract plenty of clients.&nbsp; Careers work is talking about a more demanding task - both for ourselves, and for our clients and students.&nbsp; We can work with bigger, and more challenging, ideas.</p>
<p><strong>the &lsquo;race&rsquo; is only part of the &lsquo;journey&rsquo;:</strong>&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a challenge: &lsquo;career&rsquo; is not a thing, like a slice of chocolate-fudge cake; it&rsquo;s an abstraction, like marriage.&nbsp; Abstractions are harder to define in a way that everybody accepts.&nbsp; Metaphors can help, by appealing to visual imagery.&nbsp; And &lsquo;career&rsquo; is already a metaphor - actually, it&rsquo;s two metaphors.&nbsp; In its origins the word spoke sometimes of &lsquo;a race&rsquo;, sometimes of &lsquo;a journey&rsquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not so hard to visualise either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But try this: can you see a person interrupting a race to take part in a journey?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; So try visualising a person interrupting a journey to take part in a race.&nbsp; If that&rsquo;s easier, it makes journeying the bigger idea, and the bigger can contain the smaller.&nbsp; It means we can say that <em>the &lsquo;race&rsquo; is only part of the &lsquo;journey&rsquo;</em>.&nbsp; A journey can be life-wide and life-long.&nbsp; It is not surprising, then, to find that students are more interested in the race.&nbsp; But there are indications that educators are at least as likely to see learning as a journey.&nbsp; Journeying is the stronger image for conveying the causes of career.&nbsp; And, if we are to avoid being marginalised, we need to do more with it.</p>
<p><strong>a person, encountering others, in a sequence</strong>:&nbsp; What we do with the imagery needs to connect with what people do with it.&nbsp; It means facing up to distinctions - between &lsquo;career development&rsquo;, &lsquo;careers work&rsquo; and &lsquo;career management&rsquo;.&nbsp; Career development is our facts-and-factors expertise.&nbsp; Careers work is what we do to help students and clients with what expertise shows.&nbsp; Career management is what they do about it - with or without our help.&nbsp; We need, then, to find the careers-work <em>activities</em> which connect career-development <em>expertise</em> to career-management <em>experience</em>.</p>
<p>Experience is best set down as a narrative - in a story the images are of <em>a person, encountering others, in a sequence.</em>&nbsp; People are not short of career-management narratives - communicated in peer-group and face-book gossip, recounting both direct and on-line experience.&nbsp; Exchanging those stories is a place to start.&nbsp; And we have plenty of narrative-based careers-work activities to engage it - ranging from constructivism to narrative-based websites.</p>
<p><strong>re-balancing face-to-face and stage-by-stage learning: </strong>&nbsp;Inviting people to exchange their stories is a place to start.&nbsp; But it is only a place to start, because narratives are anecdotes - they are not expertise.&nbsp; No story can speak for everybody, each is one-person&rsquo;s experience.&nbsp; So narrative is not a well-sampled diagnosis, it is a living impression.&nbsp; It is not labour-market information, it is labour-market experience.&nbsp; And there are aspects of career management that only narrative can recount: stories can show different points-of-view, things going well and going badly, attributions of meaning, turning-points, the consequences for me and others, and change-of-mind.&nbsp; Such a well-rounded narrative has an authenticity and a spontaneity which facts-and-factors can&rsquo;t convey.&nbsp; It is why a well-rounded narrative draws people in.</p>
<p>But narrative is not quick-and-easy work - the useful recounting of, and reflection on, experience needs interactive stage-by-stage learning.&nbsp; So how do we work with people on linking the story of their experience to the story of our expertise?&nbsp; At our best, our story is&nbsp; engaging, provocative and dynamic.&nbsp; But making the connection means <em>re-balancing face-to-face and stage-by-stage learning</em> - guidance works with a face-to-face agenda, curriculum is a stage-by-stage progression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Practical questions call for a re-thinking of the partnership between guidance and curriculum...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;in how many ways is career management a </em><em>life-wide life-long journey?&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;how do we use narrative to connect our expertise to that experience?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;what does that mean for re-balancing face-to-face and progressive learning?&rsquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp; winning credibility - earning trust</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that credibility cannot be claimed, it must be earned.&nbsp; And that means being open to challenge from the very people whose trust we seek.&nbsp; It is not how we see them that matters, it is how they see us.</p>
<p><strong>culture and its enclaves:&nbsp;</strong> We are not our clients&rsquo; and students&rsquo; only sources of learning for career management - they learn in other ways.&nbsp; That means that they do not come to us empty-handed - they come with beliefs, values and expectations, which they gather from their experience of <em>culture and its enclaves.</em> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those sources of learning are massively expanding through globalisation and its technologies.&nbsp; Everyone has plenty of informal ways of finding out what is going on, and working out what they can do about it.&nbsp; And they find those sources in both friends-and-family, and on-line.&nbsp; But this is learning in enclaves - it increasingly belongs to post-coded attitudes reflected in googled urls.&nbsp; Those geographically located cultural backgrounds are becoming better markers for work-related attitudes than any twentieth-century definition of social class can any longer show us.&nbsp; Different groups, in different positions, with different experiences, learn different things about career.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>contested claims:&nbsp;</strong> And, so, there is always more than one way of thinking about working life.&nbsp; Ideas about career are constantly reorganising how we understand what people do.&nbsp; Words like &lsquo;skill&rsquo;, &lsquo;employability&rsquo;, &lsquo;confidence&rsquo;, &lsquo;experience&rsquo;, &lsquo;allegiance&rsquo; and &lsquo;motivation&rsquo; crop up differently in different accounts.&nbsp; They express <em>contested claims</em>: whatever anybody says about career, somebody else can say it differently.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve ever compiled a career-management essay or case study, you may well have wondered how to be sure that you have covered the ground. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But my reading of the evidence is that there is something like a consensus about the value of careers work.&nbsp; However much they may vary in other ways, in certain conditions students and clients agree about us.&nbsp; They approve of us when...: they know what they want to do; they are facing short-term action; and they are looking for hard information.&nbsp; We shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised by the modesty of these accolades.&nbsp; In work as complex and dynamic as ours, the best we could ever reasonably have hoped for is that we help some people, on some issues for some of the time.&nbsp; And that is pretty-well what the evidence shows.</p>
<p><strong>enl</strong><strong>arged expertise:</strong>&nbsp; The evidence shows something else: when it comes to reflecting on why to move on in one direction rather than another, that&rsquo;s when people go to other people for informal help - not to us.&nbsp; They turn to people they know, and who know them - people they feel they can trust.&nbsp; And it is on that &lsquo;why&rsquo; question that they look elsewhere.&nbsp; We increase our credibility by working with people, not just on how to do things, but on why to bother.&nbsp; It means being strong both on career and on the causes of career.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t have that understanding: we are expanding our career studies continually - drawing on psychology, economics, and sociology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;career studies&rsquo; is useful, because it speaks less of some wholly-owned careers-work discipline, more of an examination of rigorous disciplines which expand our understanding.&nbsp; The history of careers work is a history of that kind of intellectual exploration and importation.&nbsp; It brings us an <em>enlarged expertise</em>: constantly taking us into unfamiliar pathways, collecting from emerging sources, and discovering new ways of understanding what is going on.&nbsp; A recent example is how culture and neurology interact.&nbsp; It expands our scope for evoking possible selves in possible futures. &nbsp;And that offers people a deeper and wider hold on working life. &nbsp;We will know that it has earned credibility when more people, from more backgrounds, want to discuss more of their lives, with more of us, for more of the time.</p>
<p>Practical questions for winning that kind of credibility include..</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;who collates our understanding of career - and the causes of career?&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;how do we best connect that expertise to client and student experience?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;how do they know us - and become known by us - enough to trust us?&rsquo;</em></p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>this is part one of a five-part keynote presentation to the 2011 annual conference of the ICG<br />the link to each succeeding part is at the foot of each window</p>
<p>a pdf version of the entire five-part text is at...<br /><a title="entiretext" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafpropositions.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafpropositions.pdf</a></p>
<p>Bill Law<br />www.hihohiho.com</p>
<p>The lecture is based on a monograph addressed to trainers, policy makers and to the careers profession alliance.  Here I&rsquo;ve pulled out the practical tasks which that monograph brings to everyday work in this field.  There are five propositions, each raising questions for our professional associations, the organisations that employ us, our trainers, our networks, and the students and clients we work with.</p>
<p>When I was a teacher one of the most frequently-asked classrooms questions was...</p>
<p>&lsquo;please sir, why are we doing this?&rsquo;...</p>
<p>I could think of two possible answers...</p>
<p>...&rsquo;because it could be in the exam&rsquo;  and <br />...&lsquo;because it could be useful in your life&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why are we doing this?&rsquo; is still a good question for careers workers.  What&rsquo;s our priority: fitting people for getting ahead in competitive selection - learning for academic achievement?  Or enabling people to take charge of their own lives - learning-for-living?  To think they are the same thing is to overlook the mess that the academically competitive can make of their lives.</p>
<p>Careers work has its answer to the question: I know of no field which has done more research-and-development on learning-for-living.  We have a lot to go on in helping people to realise fulfilling and sustainable lives.  That&rsquo;s what I argue in the monograph.  But I also argue that we have been positioned by commerce and policy to do the competitive job rather than the enabling one.  And it has curtailed too much of what career workers are best able to do.</p>
<p>So what are the tasks - and the propositions that call for them?...</p>
<ul>
<li>&gt; re-making the deal - because independent professionalism needs comprehending support <br /> &gt; winning the credibility - because credibility cannot be claimed, it must be earned <br />&gt; enlarging the role - because trained careers workers know more than they are in a position to use <br />&gt; sharpening the image - because careers work is in danger of being marginalised in its own field <br />&gt; pushing the boundary - because boundary setting can be a covert form of control </li>
</ul>
<p>I'll try also to frame the questions - and, for me, to do so is realise that our future cannot be like our past.  We need to do things differently.</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; making the deal - protecting work-place integrity</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that independent professionalism needs comprehending support.&nbsp; It means being able to negotiate with shared understanding, rather than struggling with uncomprehending power.&nbsp; Making this deal needs people to know who we really are.</p>
<p><strong>personal commitment:</strong>&nbsp; At the heart of that understanding is this: careers work professionalism is a <em>personal commitment</em>.&nbsp; It is grounded in who a teacher, adviser, mentor or coach is - as a person.&nbsp; These qualities are embodied - communicated in authentic demeanour, posture and tone.&nbsp; Clients and students sense it in the presence of that person.&nbsp; Without it disclosure is limited, and limited disclosure means limited learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know of no readily verifiable performance indicators for this kind of commitment.&nbsp; And not all of our work-place managers know how to recognise and support it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>institutional support:&nbsp;</strong> But the people who run our training courses must know how to recognise that commitment, and support it.&nbsp; That understanding includes knowing that selecting for commitment is at least as important as training in technical expertise.&nbsp; Trainers are therefore part of an <em>institutional support </em>for careers workers - providing a professional framework, credible enough to set out how we are selected, how we are trained, and what we have it in us to do.&nbsp; Without that that framework personal commitment is too exposed.&nbsp; And without that personal commitment institutional programmes are futile.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the deal: institutional support from the framework, personal commitment from the professional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, where the organisation&rsquo;s survival is made the prime driver of institutional management, those employers are poor guardians of careers-work commitment.&nbsp; Organisational survival sidelines professional independence.&nbsp; The record of both guidance and counselling tells of such counter-professional pressures.&nbsp; Both need an institutional framework for careers workers which is independent of their employers.&nbsp; In partnership with trainers, the professional associations - and their alliance - can frame and protect that commitment.</p>
<p><strong>versions of professionalism:</strong>&nbsp; Being a professional is defined by that kind of independence.&nbsp; But there are <em>versions of professionalism</em>.&nbsp; Twentieth-century professions protected their independence with credentials.&nbsp; But this is not the twentieth century - and all forms of protectionism are under sceptical scrutiny.&nbsp; We would be rash to assume that careers-work is exempt from this kind of probing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a professionalism which is widely respected - but it is &lsquo;professionalism&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;professional&rsquo;.&nbsp; There is a difference: while a profession was recognised by its claims to status, professionalism is recognised by its usefulness.&nbsp; If all the twentieth-century professions were to disappear tomorrow, working people in - all walks of life - will still take pride in that kind of professionalism.&nbsp; It has been characterised as what enables workers to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to their bosses.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why we need to look, outside our employing organisations, to what the alliance can frame.</p>
<p>So here are practical questions...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;what people do we need to attract into careers-work professionalism?<br />&lsquo;how do we negotiate that in our workplaces?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;. . . on the basis of what support for professionalism?&rsquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: In this talk I will discuss a range of academic research into agile methods. A huge amount has been written about agile methods, including assessment of specific techniques, their relationship with traditional methods, impact on project management, organisational culture and testing, how to integrate agility across the organisation, and so on. The talk will not be able to cover all of these aspects, but will focus on a range of areas related to general business disciplines. I aim to present some results of the research, but also to consider the approaches and theoretical stances adopted.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<div>
<p>I've started tracking examples of social media  use in health and social care contexts. One thing that is clear is that  self-reported patient information on social networks may be used with  proper safeguards as research data. Two recent examples:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.plosone.org/search/simpleSearch.action?from=globalSimpleSearch&filterJournals=PLoSONE&query=patientslikeme&x=15&y=11">PloS One</a> (the peer-review and publishing site) is carrying a study of data submitted by members of <a href="http://www.tudiabetes.org/">TuDiabetes</a> (an international network of diabetes sufferes), which finds that  online social networks 'may comprise efficient platforms for  bidirectional communication with  and data acquisition from disease  populations.&nbsp; Advancing this model for  cohort and translational science  and for use as a complementary  surveillance approach will require  understanding of inherent selection  and publication (sharing) biases in  the data and a technology model that  supports autonomy, anonymity and  privacy.'</p>
<p>A similar study in the <a href="http://www.jmir.org/2010/2/e19/">Journal Med Internet Research</a> last year looked at <a href="http://www.patientslikeme.com/">Patientslikeme</a>, an  online quantitative research platform  where patients report on their  conditions and treatment, connect with other patients with similar  demographic and clinical characteristics, and learn from the  aggregated  data reports. The study considered the possible advantages of the  network in terms of treatment decisions, symptom management, clinical management, and outcomes. 'We have established that members  of the community reported a range of  benefits, and that these may be  related to the extent of site use. Third  party validation and  longitudinal evaluation is an important next step  in continuing to  evaluate the potential of online data-sharing  platforms.'</p>
<p>In other words, both studies indicate that social media offer a  viable source of data for health and social care research, but that care  is needed when collecting, verifying, interpreting and sharing this  category of information. There is scope here for us to refer module  teams to this potential of social networks, and to support them in devising suitable activities based on HSC-related networks. HSC students need certain skills in order to engage effectively with social networks in their  professional practice.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Innovation is a journey from finding out how things are changing, to figuring out what we can now do about them.&nbsp; It is not decorating the same-old with brighter bells and more enticing whistles.&nbsp; Neither is it impulse, whim or hobby-horse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Innovative &lsquo;finding-and-figuring&rsquo; is evidence based.&nbsp; But what serves as evidence is not so obvious.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more than what comes out of experiment or survey.&nbsp; We can rarely sensibly move directly from evidence to action.&nbsp; We need to know what is significant in what we observe.&nbsp; And what counts is not just a fact, it&rsquo;s a factor.&nbsp; Facts are the muddle, factors are the clues.</p>
<p>There is all kinds of slippage between finding a fact and recognising a factor.&nbsp; Think about any evidence which gives a clue to your work.&nbsp; You know...</p>
<p align="center"><em>from the beginning, any line of enquiry signposts some factors - not all</em><em><br />&lsquo;what works&rsquo; in one situation may not work in another</em><em><br />no research can pick up all the evidence</em><em><br />no team can focus all the significant factors</em><em><br />other research organises similar facts into different factors<br />in the end, there are still questions that have not yet been asked</em></p>
<p>We know that research is always circumscribed, usually ambiguous and often challengeable.&nbsp; It makes eclectics of us all.&nbsp; But we need better than pick-and-mix eclecticism.&nbsp; And we get more - not just from research, but also from theory, and - then - from model-building.</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong> is careful observation - as in a survey, a direct observation or a trial.&nbsp; It needs a methodology to say that, although it cannot be the-whole-truth, it can be nothing-but-the-truth.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p><strong>Theory</strong> searches for patterns, noticing similarities and differences in what goes on.&nbsp; Statistics can reveal correlates.&nbsp; And moving the facts around in your head can produce a pattern which demands attention.&nbsp; The search is for factors which might explain how things are.&nbsp; And, without linking effects to causes, there&rsquo;s no basis for action.&nbsp; But let&rsquo;s not rush into anything.</p>
<p><strong>Models</strong> scan theories, and assemble them into a bases for action. They are models because they have, so to speak, &lsquo;levers&rsquo; and &lsquo;buttons&rsquo; which give us &lsquo;movement&rsquo;.&nbsp; They say &lsquo;pay attention to these factors to get these results&rsquo;.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t get that kind of formulation from one piece of research, nor even from one theory.&nbsp; It always means taking one thing with another.&nbsp; But it means more than that.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;self&rsquo;-&lsquo;opportunity&rsquo;-&lsquo;decision&rsquo; model worked well.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s factors were comprehensive yet distinct, balanced yet consistent, interdisciplinary yet coherent.&nbsp; This is not back-of-an-envelope stuff.&nbsp; And it worked well enough for a fair few people, for much of the time, on some of the issues.&nbsp; No mean achievement.&nbsp; It framed our professional expertise for some decades.</p>
<p>The theory was reworked psychology, economics and sociology.&nbsp; All three fields have moved on some way since the model was first assembled.&nbsp; And, now, we increasingly work with neurology, evolutionary psychology and cultural theory.&nbsp; Narrative theory links to it all.&nbsp; New facts, more theories, different factors - it all calls for new models.</p>
<p>Performance indicators need a model of how things work.&nbsp; Much of what we are given - in analyses, blueprints and frameworks - speak of factors which link &lsquo;self and &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo; to &lsquo;decision&rsquo;.&nbsp; They suggest targets to aim for, outcomes to assess and standards to evaluate.&nbsp; All assert what kinds of action are &lsquo;a good idea&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Innovation needs to start again.&nbsp; And in a constantly expanding range of knowledge it has a lot to go on.&nbsp; This is the challenge to contemporary professionalism: shall we, again, redecorate existing models, or shall we build new ones?&nbsp; Our understanding of how things work - and need to work - means we must looks elsewhere for &lsquo;good ideas&rsquo;.&nbsp; Innovation needs new models, built by a resurgent professionalism.</p>
<p>In my dreams?</p>]]></description>

<p>The aim of this research programme is to explore the impact that an increasingly &lsquo;open&rsquo; technologically mediated learning environment will have on learning in the future. In a world where content and expertise is often free and where services are shifting to the &lsquo;cloud&rsquo;, what are the implications for education? This paper describes the research programme, which takes a particular position on the notion of &lsquo;openness&rsquo;, considering it from a broad perspective covering each major phase of the academic lifecycle: design, delivery, evaluation and research.</p>]]></description>

<p>Suite S1, Innovation Centre, Longbridge Technology Park, 1 Devon Way Birmingham B31</p>
<p>E4L is a project investigating learners' opinions and experiences.<br />Core themes - transitional periods, use of shadow technologies, lightbulb moments.<br />Looked at learners from ACT, HE and, most lately, FE</p>
<p>There are interactive case studies, themed and categorised video and audio of learners talking about their experiences, available freely online along with transcripts and the facility for comments, reflections and recommendations from peers. They are intended to be of use to fellow practitioners in evaluating the student experience.<br /><br /><a href="http://elesig.ning.com/forum/attachment/download?id=2007026:UploadedFi58:9383">http://ELESIG.ning.com/forum/attachment/download?id=2007026:UploadedFi58:9383</a></p>

<p>ELESIG is a community of  practice for researchers and practitioners interested in the learner experience of elearning.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>ELESIG is an international community of researchers and  practitioners in education and training who are involved in  investigations of learners' experiences and uses of technology in  learning. ELESIG members work together to share knowledge and practice  and develop a shared repertoire of resources which will be of benefit to  the community and the sector.</p>
<p>ELESIG is based in a <a href="/elesig.ning.com" target="_blank">Ning social network</a></p>
<p>Membership is free and while many members are from HE  and FE, we also welcome anyone interested in the learner experience of  learning technologies e.g., from HE, FE, schools, workplace and lifelong  learning, commercial training or any other sector.</p>
<p>ELESIG runs three face to face symposia per year and a number of  online events as well as discussions and opportunities to network  online. It is run by a Management Team of volunteers from various  educational institutions and a Community Manager.</p>

<p>Wednesday 24 March 3.15-4.15pm<br />Workshop 7D<br />Wilson D Block, HR Learning &amp; Development Centre, Seminar Room 4</p>
<p>Communicating the results of your research to the wider world is central to the conduct of scientific research and an essential part of your postgraduate studies. But how (and where) do you publish ?</p>
<p>Organising, compiling and writing a scientific publication is not a trivial exercise and communicating your results effectively to other researchers (and/or wider readership) is something of an art. In this workshop we will discuss: How to decide when your research is ready for publication; How to decide where to publish your research work; How to organise your publication; How to work with co-authors; What is the correct style for a scientific publication? How to submit a publication and what is the refereeing process; and How to respond to referees.</p>
<p>The session will have time for discussion and questions</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Mason </strong>is Professor of Molecular Physics at the Open University. His research involves the study of atomic and molecular processes across a wide range of&nbsp;environments&nbsp;including; terrestrial and planetary atmospheres, the interstellar medium, plasmas and cellular systems, the latter as part of a study of radiation damage of biomolecules. He has published over 200 papers in the scientific literature and coordinates several large international research programmes. He has supervised over 20 PhD students. He is currently the Associate Dean for Research, Enterprise and Scholarship in the Faculty of Science.</p>]]></description>

<p>Wednesday 24 March 3.15-4.15pm<br />Workshop 7C<br />Wilson D Block, HR Learning &amp; Development Centre, Seminar Room 3</p>
<p>This workshop will present a qualitative approach to the analysis of interview data, based on discourse analysis and narrative analysis in social psychology. Further details of the approach and an example from my work on single women's narratives of relationships can be found at the link below. The workshop will include discussion of issues around research interviewing and some practice analysis of transcript extracts.</p>
<p><strong>Jill Reynolds</strong> is a Senior Lecturer in the Faculty of Health &amp; Social Care at The Open University. Her research interests and publications include education, training and practice issues, identity, feminist practice, inter-professional work and meanings of mental health care and support. Her book <em>The Single Woman: a Discursive Investigation</em> (Routledge, 2008) provides a new understanding of what is often taken for granted &ndash; female single identity. She has used the same data (first analysed for her PhD thesis) of interviews with 30 single women in their middle years for several journal articles, some co-authored, on narratives of singleness.</p>]]></description>

<p>Wednesday 24 March, 1.45-2.45pm<br />Workshop 6E<br />Central Meeting Room 11</p>
<p>When you started your research student journey you may not have known what the questions were that you needed to ask and many of these may just now be bubbling to the surface!&nbsp; If you have a question about progress issues, the probation review, doing field work, University regulations or future careers then come along and ask this panel of people who have seen a PhD through to the end.&nbsp; We look forward to seeing you there.</p>
<p><strong>Hilary Burgess</strong> is Director for Postgraduate Studies in the Centre for Research in Education and Educational Technology (CREET). Her work as Director encompasses the full and part-time PhD programme, the part-time&nbsp;Doctorate in Education programme and the MRes programme. From 1<sup>st</sup> March 2010 she will be Academic Coordinator in the Research School and will lead the Research Career Development Team.&nbsp; She is currently Chair of the National EdD Network and External Examiner for the EdD at the&nbsp;University of Roehampton.&nbsp; She is an elected Council Member of the British Educational Research Association (BERA) with a portfolio that encompasses early career researchers and the BERA Committee for Conferences and Networks.&nbsp; Recently, she was appointed as a College Peer Review member for the review of applications for accreditation as a Doctoral Training Centre and Doctoral Training Unit by the ESRC.&nbsp; Her own research and publications&nbsp;have been&nbsp;in the area of primary teaching and mentoring and more recently, Teaching Assistants and Workforce Reform and was a contributing consultant author to the Cambridge Primary Review. She has written numerous articles in journals and chapters in books alongside authoring Open University course materials. Her most recent book is called Achieving Your Doctorate in Education.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Saunders </strong>is a Reader in Molecular Genetics in the Department of Life Sciences, where he researches the basic biology of ageing.&nbsp; In that research, he uses the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, and takes a genetic approach.&nbsp; From January 2008 until February 2010, he held the potition of Academic Coordinator in the Research School, in which capacity he led the Research Career Development Team.&nbsp; The RCD team is responsible for the delivery of career development events across all disciplines, and for all career stages.</p>
<p>Robert's research career followed a stereotyped path typical of the sciences.&nbsp; His first degree was in Genetics at the University of Edinburgh.&nbsp; Subsequently he embarked on a career in Drosophila research with a PhD in molecular genetics, also at Edinburgh.&nbsp; From there, he moved to Imperial College and subsequently the University of Dundee for postdoctoral research, during which time he studied the cell cycle, and conducted genomic research, again using the fly as a model.&nbsp; He continued the genomic research while undertaking a Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship in which&nbsp;&nbsp; techniques he developed for the Drosophila genome project were applied to the medically important fly <em>Anopheles gambiae</em>.</p>
<p>Robert joined the Open University in 1999, since when his research focus has been on aspects of the basic biology of ageing; specifically on oxidative stress and its relationship to the ageing process, and currently on modelling the human progeroid disorder, Werner's syndrome in flies.</p>
<p><strong>Vivien Bacigalupo</strong> was appointed to the post of Head of Research Degrees in 2008 following on from her 15 years of experience working for The Open University. She was previously the Head of Partnerships Office having managed or facilitated over 25 successful partnerships.

<p>Wednesday 24 March, 1.45-2.45pm<br />Workshop 6D<br />Wilson D Block, HR Learning &amp; Development Centre, Room 3</p>
<p>This session will focus on the structure and rhetorical moves of conference abstracts. As a group we will consider the criteria for effective abstracts, identify the key elements or &lsquo;moves&rsquo; in a number of abstracts from different disciplines, and look at some features of writing style that may show disciplinary variation. Some sample abstracts will be provided as a starting point for discussion, but you may also like to bring along an example&nbsp;from your own field, or perhaps an abstract you have written yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah North</strong> works for the OU on a consultancy basis, having previously been a senior lecturer in the Centre for Language and Communication. She has taught English and trained English teachers in a range of overseas contexts, including China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Tanzania and Mexico.&nbsp; Her doctorate was in academic literacy, and her research interests centre on English for academic purposes, language and literacy, and computer-mediated communication. Her publications include <em>Exploring English Grammar </em>(2009), with Caroline Coffin and Jim Donohue, and <em>Applied Linguistics in Action </em>(2010), with Guy Cook, as well as articles in <em>Applied Linguistics</em>, <em>ELT Journal</em> and <em>Studies in Higher Education</em>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

<p>Wednesday 24 March, 11.45am-12.45pm<br />Workshop 5D<br />Central Meeting Room 01</p>
<p>Many people, not just students, have problems working out how best to use their time and even when they do so they may still struggle to implement what they &lsquo;know&rsquo; they should do. In this session, we will look at some of the most common &ldquo;time wasters&rdquo; and together share tips and flag up important practical ways of overcoming these and other difficulties with managing time, after we&rsquo;ve gained some core insights into different degrees of effective time management.&nbsp; Lessons learned here can benefit your productivity as a researcher and could make all the difference to your career success.</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Pugh </strong>is HR Development Adviser to the Research School, and also a freelance Development Consultant.&nbsp; After some pioneering research in the philosophy of religion, he turned to human psychology and skills development to explore human potential and how to overcome the many challenges people face in their lives and work.&nbsp; This led to the study and practice of a remarkable host of people development, coaching, peak performance and psychometric tools. His work here at the OU is focused on utilising the most relevant parts of these study areas more widely, through the provision of appropriate training for researchers, managers and staff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lately among researchers he has pioneered and developed innovative highly rated trainings in Mentoring and also Networking skills. &nbsp;Nigel has studied and implemented some of the most cutting edge time management systems on the market and brings a selection of tips and tools today in this short session.</p>]]></description>

<p>His main research interests are in Isotope Geochemistry and include a wide range of topics related by the use of short half-life uranium daughter isotopes. This includes applications to the evolution of volcanic rocks, dating paleo-climate archives and paleo-anthropology. It also includes the related analytical methods, mostly mass spectrometry and laboratory methods and their design and safe application. He is running a NERC-funded facility at the OU to do collaborative research projects with other UK HEI colleagues and usually he has a large input into the design of these projects. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry and a member of the NERC Peer Review College.</p>
<p>He would like to see himself as a field and experimental scientist, although he doesn&rsquo;t see much of the inside of a chemistry lab these days.</p>]]></description>

<p>Tuesday 23 March, 1.30pm-2.30pm<br /> Workshop 2E</p>
<p>Wilson D Block, HR Learning &amp; Development Centre, Seminar Room 4</p>
<p>As a research student, it is vitally important to keep abreast of the literature as it pertains to your research field.&nbsp; There are two points during your studentship where this is likely to be assessed formally: at probation Review and at the final Viva Voce examination.</p>
<p>The scientific literature is always changing, is often very fast moving, and it is wise to make plans and efforts to keep up to date at all times, and not just in preparation for the assessments mentioned above.&nbsp; This session will cover the following topics: Exploring the purposes of the ongoing literature review; Identifying the sources; Internet searching; Structuring your review; Organising your materials; Working together to review the literature.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Saunders </strong>is a Reader in Molecular Genetics in the Department of Life Sciences, where he researches the basic biology of ageing.&nbsp; In that research, he uses the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, and takes a genetic approach.&nbsp; From January 2008 until February 2010, he held the position of Academic Coordinator in the Research School, in which capacity he led the Research Career Development Team.&nbsp; The RCD team is responsible for the delivery of career development events across all disciplines, and for all career stages.</p>
<p>Robert's research career followed a stereotyped path typical of the sciences.&nbsp; His first degree was in Genetics at the University of Edinburgh.&nbsp; Subsequently he embarked on a career in Drosophila research with a PhD in molecular genetics, also at Edinburgh.&nbsp; From there, he moved to Imperial College and subsequently the University of Dundee for postdoctoral research, during which time he studied the cell cycle, and conducted genomic research, again using the fly as a model.&nbsp; He continued the genomic research while undertaking a Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship in which&nbsp;&nbsp; techniques he developed for the Drosophila genome project were applied to the medically important fly <em>Anopheles gambiae</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert joined the Open University in 1999, since when his research focus has been on aspects of the basic biology of ageing; specifically on oxidative stress and its relationship to the ageing process, and currently on modelling the human progeroid disorder, Werner's syndrome in flies.</p>

<p>This session is based upon Chapter 7 of <em>Doing Postgraduate Research. </em>It will explore the purposes of a Literature Review, discuss sources to be used in a review and look at ways a Review can be structured. The workshop will be based upon the session run in November for full-time students, so is essentially for part-time students who could not attend that session or any full-timers who missed it then.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Potter</strong> obtained his PhD as a full-time OU student in Social Sciences, later became a Research Fellow in the Technology Faculty and is now the Professor of Transport Strategy in the Faculty of Maths, Computing and Technology. His research interests cover transport, energy and environmental policy issues. With Dave Wield, he started the Doctoral Training workshop programme in 1992 and co-chaired the development of the U500 and U501 research packs, including editing the U501 book <em>Doing Postgraduate Research</em>. He is chair of the Research Degrees Committee and somehow finds time to sing in the OU Choir, play in our orchestra and comp&egrave;re the OU's annual carol concert.</p>

              <title>Assessing enquiry-based learning </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2676</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2676</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introducton </strong></p>
<p>Enquiry-based learning (EBL) usually results in students achieving, creating or experiencing a wide range of: learning outcomes, products arising from learning, processes as part of their learning, contexts in which learning occurs, social structures underpinning learning.</p>
<p>This poses some real challenges for assessment tasks, criteria and feedback, as the tendency can sometimes be to resort to standard approaches that particularly don't benefit the students, but that do assign reliable grades. We need to realise that the demands on staff and student are significant, as support is required to follow an unfamiliar research process, adjust to a new context, and master an ability; on a student by student basis.</p>
<p>I want to outline four principles that help us to deal with this variety that students encounter. <br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Contingency</strong></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Assessment is formative to the extent that evidence about student performance is elicited, interpreted, and used by teachers, learners or their peers, to make decisions about the next steps in research processes ...&nbsp; (adapted from Black and William, 2009)</p>
<p>We need to capitalise on the moments of contingency that arise naturally within enquiry-based learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unpredictable and uncertain aspects of work within authentic contexts.</li>
<li>Research processes unfold over time, with scope to shift direction in light of&nbsp; evidence or to plug gaps in understanding. </li>
<li>Opportunity for discussion as an integral aspect of the learning</li>
<li>Contingency ties in to one of the most substantive benefits of research-led learning, namely student motivation. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong><br /><br />Given this great variety across student learning, we still need to value efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be realistic in the extent of the research involved or recognise the demands via credit size </li>
<li>Students conduct research in groups or pairs </li>
<li>Use of coursework requirements: a condition that a student must meet to pass a module or assignment ... and combine this with </li>
<li>sampling of student work and the involvement of others in commenting on student work (e.g. self, peers, GTAs, clients, professionals, technicians ...)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Alignment</strong><br /><br />The varied range of learning does pose challenges for the consistency of the entire student experience. We need to pay particular attention to alignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning outcomes: we need to make sure that the challenge is fully explicit. Do your outcomes integrate words into them such as 'appreciate uncertainty and limits of knowledge, manage own learning, initiate projects, initiative and personal responsibility, decision making in unpredictable circumstances, complex contexts, autonomously, identify a range of solutions, ...'? This favours an increased use of formative assessment and alternative examination papers and other assessment tasks.</li>
<li>Products arising from learning: Assessment to incorporate reports, papers, artefacts, logs, performances, personal accounts, ... How can we integrate these into assessment?</li>
<li>Processes involved in learning: Directly assess or give feedback on student contribution to the processes involved, as with facilitating group-work, managing own learning or dealing with uncertainties or un-forseen eventualities. If you are not taking advantage of all this work and these naturally arising products, then the chances are that the student will need to spend more time learning than someone on a similar comparable module that is not based around EBL. (Is that fair?)</li>
<li>Contexts in which learning occurs: Taking account of authentic, professional, unpredictable contexts in setting level of support, tasks and criteria. These contexts really do enable students to hit learning outcomes as suggested above. </li>
<li>Social structures underpinning learning: EBL often works best when it takes advantage of social structures that underpin learning, as with roles, groups and pairs. Thus we will look for assessment and feedback that builds on the involvement of others in pairs and groups, pattern of meetings, or through specific roles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fairness </strong><br /><br />Given the genuine variation in tasks/contexts/level of support involved, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw up assessment criteria that take into account the varying demands faced by students, especially when contexts differ significantly (as with lab and desk-based research). </li>
<li>Ensure that the credit size reflects the actual amount of student work involved in the module, or scale down your expectations.</li>
<li>Use of coursework requirements can avoid penalising students in cases where learning is contingent on factors beyond their control. </li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>... and applying this to your own practice</strong><br /><br />Consider a given assessment task, along with the associated assessment criteria and feedback mechanisms. How could you adapt this to:</p>
<ul>
<li>draw from moments of contingency; </li>
<li>take greater account of the full range of learning outcomes, products arising, processes, social structures and contexts involved; </li>
<li>introduce efficiencies in staff time; </li>
<li>and ensure fairness to students? &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Concluding thoughts ...</strong><br /><br />The Carrick model (see references below)&nbsp; suggests that we should value renovating practice, and that embedding requires extensive personal engagement. So perhaps look for opportunities that will make it easier to implement some of these ideas, where change is already planned or where you can adapt existing practice. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Black, P. and William, D.

              <title>research ethics for e-learning with popular technologies</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2267</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2267</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm interested in finding out whether members of the group are using popular digital technologies such as Second Life, SMS, Mxit, YouTube, Facebook or Twitter (in fact any digital technologies, hardware or software, that have a widespread appeal) in teaching and learning. I don't mean those technologies that are just purely educational or institutional such as e-portfolios, PRS or VLEs.<br /> <br /> I'm interested because if people are using them for teaching and learning then there must also be people researching or evaluating this education activity.<br /> <br /> It strikes me that such research or evaluation is interesting from an ethical point of view.<br /> <br /> These digital technologies and digital networks are creating more and more places and modes that people can inhabit, where communities can form, where ideas, images and information can be produced, stored, shared, transmitted and consumed: these include social networking technologies such as Facebook, gaming technologies such as World of Warcraft; multi-user virtual environments such as Second Life, augmented reality tools such as Second Sight, context-aware systems using CreatorScape and mobile communities using Twitter.<br /> <br /> I think these technologies, each in their different ways, transform rather than merely reproduce the nature of learning and I suspect educationalists in many subjects and sectors already have several years' experience of using them. Educational research already explores some of their initiatives and opportunities and accounts are entering the literature.<br /> <br /> As I say, I think however there are ethical dimensions to researching these various pedagogies and technologies and these are perhaps lagging behind other aspects of this exciting but emergent and fragmented research area.<br /> <br /> In my view, ethics embraces everything from laws and regulations at one extreme to standards to expectations about language, taste, fashion, etiquette and behaviour at the other extreme.<br /> <br /> Ethics in the first sense is significant and problematic in this field because of the potential gulf or lag between formal institutional and legal expectations and procedures on the one hand and evolving research practice on the other.<br /> <br /> Ethics in the second sense, a more interesting sense I reckon, is important to researchers in this field because of the need to align their methods to the ethical expectations of the communities with whom they work; these expectations are however volatile, tacit, transient, chaotic and local to each community. And of course, the learner's experiences and expectations, their ethical expectations, of these educational experiences is obviously informed by the experiences and expectations they bring within from the 'outside' world where they already use Facebook, Twitter and Second Life.<br /> <br /> I'm interested in hearing whether the ethics, in the sense I've used the word, of researching the educational use of these kinds of environments interests other people in the group.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
From the University of Gloucestershire:
</p>
<p>
'From October 2006 to January 2007, 31 students took the Language &amp;
Ecology module, and were encouraged to take part in the international
research community through working with the Language &amp; Ecology
Research Forum - the main international forum for research in
ecolinguistics. The Forum links together a network of scholars, has an
online journal (Language &amp; Ecology ISSN 1745-3631), a range of
resources, and a dedicated section for the EZ102 Language &amp; Ecology
module was created. Right from the start it is suggested that students
think of themselves as contributors to the research community, actively
exploring the texts which surround them and sharing insights with the
community.'

              <title>Combining collaborative and individual work</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/241</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/241</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<strong>When studying current professional issues, students may need both to learn from each other and to relate their collective work to their own individual circumstances.</strong>
<p>Collaborative work in areas of professional practice offers opportunities for students to share and to learn from each other’s experience. However, collective products introduce problems for assessment, and do not in themselves require students to apply their collaborative work to their own circumstances.
<p>
This course, on current issues in public management and social enterprise, combines and balances students collaborative and individual work.
<p>
In learning sets of 4-7, students work use a Wiki to produce a joint report, suitable for the senior staff of their organisations, on a current management issue, selected from a list of five. They then write an individual analysis and critique of the joint report from the perspective of its fitness and readiness for their own organisation.
<p>
In the assessment of this activity, the joint report counts for 40% of the total marks (normally all students in a set receive the same mark, with some scope for adjustment if the contributions have been significantly unequal), with the remainder being for the individual work.

              <description><![CDATA[Healthcare management, like many professional fields, changes very rapidly. This course addresses the problem of keeping content topical by getting students to research a case study which can then become a resource for future cohorts. This also encourages students to be actively involved in their learning. Students are given the task of finding information about the healthcare system in another country, guided by a framework of topic headings and key issues, with suggestions for websites and other resources to use. They thus also learn about healthcare systems other than their own. The presentation of their findings is assessed. [Peter Taylor]

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/166</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/166</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>PhD students are required to provide evidence of skills developed during their doctoral research, but compiling such evidence can be a time-consuming task.
<p>
In this scheme, science, maths and technology students complete an audit of their generic skills audit early in their PhD work. This audit directs them to online resources which offer guidance on what evidence to present for skills which they already have and how to develop new skills. Students are encouraged to file skills evidence in an ePortfolio, and to have it checked by their supervisor, as part of their normal working routine.
<p>
The ePortfolio is assessed simultaneously with the PhD thesis, but independently of it.
