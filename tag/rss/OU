              <title>WED: The use of student generated webpages to improve revision and ongoing mathematical development (Angela Phillips)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8891</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8891</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Revision is an area that some teachers feel is often not taught well or in some cases taught at all (Slater, 2012).&nbsp; In a study of revision techniques used, 8 out of 10 were found to be ineffective and could hinder learning (Cohen, 2013). Therefore, it is important that students learn effective revision techniques (Pinantoan, 2012).&nbsp; To engage in ongoing mathematical development students need to become responsible for their learning journey (Dunlosky, 2013). The learning activity has been designed to enable students to have the opportunity to revise effectively, in different ways and produce a continually developing web based revision resource.</p>
<p>The project focus will be the implementation of the learning activity.&nbsp; The implementation of a project has the most impact on the overall outcomes (Durlak, 2011).&nbsp; &nbsp;The project will be presented as a case study, as the project is a real-life scenario, that does not have a clear end point (UNSW Australia, 2013). The project will be showcased in full using a webpage, (Phillips-5, 2014).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the use of student generated blogs has become popular and is viewed as an effective learning activity (Orlando, 2010), no research into the use of blogs for Mathematical revision and development was found.</p>
<p>Research from (Australian Government Department of Education, n.d.) shows that teachers should aim to bring subject content, teaching and learning pedagogy and technology together.&nbsp; This is known as Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) (TPACK, n.d.).&nbsp; The TPACK framework has been used to integrate the technology into the learning activity.</p>
<p>Different learning activities can have differing impact on the outcomes of revision, may popular techniques, such as highlighting and rereading text have little impact on performance (Dunlosky, 2013).&nbsp; However, using different strategies can have a positive impact on results.&nbsp; The positive strategies have been used in this project.</p>
<p>The project has been trialled with a class of year 8 students, who are generally twelve to thirteen years of age, in South Australia.&nbsp; The activity was introduced to the class and set for homework (Phillips-1, 2014).&nbsp; Standard revision activities, as the students had completed in the previous semester, were run during class time to gage the impact of the project.</p>
<p>The students produced their on webpages and then peer assessed each other&rsquo;s work (Phillips-4, 2014).&nbsp; The feedback was then collated and distributed back to the students, who were then asked to review the feedback of their pages and revisit their work.</p>
<p>The students completed the Semester 2 Common Test and then were given the personal questionnaire, to complete to give their views of the activity and the impact on the revision completed.&nbsp; Students were also asked to give their views on how likely they were to continue to use the webpage for revision (Phillips-3, 2014).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of the student&rsquo;s opinions on the project, alongside the results comparing the class&rsquo;s results will be discussed at length during the H818 conference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come along and find out if the project has met the initial aims.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>In order to continue to develop the best possible Media Player for <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">The Open University</a>, we lay down some guiding principles, and notes on how the current player seeks to meet those principles.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://mediaplayer.open.ac.uk/">OU Media Player</a> should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Attain and exceed the highest standards for accessibility to those with disabilities.</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of <a title="Open University accessibility standard" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/about/web-standards/standards/accessibility">the OU</a>, <a title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, W3C Recommendation 11 December 2008" href="http://w3.org/TR/WCAG20">WCAG 2.0</a> and <a title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0, W3C Recommendation 20 March 2014" href="http://w3.org/TR/wai-aria">WAI-ARIA</a> standards and guidelines (W3C),</li>
<li>User and expert testing by IET of early prototypes for new functionality, and of the Player, with time planned in to implement fixes;</li>
<li>HTML5 player based on the third-party, open-source <a href="http://mediaelementjs.com">MediaElement.js</a> libraries, with Javascript plugins to replace and extend functionality;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be usable by the mainstream as well as those with disabilities;</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>User and expert testing by <a title="Institute of Educational Technology" href="http://iet.open.ac.uk/">IET</a> of early prototypes for new functionality, and of the Player, with time planned in to implement fixes;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Represent the OU appropriately. Carry the correct branding.</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>LTS designs visual theme(s) for the Player that are both accessible and usable, and that fit in with The Open University's overall <a title="Open University brand" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/about/web-standards/standards/design-standards/brand-guidelines">brand</a> and <a title="Open University mission" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/about/main/mission">values</a>;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be usable on mobiles and tablets.</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML5 player based on MediaElement.js;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be simple for authors to embed the Player in content;</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of the <a title="oEmbed specification" href="http://oembed.com/">oEmbed</a> specification;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be embeddable in a variety of platforms, (both OU-branded &ndash; OU VLE, <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/">OpenLearn</a>, Study at OU, OU Drupal etc, and non-OU branded sites);</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of a service-based approach;</li>
<li>Use of platform-specific plugins, for example, the oEmbed plugin for Drupal;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be simple to deploy new features.</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platform specific themes and an update process which conforms to IT change request process.</li>
<li>Issues and changes logged and tracked via LTS Redmine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track usage patterns, to help improve the Player and inform other University activity.</p>
<p>The current implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of Google Analytics for the <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/">Podcast</a> Player variant;</li>
<li>Tracking of play, pause and completion events;</li>
<li>Planned: add a feedback form.</li>

              <title>OU Media Player June 2014 release (blog)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://freear.org.uk/content/ou-media-player-june-2014-release">Original post</a>.</p>
<p>I'm happy to be reporting on a new release of the <a href="http://mediaplayer.open.edu">OU Media Player</a> that happened in mid-June. This release fixed a number of bugs, including one relating to Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8, and another involved fixing security warnings for non-secure audio/video media files when the Player is embedded on a site via HTTPS.</p>
<p>There were also a couple of enhancements. One entails hiding the title panel on pages that are Open University branded. This has proved to be a stumbling block in some deployments, as the titles are not always meaningful to the public (they may be used internally to distinguish tracks), and it looks odd to have multiple copies the OU's shield logo.</p>
<p>Another feature we added was Google Analytics for the legacy Open2.net media embedded in <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn">OpenLearn</a>. This is feature isn't visible to the end-user. However, it is important so that we can track and report on usage. Based on this, I can already report that the Player is currently embedded in something like 2000 places and receives approaching 4000 plays per month.</p>
<p>Analytics tracks some "events" for the Player, currently, "play", "pause" and the audio/video track is "ended", . <a href="https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/master/src/js/mep-feature-googleanalytics.js">GitHub: ../mediaelement ../mep-feature-googleanalytics.js</a>. We're interested in doing more with the Player analytics, so please watch this space.</p>
<p>You can see the <a href="http://track.olnet.org/markdown?url=//iet-embed-acct.open.ac.uk/README.md#releases">full release notes</a> for version 1.1.9.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Colin Brown&#39;s H800 Week 8/9 Design Narrative</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8252</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8252</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>My role as an OU associate lecturer was to design and facilitate an online tutorial for my own group of 3<sup>rd</sup> level undergraduate students undertaking a module focused on &lsquo;promoting public health: skills, perspectives and practice&rsquo;.</em></p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>This was the first online tutorial for a new group of students in the initial weeks of the module.&nbsp; The online tutorial takes place within the VLE as part of the Tutor Group Forum (TGF) and as such it is &lsquo;closed&rsquo; i.e. available only to the tutor (me) and the students allocated to me.&nbsp; It was asynchronous and students were able to post their contributions at any time for a period of approximately 2 weeks.&nbsp; Given this was the 3<sup>rd</sup> week of the module the group was still forming and relationships although developing well remained tentative.&nbsp; Their interaction was driven principally because the online tutorial was part of a learning activity within the timetable, but was not compulsory.&nbsp; In terms of motivation and beliefs this was driven (a)in their role as OU students with a desire to learn; and (b) a personal and/or professional interest in health and wellbeing.&nbsp; Thus, as a voluntary activity they had to choose to take part.</em></p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>Principally my intention was to take abstract theoretical concepts from the module which had been considered through academic writing as well as more practically through case studies (including video material) and demonstrate that these issues were being considered in the &lsquo;real world&rsquo; of public health and health policy where they would be expected to practise i.e. to show that these concepts are more than abstract, but also to place them in a context more directly relevant to them than was the case in the module material.&nbsp; The measures of success were (a) quite pragmatic in terms of the amount of online posting and interaction generated (b) the quality of the posts with regard to the academic context in which the issues were being considered (c) evidence that they were getting beyond the module material into more immediately tangible areas (d) that their understanding of abstract concepts and real world application.</em></p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>The first thing was to write a clear set of instructions explaining the nature of the task and what was expected.&nbsp; This included providing an additional resource by way of an extract from a published document (The CMO Scotland Annual Report).&nbsp; The first part of the activity was to take a key theoretical concept from the module which had been the subject of a particular learning activity where they were expected to make contributions; and linkage to a chapter in the Module Reader.&nbsp; I wanted them to collaborate in the TGF to share their own views, and to develop this in the context of the additional material I had provided.&nbsp; I also asked that they offer their own views from a more personal perspective about a particular aspect (community based assets).&nbsp; I then offered some additional interventions: (a) reinforcement and encouragement for the work undertaken in the initial part of the exercise; (b) a summary which captured their discussions and thinking so that it became their product and could be used in TMAs etc thereafter; (c) links to further resources which would allow them to see the extent to which their thinking was in line with mainstream practical policy activity happening in practice. Generally, while this exercise worked well with those who participated, a number of students did not make specific contributions which perhaps diminished the wider collaborative effort.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Results</strong></h2>
<p><em>In general terms the expected outcomes were achieved in terms of the level of discussion; understanding of the subject matter amongst the group who participated; and recognition that what they were learning in the module had real world application. Also, the activity probably helped so support engagement and cohesion within the group.&nbsp; However, there a number of students did not contribute directly and the reasons for this were not explored further (as it was a voluntary activity).&nbsp; It could also have been the case that some students were not comfortable with the expected level of online participation or perhaps intimated by the technical nature or complexity of the discussion.&nbsp; The evidence of the level of participation remains within the module archive and could be quantified in different ways e.g. number and length of posts, perhaps against more academic criteria how the students used their experience in subsequent academic activity such as the TMA.&nbsp; The &lsquo;product&rsquo; i.e. the summary of the discussion remains available as a Word document. </em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>Looking back on this experience with a degree of critical distance it did work well and I would use it again, perhaps updating the supplementary material to ensure it maintains its contemporary application.&nbsp; It could work well for other tutors (each tutor designs their own online tutorial in K311 although there is a degree of informal sharing).&nbsp; The one thing which really stands out &lsquo;on reflection&rsquo; is the extent to which there is tangible evidence of the results.&nbsp; I know what I think was achieved and from the levels of participation I would contend that those students who participated.&nbsp; But, beyond the summary of the discussion (which I produced) how do I really know whether this intervention worked?&nbsp; Also, what measures might I want to put in place in future?</em></p>

              <description><![CDATA[I have been so immersed in e-learning these last few weeks that I am dreaming about it - and not to waste the opportunity I am blogging about the dream as I was in a digital ocean of my own making. Indeed for the last three years I have described Web 1.0 as a digital ocean and Web 2.0 as a universal water-cyle that includes clouds, river systems and oceans.

Context and personality is all in relation to my activity in the OLDs MOOC. 

I have just completed the OU's Masters in Open & Distance Education. End of Module Assignment went off on Jan 17. I wanted to do H817 to bring H807, also on innivations in e-learning as it was somewat rusty in content - too long on the ocean and more obvious to someone who was working in a web agency producing web-based learning for the Department of Health and FT knowledge in 2001. In all of this I would have been the senior producer or web editor - words and content rather than learning design or programming. OLDs MOOC would help bring things into focus and contrast the fast turn around of one or two hour e-learning for corporates such as Virgin, Lloyds Bank and KPMG. The pattern of activity is largelly the same with some nodes of activity reduced, some increased, while evaluation, quality assurance, proof reading and testing happened at several stages from beginning to end - I would proof read proposal documents at one end then pick up what we called the wireframe, that take spots of interest in the build in a wiki like platform as a group of six or so colleagues built the thing. I'd test inhouse, then test again once the content is on the client server. More of the same in Brighton, something of a cluster of e-learning compsnies, was on the cards until conversations with friends and indications of how I might continue had me thinking about doctoral research.

I pressed on each week with the activities just as I do with the OU - have a fair stab at it all, team up, comment and collaborate. I grab screens, take photos and blog at every opportunity. My ideas for design were too off the edge to attract interest but I found a home and four or more of us got on with this.

A few things happened or kept hapenning. I don't know how to describe it but I am always lost in Cloudworks. It isn't even cloudlike in the sense of a fluid, vibrsnt system, rather, I'm affraid it has been more like a visit to Macro at Killingworth New Town outside Newcastle upon Tyne. An urban environment but little sense of anyone being there. I've been blogging since 1999 and even then tended to get a reciprocal response to comments I left on my stuff.  Between three of us, and then two, we wrote and exchanged in Google Docs and then by email. More often thsn not others would cut and paste my content in as I was broken down in a cul de sac somewhere.

Still, the last MOOC I did felt like standing in Liverpool station during a six month ling rush hour wearing an invisibility cloak.

The other reason I needed to put my efforts elsewhere is that I started OU Module H808 Practice-based research in educational technology. Forking out £1250 tends to focus the mind especially as meat, alcohol, and most travel has been ditched to cover this.

So, detailed blogs for weeks 1-4 or to 5 while following closely since saving emails, reading bosts, and saving links all for a return later this year. Several times 'the penny dropped' so from a Design point of view I have much to build on even though I suspect I will continue to be employed as a consultsnt, project manager and writer however much I would like to play with the Lego myself.]]></description>

              <title>Use WAI-ARIA landmark roles in new &amp; existing development projects</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7953</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7953</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published <a href="http://w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0</a>&nbsp;as a "Candidate Recommendation" in January 2011.</p>
<p>This defines "roles" and in particular landmark roles. Landmark roles complement (or replace) the idea of a "skip" link -- they inform assistive technologies like screen readers that parts of Web page are "navigation", the main content, complementary information (think, a news feed in a side block), and so on. The AT can then announce the landmark to the end-user, for example when the whole page is read aloud by a screen reader, or when a page outline is displayed.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest that they should be adopted for all new and existing Web development projects, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are widely understood by screen readers, including JAWS, <a href="http://www.nvda-project.org/">NVDA</a> and Window-Eyes;</li>
<li>They are HTML attributes not elements, so older browsers silently ignore them;</li>
<li>And, therefore they are low-risk;</li>
<li>They can be used with HTML 4, XHTML 1/1.1 and HTML5.</li>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#landmark_roles">landmark roles</a> are:</p>
<ul>

<li>complementary</li>
<li>contentinfo</li>
<li>form</li>
<li>main</li>

</ul>
<p>I've used landmark roles on recent projects including <a href="http://track.olnet.org/">Track OER</a> and the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/webstandards/v3.0/">OUICE</a>-based site theme for the <a href="http://mediaplayer.open.edu/">OU Media Player</a>. You can <a title="View source in Firefox and Chrome.." href="view-source:http://mediaplayer.open.edu#line108">view source</a> to search for them.</p>
<h3>WAI-ARIA roles in HTML5</h3>
<p>If you choose to use the new <a href="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html">HTML5 'sectional' elements</a> use <a href="http://w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_HTML5_nav_element#Example:The_.3Cnav.3E_element">the WAI-ARIA role too</a> -- that is [nav role=navigation] ... [/nav]. There is more consistent support for WAI-ARIA roles among assistive technology than there is for the sectional elements.</p>
<p>There are some example code snippets and useful links below.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6684</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6684</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I've proposed a mini-project here, for IET to host an experimental embedding service on behalf of The Open University. This will serve a similar purpose to Embed.ly (<a href="http://api.embed.ly/">api.embed.ly</a>) and Oohembed (<a href="http://oohembed.com/">oohembed.com</a>), and act as a proxy on behalf of other embed or service providers, for example, YouTube, <a title="Learning Activity Management System" href="http://wiki.lamsfoundation.org/display/lamsdocs/About+LAMS#AboutLAMS-whatIs">LAMS</a>, Prezi and Google Docs forms.</p>
<p>The embedding service will provide an oEmbed interface (<a title="The specification" href="http://oembed.com/">oembed.com</a>), compatible with Wordpress 2.9+, jQuery, Drupal and other software. It will provide embeds:</p>
<ol>
<li>That are accessible to those with disabilities,</li>
<li>That are usable on mobiles and tablet devices, eg. iPad,</li>
<li>On behalf of niche services, eg. LAMS,</li>
<li>That incorporate analytics/ tracking, eg. Google Analytics, Piwik.</li>
</ol>
<p>The four points above are what will differentiate the service from Embed.ly and Oohembed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed version 1 services: YouTube, LAMS, Prezi, Google Docs forms (priorities for OULDI).</li>
<li>Likely version 2 services: <a href="http://www.mathtran.org/">Mathtran.org (OU)</a>, <a href="http://cohere.open.ac.uk/">Cohere.open.ac.uk (OU)</a>, <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">MIT Scratch</a>.</li>
<li>Relates to: this project will build on my prototype at <a href="http://maltwiki.org/">Maltwiki.org</a>, and work through <a href="http://olnet.org/node/142">OLnet</a>. It relates to <a title="Open University Learning Design Initiative" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/OULDI/">OULDI</a>/Cloudworks, and the <a href="http://freear.org.uk/content/ou-media-player-project">OU media player project</a>.</li>
<li>Use: I envisage that the service will be used by OU and third-party blogs and web sites. I will be proposing a <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> filter plugin for oEmbed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A note on terms and conditions</p>
<p>There will be terms and conditions that state that the OU makes no claims on the intellectual property of service providers like YouTube and Prezi or their contributors. We simply provide a conduit, and act on behalf of the service providers. They should also state that we do NOT store content or software (eg. Flash) from the service providers, except where the content is released under a permissive license (eg. LAMS sequences are Creative Commons licensed, so we may cache copies of LAMS SVG files).</p>
<p>More soon! Feedback welcome.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Tony <a href="http://blog.ouseful.info/2011/02/06/the-most-accessible-media-player-on-the-web/">Hirst has just blogged</a> about the Office for Disability Issues new accessible media player AKA the "Most Accessible Media Player on the Web". Both he and <a href="http://technocrapy.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/are-waterfalls-agile/">Will Woods</a> have alluded to work that The Open University is undertaking. I thought I'd fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>The OU is at the start of a 6 month development to create a multimedia player that (we hope):</p>
<ol>
<li>Will be an "attractive" player that the average designer/ blogger would be happy to use on their site. </li>
<li>Can be used in a variety of contexts - our Moodle-based virtual learning environment, OpenLearn, OU-Drupal sites, blogs, Cloudworks... </li>
<li>Will deliver content mostly from the OU podcast site in the contexts mentioned above. </li>
<li>Will be accessible to users with disabilities - both in terms of control, and display of alternatives like transcripts and captions. </li>
<li>Usable on a variety of devices, including mobiles and tablets. </li>
<li>Will be delivered in a maintainable way. </li>
</ol>
<p>Taking points 1 and 2 together, my personal mantra is "<em>If its accessible, but not attractive then we haven't succeeded</em>". So we are talking unobtrusive accessibility.</p>
<p>Taking the final point regarding delivery. The main method for embedding the player, will be using a REST-ful web service, based on the <a href="http://oembed.com/">oEmbed specification</a>. This service is available for many providers, including YouTube, Flickr, Slideshare, Vimeo... See the <a href="http://oohembed.com/">oohEmbed</a> and <a href="http://api.embed.ly/">Embedly</a> sites. This will be transparent to the end-user and the author of content. An author on a Wordpress blog will merely type something like:</p>
<pre> [embed] <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/pod/mst209-fun-of-the-fair#079b8e506c">http://podcast.open.ac.uk/pod/mst209-fun-of-the-fair#079b8e506c</a> [/embed]
</pre>
<p>The blog software will handle the rest. oEmbed is used or consumed by various software/sites, including <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds">Wordpress 2.9 onwards</a>, the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/noradio/status/24790949420">new Twitter</a>, Ars Technica, StatusNet, and our own Cloudworks/ <a title="Cloudworks open-sourced" href="http://getcloudengine.org//wiki/oEmbed">CloudEngine</a>. Many multimedia providers can be plugged in with little effort, a great benefit, so authors will be able to embed from YouTube, Flickr and OU-podcast in the same way. The promotion of a service-based approach does not preclude bloggers from using conventional embed codes/snippets.</p>
<p>The player itself will probably be Flash-based on desktops, and will fallback to HTML5 for tablets and mobiles. This is dictated by the encoding infrastructure on the podcast site, and the current state of the various video and audio codecs.</p>
<p>The controls/ buttons for the player will be HTML and Javascript-based, not Flash-based. This follows examples like Chris Heilmann's <a href="http://icant.co.uk/easy-youtube/?http://youtube.com/watch?v=uBdwM7oQivk">Easy YouTube player</a>, and builds on my own <a href="http://maltwiki.org/">MALT Wiki prototype</a> (MALT Wiki is used by Cloudworks, and is oEmbed-based).</p>
<p>We will be using third-party Flash and Javascript components where possible, and implementing the player and web service.</p>
<p>As to the evaluations that we have done. Back in March 2009, I evaluated players including YouTube, Easy YouTube, jwPlayer, NCAM's ccPlayer and Flowplayer. See <a href="http://slideshare.net/nfreear/malt-wiki-techshare2009/18">slide 18 of this presentation</a> and <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AgJMkdi3MO4HdFNDdElzUUhMejAzaWZoMFJ0emw3a0E&hl=en_GB&single=true&gid=1&output=html">this spreadsheet</a>. I tested with screen readers (JAWS, and <a href="http://nvda-project.org/">NVDA</a>), and also compared APIs for the players (how "scriptable" they were), licenses and so on.</p>
<p>As part of the current player project I wrote a design brief with screen shots of various existing players outside and inside the OU. This included YouTube, EasyYouTube and the <a href="http://www.officefordisability.gov.uk/inclusive-communications/channels/odi-accessible-media-player.php">ODI media player</a> - a late addition. It was not an evaluation per se. It instead presented what was out there - we may want to use some features, we may not.</p>
<p>In the current project plan, we have built in accessibility testing, using expert evaluation. And we hope to do testing with real users too, using the <a href="http://jennielee.open.ac.uk/labs/">Jennie Lee laboratories</a>.</p>
<p>I'll conclude by saying that we hope the player will be accessible and will meet the needs of authors/ bloggers and end users. I don't think we will claim to be "the most accessible player on the Web". After all that sets you up for a world of criticism!</p>
<p>Feedback and ideas are as ever welcome.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Tool: OU Annotate</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6213</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6213</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I was in a meeting today of The Open University's accessibility practitioner's group. Louise Olney, a project manager in Learning and Teaching Solutions kindly came to talk to us about OU Annotate, and in particular the work that is being done to improve it's accessibility.</p>
<p>"OU Annotate enables you add your own annotations to web pages.  You can create an annotation for an entire web page, like a bookmark, or you can select and highlight specific text.  You can add comments and tags to your annotations and, if you wish, share them with others."</p>
<p>OU Annotate is I think somewhat similar to <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5294">Snip.ly</a> and <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2465">Diigo</a> (though as I haven't used either of these, I could be wrong!)</p>
<p>Open University students and staff can install the <a href="http://students.open.ac.uk/annotate/">OU Annotate bookmarklet and view the manager via StudentHome</a>. And you may also like to <a href="http://screencast.com/t/eh4Cu7GY">view the lead developer, Jenny Gray's screencast</a>, and <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/oublog/view.php?user=60&tag=ouannotate">Jenny's blog posts</a>.</p>
<p>I've given the OU Annotate bookmarklet a try, and so far it looks impressive. I'm particularly happy to see the functionality to export annotations in various formats, including to Google Docs - intriguing. I would also welcome the option to publish an RSS/Atom feed of my personal annotations. I'm a fairly heavy Delicious user. If it was possible to make annotations world readable (probably a big ask), or if anyone who self-registers for a <a href="https://msds.open.ac.uk/SAMSWebSelfRegistrationNet/SAMSDefault/SAMS006_Default.aspx">free Open University account</a> could use OU Annotate I'd consider switching.</p>
<p>Personally, I think that OU Annotate would be a great marketing tool for the OU.</p>]]></description>

<p>Some positive elements mentioned in our group were:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Its kind of like being told to go on a journey and being presented with 20 different routes that will all get you there just on a different track and perhaps at a different speed.</li>
<li>The metaphor of clouds is very clear and powerful.</li>
<li>There is a wealth of information on the site.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Some suggestions for areas of improvement were:</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Some clouds are empty and it costs time to check them all out to find which ones are worth exploring.</li>
<li>It's yet another social network to share resources, links etc. Why wouldn't I make a summary of conference notes on my blog and send a link around with Twitter?</li>
<li>The problem is that I just don't have the time to get involved in them at the level I'd like to.</li>

<p><strong>Comment from Heather<br /></strong>"I'm a bit bashful about posting this YouTube link, as it looks very amateur compared to some of the other items on here! I teach on A215, which is taught online except for two day schools. My hope was that this video would personalise the experience a bit more for the students, as well as reinforcing some key information at the start of the course. I included the link in my introductory email to them."</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The embedded video and slideshare presentation&nbsp;below were submitted for the OU 'Learning in an Open World' conference (22 -23 June 2010) by Janet Haresnape.&nbsp; Please add any comments or questions here.</p>
<p>This particular presentation has had a number of iterations because of technical issues, which has been a good learning experience for a number of people.&nbsp; For the moment I am adding the presentations but I will come back and add a description of what was done and how.</p>
<p>Comments from Janet "I'd like to make a contribution to this conference.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;a collaborative wiki-based&nbsp;activity I have deleloped for our Evolution course (S366).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the link to teh wiki with&nbsp;the live activity is&nbsp;currently being used by S366 students, so it will only be available to those with access to the course website."</p>
<p>"Instead I have made my contribution a powerpoint presentation with video clips and sound which plays automatically, and I have uploaded it to slideshare. However, when I try to view it there, none of the video clips or the sound plays."</p>
<p>"My version of Powerpoint is 2003, as installed on my OU laptop.&nbsp; The camera, microphone with which the clips were recorded were all done with borrowed equipment on someone else's computer in the Regional Centre" (logitech quick cam software set up on Windows XP&nbsp;desktop PC with headphones and mouthpiece).</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><a title="elluminate by edtechie99, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36439943@N06/4687270003/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4687270003_b821b79d04_m.jpg" alt="elluminate" width="179" height="91" /></a></p>
<p>The the OU 'Learning in an Open World' conference (22-23 June 2010) is being sponsored by Elluminate who are providing the synchronous conference space. This cloud has links to the sessions <strong>and help for known connection problems (see extra content)</strong>. Please add comments about any problems connecting to this cloud so we know for future use.&nbsp; For full details of the conference see: <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2012">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2012</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Logging in:</strong></p>
<p>Each of the four sessions takes place in a different Elluminate space, ie it has a different URL. This means you have to log into each one separately. You can only log in near the session start time, not days before. There is a limit of 400 users in each session. We can't prebook people I'm afraid, so it is a case of first come, first served.</p>
<p>The links for each session are:</p>
<p>Session 1 (22nd June, morning) playback: <a href="https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-06-22.0052.M.2B75F29C80EFE7AAEF7138B1D7E4AF.vcr&sid=cpp1">https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-06-22.0052.M.2B75F29C80EFE7AAEF7138B1D7E4AF.vcr&amp;sid=cpp1</a></p>
<p>Session 2 (22nd June, afternoon) playback: <a href="https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-06-22.0516.M.D86AEB8E871EAD6819856184070D75.vcr&sid=cpp1">https://sas.elluminate.com/p.jnlp?psid=2010-06-22.0516.M.D86AEB8E871EAD6819856184070D75.vcr&amp;sid=cpp1</a></p>
<p>Session 3 (23rd June, morning): (waiting for playback link)</p>
<p>Session 4 (23rd June, afternoon):&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #005488; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;" href="https://sas.elluminate.com/m.jnlp?password=M.9DDE389EFCE7B76F7880AE9C0939F4" target="_blank">https://sas.elluminate.com/m.jnlp?password=M.9DDE389EFCE7B76F7880AE9C0939F4</a></p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<p>Elluminate is easy to use, when you log in it launches another window, which contains the main presentation space, a text chat window and a list of who is online. You should test your setup beforehand (you may need to install Java), just so you know it works ok on your machine by visiting:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elluminate.com/Support/?id=62">http://www.elluminate.com/Support/</a>.&nbsp; if you do have problems, please see fixes in extra content section below before contacting the helpdesk for support.</p>
<p>You should ensure that you can access the setup room and that your audio is working. If you have problems, please look at the Elluminate knowledge base: <a href="http://support.elluminate.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=2653">http://support.elluminate.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=2653</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sessions</strong></p>
<p>During the sessions there will be a number of moderators who will focus discussions and deal with problems. However, please try to sort out any technical issues prior to the conference, so the chat sessions are not filled with this. Due to the large number of users, not everyone will have access to the microphone, instead during the discussion sessions moderators can allocate it to someone if they 'raise their hand' (by clicking next to their name). The text chat window will form the main channel for discussion during presentations.</p>
<p>There is a discussion slot during each session. For these we have set up a number of 'rooms' in Elluminate. You can move between rooms easily, by dragging your name onto that room. Once you are in a room, you won't hear what happens in the other rooms, so we can have multiple parallel discussions.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Suggested OER Reading List (for Academics New to OER)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3487</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>We would like to build up a suggested reading list for academics who  are new to OER and would welcome suggestions in this cloud either as  comments or links below.</strong></p>
<p>SCORE is a HEFCE-funded project (2009-2012) based at The Open University supporting individuals, projects, institutions and programmes within higher education in England who are engaged in creating, sharing and using open educational resources (OER). As well as publishing its own OER content, SCORE has a fellowship scheme, offers support and advice, mentors UK OER projects, offers events and online community support.<br /><br />A central part of SCORE is its fellowship scheme. SCORE expect to fund 36 fellowship projects between 2010 and 2012 with two thirds drawn from outside the OU. Fellows work is expected to inform, influence and impact on OER policy and practice across the higher education sector. Projects may be &lsquo;stand-alone&rsquo; or involve collaborations with other fellowship projects to address important themes in OER activity.<br /><br />Based flexibly at the OU in Milton Keynes, fellows can draw on the OU&rsquo;s expertise in creating, sharing and using OER. They will receive support from the SCORE team, mentors and the OU&rsquo;s OER fellowship community (which includes Open Learning Network (OLnet) international fellows).&nbsp; This reading list will be a useful resource not only for SCORE and OLnet fellows but also an open resource for anyone who is interested in finding out more about OER.<br /><br />For more information about SCORE: <a href="http://www8.open.ac.uk/score/" target="_blank">http://www8.open.ac.uk/score/</a><br />For more information about OLnet: <a href="http://olnet.org/" target="_blank">http://olnet.org/</a></p>]]></description>

              <title>Using Pre-released Third Party Articles in the Final Assessment: Course: T324 - Keeping Ahead in ICT</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3202</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3202</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The second part (Part 2) of the examination in this course is worth 60% and&nbsp;is based on third-party articles that are issued to students in advance mid-way through the course and are made available in the exam room. This approach&nbsp;was first used in 2007 and performance has been similar from the two cohorts who have taken this new style exam. Overall pass rates are high although it does appear that students, in spending more time preparing for Part 2 and despite detailed advice, are sometimes not giving Part 1 (short, comparatively straightforward questions covering the whole course) due attention. Slight changes are planned for 2009 with formative CMA quizzes planned for 2010.</p>
<p>Whilst pre-release examinations are not new to the OU, it is novel for undergraduate teaching of ICTs (Information Communications Technologies). This form of assessment means students can be asked rather more demanding questions, but without having to rely completely on memory &ndash; it therefore represents a desire for an ECA sitting somewhere between a traditional examination and a labour-intensive projects and that does not place too great demands on memory for the student.</p>]]></description>

<div>SocialLearn is exploring the potential of the social web for learning and sensemaking (both academic, and in the workplace) with specific interest in how different OU communities might benefit (e.g. students, staff, researchers, alumni). In this session, we'll give an update on some of the project's thinking and prototyping.</div>

<div>
<div>This will be a work-in-progress update, in which Simon will be inviting input on what KMi research/technologies could plug into SocialLearn, eg<br /> 
<ul>
<li>Natural language parsing to improve user profiling</li>
<li> Analytics and recommendation engines</li>
<li> Merging social graphs from the cloud</li>

<p><strong>Robert Saunders </strong>is a Reader in Molecular Genetics in the Department of Life Sciences, where he researches the basic biology of ageing.&nbsp; In that research, he uses the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, and takes a genetic approach.&nbsp; From January 2008 until February 2010, he held the potition of Academic Coordinator in the Research School, in which capacity he led the Research Career Development Team.&nbsp; The RCD team is responsible for the delivery of career development events across all disciplines, and for all career stages.</p>
<p>Robert's research career followed a stereotyped path typical of the sciences.&nbsp; His first degree was in Genetics at the University of Edinburgh.&nbsp; Subsequently he embarked on a career in Drosophila research with a PhD in molecular genetics, also at Edinburgh.&nbsp; From there, he moved to Imperial College and subsequently the University of Dundee for postdoctoral research, during which time he studied the cell cycle, and conducted genomic research, again using the fly as a model.&nbsp; He continued the genomic research while undertaking a Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship in which&nbsp;&nbsp; techniques he developed for the Drosophila genome project were applied to the medically important fly <em>Anopheles gambiae</em>.</p>
<p>Robert joined the Open University in 1999, since when his research focus has been on aspects of the basic biology of ageing; specifically on oxidative stress and its relationship to the ageing process, and currently on modelling the human progeroid disorder, Werner's syndrome in flies.</p>
<p><strong>Vivien Bacigalupo</strong> was appointed to the post of Head of Research Degrees in 2008 following on from her 15 years of experience working for The Open University. She was previously the Head of Partnerships Office having managed or facilitated over 25 successful partnerships. Prior to this she was a Programme Manager in the Faculty of Health and Social Care and a Course Manager in the Science faculty. She has also worked as an Associate Lecturer and was seconded to the Centre for Outcomes Base Education for 6 months. In her various roles she has gained much experience of University Administration and Governance. Prior to joining The Open University, Vivien was a science teacher (12-18 age group), but has also worked as a production manager in a crisp factory and as a technical sales manager for an American company selling modified starches to the food and pharmaceutical industries.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2978</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2978</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>A new cloudscape has been created to make commenting on individual contributions easier.&nbsp; Please see </strong><a href="/cloudscape/view/2128"><strong>http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2128</strong></a><strong>&nbsp; for a a full list of contributions and links to clouds for each one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>See below for the original call</strong></p>
<p>Want to contribute something about your project, work or research to the OU conference taking place online on 22 to 23 June 2010? We'd love to have it! Unlike previous conferences where papers are selected, we want non-paper based contributions and we accept anything (as long as it's relevant and not rude).</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>First create a digital artefact for us and upload it somewhere - some examples formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://slideshare.net">Slideshare</a> presentation</li>
<li><a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> video</li>
<li><a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> photos</li>
<li>Another Cloud in Cloudworks</li>
</ul>
<p>But you may choose another format (eg an <a href="http://xtranormal.com">Xtranormal</a> movie).</p>
<p>Then post your link below in the comments. If it is an embeddable format (eg YouTube), then I will add it in to this cloud, so all the content is visible here, and if not I'll add it as a link.</p>
<p>In the conference programme we have four discussion sessions where hopefully we can draw on these inputs. To have your contribution considered for inclusion in the main programme the <strong>deadline is 16 June</strong>.</p>
<p>We'd love to hear about your project and for you to help us explore the concept, perspectives and issues around openness in education.</p>
<p>You need to be registered in Cloudworks to submit content.&nbsp; The details of the overall conference are in the cloudscape: <a href="/cloud/view/2994">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2012</a>&nbsp;and the programme is in the cloud: <a href="/cloud/view/2994">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2994</a>.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Paul Mundin of the OU Learning Design Initiative has undertaken a detailed mapping of the current curriculum processes at the OU to produce a series of 14 'as is' representations of the curriculum from overall institutional level, through to indivudal courses. The "stage gate process" acts as a driver for curriculum development and approval. The figure shows one of the curriculum maps illustrating an overview of the stage gate process.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Still a bit of a work on progress, the course representation is intended to act act a support for making decisions about course design and weighing up the various factors - pedagogical, financial and course performance. It is intended to work in conjunction with the other course views, but can also be used as a kind of checklist of good practice.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This view of a course focuses on the financial aspects. The examples provided are around Open University courses which are divided in two phases: production - where the course is developed and presentation - where it is delivered to students. The OU system has a range of roles associated with these phases - a core course team, supporting staff in other Centrai Academic Units (CAU) and associate lecturers or tutors. However this view could easily be adapted for general use. The key aspects are viewing types of costs, against income and total cost.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This representation enables you to view a course at "a glance". It shows the key components of the course in terms of five main facets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidance and support</li>
<li>Information and experience</li>
<li>Communication and interaction</li>
<li>Thinking and reflection</li>
<li>Evidence and demonstration</li>
</ul>
<p>The first being the support structure provided the next three the types of learning the student does and the last the way in which the learning is assessed.</p>
<p>Three variants of this representation are provided below:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tablular version giving further information about each of the facets, along with examples.</li>
<li>A 2-D map of the OU's KE312 course (created by Mick Jones).</li>
<li>A 3-D version which shows how both the guidance and support, and the evidence and demonstation link to all three types of learning the students does.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently we have refined our thinking on this and have condensed the catgories into four - see<a href="/cloud/view/2971"> related cloud.</a></p>]]></description>
