<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Project Title &ndash; <strong><em>Designing a mini-MOOC for Assessor Training on the verification systems in Further Education&rsquo;.</em></strong></p>
<p>MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have been well established in Higher Education (HE) and for many studies this has been the primary focus (Andreatos, 2015; Evans et al., 2016).</p>
<p>However, few studies have empirically examined the influence of MOOCs in an organisational setting and more research is required to explore how MOOCs affect employee learning and development in the workplace (Dodson et al., 2015; Egloffstein and Ifenthaler, 2017).</p>
<p>With this notion research has shown the transformation of MOOC initiatives progressively moving towards the more corporate training and development sectors (Savino, 2014). According to Savino (2014) corporate leaders and training professionals have become aware how MOOCs can <em>&lsquo;supplement and support corporate training&rsquo;</em> (Savino, 2014, p. 59). Drawing on the study conducted by Savino (2014) the paper examines how MOOCs are used in both HE and corporate training and learning.&nbsp; Further prompting the idea that this method could be used in training employees (Weiss, 2013), I have taken these viewpoints to further add support to my rationale in conducting this activity and the impetus on staff development.</p>
<p>The H818 Online conference theme will focus on innovation and the scope of my idea will discuss the viability of using mini-MOOCs for training and professional development purposes.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to design a mini-MOOC to train assessors on the verification systems used in the context of a Further Education setting. The intention of bridging the skills gap in staff and promoting further development for staff to eventually become internal verifiers for the school.&nbsp; The demonstration will involve discussing elements of layout and themes from an adapted MOOC idea to create a multimedia presentation using Adobe Spark to create slides of my proposed mini-MOOC design. Furthermore, uploading the video presentation to a YouTube platform. There is scope to use Canvas which builds on the idea of teaching and learning with its &lsquo;intuitive&rsquo; interface which increases its adoption and appeal to any developer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically, it has shown that expensive, offsite training had proved ineffective, due to the lack of external support given by some awarding bodies. As Lead Internal Verifier for my centre and providing face to face training, this also presented itself with many challenges.&nbsp; For example, poor staff turnout to the sessions due to work commitments, collaboration not effectively used and some staff reluctant to share ideas.&nbsp; Therefore, due to time and staff commitment issues, looking at openness through the lens of innovation can potentially help to deliver a more innovative form of training and worth exploring.</p>
<p>Training materials will be resourced from the awarding body amalgamated with my own resources to provide the project materials in my design.&nbsp; It is likely that I will be faced with several pedagogical challenges, such as the reluctance for participants to share more openly.&nbsp; Therefore, further research into using situated &lsquo;Design Patterns&rsquo; is paramount to seek possible solutions to such issues (Liyanagunawardena et al., 2015).</p>

              <title>MON: Evaluation of game-based SRS (Student Response Systems) as OER and examples of open practices in secondary education (Ognjen Vukas)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11971</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11971</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I intend to explore the theme of innovation in the world of edtech start-ups such as the popular quizzing applications Kahoot, Quizlet Live, Socrative and Quizizz (Rose, 2017), and assess their suitability to support open practices in secondary education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education is the third most popular category in the Apple iOS App Store (Statista, 2018). This illustrates the growth of the market in edtech apps and services, which is also evident from the billions in venture capital funding that thousands of edtech start-ups have attracted (Berger, 2017). Many of these start-ups have adopted strategies which rely on freemium business models and user generated content. Game-based SRS have used gamification and the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) trend to achieve widespread adoption, especially in secondary education. These apps build on the tradition of Electronic Voting Systems (EVS) or clickers which first appeared in the 1960s and since then have been used in both HE and in compulsory education (Deal, 2007).&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the open education perspective, these are interesting developments as edtech companies are creating platforms for the free sharing of resources amongst teachers and other training practitioners. The vast majority of 51 million public Kahoot quizzes (Harrell, 2018) or 300 million Quizlet study sets (Quizlet, n.d.) are created and shared freely by their users, teachers and learners, although they have both started to offer resources from educational publishers (Kolodny, 2017).</p>
<p>I intend to evaluate these services against the five Rs of OER (Weller, 2014). I also intend to explore the impact commercial interests and market forces can have on openness, including the following issues: ownership of user-generated content; ability of users to retain their data in cases of acquisitions, ownership changes or services shutting down; interoperability and reusability of content between different apps and services; and whether these apps contribute to wider adoption of open practices.</p>
<p>As an exploratory part of the project I intend to create an outline of a website which will present the results of my investigations into the openness of game-based SRS applications; advice and information on interoperability and reusability of content between different apps and services; and advice for practitioners on how to protect their data and ensure they can retain it.</p>
<p>I will present the results of a literature review of SRS in relation to openness, the results of an online survey of practitioners using game-based SRS and the outline of the advice and information website.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Together Alone: Trello in the art classroom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Monday 18th Feb 2019 at 19:30</strong></p>
<p>This conference presentation will look at the introduction of ‘productivity platform’ Trello (2019) as a technology enhanced learning tool (TEL) to promote inclusion for complex Special Educational Needs (SEN) students. As well as a project management and productivity tool, Trello is currently being ‘repurposed’ (Conole, 2018) to ‘suit’ a different ‘context’ (Agostinho, 2011)  by Further Education (FE) Creative Arts students. The talk will explore how positive personal or ‘expansive’ attributes (Lucas et. al, 2013) contribute to and develop learner experience with Trello as collaborative TEL.  </p>
<p>The inclusive ‘expansive’ area central for this SEN College is ‘enabling independence’ (Treloar’s, 2018) for learners with disabilities. The talk will look at this stimulus for the project: recognising that barriers to inclusion can exist not only within physical but also mental bubbles of isolation within the classroom for these students. It was observed that college cohorts often have more interaction with teaching and support staff than in class peers.</p>
<p>Trello was proposed as a flexible platform to allow this cohort of FE students the scope to work in a visual virtual classroom. The presentation will showcase how Trello gives an opportunity for improved digital literacies. There are opportunities to create digital mood boards, multiple forms of posting functionalities from animated GIFs to YouTube clips to standard blogging textual features along with response functionalities from text comments to virtual stickers. As independence in this context is measured on the scale of support required for students to complete tasks in familiar to unfamiliar situations, the introduction of Trello places these students into an unfamiliar learning environment with mainly peer support. This approach, therefore, rates highly on Independence Learning Plans (ILPs) which are used to support students for life beyond the college.</p>
<p>The presentation will also demonstrate a ‘social emancipatory’ (Nouri & Sajjadi, 2018) model in action. Students have a voice within the investigation and take an active part not only in the pre-project testing of potential tools for use in the project but also key decision making and tracking progress. The project has allowed for input into a ‘situated’ (Brown, 1989) learning design and software implementation with learners ‘modelling behaviour’ (Kallick  & Costa, 2014) from each other and staff during the process.</p>
<p>The talk will conclude by looking at the early results from this six-month project. This will include an extract from an interview with the lead researcher and lead student researcher on status of the project and possible outcomes. The interview will explore researcher views and evidence to date by asking:</p>
<p><strong>·        Will independence increase via ‘acquisition’ of new skills and ‘participation’ with Trello (Sfard, 1998)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>·        Could finding ‘a suitable voice’ (Kerawalla et al, 2008) for learning within digital environments develop digital literacy overall?</strong></p>
<p><strong>·        Is independence via inclusive collaborative TEL for students with disabilities who have historically experienced ‘systemic barriers in education’ (Malhotra, 2015) an achievable outcome?</strong></p>
<p>The full interview will be available after the presentation as an Open Educational Resource (OER) in a multimedia format.</p>

<h2><a title="Poster Metal 3D Print Overview" href="https://youtu.be/KFbbSrZvpKc" target="_blank"><em><strong>WATCH A 1 MINUTE OVERVIEW</strong></em></a></h2>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A new course has been developed to train operators of the metal 3D printer located on Charles Darwin University Campus in Darwin, Australia. The printer is manufactured by SPEE3D and managed by Advanced Manufacturing Alliance (AMA) (Charles Darwin University, 2018). Students will be required to complete six elements: scan, setup, produce and troubleshoot metal 3D printing according to a National Standard training skill set (training.gov.au, 2018). Troubleshooting is the focus of this presentation.</p>
<p>The title of this presentation alludes to an acceleration of learning as this printer has been designed to shoot powder at approximately three times the speed of sound. The metal 3D printer requires no heat process to fuse the metal together. Troubleshooting techniques will relate to issues impacting the printing of metal parts. With the use of educational technologies, students can use multiple senses to build a library of problem-solving skills for this unique and complex piece of equipment.</p>
<p>Three common troubleshooting aspects have been chosen in the first phase of developing the training material. These are calibrating for new&nbsp;stocks of powder, cloud forming and under/overbuilding. It is intended that the training will be available in a blended mode of online and face to face. All outputs need to be compatible with the existing Learning Management System &#40;LMS&#41;. Project outputs will include a range of formats. Interactive videos and quizzes will be created in H5P. A narrative will be introduced to guide students through troubleshooting steps in Padlet. Augmented Reality will be designed for the calibrating aspect of the 3D printer.</p>
<p>This unique printer works with materials that can be dangerous if mishandled. Training in troubleshooting will ensure that operators have the skills to provide a safe and successful operation. Augmented Reality Troubleshooting (ART) has been known to accelerate and assist in troubleshooting in complex environments (Vinn, 2018). Using AR for training can be the first step in gaining these benefits.</p>
<p>Using Augmented Reality technology in educational settings can increase motivation and assist with long term memory retention (Leonard &amp; Fitzgerald, 2018). Calibrating is a common troubleshooting activity and has been chosen as best suited to gain benefits from using Augmented Reality. This will allow for the task to be repeated in a safe environment and benefit from memory retention and motivation of the students.</p>
<p>The underlying theme of inclusion influences all parts of the project and the conference presentation. To encourage students to interact with the learning material, transcripts, audio, visual and alternative formats will be created. Accessibility checks will be taken for the material that is available online.</p>
<p>This presentation will provide a dynamic snapshot of the learning experience designed to stimulate and focus on technical troubleshooting. Join this session to see how educational technology can add another dimension to learning.</p>

<h1><strong>Abstract</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Tomorrow&rsquo;s Digital Scholar: Using Google Docs to promote Collaboration in Secondary School English</strong></h2>
<p>The advent of Web 2.0 technologies in recent years has prompted a shift in academic practices, the openness and networked participation afforded by such tools leading to the emergence of what has been dubbed &lsquo;the digital scholar&rsquo; (Weller, 2011).&nbsp; Technologies such as social media, blogging platforms, and collaborative writing software have provided digital scholars with unprecedented access to synchronous collaboration and real-time feedback, with vast networks of peers facilitating a constant process of creating, sharing, commenting and revision (Yamamoto and Karaman, 2011). As Higher Education institutions begin to adopt such practices, and Web 2.0 tools are increasingly &lsquo;becoming popular in teaching and learning environments&rsquo; (Brodahl and Hadjerrouit, 2011), notions of what it means to be a learner are in a state of transformation.&nbsp; Digital tools have the potential to support learning in ever more innovative ways, &lsquo;mark[ing] a step change in the ways in which learners can interact with and on the web&rsquo; (Selwyn, 2008), and encouraging a pedagogy that is open, participatory, and collaborative.&nbsp; The educational landscape is evolving, shaped, in part, by the digital scholar.</p>
<p>This has implications for the Secondary School Teacher, who is expected to &lsquo;demonstrate a critical understanding of developments in the subject and curriculum areas, and promote the value of scholarship&rsquo; (Department for Education, 2011).&nbsp; As the definition of &lsquo;scholarship&rsquo; changes to include the practices and pedagogies of digital scholarship, and more school-leavers than ever before are going on to study at university (UCAS, 2016), teachers have a responsibility to ensure that their learners &ndash; the digital scholars of tomorrow - are adequately prepared in the tools and practices used in Higher Education and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many teachers are keen to embrace this responsibility, and there is evidence from the UK (Penney, 2017) and beyond (Woodrich and Fan, 2017) that some secondary institutions are already making innovative use of Web 2.0 tools to further open and collaborative teaching methods.&nbsp; Despite this, there remain barriers to ensuring that tomorrow&rsquo;s digital scholars are adequately prepared, including school cultures that discourage risk, a lack of confidence with Web 2.0 technologies amongst staff, and the absence of a support network to exchange ideas and to share examples of best practice (Kirkland and Sutch, 2009).</p>
<p>The conference presentation will demonstrate how a short multimedia course is being designed to negotiate some of these barriers. &nbsp;Aimed at the Secondary English teacher, who is ideally placed to promote the creative and collaborative practices of digital scholarship, the online course uses the open-source Learning Management System, Canvas, to demonstrate how Google Docs can be used effectively in the classroom for collaborative writing. &nbsp;Providing not only a guide to using Google Docs to promote collaborative writing, but a virtual environment for colleagues to exchange innovative examples of best practice, the course will offer one of many possible ways in which Secondary practitioners can nurture the skills of tomorrow&rsquo;s digital scholar.</p>

              <title>SAT: How VLE&#39;s &amp; Hygiene Factors via Blended Learning can aid long-term unemployed into work (Steven Durant-Burgin)</title>

<p class="Paragraph SCXW207544224" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->The topic that has been chosen for this project intersects Inclusion, Innovation and partially into Implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Short Abstract for H818 Conference Presentation</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>How VLE's &amp; Hygiene Factors via Blended Learning can aid long-term unemployed into work.</strong></h2>
For many years now, welfare to work programmes have worked in similar ways in regards to achieving their Key Performance Indicators.&nbsp; Beatty et al., (2011) states that the welfare to work programmes have a far greater reliance on hitting job targets, than fixing the skills gaps that the long-term unemployed have which hinders them gaining sustainable employment.
<p>Beatty et al., (2011) states that &ldquo;as the majority of these welfare to work programmes have a &lsquo;one-size-fits-all, top-down&rsquo; solutions, whilst well intentions, only provided a few people into employment&rdquo;. Beatty&rsquo;s findings are backup up by Carter and Whitworth, (2017) who highlights the &ldquo;payment-by-results&rdquo; culture of welfare to work programmes.</p>
<p>This project for the H818 &ndash; Open Conference, is to look at how Virtual Learning Environments when used in conjunction with Blended Learning, along with taking identifiable hygiene-factors (using Hertzberg&rsquo;s Two-Factor Theory) into account, can aid the long-term unemployed gain the skills that they possibly will need in this technological age, where the skills needs to be demonstrated by potential employees for potential employers has grown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With more businesses using Information Communication Technologies, such as Computers, Mobile Devices and Social Media, the long-term unemployed need to have an understanding of these technologies and how to use them sufficiently to perform the jobs that they want to apply for.</p>
<p>Having worked in the welfare to work sector of training for many years&rsquo;, the presenter has identified that training that is given to the long-term unemployed has been and still is, geared toward shortened down versions of Level 2 in Customer Service and Retail which have a Guided Learning Hours of 30 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These training courses are class-based and use portfolio-based assessments to demonstrate that learning has taken place. It is doubtful that this way of teaching facilitates learning at its full potential. &nbsp;If we are to give people the possibility to be included in the sustainable job market, we should really look at how we can give the students the best possible opportunity to learn as many skills as possible.</p>
<p>Bloom et al., (2003) had found that many managers of the training companies providing the welfare to work programmes believe that a more &ldquo;personal approach is a far more effective way of helping those in long-term unemployment than the one-size-fits-all approach&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With the above to take into account, this presentation will look at how Virtual Learning Environments can increase the skills that the long-term unemployed can learn, whilst also be able to use Herzberg&rsquo;s Two-Factor Theory to identify the Hygiene-factors (things that cause dissatisfaction for the learners) that the long-term unemployed have towards using Virtual Learning Environments.</p>
<p>With these Hygiene-Factors identified, we will see how using a Blended Learning methodology along with using Motivating-Factors to reduce the Hygiene-Factors, this will help plan a new curriculum delivery model to help aid the long-term unemployed to have far greater opportunities to learn new skills.</p>

              <title>WED: How can Next Generation Digital Learning Environments fulfil the promise of online education? (Elizabeth Ellis)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10197</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10197</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This multimedia poster session on the theme of Innovation will ask, &lsquo;How can Next Generation Digital Environments embody and execute the promise of online education?&rsquo; As the higher education sector comes to terms with the idea that there is probably not a single &lsquo;solution&rsquo; to the problems inherent to virtual learning environments (VLEs), the term NGDLE is starting to creep into horizon scanning conversations among learning technologists.</p>
<p>A product of their time, VLEs are increasingly problematic in a more socially networked and digitally confident world. VLEs can often be passive repositories of learning material and grades, guilty of simply putting the offline online, rather than providing immersive personalised learning environments - teaching spaces with their own methods and approaches taking advantage of what the digital world has to offer students.</p>
<p>Now that we are in a Teaching Excellence Framework landscape, how should NGDLEs effectively help students succeed in their academic and professional careers? By providing them with personalised learning experiences and the acquisition of lifelong learning skills (HEFCE, 2016)? Should NGDLEs drive behavioural change in our students and our teaching staff? How can we easily identify the user requirements of an NGDLE?</p>
<p>An ongoing consultation challenge from Jisc poses the question, &lsquo;What should the next generation of digital learning environments do?&rsquo; (Jisc, 2016)</p>
<p>Online learning continues to be highly emotive, with those who use technology to teach online often being accused of trying to delete or diminish the human element of learning. Particularly with learning analytics becoming increasingly more mainstream, and the conflation of learning analytics with personal data and privacy concerns, educational technology is under scrutiny from the academic and student communities.</p>
<p>This session will ask:</p>
<p>1) What are NGDLEs?</p>
<p>2) What do NGDLEs mean for online education, and what does it require of it?</p>
<p>3) How can NGDLEs be a vehicle for the best parts of online education: the open web, co-creation, student engagement, technology, and digital capability?</p>
<p>4) What does student success look like in an NGDLE?</p>
<p>5) What do NGDLEs signify about innovation in online education?</p>
<p>Even if there is no single technological leap forward with regards to digital learning environments, NGDLEs could represent a disruptive or incremental innovation in online learning and teaching. As we challenge our students to take more ownership through participative learning, as we encourage our students to become more digitally confident and creative, as we provide our students with the tools for deeper engagement with learning materials and new strategies for immersive learning, and as we continue to help them battle with the ongoing curse and joy of collaborative learning, taking an active stance with regard to the development of future digital learning environments can help improve trust between online learning and teaching evangelists and sceptics, and ultimately improve student attainment, progression and retention.</p>

              <title>MON: Tacaí - Supporting the Understanding of Mathematical Concepts in Further Education in Ireland (Paul Curran)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10194</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Taca&iacute;&rdquo; is an online, free-to-use learning support tool, aimed at being used within the Irish Further Education sector. It supports the learning of mathematical concepts commonly encountered at QQI Level 4 in the Irish system, specifically those required in Functional Mathematics 4N2138. The support itself will be offered online and open to all, at least in its initial stage as currently envisaged. The word &ldquo;Taca&iacute;ocht&rdquo; is of the Irish language (or Gaeilge), which roughly translates into English as &ldquo;support&rdquo; and can be understood in a literal physical way but also in the context of moral support and encouragement. "Taca&iacute;" means supporter in the same sense. The approach to learning taken by the project is one of scaffolding learning which is a metaphor referring to a structure offering physical support that is removed when it is no longer needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mathematical ability and numeracy has long been linked to employment prospects as evidenced by the National Adult Literacy Agency (2014), the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) report (2012), the School Completion Programme and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Hughes and Schwab (2010) describe literacy as a situated social practice. By this they mean that literacy is more than just a set of discrete skills. Numeracy is rightly considered a form of literacy by Hughes and Schwab and by NALA (2014). It is in this context that this project approaches mathematical skills. An activity system in the style of Vygotsky gives recognition to a number of factors, including mediating artefacts or tools. This is the role Taca&iacute; envisages for itself: as a tool that supports learners who are also supported in other ways including interacting with a community of learners. It forms an artefact around which interactions can occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a mediating artefact Taca&iacute; will draw upon the theory, much cited in the context of reading and writing literacy, of scaffolding. This is the idea that during the learning process the teacher or a facilitator offers a variety of supporting mechanisms to assist the learner to grasp a concept. As Taca&iacute; is a support to mathematical learning it will take the form of hints, suggested strategies and useful metaphors towards the aim of understanding mathematical concepts and procedures. &nbsp;Central to the approach taken by Taca&iacute; is the strategy of progressing from concrete materials to abstract concepts. Thompson (1994) describes how the effective use of concrete materials can help avoid misunderstandings. Lee and Tan (2012) discuss the effectiveness of a concrete-pictorial-abstract (C-P-A) progression. They develop a role for virtual manipulatives within this progression and outline a C-V &amp; V-P-A alternative. The use of virtual manipulatives is a tool that Taca&iacute; will employ to allow learners to explore concepts and relationships between concepts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work of Richardson et al. (2014) on colour and contrast in e-learning and instructional design and the work by Murch (1987) on readability have been used to design the tool with accessibility, split-attention issues and cognitive load in mind. Development is on-going.</p>]]></description>

              <title>MON: &#39;Making the Most of MOOCs&#39; - Digital Learning with the University of the Third Age (Wendy Maples)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9527</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>The multi-media conference presentation will be a demonstration of my &lsquo;Making the Most of MOOCs: Digital Learning with the University of the Third Age&rsquo; work-in-progress, presenting the rationale for and development of an appropriate-technology web-based platform to facilitate informal online learning, and the digital learning resources that will make up its content.</h2>
<p>The &lsquo;Making the Most of MOOCs&rsquo; project involves research into digital learning inclusivity and, more specifically, consultation with Southeast University of the Third Age (U3A) representatives in order to identify an appropriate web-based learning platform and to source/develop learning resources to support digital literacy for informal educational purposes. The project emerged from my general interest in digital literacy for informal education and from a happenstance conversation with a former academic colleague, now a passionate member of the Southeast U3A Network, who was investigating better means of supporting online learning amongst U3A members (Pitt, G. 2015a).</p>
<p>The U3A was established to support and encourage lifelong learning amongst its members. This endeavour has meant almost exclusively self-generated learning activity presented and discussed at face-to-face meetings. However, informal interviews with U3A representatives (Staniforth and Pitt 2015, Pitt 2015b) and a report by the U3A Trust&rsquo;s Standing Committee on Education (2015) indicate that some U3A members wish to make better use of educational content that is increasingly available through &lsquo;MOOCs&rsquo; (Massive, Open, Online Courses) or other online educational resources (OERs). In accord with the U3A&rsquo;s understanding that learning is a social activity, some U3A members would also like to explore the wider potential social and inclusivity benefits of online networks. Early discussions with Southeast U3A Network representatives suggest that &ndash; in broad contrast to data on the relevant age demographic identified by the Office for National Statistics (2015) &ndash; the large majority of members have access to the Internet, with their main purpose to its use being communications with friends and family through Skype and email. Some U3A members routinely use the Internet for educational purposes, and there are some U3A groups who, over the past year, have utilised MOOCs to inform group discussions (U3A Standing Committee on Education, 2015).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there is extensive member expertise on a huge range of topics, there is currently limited member knowledge, expertise and confidence about distance and online learning. The U3A Southeast Network representatives group has therefore asked me to scope an appropriate web-based platform and digital learning materials to support: 1) Better use of MOOCs and other OERs; 2) Greater social learning opportunities for U3A members unable to attend face-to-face U3A meetings; 3) Greater interactivity between &lsquo;virtual U3A&rsquo; members and face-to-face members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &lsquo;Making the Most of MOOCs&rsquo; multi-media presentation will address pilot project work-in-progress, covering: 1) Background data and scholarly research informing inclusivity issues for the U3A age demographic; 2) The U3A&rsquo;s OER needs and interests, based on consultation with Southeast U3A Network representatives; 3) Initial investigations into appropriate web-platform technologies that best facilitate online learning practice; 4) Initial investigations and/or development of digital learning resources to be &lsquo;housed&rsquo; on the platform.</p>

              <title>SAT: Do you ever consider copyright when including images and other content from the web in your digital teaching resources?  (Elaine Dalloway)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9521</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you consider copyright when adding images to your teaching materials or other content? &nbsp;Two thirds of respondents to this survey question stated either that they didn&rsquo;t, or they weren&rsquo;t sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd guess about half [of my colleagues] simply are unaware of copyright issues and the other half are aware but don&rsquo;t have the time or inclination to do things properly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="right">Survey response, December 2015</p>
<p>Copyright is a legal protection, which grants the creator of a piece of work exclusive rights to how that work is used. Copyright applies as soon as the idea becomes a physical expression and lasts until 70 years after the death of its creator.&nbsp; However, &ldquo;copyright law in the digital arena &hellip; is something of a minefield. The law is strict in parts and vague in others&rdquo; Oldale (2015).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair use is a legal exception to the exclusive rights an owner has for his or her copyrighted work&rdquo; (Hawkins 2011) and there is often a misconception that any copyrighted work may be used freely, under this exception, in an educational context.&nbsp; This is not the case, and there are restrictions on what can be considered &lsquo;fair use&rsquo;, although again this is not always clear. &nbsp;Even if you provide an attribution and link back to the original, this does not mean that &ldquo;you&rsquo;re free and clear&rdquo; to use any image you find online (Hawkins 2011).</p>
<p>My feeling is that as educators, it is important that just as we would expect to attribute a quote to an author, we must also provide details of images we use, and must ensure that we have permission to use these images.</p>
<p>If an image is subject to copyright and we really must use it, then written permission should be sought from the copyright holder.&nbsp; However, there are various tools available to help us find images that can be used freely.&nbsp; For example there are filters that can be applied to a Google image search to return only images in the public domain or labelled for reuse under the various licensing schemes offered by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My research has drawn my attention to the argument, however, that the terms of the Creative Commons licenses &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t particularly clear to either the people creating CC content or using it [being] torn between the twin aims of making sharing simple and making it precise&rdquo; (Benton 2011).&nbsp; For example there is much debate around the CC-BY-NC licence, which allows sharing for non-commercial purposes only, and in this regard, what exactly constitutes &lsquo;non-commercial&rsquo; use.&nbsp; It should also be noted that &ldquo;Creative Commons is not public domain&rdquo; (Wild 1011).</p>
<p>&nbsp;My project will produce a web resource, which will help educators find images in the public domain, and those labelled for re-use, and will include a guide to using Creative Commons licences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;During the multimedia presentation we will look at this resource and discuss how not to fall foul of copyright law.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This OU Live multimedia presentation describes my research and development of the Dyslexia-Friendly Workplace Project.&nbsp; This educational technology project is developing a behavioural intervention, aimed at Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of employing organisations, about the inclusion of adults with dyslexia in learning in the workplace.&nbsp; Dyslexia-Friendly Workplace will be an open access, free, multimedia digital wall curated using Microsoft Sway.&nbsp; The Project aspires to have transformative economic and social impact as a provision of open education about adults with dyslexia for all employees and volunteers.&nbsp; The first intervention and iteration of the Wall will be personalised for CEOs of social enterprises operating in Scotland, on the grounds that twenty per cent of entrepreneurs in the UK have dyslexia (McCue 2015) and there are over 30,000 entrepreneurs with dyslexia working in Scotland (Gildener 2015).&nbsp;</p>
<p>My presentation sets out the three areas of 1) evidence on dyslexia and entrepreneurship, 2) my agenda in universal design, accessibility and inclusion and 3) my actions in designing a digital wall of informal learning about dyslexia for social enterprises as workplaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The four pillars of my agenda are The Social Model of Disability where difference is not considered a deficit (SAIF 2009); digital inclusion of all adults which requires mindfulness of the digital divide, the double digital divide, digital literacy, digital agility and accessibility (Seale, Draffan and Wald 2010; Seale 2014); universal design to ensure usability for all not accessibility for some and free open education in informal digital spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My presentation will reveal the first iteration of the Dyslexia-Friendly Workplace digital wall, introducing three of its artefacts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Artefacts of the digital wall will be sent as missives to the targeted audience of CEOs of social enterprises in Scotland using a social media strategy.&nbsp; The rationale for the social media strategy, indicators of traction and measures of economic and social impact will be described.</p>
<p>In the social economy practice with adults with disabilities may be at an advanced enlightened situation. I look through the Inclusion lens to Open Education towards some tangible missions of co-creating learning that will contribute to equality and prosperity.&nbsp; Whoever we consider ourselves to be, we make sense of the world through our lens, as specialists and generalists depending on our passion for, interest in and accomplishment of a thing and co-production with others.</p>

              <title>SAT: How forums and collaborative learning impact on oral proficiency in a foreign language class. (Tommy Ruiz)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Using a class activity and its inclusive online collaborative component (open educational resources (OER), Moodle and its forums) the teacher recorded students who would not regularly speak during class time. This presentation discusses the importance of collaborative learning, digital methods and how students perceive their educational learning through an online community. Focusing primarily on the theme of inclusion, the interpretivist lens allows the teacher to focus on ethnographic data collected to extract key concepts. The presentation concludes by outlining the importance of collaborative learning and its impact on inclusive learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This presentation explores:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How collaborative learning is implemented in a foreign language class.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How and why it helps oral proficiency.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To what extent forums compliment collaborative learning in a foreign language class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While interest in the voice of students and teenagers has grown, concerns for their oral participation in a foreign language class can still be a daunting experience for some (Hewitt and Stephenson, 2012).&nbsp; For those excluded, the teacher needs to implement a safe, positive learning environment where students can feel at ease. Personal growth is mostly achieved whilst connecting, comparing and challenging your peers&rsquo; work. As a result, carefully structured group work or collaborative learning has been promoted at the international school of Kuala-Lumpur (ISKL) for a number of years. When applied to a foreign language class, collaborative learning creates random conversations. It focuses on shared knowledge and clear communication skills between students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When learning a foreign language, not all students learn at the same pace. Therefore pupils do not have the same learning outcomes. Consequently, a class activity that promotes collaborative learning needs to be tailored for the students&rsquo; individual needs. As a result, critical theory (Curseu and Pluut, 2013) suggests that students should work collaboratively in small groups to fulfil their potential whilst avoiding some of the peer pressure issues. Effective communicators listen, reflect and respect each other&rsquo;s ideas. Students need to take part in conversations to be accepted and thus included in the learning process. Each student should be a creative thinker who can reason critically. They need to defend viewpoints, argue and share experiences. In that context, oral participation is a crucial component towards inclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Placing a similar emphasis on the role of forums, Norvig (2012) views the latter as a platform where communication helps students clarify problems, negotiate meanings, exchange knowledge and share perspectives. Whilst language acquisition is usually linked to input-driven, listening and thus passive learning is as important (Lefkowitz and Hedgcock, 2002). In this context, forums are an extension of the collaborative learning and a reflection tool. Forums allow students to listen to their peers, learn from good examples, engage in critical reasoning and promote a monitored inclusive learning environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This presentation will appeal to teachers who are looking for an inclusive approach to enhance an open scholarly practice, as well as those individuals who would like to learn about the forums in a collaborative online learning environment. The presentation will explore an analysis of participant contributions, survey data, and questionnaires to propose a model for collaborative learning in a foreign language class.</p>

              <title>MON: Implementation - The Use of Facebook as a Social Network Site to Deliver Organisational E-Learning – Could it Work? (Richard Heffer)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Implementation - The Use of Facebook as a Social Network Site to Deliver Organisational E-Learning &ndash; Could it Work?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my conference presentation, I want to explore the validity and the issues around implementing using Facebook to host our organisational e-learning material. Provisionally, these issues will be identified as:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Organisational Drivers to improve our Delivery of E-learning.&nbsp; Can Facebook be used to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our e-learning delivery during an ongoing climate of public sector funding reduction of 20%?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of Facebook as a cost efficient way to use a public SNS to bring e-learning material to our staff.&nbsp; The age group of our NFRS staff is 25 - 55 who have a 55-70% usage of social networking sites (ONS 2104 Report). &nbsp;There seems to be a likely synergy.</p>
<p>Facebook has affordances within its design that encourage knowledge sharing and encourage social collaborative learning (Wenger 2006) as de &ndash;facto learning platform hosting e-learning material.&nbsp; The design of the Facebook Social Network Site (SNS) has ensured that it is accessible through wide variety of devices and it is optimised for mobile devices again encouraging the employment of concepts around mobile learning.</p>
<p>An exploration of the limitations of Facebook as an e-learning platform.&nbsp; Thus, learning material on Facebook cannot be made to be SCORM compliant and will lack designed-in interaction.&nbsp; This has the risk of it encouraging a passive learning experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; I consider that there are design implications for Facebook e-Learning Material and would like to explore if there a nascent, evolving or a mature design approach for SNS learning within e-learning communities of practice?&nbsp; There are also implications for the accessibility of learning material on Facebook. Material posited on Facebook is inherently visually based and thus I want to explore if it can be made compatible with best-practice accessibility requirements or does inherent design of Facebook mitigate against accessibility?</p>
<p>Another exploration will be Reputation Management; what are the problems for a public sector using a globally and commercially orientated social network site?&nbsp; Will our organisational reputation sit well when there are unmanaged advertising pop-ups and the hidden aspects of Facebook data mining to be considered?</p>
<p>In terms of the research and data sources to be used; a main source of information for the project will be the online questionnaire put out to all our organisational staff.&nbsp; This is to be supported by trialling existing e-learning material on our organisational Facebook page.&nbsp; By viewing the staff responses to this material, I hope that I can gain and assess a better, if subjective, picture of the level of customer reception for future learning material on our Facebook page.</p>
<p>This will be supported by a review of current the current academic discourse around the use of Facebook and learning to identify trends and ideas.&nbsp; Initial searches have indicated that such academic studies are confined to formal education, rather than organisational learning, but I hope that there will be common themes and ideas that I can explore.&nbsp; Equally valid will be a review of ideas and concepts in online communities of practice centring around e-learning, SNS and organisational learning.</p>]]></description>

              <title>WED: The use of student generated webpages to improve revision and ongoing mathematical development (Angela Phillips)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8891</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Revision is an area that some teachers feel is often not taught well or in some cases taught at all (Slater, 2012).&nbsp; In a study of revision techniques used, 8 out of 10 were found to be ineffective and could hinder learning (Cohen, 2013). Therefore, it is important that students learn effective revision techniques (Pinantoan, 2012).&nbsp; To engage in ongoing mathematical development students need to become responsible for their learning journey (Dunlosky, 2013). The learning activity has been designed to enable students to have the opportunity to revise effectively, in different ways and produce a continually developing web based revision resource.</p>
<p>The project focus will be the implementation of the learning activity.&nbsp; The implementation of a project has the most impact on the overall outcomes (Durlak, 2011).&nbsp; &nbsp;The project will be presented as a case study, as the project is a real-life scenario, that does not have a clear end point (UNSW Australia, 2013). The project will be showcased in full using a webpage, (Phillips-5, 2014).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the use of student generated blogs has become popular and is viewed as an effective learning activity (Orlando, 2010), no research into the use of blogs for Mathematical revision and development was found.</p>
<p>Research from (Australian Government Department of Education, n.d.) shows that teachers should aim to bring subject content, teaching and learning pedagogy and technology together.&nbsp; This is known as Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) (TPACK, n.d.).&nbsp; The TPACK framework has been used to integrate the technology into the learning activity.</p>
<p>Different learning activities can have differing impact on the outcomes of revision, may popular techniques, such as highlighting and rereading text have little impact on performance (Dunlosky, 2013).&nbsp; However, using different strategies can have a positive impact on results.&nbsp; The positive strategies have been used in this project.</p>
<p>The project has been trialled with a class of year 8 students, who are generally twelve to thirteen years of age, in South Australia.&nbsp; The activity was introduced to the class and set for homework (Phillips-1, 2014).&nbsp; Standard revision activities, as the students had completed in the previous semester, were run during class time to gage the impact of the project.</p>
<p>The students produced their on webpages and then peer assessed each other&rsquo;s work (Phillips-4, 2014).&nbsp; The feedback was then collated and distributed back to the students, who were then asked to review the feedback of their pages and revisit their work.</p>
<p>The students completed the Semester 2 Common Test and then were given the personal questionnaire, to complete to give their views of the activity and the impact on the revision completed.&nbsp; Students were also asked to give their views on how likely they were to continue to use the webpage for revision (Phillips-3, 2014).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of the student&rsquo;s opinions on the project, alongside the results comparing the class&rsquo;s results will be discussed at length during the H818 conference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come along and find out if the project has met the initial aims.</p>

              <title>WED: To what extent do MOOCs contribute to a  narrative of development as freedom? (Tim Seal)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8869</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8869</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>[DRAFT abstract - comments please]</h2>
<p>The uptake of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) within the HE sector has increased exponentially in the last 2 years with a belief that it will be of benefit to the provision of education in an ever expanding population (Trucano, 2013). With the majority of MOOCs coming from and being aimed at the global north (ICDE, 2013), how are MOOCs contextualised by providers for local context, what impact does this have on their applicability to the global context, and how does OER and openness support this contextualisation? &nbsp;One commonly heard line of rhetoric in respect to MOOCs is that they largely benefit those already engaged in their own education, rather than those excluded from other forms of education. Some studies (Christensen et al, 2013) finding over 80% of participants having post-secondary qualifications and almost 50% reporting post graduate qualifications. Understanding the mechanisms by which a MOOC is delivered can support the engagement of participants, or act as an additional barrier, particularly in development contexts, is essential to the ability of MOOC providers in ensuring equitable access and support for students&rsquo; learning.</p>
<p>Set within the context of Nobel economist Amartya Sen&rsquo;s (1999) ideas of development in &lsquo;expand[ing] people&rsquo;s substantive freedoms through the removal of &ldquo;unfreedoms&rdquo;: poverty, limited economic opportunity, inadequate education and access to knowledge, deficient health care, and oppression&rsquo; (p. 1).&nbsp; This presentation seeks to identify the ways in which MOOCs and by association other forms of openness either add or remove barriers to engagement in education in relation to the removal of unfreedoms, providing an understanding of the openness of MOOCs and the extent to which MOOCs as tool contribute to a narrative of development as freedom.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Every educational format raises different issues in terms of accessibility and inclusivity. If a course is offered at a bricks and mortar facility, participation is limited to those who can physically attend. If we opt instead to publish written materials, we exclude those who cannot read and further limit our audience by excluding readers of other languages. If we charge for access to a resource we exclude those who cannot afford it. Concessions are usually made in order to reduce the number of people who are excluded. This might include adaptions to buildings to provide easier access to those with disabilities. Books may be published in multiple languages or with a text-to-speech option for those who cannot read. Resources may be offered at a reduced price on a means-tested basis. <br />The Open Scholarship movement attempts to remove further barriers by making educational materials widely and freely available online. There is still some debate as to what characterises an open educational resource (OER), and there is not yet a clear, accepted definition of what it means for a resource to be &lsquo;open&rsquo; (Veletsianos and Kimmons, 2012; McAndrew 2010). However, Veletsianos and Kimmons (2012) refer to open materials having to be &lsquo;widely accessible&rsquo; and they emphasise the importance of information being digitised and networked, with the aim of democratising the creation of and access to knowledge. <br />However, this approach has its own issues. If we choose to propagate educational resources online we exclude those who have no access to the internet. In addition, if our resource is content rich and has substantial multimedia content, it may be inaccessible to those who only have low quality internet access. In order for open scholarship to be considered an inclusive educational movement, we must first recognise those who remain excluded from participation, and actively work towards reducing their number. The impact of a lack of access to educational materials caused by a lack of internet access has been well documented, and is even considered to be a human rights issue (The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), 2003). It is therefore necessary to ask the following; how accessible is digitally published material? Who is excluded from accessing such resources? What barriers do they face? And what can educators do to reduce those barriers?<br />This presentation will consider several aspects of the issue. First, it will look at who is excluded from accessing online materials due to a lack of internet access. This will include both global and local disparities. Next, it will consider how poor or low quality internet connections impacts access to educational materials as this is a major issue in the developing world. Finally, it will offer a practical demonstration as to how the loband website simplifier (loband, 2013) can be used to help educators meet the otherwise impractical Web Design Guidelines (Aptivate, 2012). <br /><br />By making our resources loband friendly we can all help to reduce the barriers to access faced by those with the most basic forms of internet access.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Establishing connection with students has long been acknowledged as an important factor in facilitating learning. Anyone involved in distance education will be familiar with the feelings of anxiety and isolation expressed by students studying away from campus. A close and successful face-to-face relationship with students is considered by many academics to be a powerful aspect of their professional identity, essential for creating meaningful learning experiences and in some cases, a contributing factor in their resistance to e-learning. This paper looks at how we create these personal relationships in an online environment. What does it mean to communicate vitality, conviction and feeling? What does &lsquo;being there&rsquo; with students mean in an online learning environment? What do learners want from their tutors? <br /><br />I identify and examine the factors and criteria that students use to rate the performance of their tutors and look at what it tells us, as e-learning practitioners, about what students value in their relationships with their tutors. Data was collected from four groups of students undertaking two vocational marketing certificates offered by UK organisations. Each group of students was asked to rate their Class Tutor on a scale of 1 &ndash; 5, where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent, after each class for a period of three months. At the end of this period the students were presented with a questionnaire that asked them to reflect upon the reasons for their ratings. A further set of focus groups, undertaken either in person or using synchrous messaging technology, were arranged to discuss the issues further. As both courses have face-to-face and online versions, which delivered the same materials, by the same tutors over the same period of time, I was able to compare criteria to begin to understand how technology impacts upon the relationships tutors have / can build with their students. <br /><br />The research found that online learners place greater importance on what I classify as &lsquo;performance&rsquo; criteria and how much they have been &lsquo;entertained&rsquo; rather than the subject matter being presented. With reference to the impact of technology the data illustrated that in face-to-face teaching technological malfunctions had a negligible impact on tutor ratings, whereas for online students technical malfunctions cause significant negative impacts on tutor ratings. I go on to discuss the impact of these criteria on the implementation and further development of online learning environments, specifically in relation to setting and managing students experiences of online learning. The paper concludes by considering what this means for both learning technologists and tutors in the design and delivery of online learning content. While this paper begins to understand what learners value in terms of the tutors role in delivering online learning, in doing so, it raises a number of questions relating to how we look to meet these concerns and ensure that students expectations are managed and met prior to enrolment, during and after they have finished their qualifications.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Open digital badges that contain meta-data as evidence from authentic assessment allow individuals to demonstrate their learning and skills in a variety of settings and across disciplines both formally and informally. This helps paint a richer picture of the skills people possess unlike traditional certifications. The openness afforded by digital badges makes them networked and allows them to be shared across the web for employment, education or lifelong learning (Knight, 2013). <br /> <br />Whether you agree with this statement or not, it is hard to ignore the developing trend toward open digital badges as an alternative accreditation method. However, many questions surrounding their use and long-term credibility and sustainability still exist. This conference session will examine some of the latest research and findings in relation to the implementation of open digital badges and explore how these can be used to develop a viable program of implementation via a practical proposal for our own ASB Online Academy instructors.<br /><br />The ASB Online Academy is an American School of Bombay (ASB) initiative. The ASB Online Academy has developed a unique program of online learning opportunities for a diverse international audience across three learning strands: Professional, Student and Adult. Due to the global, transitory nature of our program and our school, researching the use of open digital badges in an online learning environment was an obvious step toward supporting a more open and portable approach to obtaining and sharing achievements and credentials. <br /><br />This conference session will explore key elements of this practical proposal offered to ASB Online Academy instructors, in order to encourage them to introduce open digital badges into their online course design. We will explore the evidence that informed the guidelines produced for our instructors. The proposal will be in the format of a Prezi presentation that walks through the key components required for designing badge empowered learning environments (Finkelstein et al., 2013). Selected, relevant elements of this will be shared during the conference and will focus on:<br /><br />&bull; Evidence of open digital badge approaches already adopted by educational institutions:<br />o The University of California, Irvine (Carey, 2012)<br />o Purdue University (Tally, 2012)<br />&bull; Exploration of the potential of open digital badges in order to accelerate 21st century learning environments including:<br />o Alternative models of assessment (Hickey, 2012)<br />o Individual Learning Pathways (Finkelstein et al., 2013, p13)<br />&bull; Key challenges facing the wider adoption of open digital badges as a sustainable and credible accreditation alternative:<br />o Validity and credibility (Casilli, 2012)<br />o Authentic, openly accessible meta-data (Sharples et al., 2013, p 12)<br />&bull; Insight into specific guidelines provided to ASB Online Academy instructors<br /><br />Attendees will leave the presentation with ideas for a workable implementation strategy based on the latest research that could be adapted for their own institution as required.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>
