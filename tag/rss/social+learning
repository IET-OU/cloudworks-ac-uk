              <title>SAT: Break Out of the Box! How you can use xAPI to free in-house staff development (Katherine Hinchey)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>You learn by doing and collaborating, watching videos, accessing just-in-time information from your mobile device, mentoring, and more. Why, then, does the Human Resources department only give you slides to learn from?</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s workers and corporations are united in wanting more access to the formal, non-formal, and informal learning needed to support an increasingly skilled workforce (The Education Commission, 2016; Pew Research Center, 2016a and 2016b). However, today&rsquo;s corporations largely store their learning resources in virtual learning environments (VLEs) that have adopted a uniform way of storing content. This uniform way, called SCORM, was incredibly helpful when it was designed nineteen years ago, and it still has an important role to play today. When SCORM was created, computer-based training was relatively new and organisations needed a single way to store and track training. For a time, innovation in elearning stopped at the known, established boundaries of the VLE (Weller, 2014, p. 194).</p>
<p>Now, a new need has developed: a way to store and track learning when it occurs on mobile devices, or through social and collaborative activities, or offline by reading a book or engaging in stretch assignments, or when participating in simulations or augmented and virtual reality programmes.</p>
<p>An innovation that meets that need was first released in 2013, and had its last planned update in 2016. It is the Experience API (xAPI). xAPI provides a common format for capturing data from today&rsquo;s distributed learning landscape (Rustici Software, n.d.). With xAPI in place, you can free staff development from the confines of SCORM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rely less on elearning courses designed from slides and more on learning experiences;</li>
<li>Recognise learning from formal and informal or non-formal activities (Downes, 2015);</li>
<li>And track not only clicks and views but also correlate learning with performance (Torrance, 2016).</li>
</ul>
<p>Managers and other decision-makers within learning departments and organisations are at a critical point. They need a source from which to gain a high-level, jargon-free understanding of the benefits of xAPI, common applications and uses of xAPI to support learners as they access modern and innovative learning opportunities, best practices and lessons learned, and information they should provide to their learning development and learning technology teams to prepare for implementation of xAPI (HT2 Labs, n.d.).</p>
<p>In my conference presentation, I will discuss and share a workshop created to meet those needs. The workshop helps managers, even those without extensive technical backgrounds, to be prepared to move forward with discussions and decisions about xAPI within their organisation. My presentation will show some of the workshop features and provide attendees with tools they can take with them, for use in their future endeavours.</p>

              <title>MON: Compulsory Or Graded Peer Forum Activity As A Factor Affecting Inclusion And Ownership Of Learning In Higher Education Distance Learning (Richard Sharp)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11450</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11450</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>The presentation while recognising the value of peer participation, experienced in asynchronous forums on higher education (HE) distance-learning courses, will discuss its application. &nbsp;Peer participation is regarded by some as an <em>essential</em> component of learning.&nbsp; Brown states that participation is key in a social view of learning in which understanding is socially constructed, saying &ldquo;we learn [&hellip;] from our interaction with others&rdquo; (Brown, 2007, 3:27).&nbsp; Where learning and curriculum design is framed to support this kind of social learning pedagogy, then forum participation may be set as compulsory or graded (effectively compulsory). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The paper will ask whether a compulsory approach to peer activities acknowledges diversity and supports inclusion within the student cohort.&nbsp; Also, whether the reduction of choice could negatively affect a student&rsquo;s sense of ownership about their own learning practices, leading to isolation and exclusion.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In support of diversity and inclusion</strong></p>
<p>The UK Department for Education (DfE), in a report about inclusivity in HE stated that HE institutions must adopt inclusive practice in order to equitably support the learning experience for the whole student body (Department for Education, 2017, p. 3).&nbsp; The report confirms the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of the social model of disability, and notes how inflexible practice, not individual characteristics, are at the root of exclusion issues (Department for Education, 2017, p. 12).&nbsp; Although the report focuses on disability and adjustment, there is also a clear recognition that inclusive practice and design can remove barriers for all students by &ldquo;using more flexible methods of teaching, assessment and service provision to cater for different [&hellip;] learners&rdquo; (Department for Education, 2017, p. 16).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Choice, flexibility, and ownership of learning.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Anderson&rsquo;s (2003) Equivalency Theory proposed that there are three types of interaction that a student engages in: student-student, student-teacher, and student-content interaction.&nbsp; These differing foci can be equally valuable in achievement of a learning outcome, dependent on the individual and situation.&nbsp; In relation to student-student peer interaction, Luhrs and McAnally-Salas (2016) state that asynchronous discussion forums are especially useful for students on distance courses (Luhrs &amp; McAnally-Salas, 2016, p. 29).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Downes (2006) said that &lsquo;students own education&rsquo;, he was referring to how students can now define and construct their own personal learning environments (PLEs) and make individual choices about how they act, and interact, in their own learning practice.&nbsp; The National Centre on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) also state that a key factor in encouraging engagement is to &ldquo;optimise individual choice and autonomy&rdquo; (National Center on Universal Design for Learning, 2017). &nbsp;The ability to choose gives the student a sense of ownership of their learning practice.</p>
<p><strong>Can graded or compulsory forum participation activity be restrictive and disabling?</strong></p>
<p>Inclusion is a term which is often linked to disability adjustments.&nbsp; However, all students benefit from experiencing control over the learning practices that they choose to adopt.&nbsp; The presentation will suggest that practitioners consider the effect of making participatory forum activity compulsory or graded, and asks whether, for some learners, it could reduce choices, and create feelings of exclusion and disengagement?<strong><br clear="all" /></strong></p>

<p>FutureLearn&rsquo;s platform is grounded in Laurillard&rsquo;s conversational framework: &ldquo;..conversation at the level of actions where discussion is directed towards interpreting the learning materials&rdquo;. What actions are we asking the learner to do? What does the platform &lsquo;afford&rsquo;? Activity based learning, like reciprocal teaching or jigsaw groups work in smaller classes, but needs rethinking at scale. Active learning concentrates on what the student does. I propose that extensions to the FutureLearn platform are required to initiate deep active learning, and have prototyped 2 visualisations: a word cloud, and &lsquo;semantic speed dating&rsquo;. Pedagogical activities around social tagging and summarisation should be considered.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm always loath to start a blog or learning journal away from the platforms I've used for the last five years - Wordpress since 2007 (www.mymindbursts.com) 1500+ entries and as an OU postrgraduate student on the OU Student Blogging Platform since February 2010 (1000+ entries) ... and before this in Diaryland.com since 1999 1.5m words. I believe in the format, I've kept a diary for long enough. I rather like the idea of being able instead to blab into a webcam like Jack Sully in Avatar. I guess I could talk to Siri on the iPad but then it still has to be edited and posted somewhere ... here if it is to be shared (which is the whole point).</p>
<p>My experience with learning online for the last three years (Masters in Open and Distance Education) is that when at this level someone says it'll take 'x hours' in the week I double the number before I decide if I can make the time - this takes care of needing to familiarise myself with the landscape. I can take 'x hours' and multiply by 4 if there is new software involved, even longer to the point of giving up if it isn't immediately obvious, intuitive and FUN. A fellow MOOCER pointed me towards Pearltrees and I feel in love. But then again, I take both a professional interest and have the boyish curiosity that makes me click on everything anyway. So we'll see.</p>
<p>I've skipped in and out of week 1 trying to follow the instructions but feeling like one in a thousand playing a game of treasure hunt. Or, like one of several hundred on the first evening of an OU Residential School. With an added difficulty here - all Holiday Inn's look the same, but the platforms here are not. Even Cloudworks, which I tried during an MAODE module, looks as unfamiliar as it did 18 months ago. I couldn't get it then ... though I played ball, wrote and posted, but got no interaction. It felt like I was being sent into the jungle to list the flora and collect insects and meet fellow travellers but what I found as a desert full of chimeras.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

We have examples of writing improvement, but each learner is different in their gain, collection is time consuming. Sometimes a testimonial comes; or feedback on survey (10% returns).<br /><br />Learner: focus on listening, uses links from Twitter, wiki, etc. doesn’t login to LMS for 3 months.  Gets a reminder call, and they have been completing activities on recommended resources.  We have no data on language gains.</td>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>My situation </strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an adult literacy tutor and I live on the West Coast of Ireland (originally from Nottingham) . I'm also a very recent graduate of St. Angela's College, Sligo where I completed an M.A. awarded by NUI Galway in Technology, Learning, Innovation and Change.<br /> <br /> I&rsquo;m interested in digital literacies and social learning, which ideally I'd like to teach online in a Higher Education or professional development context. For that reason, I'm developing my skills and knowledge in relation to online pedagogy and instructional design (which I&rsquo;m going to refer to as learning design from now on).<br /> <br /> <strong>My learning design project</strong><br /> <br /> I&rsquo;m already developing my course through participation in <a href="http://pedagogyfirst.org/wppf12/">Pedagogy First </a>&nbsp;,which is a small MOOC like programme led by volunteers of Mira Costa College, San Diego, which focuses on online pedagogical skills. <br /> <br /> However, within OLDSMOOC I&rsquo;d like to develop some learning design skills so as to help me develop my course as effectively as possible. <br /> <br /> I have been blogging about my progress on the course so far: <a href="http://learningcreep.wordpress.com/">http://learningcreep.wordpress.com/</a></p>]]></description>

              <title>Xin(Alice) Huang: My dream: OTC Sales Force Effectiveness</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6933</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6933</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Your situation (context)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;I want to produce a training curriculum for the first line sales managers of a Pharmaceutical company in China to manage their OTC (over the counter) sales force effectively.</p>
<p>With the ever increasing pressure to ensure maximum return on investment, sales force effectiveness(SFE) is becoming a high priority area in the global pharmaceutical industry. How to improve the effectiveness is now a dual responsibility between sales force management team and sales training team. Training sales representatives alone is not going to work, the learning has to extend to outside training room and involve first line sales managers to carry on after-training coaching to make sure transfer of learning happens.</p>
<p>China, a thickly populated large country, to cover most OTC pharma channel, including retail stores, pharmacies, supermarkets, neighborhood convenient stores will require a&nbsp; large size of the OTC sales force and widely dispersed throughout the country. It can be extremely costly and difficult to bring sales team together in one place for training. Also due to the nature of the sales work, sale Rep would need training and support&nbsp; that areaccessible whenever&nbsp; they need it. This will&nbsp; also contribute to thesales force stability. Therefore, the first line sales manager is becoming a pivotal role in terms of training their own team and providing ongoing support.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The change you would like to see (challenge)</h2>
<p><em><strong>What do you hope to achieve?</strong></em></p>
<p>Produce a blended training approach that will incorporate training outcome&nbsp; with business performance, will merge learning process into everyday sales activities so that learning will happen naturally any time, any where.</p>
<p><em><strong>What would be different if you succeed?</strong></em></p>
<p>If I succeed, both the OTC sales managers and sales Rep would never complain that attending training is a waste of their time. The Rep will feel empowered, confident in doing their job. The sales manager will feel a sense of achievement because they are able to upskill and support their own team member.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How you might go about bringing that change</h2>
<p><em><strong>What is your pedagogical approach? </strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;Constructionism will be the underpin learning theory for this project.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Which technologies will you use to implement it, and how?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Mobile device and social media platform will be used to implement the project. All learning material, training workshop, will be hosted via social media platform, and learning interactions will be enalbed through mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

<p>To be presented at the Widening Participation Conference 2012 'Discourses of Inclusion in Higher Education', 24-25 April 2012</p>
<h2>Discourses of inclusion of the hard-to-reach: &nbsp;building resilience of looked after children and young people in alternative education through Aimhigher interventions</h2>
<h3>Maria Kukhareva</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The paper is based on doctoral research which explores views and experiences of young people who have been placed in the care system and/ or educated outside mainstream education. The particular angle of the study is the concept of resilience and whether (and in what way) participation in Widening Participation activities impacts on the resilience of the groups in question.</p>
<p>The paper looks at the findings resulted from semi-structured interviews with 19 young people and nine professionals, the relevant discussion and implications for widening participation practitioners and professionals working with vulnerable groups.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5152</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Stimulating review by Al Bird of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.c4lpt.co.uk/handbook/index.html">Social Learning Handbook </a>and the <a rel="external" href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/working-smarter-fieldbook-|-september-2010-edition/14309750">Working Smarter Fieldbook</a>. Concludes that training and development professionals must show themselves to be credible. How? By focusing formal training where it works best (and weeding it out where it doesn't - especially when it's costly and unnecessary). Both books point to 'performance consulting' in their analyses of people-productivity challenges (as opposed to 'training needs analysis'). They argue that we should probe deep and look at what creates the 'problem' for an individual/team/organisation and what can be done to improve performance in a hard business sense. The answer will not necessarily be 'training' (it may involve, for example, clearer role definition, opportunities for collaboration, better performance management or regular coaching). 'As with some of my clients, better to knock off the word "training" and simply call it a "needs analysis"'. This means not prejudging the outcomes (as we are wont to do).</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Presenter:&nbsp;Dr Simon Buckingham Shum<br /> Title:&nbsp;The SocialLearn Project<br /> Date: Thursday 18 March 2010<br /> Time: 11:30am<br /> Location: KMi Podium</p>
<div>SocialLearn is exploring the potential of the social web for learning and sensemaking (both academic, and in the workplace) with specific interest in how different OU communities might benefit (e.g. students, staff, researchers, alumni). In this session, we'll give an update on some of the project's thinking and prototyping.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>This will be a work-in-progress update, in which Simon will be inviting input on what KMi research/technologies could plug into SocialLearn, eg<br /> 
<ul>
<li>Natural language parsing to improve user profiling</li>
<li> Analytics and recommendation engines</li>
<li> Merging social graphs from the cloud</li>
<li> Ontologies relevant to learning/academic research</li>
<li> Relevant widgets/gadgets for learners/researchers</li>
</ul>

<p>Wednesday 24 March, 3.15-4.15pm<br />Workshop 7G<br />Second floor library, Information Suite</p>
<p>Cloudworks includes a set of resources that can be used to help you to develop your research skills. It also offers the possibility of discussing these skills online, and sharing useful links and references.</p>
<p>SocialLearn provides an additional set of tools that support your use of Cloudworks and other relevant websites.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca Ferguson</strong> is a Research Fellow in the Knowledge Media Institute at The Open University, working on the university&rsquo;s SocialLearn project. Her main research interest is in how people learn together successfully online. This has included investigations of learners&rsquo; use of forums, blogs, wikis and virtual worlds, and of how these technologies can be used to complement face-to-face interaction. Her PhD, which she completed in IET, focused on the construction of shared knowledge through asynchronous dialogue. Her current focus is on how social learning tools can be used to help postgraduate students locate and make sense of the resources they need.</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Welcome</strong> to our cloud for this conference session :-)&nbsp;from the&nbsp;SocialLearn team: Simon Buckingham Shum, Rebecca Ferguson, Mark Glaister, Thanh Le&nbsp;</p>
<p>SocialLearn (part of the portfolio under Denise Kirkpatrick, Pro-Vice Chancellor for Learning &amp; Teaching Quality) is designing a social learning space which can integrate existing tools in the OU and the cloud, to support learning.&nbsp;Our immediate target groups are the hundreds of thousands of users in the Open University&rsquo;s online communities, with a specific focus in the coming year on professional development and e-scholarship/research.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Some starting assumptions about social learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a common term in lots of fields (domains if you like)</li>
<li>It is understood differently in these fields, at least on the surface</li>
<li>It relates to a diverse range of practices</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of the symposium is to explore the different understandings and practices relating to social learning amongst researchers at the Open University, drawing particularly on OSRG and the SocialLearn team.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->The most general idea I know of for social learning is that it is a space of platform which supports collective exploration of an idea or situation. &nbsp;I'd like to propose this as an heuristic idea to drive discussion by inviting anyone taking part to express their concept and experience of social learning in these terms.</p>

              <title>Blog Post: The Transition from the Co-Digital to the Post-Digital</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This <a href="http://tallblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/index.php/2009/11/27/the-transition-from-the-co-digital-to-the-post-digital/" target="_blank">blog post</a> by David White synthesizes the strong debate sparked by the discussion paper<a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=aqv2zmc9bgm_51ft65rbn2" target="_blank"> Planning for the Post-Digital&rsquo;.</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the author presents a model of innovation process built upon the <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/the-hierarchy-of-digital-distractions/" target="_blank">Hierarchy of Digital Distractions </a>by David McCandless.</p>
<p>The proposed model aims to represent the transition from an early phase 'Co-digital' - in which "a technology goes through as the user community appropriates it and influences its development" - towards a 'Postdigital' one, in which (according to the original document), the power of the technologies "arises in the act of their colonisation, or appropriation, by people into their lives; when they cease to be technology and become simply "stuff that works".</p>
<p>The debate is underway in reply to this post.</p>]]></description>
