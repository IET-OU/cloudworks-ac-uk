              <description><![CDATA[<p>Title</p>
<p>Learning about the tree octopus and information literacy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrator</p>
<p>I work as a Learning Resource Centre Manager in a comprehensive secondary school with a student cohort of 1700 pupils.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Situation</p>
<p>As part of the Personal, Health, Social and Citizenship Education (PHSCE) curriculum delivery I was asked to hold some lessons in information literacy for Year 7 students. The Learning Resource Centre (LRC) has two sides a &ldquo;bookish&rdquo; side and another which is more of an ICT suite with 30 computers and additional work desks in the middle of the room all facing a interactive whiteboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lessons were scheduled after the first halfterm for six consecutive weeks. These lessons were on top of the 10 minute induction all Year 7 students get at the beginning of the year. Most students were therefore familiar with the LRC and me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PHSCE is held during Tutor time e.g. one 50 minute lesson per week. Tutors may not teach the students otherwise, hence see them only during morning registration, assemblies and to sort disciplinary issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These lessons were delivered by me and the tutor (teacher) were in a supporting role (opposite from the norm).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task</p>
<p>I sought to achieve several things through the lessons. I hoped to lay a foundation for information literacy skills; like evaluating sources, researching, presenting findings, ethical use etc. At the same time I wanted to showcase some of the online resources the LRC subscribes to. It was also a way to market my department to the tutors/teachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The skills were measured through questionnaires, before and after the lessons. I also planned a classroom discussion, allowing for verbal feedback after the last lesson and would hope to receive positive feedback. &nbsp;If the students carried on using any of the online resources and user statistics increased I would see that as an indicator of success too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also did a questionnaire for the tutors seeking general feedback. If tutors decided to come back and have subject specific collaborative lessons with me that would be another indicator of success.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Actions</p>
<p>I began with rewriting some of my lessons and adjusting them to a slightly different level/topic range as my previous lessons were not intended for secondary students but sixthformers.</p>
<p>While designing the lessons and activities I used <a href="http://www.cilip.org.uk/get-involved/advocacy/information-literacy/pages/skills.aspx">CILIPs IL model</a>, English and ICT curriculum assessment criterias, <a href="http://www.big6.com">The Big6 model</a>, <a href="http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/informationliteracy/index.asp">The Scottish education Information Literacy</a> framework to find the level for secondary students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also had to create some hand-outs and PowerPoint presentations, as this would allow me to introduce the lessons and give an overarching framework for all lessons to the students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students had to fill out the skill questionnaire before coming to the first lesson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lesson 1: This was initiated with a research task on sites like the <a href="http://zapatopi.net/treeoctopus/">Tree Octupus</a> followed by unveiling of that the sites were spoof and moving on to ways to detect this and judging sources. This covered reliability and validity on the web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lesson 2: Students researched their names&rsquo; origins, meanings and others with the same name. This covered using a variety of sources on the web, including interviewing people and the Oxford national biographies database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lesson 3: Students researched an animal and used books as a reference to present their findings in Wikipedia. As becoming a contributor of Wikipedia became an issue/time consuming this lesson was changed to a wiki on the School VLE. However it did highlight to students that Wikipedia had to be used cautiously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lesson 4: Students had to find the sources of an extracted article, an image and a journal on Aretha Franklin using subscribed resource Britannica Online. I amended the lesson to direct them to Brittanica straight away due to time contraints. Initially I deliberately let them search Google knowing they would not find the sources. I instead pointed out the &ldquo;hidden web&rdquo; fact to them verbally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lesson 5: Students were asked to create podcasts using Audacity. They could choose to review a book or a music video in groups of 5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lesson 6: Assessment questionnaire, group discussion/feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Students varied a lot both in terms of language /understanding terminology and IT competence. Some of the questionnaire questions that were supposed to assess skills were not up to the mark as students were not aware of what was being asked. Retaining interest and student attention on the task at hand was the most difficult thing. There were also login issues, which meant some students were not able to take part as much as I would have liked. Some students struggled with finishing the activities and were not keen on getting the activity as a homework. Some tutors also never did the pre lesson questionnaire which meant that lesson 1 became rushed as some time had to be devoted to that. Working in collaboration with tutors and teachers brought there own issues. Some ( few)tutors had problems not being in charge and acting as a support, they acted awkwardly or deserted the LRC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of the outcomes students did overwhelmingly rate the lessons as excellent. Lesson 3 got the lowest rating and Lesson 1 got the highest ranking which was surprising. The questionnaires show that around 80% students did become familiar with terminology/ search processes after the lessons. All Year 7 students become aware of the fact that the LRC did subscribe to certain online resources like Britannica. However there was very little increase in the use of subscribed online resources, which made it difficult to credit the lessons with any significant contribution to that usage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reflections</p>
<p>On reflection I would allow more time for activities and maybe carry over some for two lessons. I would also have a chat with the tutors, prior to the lessons and go through with them what I wanted to achieve and how I wanted to be supported. Some of the teachers were not familiar with the tools we were using hence it made it difficult for them to support students as well as grasping things themselves although I find the tools very straight forward. The feedback I received from students was encouraging as I was concerned that they did not see the point of earning information literacy. I learnt that it is useful to have a contingency plan- no matter how much you plan things can still go amiss. I also think although it is harder to motivate students to work during PHSCE lessons because they can&rsquo;t make a connection to a subject it also gives a lot of freedom. In future I would like to give students more choice in terms of researching a topic of there own choice.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>As the principal funding agency for UK social science research, the ESRC requires that the research it supports be designed and conducted in such a way that it meets certain ethical principles and is subject to proper professional and institutional oversight in terms of research governance.</p>
<p>The ESRC Research Ethics Framework (now renamed Framework for Research Ethics) was formally introduced in January 2006.&nbsp; The framework sets out ESRC's policy on research ethics and provides guidance on ethical scrutiny appropriate to social science research.&nbsp; It was created because, although the Council, learned societies and others already provided general guidance in regard to these matters, there was a clear need to extend and develop best practice in response to the growing complexity and demands made of research and researchers today.&nbsp; ESRC has made it clear that the framework is a &lsquo;living&rsquo; document which the Council is committed to developing over time, taking into account the experiences of the ESRC and research organisations as well as future challenges arising from the wider ethics environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The framework has been subject to a wide ranging consultation and&nbsp; a revised version has now been released (2010).&nbsp; Changes in legislation, advances in technology and responses to the consultation were considered by the office and a small advisory panel who made recommendations to the ESRC Council on the necessary changes to the framework.&nbsp; The Framework for Research Ethics (FRE) includes ESRC&rsquo;s six core principles regarding research ethics and how to implement them, the ESRC&rsquo;s minimum requirements for researchers and research organisations and details various aspects of research ethics.</p>]]></description>

<p>Wednesday 24 March 3.15-4.15pm<br />Workshop 7D<br />Wilson D Block, HR Learning &amp; Development Centre, Seminar Room 4</p>
<p>Communicating the results of your research to the wider world is central to the conduct of scientific research and an essential part of your postgraduate studies. But how (and where) do you publish ?</p>
<p>Organising, compiling and writing a scientific publication is not a trivial exercise and communicating your results effectively to other researchers (and/or wider readership) is something of an art. In this workshop we will discuss: How to decide when your research is ready for publication; How to decide where to publish your research work; How to organise your publication; How to work with co-authors; What is the correct style for a scientific publication? How to submit a publication and what is the refereeing process; and How to respond to referees.</p>
<p>The session will have time for discussion and questions</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Mason </strong>is Professor of Molecular Physics at the Open University. His research involves the study of atomic and molecular processes across a wide range of&nbsp;environments&nbsp;including; terrestrial and planetary atmospheres, the interstellar medium, plasmas and cellular systems, the latter as part of a study of radiation damage of biomolecules. He has published over 200 papers in the scientific literature and coordinates several large international research programmes. He has supervised over 20 PhD students. He is currently the Associate Dean for Research, Enterprise and Scholarship in the Faculty of Science.</p>]]></description>

<p>Wednesday 24 March 3.15-4.15pm<br />Workshop 7C<br />Wilson D Block, HR Learning &amp; Development Centre, Seminar Room 3</p>
<p>This workshop will present a qualitative approach to the analysis of interview data, based on discourse analysis and narrative analysis in social psychology. Further details of the approach and an example from my work on single women's narratives of relationships can be found at the link below. The workshop will include discussion of issues around research interviewing and some practice analysis of transcript extracts.</p>
<p><strong>Jill Reynolds</strong> is a Senior Lecturer in the Faculty of Health &amp; Social Care at The Open University. Her research interests and publications include education, training and practice issues, identity, feminist practice, inter-professional work and meanings of mental health care and support. Her book <em>The Single Woman: a Discursive Investigation</em> (Routledge, 2008) provides a new understanding of what is often taken for granted &ndash; female single identity. She has used the same data (first analysed for her PhD thesis) of interviews with 30 single women in their middle years for several journal articles, some co-authored, on narratives of singleness.</p>]]></description>

<p>Wednesday 24 March, 1.45-2.45pm<br />Workshop 6E<br />Central Meeting Room 11</p>
<p>When you started your research student journey you may not have known what the questions were that you needed to ask and many of these may just now be bubbling to the surface!&nbsp; If you have a question about progress issues, the probation review, doing field work, University regulations or future careers then come along and ask this panel of people who have seen a PhD through to the end.&nbsp; We look forward to seeing you there.</p>
<p><strong>Hilary Burgess</strong> is Director for Postgraduate Studies in the Centre for Research in Education and Educational Technology (CREET). Her work as Director encompasses the full and part-time PhD programme, the part-time&nbsp;Doctorate in Education programme and the MRes programme. From 1<sup>st</sup> March 2010 she will be Academic Coordinator in the Research School and will lead the Research Career Development Team.&nbsp; She is currently Chair of the National EdD Network and External Examiner for the EdD at the&nbsp;University of Roehampton.&nbsp; She is an elected Council Member of the British Educational Research Association (BERA) with a portfolio that encompasses early career researchers and the BERA Committee for Conferences and Networks.&nbsp; Recently, she was appointed as a College Peer Review member for the review of applications for accreditation as a Doctoral Training Centre and Doctoral Training Unit by the ESRC.&nbsp; Her own research and publications&nbsp;have been&nbsp;in the area of primary teaching and mentoring and more recently, Teaching Assistants and Workforce Reform and was a contributing consultant author to the Cambridge Primary Review. She has written numerous articles in journals and chapters in books alongside authoring Open University course materials. Her most recent book is called Achieving Your Doctorate in Education.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Saunders </strong>is a Reader in Molecular Genetics in the Department of Life Sciences, where he researches the basic biology of ageing.&nbsp; In that research, he uses the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, and takes a genetic approach.&nbsp; From January 2008 until February 2010, he held the potition of Academic Coordinator in the Research School, in which capacity he led the Research Career Development Team.&nbsp; The RCD team is responsible for the delivery of career development events across all disciplines, and for all career stages.</p>
<p>Robert's research career followed a stereotyped path typical of the sciences.&nbsp; His first degree was in Genetics at the University of Edinburgh.&nbsp; Subsequently he embarked on a career in Drosophila research with a PhD in molecular genetics, also at Edinburgh.&nbsp; From there, he moved to Imperial College and subsequently the University of Dundee for postdoctoral research, during which time he studied the cell cycle, and conducted genomic research, again using the fly as a model.&nbsp; He continued the genomic research while undertaking a Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship in which&nbsp;&nbsp; techniques he developed for the Drosophila genome project were applied to the medically important fly <em>Anopheles gambiae</em>.</p>
<p>Robert joined the Open University in 1999, since when his research focus has been on aspects of the basic biology of ageing; specifically on oxidative stress and its relationship to the ageing process, and currently on modelling the human progeroid disorder, Werner's syndrome in flies.</p>
<p><strong>Vivien Bacigalupo</strong> was appointed to the post of Head of Research Degrees in 2008 following on from her 15 years of experience working for The Open University. She was previously the Head of Partnerships Office having managed or facilitated over 25 successful partnerships. Prior to this she was a Programme Manager in the Faculty of Health and Social Care and a Course Manager in the Science faculty. She has also worked as an Associate Lecturer and was seconded to the Centre for Outcomes Base Education for 6 months. In her various roles she has gained much experience of University Administration and Governance. Prior to joining The Open University, Vivien was a science teacher (12-18 age group), but has also worked as a production manager in a crisp factory and as a technical sales manager for an American company selling modified starches to the food and pharmaceutical industries.</p>]]></description>

<p>Wednesday 24 March, 1.45-2.45pm<br />Workshop 6D<br />Wilson D Block, HR Learning &amp; Development Centre, Room 3</p>
<p>This session will focus on the structure and rhetorical moves of conference abstracts. As a group we will consider the criteria for effective abstracts, identify the key elements or &lsquo;moves&rsquo; in a number of abstracts from different disciplines, and look at some features of writing style that may show disciplinary variation. Some sample abstracts will be provided as a starting point for discussion, but you may also like to bring along an example&nbsp;from your own field, or perhaps an abstract you have written yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah North</strong> works for the OU on a consultancy basis, having previously been a senior lecturer in the Centre for Language and Communication. She has taught English and trained English teachers in a range of overseas contexts, including China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Tanzania and Mexico.&nbsp; Her doctorate was in academic literacy, and her research interests centre on English for academic purposes, language and literacy, and computer-mediated communication. Her publications include <em>Exploring English Grammar </em>(2009), with Caroline Coffin and Jim Donohue, and <em>Applied Linguistics in Action </em>(2010), with Guy Cook, as well as articles in <em>Applied Linguistics</em>, <em>ELT Journal</em> and <em>Studies in Higher Education</em>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

<p>Many people, not just students, have problems working out how best to use their time and even when they do so they may still struggle to implement what they &lsquo;know&rsquo; they should do. In this session, we will look at some of the most common &ldquo;time wasters&rdquo; and together share tips and flag up important practical ways of overcoming these and other difficulties with managing time, after we&rsquo;ve gained some core insights into different degrees of effective time management.&nbsp; Lessons learned here can benefit your productivity as a researcher and could make all the difference to your career success.</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Pugh </strong>is HR Development Adviser to the Research School, and also a freelance Development Consultant.&nbsp; After some pioneering research in the philosophy of religion, he turned to human psychology and skills development to explore human potential and how to overcome the many challenges people face in their lives and work.&nbsp; This led to the study and practice of a remarkable host of people development, coaching, peak performance and psychometric tools. His work here at the OU is focused on utilising the most relevant parts of these study areas more widely, through the provision of appropriate training for researchers, managers and staff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lately among researchers he has pioneered and developed innovative highly rated trainings in Mentoring and also Networking skills. &nbsp;Nigel has studied and implemented some of the most cutting edge time management systems on the market and brings a selection of tips and tools today in this short session.</p>]]></description>

<p>The &lsquo;official&rsquo; guidance to Designing Experiments is in STM895, and various aspects are also discussed in other sessions; this talk is based on my personal experience and practice in <strong>doing experiments. </strong>I will talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellence and Impact</li>
<li>Research methods and approach</li>
<li>Practical aspects of sample collection and laboratory work: methods and protocols</li>
<li>Data reduction and evaluation, significance, wider implications</li>
<li>General principles of: personal conduct, reduction of variables, reproducibility,&nbsp; and Risk Assessment</li>
<li>Sir David King: code of conduct</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Peter van Calsteren</strong> did his PhD in Leiden, The Netherlands in 1977 and came to the OU in 1980 on a 3 year research fellowship for the Petrogenesis Research Group. He has been a Senior Research Fellow since 2001 in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences.</p>
<p>His main research interests are in Isotope Geochemistry and include a wide range of topics related by the use of short half-life uranium daughter isotopes. This includes applications to the evolution of volcanic rocks, dating paleo-climate archives and paleo-anthropology. It also includes the related analytical methods, mostly mass spectrometry and laboratory methods and their design and safe application. He is running a NERC-funded facility at the OU to do collaborative research projects with other UK HEI colleagues and usually he has a large input into the design of these projects. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry and a member of the NERC Peer Review College.</p>
<p>He would like to see himself as a field and experimental scientist, although he doesn&rsquo;t see much of the inside of a chemistry lab these days.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Robert Saunders</p>
<p>Tuesday 23 March, 1.30pm-2.30pm<br /> Workshop 2E</p>
<p>Wilson D Block, HR Learning &amp; Development Centre, Seminar Room 4</p>
<p>As a research student, it is vitally important to keep abreast of the literature as it pertains to your research field.&nbsp; There are two points during your studentship where this is likely to be assessed formally: at probation Review and at the final Viva Voce examination.</p>
<p>The scientific literature is always changing, is often very fast moving, and it is wise to make plans and efforts to keep up to date at all times, and not just in preparation for the assessments mentioned above.&nbsp; This session will cover the following topics: Exploring the purposes of the ongoing literature review; Identifying the sources; Internet searching; Structuring your review; Organising your materials; Working together to review the literature.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Saunders </strong>is a Reader in Molecular Genetics in the Department of Life Sciences, where he researches the basic biology of ageing.&nbsp; In that research, he uses the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, and takes a genetic approach.&nbsp; From January 2008 until February 2010, he held the position of Academic Coordinator in the Research School, in which capacity he led the Research Career Development Team.&nbsp; The RCD team is responsible for the delivery of career development events across all disciplines, and for all career stages.</p>
<p>Robert's research career followed a stereotyped path typical of the sciences.&nbsp; His first degree was in Genetics at the University of Edinburgh.&nbsp; Subsequently he embarked on a career in Drosophila research with a PhD in molecular genetics, also at Edinburgh.&nbsp; From there, he moved to Imperial College and subsequently the University of Dundee for postdoctoral research, during which time he studied the cell cycle, and conducted genomic research, again using the fly as a model.&nbsp; He continued the genomic research while undertaking a Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship in which&nbsp;&nbsp; techniques he developed for the Drosophila genome project were applied to the medically important fly <em>Anopheles gambiae</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert joined the Open University in 1999, since when his research focus has been on aspects of the basic biology of ageing; specifically on oxidative stress and its relationship to the ageing process, and currently on modelling the human progeroid disorder, Werner's syndrome in flies.</p>

<p>This session is based upon Chapter 7 of <em>Doing Postgraduate Research. </em>It will explore the purposes of a Literature Review, discuss sources to be used in a review and look at ways a Review can be structured. The workshop will be based upon the session run in November for full-time students, so is essentially for part-time students who could not attend that session or any full-timers who missed it then.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Potter</strong> obtained his PhD as a full-time OU student in Social Sciences, later became a Research Fellow in the Technology Faculty and is now the Professor of Transport Strategy in the Faculty of Maths, Computing and Technology. His research interests cover transport, energy and environmental policy issues. With Dave Wield, he started the Doctoral Training workshop programme in 1992 and co-chaired the development of the U500 and U501 research packs, including editing the U501 book <em>Doing Postgraduate Research</em>. He is chair of the Research Degrees Committee and somehow finds time to sing in the OU Choir, play in our orchestra and comp&egrave;re the OU's annual carol concert.</p>
