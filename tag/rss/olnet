<p>Liu said that in China there is lack of the enthusiasm and passion evident in the talks of Larry Lessig and Hal Plotkin, and the policy setting of the Netherlands. But there has been consistent investment in last few years - the production on 4000 "Best courses" but these have not been well shared. New work on repositories at the OUChina will also need to see what sustains. But there is enthusiasm by the learners.</p>
<p>Barney: there is a division between the "elite" involved in OER and those who face the "digital divide" withe expensive and limited connectivity. His fundamental critique is cultural - need to show sensitivity and opening up to cultural issues. Otherwsie will end up with one way flow. OER has the potential to overcome this - but needs to be more than joining in to be a real participant in an inclusive manner.</p>
<p>Naveed cited MIT OCW to make public exisitng content, that has been followed by OER by design. Now have OER as a side effect. Lack of faculty has led to greater use of technology to spread expertise through video lectures. Careful design means they are happy that they are of high quality ocw.bu.edu.pk has launched. Many are in Urdu/English and may not transfer but some such as Computer Science are world class and likely to apply more widely. Are there any users out there? The Not invented here syndrome does exist.</p>
<p>Manfred as a publisher described the OER world in Germany briefly.</p>
<p>When is the tipping point - Naveed it is still some time away. Started from "MIT content is not an MIT education" which limits impact. Need to decide that the "content" is the education. Manfred - the biggest publisher of OER is a German publisher "Springer-Verlag" but money is still needed from foundations or elsewhere. Barney - no tipping point until the playing field is leveled. The focus in teaching needs to be able to move from content, while in discipline terms content remains important. Liu - MIT OCW is very popular in China but videoed classroom allows some transfer of experience. Fascinated by seeing approach but just an early stage. Open, social, participatory material has yet to arrive.</p>
<p>The tweets [paraphrased by me]:</p>
<p>Naveed: Accessible, world-class education delivered to your doorstep. Bring your motivation.</p>
<p>Barney: Get rid of OER altogether and go back to basics and start all over again!</p>
<p>Manfred: @publishers @universities come here, learn, be open to OER</p>
<p>Liu: Integrate the culture of sharing in to higher education</p>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5801</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Rory spoke about the tipping point that might be coming for OER to topple the Medieval model for universities. He said that there were some myths:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional is better than e-learning [no evidence - and people have been looking for it]</li>
<li>E-learning involves less worthwhile contact [no evidence of this and useful contact can be more]</li>
<li>Elearning is 2nd rate [n significant difference]</li>
<li>Small class size is better than large classes [&lt;20 true &gt;30 more students the better.]</li>
<li>Quality of learning is less in elearning. [Elearning introduced quality measures.]</li>
</ul>
<div>Need to ask those who defend traditional models to prove it is better - oherwise internet is essenial for internet. OER quality measures *are* in place. OER avoids the problems of Digital Rights Management that comes with proprietary content that tends to restrict educators from using content as they need to.</div>
<div>He pointed out that the world is going mobile. 1/3 of world population only use mobile when accessing the internet. His advice - Design for Mobile first.&nbsp;</div>
<div>THe OER University now has reached its initial target of 10 member organisations. With a plan to offer a shared open curriculum. OER is part of a changed that is "underhyped" - "If you don't like change you will like irrelevance even less" US General.&nbsp;</div>

              <title>ICDE Symposium: Creativity and ODL</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5798</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5798</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Coordinated by iCreaNet and Aarhus University, Denmark. It addresses a number of inter-related issues about creativity, learning theories, learning design, interculturality, sustainability and collaboration issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prof. Asger Harlung</li>
<li>Prof. Barry Sponder</li>
<li>Prof. Elsebeth K. Sorensen</li>
<li>Prof. Fredric M. Litto</li>
<li>Prof. Gila Kurtz</li>
<li>Prof. Gra&iacute;nne Conole</li>
<li>Prof. Jun Oshima</li>
</ul>
<p>This symposium calls for a new Educational Paradigm with education lagging behind other aspects of life in responding to the changing world. The aim is not to spend time defining terms but rather finding a way to be creative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asger outlined a new paradigm with three characteristics:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Well found and argued criteria should replace the pursuit of exact definitions</li>
<li>Seeking qualified understanding should replace striving for "knowledge"</li>
<li>"Gardens of forking learning paths" should replace standardisation in educational contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too much standardisation does not support creativity. The split between the traditional found in educaition and the changes felt in everyday life (Wiley &amp; Hilton, 2009) and the need to switch from convergent thinking to divergent thinking imply a more diverse approach to learning. Approaches that encourage curiosity, suggestions, and options for assessment: convince us that you master this, find an appropriate way of doing so. The assessment echoes the badges approach to recognise achievements. The way forward is likely to be via grassroots rather than top. This leads to a form of project based learning. [The description of forking paths reminds me of the chaotic bifurcation images - not sure if the ideas here will lead to the complexity, or if this is good or bad!]</p>
<p><img src="http://mathforum.org/advanced/robertd/bifurcation.gif" alt="Bifurgation graph" width="400" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barry spoke about about using learning styles to compare the impact of different web 2.0 tools across different cultures. The idea being to then correlate the results. His argument is that the "learning styles" dominate over the culture. In particular the provision of web site creation under a reteach model was a success. As summarised by a comment from the audience "putting the technology in the hands of the student". He then followed up this session by describing the structures of his teaching which encourages the creation of websites with embedding and screen recording via screencast-o-matic, feedback via Google docs, annotations through crocodoc, sharing with dropbox, publishing via lulu, and avatars with voki. By using free versions the practice can be applied immediately.</p>
<p>Grainne commented on creativity as an essential skill as everybody becomes a particpant in learning. She divided creativity into Process, Product, Person, and Place and into stages: Preparation, Incubation, Intimation, Illumination and Verification. She referred back to work with Giota Alevizou on characterising the creativity supported by new media. The example of MOOCs as a sign of the release of educatonal creativity seems a good one.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Susan C. Aldridge from UMUC led a panel with participation from Indonesia, Brazil and Norway.&nbsp;UMUC adopts a &ldquo;Learning Design&rdquo; model which is hybrid. In the past they built their own web based learning management system &ndash; which reflects a previous must build it yourself approach. Now transitioning towards use of external resources both open and proprietary. Concern is cost and quality in moving from design themselves to adopt and use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The discussion raised issues of reach, language, informal, sharing, networking, openness, law changes, self-maintaining lecture notes (get students to update your wiki), open government, access, mobile &amp; design.</p>
<p>Challenges for ICDE community:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we really know what everyone is doing and what everyone knows.</li>
<li>Share 3-4 tracks to develop and explore further</li>
<li>Address copyright internationally.</li>
<li>Cross over to those not involved</li>
<li>ICDE to negotiate for OER to be available internationally in all languages</li>
<li>Allow transfer to from university to university in agreed credit transfer on module by module basis</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these are underway but language continues to be a barrier.</p>]]></description>

              <title>ICDE Keynote: Lawrence Lessig - ODL in a changing world</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5796</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5796</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Lawrence Lessig led with the position that "Copyright is necessary" especially in the digital age. The copyleft and copyright position share a view that there should be rights held by artists, but differ in the view of publishers that "copyright is for publishers". Which is *not* the legal position (established in England 1774).</p>
<p>In the context of education and science copyright is not essential. But the academic world has terrible access built by "us". The restrictions have nothing to do with the *intention* of copyright that was designed to protect culture rather than science. The open access movement is responding to the costs and unfairness in the "for profit" model. The science commons principles for open science sets out what is needed to give freedoms to use the information (see&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Science_license" target="_blank">http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Science_license</a>). The success of Plos (Public Library of Science) and gradual adoption of CC-BY/CC-BY-NC means that 71% of science articles published last year had an open licence.</p>
<p>Lawrence showed a brilliant range of videos e.g. (from soderberg.tv) that demonstrate the clash between "18th C copyright and 21 C technology".</p>
<p>Ceative commons has now reached 500bn items released with the more open licence. This voluntary reform is mitigating the old legislation.</p>
<p>The future of education is not Harvard (despite him being a Harvard Professor) but rather a variation on Open &amp; Distance Education. But to deliver its potential the copyright problems must be solved - with a hybrid of commercial and open. This could tap the "amateur" creators as well as the professional. Again voluntary reform is needed to retain free access to material that can be built upon to adapt and share. The need to clear out the uncertainty through the work of e.g. UNESCO to free up content. Standardised free licences are needed - avoiding customisation under the "Freely licensed content must be interoperable" principle (FLCMBI). The wikipedia example of moving from GNU-FDL to CC-BY showed how care is needed. These licenses have the same intention but the requirement to keep the licence kept them apart. The UK was cited as the source for a couple of failures: the BBC-Creative Archive licence and the Open Government Licence. Both destined to be forgotten - as they cannot mix with other licences.</p>
<p>The ethics of universal access to knowledge encourages openness.</p>
<p>Lawrence ended with an explanation that we cannot expect formal revisions until the US Government reforms itself not least because of the funding regime that means "30-70%" of a politician's time is spent in deaiing with fund raising. This in turn has the efffect of biasing attitudes. This makes the blocking of IP legislation almost a certainty as politicians act to support existing power bases. Unless the world moves first to shame the US.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This presentation about Korea's approach to supporting ODL and ICT to extend their education system. Korea has very highly ranked results for its achievements at school level. Their current initiitaves include "U-learning" and digital textbooks.</p>
<p>There is high penetration of PCs and high speed internet into the school system and national systems including a National Educational Information System to help link home and school through transparent information. This provides the electronic documentation for the academic record needed as learners progress through the education process.</p>
<p>The digital textbook programme has a target for 2015 to have pupils using an integrated textbook and contact system under a model of "Smart education" to &nbsp;aloow "any place to become a classroom". The investment over the next 4 years is estimated at around $2bn.</p>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5788</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Hal Plotkin brought personal greeting from Barack Obama as well as the vice president and Secretary of State for Education Martha Kanter. Hal brought his personal story that had also set the scene at a previous Hewlett conference&nbsp;<a title="Hal Plotkin Keynote Hewlett Meeting 2010" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3345">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3345</a>.</p>
<p>Hal went on to describe the adoption of a policy by the College where he was on the boad to adopt and improve free and open resources. The result was may faculty members volunteering to engage with this initiative - based on the enthusiasm and motivations of those in education. Foothills then produced the first fully articulated free and open statistics course, hence saving stundents collectively over $1m in saving them text book costs.</p>
<p>The programme of work under the Trade Act has announced $500m of grants in the first wave of $2bn of funding that is the biggest investment in open content as all the content must be shared and released under CC-BY. Hal Plotkin widened the invitation to participate alongside those involved in the grant. [This includes our own partner Anne Arundel Community College in Maryland.]</p>
<p>The percentage of people who have the opportunity to take part in the "best" of higher education. His guess is that less than 5% have the chance to do this - while in that 95% who have no chance there is much missed potential.</p>
<p>A perhaps surprising result of the adoption of OER is that there are also improvements to the teaching process. His possible reasons include that students hold on to all the free resources rather than sell the expensive learning materials and sharing and collaboration on how to teach and spreading practice beyond classrooms.</p>
<p>He also related the meeting of the Mozilla Foundation's work on badges launched at the Mozilla Drumbeat conference in Barcelona last year. The potential for the online badging to replace the certification of higher education is a possibility, if not a certainty.&nbsp;<a title="Mozilla Badges" href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges" target="_blank">http://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges</a></p>
<p>Hal finished by describing the holographic projection system that are now appearing that could be used to allow three-d representations to be transferred as tele-presence further changing what we think of a distance education - becoming simply "education". He described this as the chance to make the biggest change to education in the entire hostory of the world.</p>]]></description>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Looking at reuse of OLI material in Higher Educationking an Activity Theory view of the use of OER as practice.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Preliminary conclusions:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->1. Assume OER will be used differently by different instructors. (Also confident that can also be said of learners). Some dependence on subject domain of the OER. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->2. So do not design for single use. Anticipate various uses &ndash; a &ldquo;pedagogical pachage&rdquo; rather than a course.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->3. Detail may add or detract E.g.: conceptual explanations facilitate some and detract for others</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Interviewees &ndash; 3 elementary statistics instructors, 2 web design. Interviews every 1-2 weeks. Total of 40 interviews (30-45 minutes). Stats courses use OLI. Web design focussed on web based tools. &nbsp;Different way in which topic functions.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Three issues for productivity and usability:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->1. Alignment of OER conceptual focus with previous emphasis</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->2. Match OER topics and sequence with previous syllabus</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->3. Affordances and constraints on instructor-student interaction (e.g. OER providing feedback but only works for some sorts of use)</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->In this talk looking at conceptual focus examples:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->1. Instructor functioning as a mentor: preparing students to join the community of practice (cf Lave and Wenger). Aim that students join the community of professional web designers). Encourage innovation/exploration. Develop connections through e.g. professional visits, attend conference.</div>

<p>
<p>Renee Fisher and Jim Greeno from Carnegie Mellon University (and OLnet).&nbsp;Looking at reuse of OLI material in Higher Education taking an Activity Theory view of the use of OER as practice.</p>
<p>Preliminary conclusions:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Assume OER will be used differently by different instructors. (Also confident that this can also be said of learners). Some dependence on subject domain of the OER. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Need to not design for single use. Anticipate various uses &ndash; a &ldquo;pedagogical pachage&rdquo; rather than a course.</li>
<li>Detail may add or detract E.g.: conceptual explanations facilitate some and detract for others</li>
</ol></p>
<p>Interviewees &ndash; 3 elementary statistics instructors, 2 web design. Interviews every 1-2 weeks. Total of 40 interviews (30-45 minutes). Stats courses use OLI. Web design focussed on web based tools. &nbsp;Different way in which topic functions.</p>
<p>Three issues for productivity and usability:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Alignment of OER conceptual focus with previous emphasis</li>
<li>Match OER topics and sequence with previous syllabus</li>
<li>Affordances and constraints on instructor-student interaction (e.g. OER providing feedback but only works for some sorts of use)</li>
</ol></p>
<p>In this talk looking at conceptual focus examples:</p>
<p>1. Instructor functioning as a mentor: preparing students to join the community of practice (cf Lave and Wenger). Aim that students join the community of professional web designers). Encourage innovation/exploration. Develop connections through e.g. professional visits, attend conference.</p>
<p>2. Instructor functioning as a coach: sees students as cognitive apprentices (Collins). &nbsp;Web resources are tools to help reach goals.</p>
<p>3. Knowledge as problem solving and concepts. Use &ldquo;wordy&rdquo; text to explain which software illustrates. OLE leaves it to the technology. [Not previous practice as had emphasised the calculation.</p>
<p>a. Preferred by one and will adopt less computation in the future</p>
<p>b. Works ok for some students &ndash; produces a different distribution of results.</p>
<p>c. Augmented the material to meet curriculum</p>
<p>Q&amp;A</p>
<p>Does this mean that we should not seek perfection in OER?</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>An interesting area to go to with this research to investigate what it means for uptake and adoption. How fully developed and specified should things be for release.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>How is this different in an OER context?</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive approaches can be more intrusive &ndash; tracking by the instructor can cause coercion</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Larry Cooperman and Gary Matkin - run through the reasons they have found for UCI to adopt OCW:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Serve current students</li>
<li>Attract new students</li>
<li>Support faculty</li>
<li>Facilitate accountability and continuous improvement</li>
<li>Advance institutional recognition</li>
<li>Support public service role</li>
<li>Disseminate results of research and attract research students</li>
<li>Serve as a repository of digital assets</li>
<li>Serve learning communities (of all types)</li>
<li>Enhance international service and reputation</li>
</ol>
<div>Trying to behave something else - flag up future experience rather than necessarily a "course". &nbsp;The other side is what to do to get buy in from the university:</div>
<div><ol>
<li>A website to be proud of</li>
<li>Help students and facult</li>
<li>Leverage and support existing units</li>
<li>Build an inventory - and spread it around</li>
<li>Create miro demonstrations and publicise them</li>
<li>Get media attention internal and external</li>

              <title>OCWC Global 2011: How to help teachers help learners learn with OER</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5433</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5433</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Dave Pritchard - Survey on what teachers of Physics wnat to teach and what students want to learn. Not a good correlation. E.g. teachers like theory and sense-making don't like practical applications. Students are the opposite. In fact focus is on topics in any case!</p>
<p>Similar mismatch between College approach and Internet age behaviour. In addition what people actually want is personal help rather than content. So is OER "Digitizing the dinosaur".</p>
<p>Lessons from his teaching career:&nbsp;Answering questions right - does not mean student mental process resemble the teacher/expert one.</p>
<p>Data shows that copying homework hinders analytic learning - but not conceptual questions. &nbsp;Shows that aspects are de-coupled from how experts expect learning to happen. Chi, Feletovich &amp; Glaser (1981) - expert/novice mismatch. Declarative and procedural knowledge does not equal srategic knowledge.</p>
<p>Tackle with MAPS - Applied Problem Solviing. Three intensive weeks to improve from D to B. Approach to try to measure everything. An item Response Theory to get real-time feedback for student performance. Showed that MIT students come in more capable than the average but then fell down to the average after about 6 weeks. Instant feedback then enables to see how to improve things. Offer module and assets - with indication of difficulty involved - allow student choice. But know which pay backs - e.g. simulation v text v video. Choose your own homework allow mix and match easy (1 pt) - hard (3 pt) to make up 15 points of homework.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Preetha introducing the idea of OpenStudy. Addressing the engagement issues. ?Students find much online learning boring - but are spending time on facebook, wikipedia and instant messenging for homework answers.</p>
<p>OpenStudy uses learning theories: Twigg, Fuchs, Lave &amp; Wenger, Vygotsky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OCW+OpenStudy integration with real time feed of q&amp;a from the OpenStudy appearing beside the OCW content. Generally some people on line (e.g 8 online in computer science at 6am this morning). A layer for e.g. maths allows cross-pollination with more than one resource linked to the problems. Reputation medals and badges for people who give good answers. Gives benefits in terms of greater time on site and better understanding of users.</p>
<p>To get OpenStudy on a site: Step 1: contact OpenStudy. Step 2: add widget. That is it! (Or adopt the educommons platform and it is built in.)</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Josh Jarret (Gates): relatively recent move to OER. Trying to level the opportunities in education and improve attainment. Keen on using disruptive element of technology and innovation to improve learning. Value in lower cost (need to know if it actually makes a difference), breadth of access, impact of use on impact. Also interested in Scale &amp; Quality. Does Open help us scale - trying this with MITE and OLI. Make free so good that cannot keep it from the hands of students. &nbsp;Not yet proven that open can do this - but has the chance to do so. Does open drive continuous improvement? Lacks the feedback - need more "Darwinism" in OER to help refinement happen. Can formative assessment drive search - help learners with problems get what they need? Know where the modules are that work and those that don't. Can learning outcomes be a natural selection device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cathy Casserly: &nbsp;Cathy now CEO in first three months at Creative Commons on a listening tour. CC now moving into the mainstream and education. Continuing infrastructure that helps avoid technical and legal impediments. Culture, education, science and open data are core areas. How to move into cycle of improvement? - open data.</p>
<p>What makes a good proposal? The sweet spot between what you really want to do and what foundations are looking to fund. Need to align the ideas with the strategies. Keep proposals short! Must have a tight narrative - think the person who reads it has to explain and convince to others.</p>
<p>Pedro: Why is OER so successful in Spain? Spanish education was already acting as consortium 5 years before the formation of OCWC. This could be a reason. Bank of Santander funds in a very open way (&euro;120m /year - no ties to projects). Plus some magic! Recognise the global marketing opportunity and the glamour of OER. 44 out of 80 Spanish Universities now have OCW.&nbsp;Future direction of Universia - needs to figure out new strategic plan to work with other companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vic Vuchic: Are you happy so far? Yes! although - nervous as need to keep success going. Shifting strategy and economic times mean less foundation investment - but still growth in the activity. Hewlett refocus on infrastructure groups: CC, Connexions, OCWC. Move to sustainable and adaptive needed. Want OER in the mainstream and moved along the maturation curve. Move to active participating communities, embedding in institutions and become more deman led. Moving funding away from 4-year universities to community college and common curriculum (K-12). Globally - policy with UNESCO, OECD, Ministries; community; research - a few good studies can go a long way.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Tom Caswell: introducing the Open Library work from Washington - see also&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5424">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5424</a>&nbsp;. Had a "Quality Matters review process for the open courses, Accessibility design specialist, Literacy skills agenda, global education considerations.</p>
<p>Yongsheng Sun Global education: &nbsp;Students need to be prepared to operate in a global world so have brought out this perspective in the course design. Approach is to incorporate and informed understanding of the connectedness and dependencies. Bring in other traditions where appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q&amp;A:</p>
<p>Maintenance - part of openness is giving up control and allow a life of its own. BUT in adopting content for own system expect to have a maintenance cycle - not necessarily commissioned from original author.</p>
<p>Authoring approach is to build in the LMS - then export to other systems for external sharing. Trying to minimise the cost of sharing as primary duty to own students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two institutional researchers are part of the project and will carry out comparison before and after looking for impact.</p>
<p>Surveys are in place to understand what is happening now.</p>
<p>Using open.michigan system to help track copyright materials - e.g. extract all images from powerpoint and flag for copyright issues.</p>
<p>"Sun model" for global education - &nbsp;aims to bring out global view and help people reflect on what is needed.</p>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5427</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>An evaluation of the impact of the open work at Michigan. Evaluation started in 2010 drawing on models of evaluatin at:&nbsp;Tufts OpenCourseWare, Free to Learn, MIT OpenCourseWare, Oford's Technology-Assisted Lifelong Learning.</p>
<p>Looking at whether the measures meet the vision of Open.Michigan + goals http://tiny.url/openmichigan to produce measurable activities and evaluation objectives. Increased use of analytics but actually also move platforms so need to be careful to gather all data. Now using OERbit platform that helps draw things together. Analytics can show breakdown but need surveys to understand in greater detail.</p>
<p>Main area of activity is health - with fairly broad involvement across university but not at all levels. Even so 40% of faculty &amp; 75% of students had not heard of OCW. Survey went to the whole university - though low response from non-faculty staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Results: sharing is happening. Syllabus tends to be downloaded more and more. Adapting is lower than view/download (but data actually shows reasonable percentage - up to 20% for some categories).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emerging themes:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Communication/awareness</li>
<li>Copyright clarification</li>
<li>Define terms (avoid OER!)</li>
<li>Why and how to use/create</li>
<li>How to improve OER</li>
<li>Cultural shifts</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Aim to now develop a comprehensive communication plan across the universit - with some more formality to reach the leadership.</p>
<p>Resources are online including questions - http://tiny.url/omevaluation - intend to add an OERbit module that will help people understand what is happening to the content.</p>
<p>Q&amp;A:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Intend to investigate further through focus groups what is happening in "Adaptation"</li>
<li>Some parts of survey for everyone - other bits for those who were engaged</li>
<li>Difficulty of defining terms - need greater awareness</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Vijay Kumar &amp; Kim Thanos, running a session looking at a framework for innovation and how it has been applied - plus how to apply in the session.</p>
<p>Model of diffusion of innovation (Havelock &amp; Huberman) ORACLE - building on experience from the early days of introducing technical innovation in developing areas. Success depends on a variety of factors: Object, Resources, Authority, Consensus, Linkages, Environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Object - the value and expected benefit balanced against complexity</li>
<li>Resources - for OER not about "sustaining OER" rather what can be achieved</li>
<li>Authority - who is behind the idea</li>
<li>Consensus - getting everyone on board</li>
<li>Linkage - infrastructure technical/organisational/social</li>
<li>Environment - what is needed and how change can happen</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Need these six factors but also there is a time for things to happen - readiness for things to happen. OER now becoming a key part of strategies for education.</p>
<p>Recognise the multiple perspecttive - use a 3 lens framework. Cultural, Strategic, Political. Organisations as institutions, machines, contests. Perspectives of people as well&nbsp;&ldquo;where you stand on an issue depends on where you sit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Kim Thanos: works on sustainability so often looking at the ways to raise promise to impact and take pockets of innovation forward. Having done this repeatedly want to see how to stand back and apply models such as different lenses. Culture as habit - slow but sustained change that need not be negative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two examples: Appied to Haiti education - Build Back Better. Devised projects and process. Needed to establish local ownership and leaderships as primary step. Projects: OER, immersion in technical environment, and national digital library. Second e.g. India's National Knowledge Commission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Common elements: infrastructure, staff development, content assests as OER, governance and leadership, vision or object.</p>
<p>Kick off meeting with NGLC wave 1 project next week - focus on at risk students. Looking for many different changes but the rallying point that is visible is the elimination of textbook costs. Very concrete, well understood,.</p>
<p>Survey before the conference:</p>
<p>Culture (6.38) v Strategic (7.24) v Political (5.48)</p>
<p>Strongest factor - thought leaders understanding and advocating open education.</p>
<p>Lead into discussion on enablers and inhibitors. Cultural lens - action through habit, strategic group - action through planning, political group - action through power.</p>
<p>Cultural group notes:</p>
<p>&bull;Inertia &ndash; same for 10 years  &bull;Reverse &ndash; chance for change  &bull;Admin/technical as important &ndash; technical solutions can take over  &bull;Protection of values = protection of content  &bull;Toolkit &ndash; flag up know the culture and than can use it  &bull;Inculcate habit building on the culture  &bull;Connect culture: live up to reputation through openness  &bull;Not counter to culture  &bull;Incentive to change habit: not money (at least at Harvard)  &bull;Tenure promotion as route from Openness  &bull;Must first look outside  &bull;Success can be inhibitor &ndash; high production values intimidating  &bull;Enabler &ndash; cuts can be push towards experimentation  &bull;Automate the repetitive &ndash; save time as well as finance  &bull;Openness as route to sharing and recording own work &bull;Hands on practice of colleges  &bull;National culture (French v English)</p>
<p>Strategic:&nbsp;&bull;Lack of understanding of business models  &bull;Change needs greater information  &bull;Connect funders with institutions</p>
<p>Political:&nbsp;&bull;Politics of environment as well as the institution  &bull;Political story needed to meet cultural and political situations  &bull;Not one size fits all &ndash; adjust message to circumstance  &bull;Recognition as a policy: not just Teaching &amp; Learning  &bull;Money and resources &ndash; more money implies harder to get a result! Less money means the keen will engage!</p>
<p>Recognise that we are at the beginning of the innovation cycle and do not allow any set backs to kill the willingness to engage.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Tom Caswell on the policy moves that have led to adoption of a more open approach at Washington State. Credit given to Cable Green for leading the move towards this policy. Tom compared working on policy as Aikido - martial art based on working with the strength of your opponent.</p>
<p>Community college challenges: textbook costs, time to degree, student completion rates, high faculty turnover. Policy toolbox (OCWC has a toolkit that helps): legislative strategy, student advocacy and governance all worked together for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Textbook costs: 1 course (English composition) has 47,000enrollments using $100 text book = $4.7m annual cost. If all state funded educational content was open access could start to make savings. Achieved by adding suggested ways to achieve existing goals through opennees. Partner with legislators who cared about the same things. E.g. add "consider least costly practices..." to infuse ideas of open education into legislation. State board now has specific CC-BY licence requirement as part of State Open Policy.</p>
<p>Gates foundation funding design of 81 high-enrolling courses using OER materials. Identify and fil the gaps (maximum text book costs &lt;$30). Adopting CCOLI statistics course. Open Course Library.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>David Kernohan on the potential impact of the change in the UK funding regime on UK HE. The pressures of the new funding are leading to changing to how universities compete (but not in a good way) and also what students value (also not necessarily in a good way).</p>
<p>Sheila Macneill update on the UKOER programme. An interesting new proposal call with submission in an open discussion system and with open evaluation. Evaluation of UKOER has found several drivers:&nbsp;recruitment, link to change, digital literacy, community outreach, student learning, a way to trasform culture, a way to preserve declining area, a way to create a learning community, mass participation.</p>
<p>Some negative findings: no observed use/adapt/share going on. David Wiley has referred to "dark reuse" as things that cannot be seen happening. But actually there is evidence of other sorts of reuse so would expect ot see this. DIYU - not in evidence either. These are nice ideas but not happening.</p>
<p>Models/scenarios for what might happen:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Status quo: OER enters the mainstream.</li>
<li>Open choice: Add on credits model</li>
<li>Collaborative University partnerships: OER based consortia (but much not shared)</li>
<li>Transformative model: a universality</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>So why do this:</p>
<p>There is a tranformational effec, there is wider societal and human good, localised and specific end user benefit.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you measure reuse of your materials - how many reuses are enough?</li>
<li>If no-one reuses do you still benefit from open release?</li>
</ul>
</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Backary Diallo (African Virtual University) Richardus Indrajit (Indonesia), Stavros Xanthopaylos (Brazil)</p>
<p><strong>Backary Diallo</strong>&nbsp;AVU info avaliable on youtue, facebook etc - so only brief update needed. AVU is widely present in Africa and established an OER architecture in 2005. The project involved 10 countires - establishing eLearning centres, capacity enhancement, teacher education, and gender mainstreaming.</p>
<p>Talk focus on the teacher education element. Covered three languages (French, Portuguese + English). Challenge of infrastructure - computers but also generators. Teacher education stages from poicy to evaluation and release. Moodle used to provide a common platform. Up to 2011 4000 students enrolled in the programme.</p>
<p>Working across the boundary meant that needed to harmonise the curriculum. A modular approach to allow variation with more modules than each needs. Open distance eLearning "ODeLified" modules then approved back as programmes within each university.</p>
<p>Materials development needed staff development and templating of the approach. oer.avu.org offers access to the materials (managed by dSpace). Surprised by international access (number 1 Brazil) very low numbers from Africa itself.</p>
<p><strong>Richardus Indraji</strong>t (indonesia) 237million over 18000 island. Challenge of and unequal distribution of educational resources and expertise. ICT may offer solutions - three intiatives: eLearning, OCW, grant support for OER courses from goverment. But no significant change.</p>
<p>Need change support by context, compliance and communication. Try to select 6 leading universities but lead to competition. Instead take a subject base on Computer Science across 750 universities/600,000 students: Nexsus (National E-education for eXchange ...). Radical open appraoch - courses, research, conference, project, journal, ... all open. All degrees with up to 30% from other univerisites - allow to mix "best" universties with small and local ones. Diploma supported by government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value proposition for: students, lecturers, universities (provider &amp; user), association, government. Plan launch on 11/11/11 with intention to cross over to international provision by 2015. 14 people here from Indonesia to encourage collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Stavros Panagiotis Xanthopoyli</strong>s (Brazil): Fundacai Getulio Vargas (FDV) initial mission to train civil service (1940s). Now Brazils largest non-government provider of distance education. 98,000 students online. 24 OCW courses free and open based on content of paid courses.</p>
<p>Innovation in methods and pedagogy. 233 members of team working on distance education content. Brazill 200m people. University California Irvine invited them in to OCWC and helped set direction. Not accepted initially. Need to localise the content and transform from standard text to e.g. cartoons. Put up relatively short courses - approx 15 hours per course. People asked for certificates - help to understand who is doing what. Declaration of participation approach. In last 2 months of 2008 71,000 vists, 19,000 declarations.</p>
<p>Total of 24 course (5-30hours) mainly business and management. To get the declaration need to answer survey and add to mailing list. Generates paying student and *is* self sustaining. Sponsorship by e.g. Wal-Mart of sustainable courses. Now &gt;7.5m visits &gt;2.4m completions &gt; 1.3m declarations. On per course 24x bigger than MIT! Indicates that in Brazil there is big demand for this form of education. 50% hear about courses through word of mouth - 90% through this or internet search, 99.99% would recommend - 7,000 paying students ($3m revenue) as a result. Gender is now reasonably balanced. 77% low income</p>
<p>Almost 100% (99.75%) of visits are from Brazil - distribution of use follows the distribution of computers in the country. 48 other coutries with Brazilians overseas in evidence.</p>
<p>New business models - sponsorship allows support as well as content. Acted as a catalyst for quality through exposure. &nbsp;Now challenging the high school syllabus through openness. Suprised by how huge the impact of this work has been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OER a true democratic movement that can make a difference for a better world.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Now 266 members (43 new in the last year) and more than 18000 courses. Notable addition Community College Consortium for Open Education Resources deciding to merge its membership with OCWC. Membership rules also moving from course production to include support for the field.</p>
<p>Added project showcase and other community elements to the site. Including newsletter and blog.</p>
<p>Survey: - more users over 50 than any other categories (repeated on education-portal.com), awareness was low, need help to discover what is wanted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next year's conference is from Cambridge (UK) linked with OER12 organised by The Open University.</p>
<p>Steve Carson: need to turn attention to the next 10 years as well as pay attention to celebration of the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Gary Matkin (Treasurer): OCWC budget draws on $500,000 from Hewlett to run for a total cost of $600,000 as a lean operation. In the future will need to operate without the grant so will need to diversify way the organisation supports and funds itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now started an open course catalog on OCWC.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Some of those who started OCW in the years after MIT updating on their experience introduced by Mary-Lou Forward.</p>
<p>Sukon Kanchanaraksa (John Hopkins) built up medical resources in particular images. See the open provision as part of a spectrum from Academic degrees - certificates - continuing education - OCW. Without OCW there would be a gap and the educational content would not be available to all who needed.</p>
<p>Notre Dame launched in 2006 as a way to contribute to the common good. Focus on social and cultural material. Some of their open courses have had big spikes in interest: Creole Langauge and Culture (supporting Haiti), Islamic Societies of middle East and North Africa (as actions happen in that part of the world), Nuclear warfare (Japanese earthquake and aspects of disaster management). Have added new courses of local benefit to students and also used OER to provide greater global reach and visibility. Uses the educommons framework to release courses that are complete as possible.</p>
<p>Mary Lee (Tufts) aim to address "world's complex challenges through innovative teaching and research". Had some exisitn free digital resources but OCW meant a big scale up to launch in 2004. Led to further open initiatives - latest is Aquapedia to share open actions at Tufts. OCW proveided several benefits and Tufts fed back into the formation of the OCW Consortium as well as new content and tools (Perseus, TUSK, VUE).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pedro Aranzadi,&nbsp;Universia was formed by Santander Bank in 2000 &nbsp;with aims to promote innovation and joint projects and help students into employment. 1200 member universities carrying out various actions. Agreed to translate from MIT courses into Spanish and helped bring institutions to OCWC. 1000 courses now provided from memeber institutions. OCW has helped improve connection with teachers (while working with mangers is easy (money), students is also easy (beer) teachers are more difficult and generally only get one chance!) OCW has helped to establish Universia and increase profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yoshima Fukuhara (Meiji University and Japanese OCW). A consortium approach taken in Japan with aim to launch simultaneously OCW as felt had fallen behind. Develop both Japanese and a smaller number of English courses. They carry out regular sample surveys since 2006 ~ 1200 users per year: "How do you think about this activity?" &gt;90% +ve. "Aware of universities opening up lectures?" &lt;30% aware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presentation on behalf of Fun-Den Wang (CORE). Followed formation of the "IET Foundation" giving scholarships in China. Adopted OCW and current trends are much greater interest in video OCW courses and a move towards "Open Universtities" which will offer OER. In the future expect to offer certificates linked to OCW and integrated the Chinese OCW with localised international OCW.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Steve Carson introduces a very distinguished panel of those involved in the formation of MIT OCW. The committee looking at whether MIT should move into distance learning instead recommended that all MIT content should be given away for free.</p>
<p>Charles Vest: two keys to great things: One is to listen to the ideas that don't come from the top down. Two is that really great ideas will find their support somehow.</p>
<p>His own background drew on what happened with the radiation lab (operational work on radar) at MIT. This was closed at the end of the war but gave people 6 months to write up before they moved on. Led to new approach to the field with notes that were shared and added to that spread across the US. The other factor was the idea took so quickly both at MIT and with foundations (especially Bill Bowen of Mellon Foundation and then Hewlett Foundation) - rather than the more typical couple of years to take on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Robert Brown: annual planning meeting in 1998 to see what key items needed promoting. MIT was under investing in educational technology. Other institutions were mobilising - so led from 1999 a council on educational technologies to innovate internally and externally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lawrence Bacow: Some scepticism from MIT faculty - "time spent putting stuff on the web is a distraction". Foundation funding made people aware there would be resources. Early adopters - led to existence proof and could see helped other work work.</p>
<p>Dick Yue: committee looked at models that others were coming up with - certificates etc, copy fathom.com etc. But then MIT historical context encourages looking for ways to get big impact ... "Is that all there is to life". Felt that initial report that they produced felt like "no big deal" - wanted to find something more exciting and way to be an early adopter. Produced a big report to show that everything was considered but also bring out vision and paid intention to the economics - but primarily felt the time was right. Benefits and values - move forward in technology, help students, interests of foundations, ... But actually this idea turned out to answer a lot of questions. OCW is not just a good idea - but was MIT in action and the fit with how faculty think about education.</p>
<p>Shigeru Miyagawa. Commitment to publish everything made before understood how many courses there were - surprised to find we had 2000 courses. OCW meant he saw academic leadership in action in a new way.</p>
<p>Hal Abelson: Lots of good ideas - leadership brought out the way this idea fitted with MIT and insisted on getting buy in from the faculty. Openness helps move away from Internet 1.0 to new ideas. Also need to think about where we are going. Book "New culture of learning" Doug Thomas and John Seely Brown helps set the scene. Now moving forward to not "publishing knowledge" but new ways to create knowledge - now thinking about how to change MIT for a world of so many resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(DY) Faculty overwhelmingly bought in. Charles Vest: Three concerns - Intellectual Property (very minor - noise level). Worry that would not innovate. Worry that too mundane and will not look to be high quality. Really unique was the comprehensiveness of giving the whole thing. Most viewed as something that was a tool for teachers - missed that majority of users would be self-learners.</p>
<p>(LB) There was expectation from students that would have content on the web. But was some concern about the value of the residential undergraduate experience. (RB) noise from students, alumni and parents: are we giving away the MIT experience which needs to be earnt. Commodotising MIT education - but this did not happen. (LB) the books written by people at MIT are not an MIT education (CV: MIT education is not a "box full of books"). (DY) Publishing can free up faculty to teach rather than copy from one place to another. Worries that numbers will decline not founded - rather high school students would look ahead. (RB) One professor: Will never do this. Have a set of notes that use - what would he do if they are available. On other hand Singapore-MIT alliance meant starting to teach remotely so need to think these things through. OCW created a healthy debate.</p>
<p>(SM) set out idea that it should spread from very beginning. 2003 tried to get neighbour institutions involved e.g. Tufts. Now a much biiger community - this was not an after thought. (DY) Sought a name that did not directly reflect MIT - OpenCourseWare and did *not* trademark this. Again with idea that MIT is only one institution and does not do many disciplines so intend to be an early model for others. (LB) Moved to Tufts and found that Tufts already thinking about this approach and worked on digitising medical content.&nbsp;<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Tufts</em>&nbsp;University&nbsp;<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Sciences Knowledgebase. Easy decision to join in with OCW.</em></p>
<p><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->HA: Where we are heading next. Future of OCW with future of the university. World more about generation of knowledge so need infrastructure for impact. Need to remember how far we have come already - lead into co-creation of knowledge.</em></p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5398</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5398</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>O'Reilly as a company started as a book publisher, then organising conferences (not least the Web 2.0 summit), online provision of books and now venture capital to support innovation. Goal "Changing the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators".</p>
<p>Several firsts - first book on WWW (1992), first commercial web site (1993), web services (1997), Web 2.0 (2004), Make: Magazine (2005). "The future is here just not evenly distributed" (William Gibson).</p>
<p>Watch the hackers and see what they are doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>screen scraping -&gt; web services&nbsp;</li>
<li>Wireless community networks -&gt; wifi hotspots</li>
<li>Open source software -&gt; open collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pattern recognition - have maps of what are going on (though these can be wrong - "The map is not the territory" - Korzybiski).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Free software - Stallman. Seen as radical. But followed by Raymond's view of open source as a development methodology - free software was about engagement in the open. Actually goes back to Unix - which was licence agnostic. e.g "The UNIX programming environment" - Kerringhan and Pike (for which Tim has written part of the Wikipedia entry in praise of its importance).</p>
<p>"The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think." - Edwin Schlossberg. Led to a rethinking of the free software concept - and the meeting in 1998 that defined open source. Tim wrote about this in "Remaking the peer to peer meme" with some concept maps that explained these different views. View of the PC revoultion - hardware, software and infoware. IBM was dominant in PCs - expansion broke the dominance of IBM: split to Intel, Dell, Microsoft.</p>
<p>Does this model apply to open source? e.g. open source software built on the same hardware and PCs. OR different view as stack of software as service, commodity software components, sub systems. Commodity intel hardware, protocols, and LAMP. BUT the key service layer (e.g. Google) is very much proprietary. So actually fairly complex mapping process.</p>
<p>Christensen "The Innovator's Solution" - when profits disappear at one stage, the reappear at another. So free software is basis for new proprietary empires - Google, facebook etc.</p>
<p>Advantage of open source is to drive down the barriers to participation: low barriers to experimentation, interoperability. Lock in then from benefits of services *not* control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tim O'Reilly five lessons from open source for open courseware:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Think deeply about what it is you *really* do.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->As educators, researchers and innovators. What is the job we do for the learners of today and the future and why?</p>
<p>2. Smaller pieces, modular design.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Open courseware often brings the heritage of students assembling in one place for one time. Can we break this down? Wikipedia has a more atomic structure and standardised design. Youtube 5 minute instructional videos and how tos. Viewing falls off radically after 5 minutes: not the 45 minute lecture or semester long course. Challenge how we think people learn as they learn in new ways outside of university. Instructables.com: simple pictures with captions. Khan academy - 52 million lesson views based on small formats. Stackoverflow.com - answering very specific questions.</p>
<p>3. Develop in public</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Going back to Cathedral and Bazaar principles. github - sharing open source development now aim to apply to books. Wikipedia talk pages that allow open discussion and views of how pages evolve all in public. ohloh tracking participation levels in the public to see what people have done. markmail that allows datamining of the mailing lists.</p>
<p>4. Provide affordances for community</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Allow feedback,tracking. Egs Google pagerank and adwords that depend on user behaviour. Amazon adding participation to buying books. Instructables feeding back views and subscriptions. Make things social. Classics teachers in collaboration between 21 southern colleges led to second biggest classics programme.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Big message: an architecture of participation:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->- don't just measure download, measure contribution</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->- design to be extensible</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->- small pieces loosely joined is the magic</p>
<p>5. Create more value than you capture.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->This has been achieved by OCW. The Gift - Lewis Hyde. Status from what we give away. Enhanced value to the world by giving away so far - think about how to take it forward in a changing world. Not just expression of what we do now - but thinking about the future of the university.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>MIT's OpenCourseWare took off as could not have een expected. Now 250 univeristies are part of OCWC, including many leading universities.</p>
<p>No idea emerges without some precident. MIT drew inspiration from the open source etc. But actually draws on more ancient tradition of the academy: simultaneous pursuit of the same aims. Potent force for the common good. Prepare our students to draw on the value and so invent a better future for all.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <title>Open Nottingham 2011: Lessons from Open Source Software Re-use - Greg DeKoenigsberg</title>

              <description><![CDATA[&lt;!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px Calibri} --&gt;
<p>Greg DeKoenigsberg (ISKME OER Commons) talking about&nbsp;lessons from the world of open source trransferred to open education. How does online collaboration work? Where is the learning in this process. What he learnt by participating and collaborating around a community of 10,000 plus members.&nbsp;What he learnt from open-source and what he think about OER.&nbsp;How the lessons from open-source can be carried on to the OER movement.</p>
<p><strong>Online communities of practice (taking Etienne's work on CoP):</strong> <em>What is the domain?</em> Participation is voluntarily &ndash; you must feel passionate about this. <em>What is the community?</em> The context in which your participants work together. <em>What is the practice? </em>The activies that move your participants closer to your golas)</p>
<p>The internet encourages the construction of endless communities of practice, serving vanishingly small domains.&nbsp;See entire worlds of people that you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise see.</p>
<p>What we conceive of as &ldquo;the OER community&rdquo; is actually a potential endless set of vanishingly small communities that all have different needs and priorities (Do we know enough about them?)</p>
<p>Talking about discoverability solutions that work: You need people to filter resources in the developed (1st world). 1<sup>st</sup> world problem too many resources / 3<sup>rd</sup> world problem not enough resources. 1<sup>st</sup> world needs people (eg people you follow and trust their opinion / judgement on twitter) to filter good/bad resources.</p>
<p>How can we leverage open content and infrastructure to build and service actual communities of practice?</p>
<p>The internet encourages the construction of endless communities of practice serving vanishingly small domains.&nbsp;Giving people new opportunities to be genuinely useful even in small ways is empowering in ways you wouldn&rsquo;t believe.&nbsp;Micro-contributions from the wider open-source community is what makes it work. Empower users.&nbsp;That is the secret to the open source world!</p>
<p>Licenses are mechanisms that allow people to share. These mechanisms are essential to the sharing of source code. Economic value / user case studies of open source.&nbsp;These mechanisms may be incidental to the sharing of content.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Open Nottingham 2011: Use of OER by an Open University Maths Course - Tim Lowe</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5314</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5314</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Tim Lowe talking about Maths course and resources and "Maths Help"</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for applying for course:</strong></p>
<p>a. Support module to do other courses (eg science, business etc)</p>
<p>b. Introduction to Maths in order to then progress to more advanced maths course; and...</p>
<p>c. To overcome fear of doing maths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aims of re-writing the materials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increase retention</li>
<li>Better prepare students for subsequent modules</li>
<li>Remove preparatory material</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is Maths help?&nbsp;</strong><em>Mathshelp.open.ac.uk</em></p>
<p><em>"Maths Help" on the OU OER site OpenLearn&nbsp;</em>allows students to begin to prepare for maths course before they receive their course materials.&nbsp;Basic maths skills modules on OpenLearn, based on previous (printed) materials, enhanced with interactive activities and linked to the course website. Mathshelp is&nbsp;a door into everyday mathematics, points also within course materials, available for all to use (lined to from OU &ldquo;Skills for Study&rdquo;; STEM: North of Scotland; TechFest-SetPoint) and reuse (via Jorum). Materials from books into web friendly format. Plus very useful guide of how to&nbsp;use the maths calculator (used also by other organisations).</p>
<p><strong>The challenge:&nbsp;</strong>When students are reading materials and sending materials, the communication of maths should be enhanced, we should be able to teach more <em>How do we say maths?</em> <em>Who do we speak it? </em>&nbsp;Solution by using audio frames)</p>
<p><strong>Usage and feedback:&nbsp;</strong>Unique visitors: 1/1/2010 &ndash; 13/9/2010. users:&nbsp;500-1000 per module.&nbsp;Modules rated 4.5-5 stars (via OpenLearn &ndash; not many people do ratings).&nbsp;Students recommending to each other in forums.&nbsp;Tutors reporting better initial understanding.&nbsp;High take-up (95%) and achievement (mean:94%) in first early assignment</p>
<p><strong>Final thought from the room: </strong>Students doing other courses that need such support for other course &ndash; this could help so much.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>We want to better understand what learning is like in universities and what teaching entails.</p>
<p>Why is Nottingham involved? (5-year strategic plan) Detailed outline of the way OER contributes to the work and mission of Nottingham University:</p>

<p>2. Excellence in education</p>
<p>3. Promotional opportunities</p>
<p>4. Internationalisation</p>
<p>5. Cost efficiencies</p>
<p>Nottingham University working with student unions to better understand how students are using the resources.</p>
<p>Nottingham University has campuses in Asia and Malaysia &ndash; they dont have the same materials &ndash; the ability and opportunity to share materials across continents &ndash; make it openly available</p>
<p>Evidence that Chinese students are using the open materials to study at the NU campus in Ningbo</p>
<p><strong><em>Nottingham Uni has two tools:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>XPERT</strong> (harvesting OER engine)</p>
<p><strong>XERTE</strong> (creating e-learning materials &ndash; open source tool)&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <title> Open Nottingham 2011: The Learning Registry - Steve Midgley</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5296</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5296</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Steve Midgley is the&nbsp;Deputy Director of the Office of Education Technology at the United States Department of Education. At Open Nottingham he introduced&nbsp;the "Learning Registry"&nbsp;to help educators to find the resources they need in the format they need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>What is the Learning Registry?</strong></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->1. Lightweight API</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->2. No centralised infrastructure: no &ldquo;off&rdquo; switch</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->3. Control and accountability is local</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->4. No default winners: level the playing field</p>
<p>Digital learning resources are widely available, but hard to apply for teaching and learning.&nbsp;Educators and students already know about how best to use resources.</p>
<p>Users are leaving data trails but their usage data is often thrown away or locked up.&nbsp;Expertise is highly distributed. users are leaving data trails, but usage data is often thrown away or locked up.&nbsp;The universe of diffreent forms of data orbiting around learning resources.&nbsp;Types of data: paradata (data about data), metadata, analytical data, linked data, context all around the learning resource.&nbsp;A big opportunity in the education space to be able to go after this metadata &amp; paradata and get value from it.</p>
<p>New services can include better discovery, recommendations, curricular integration and measurements of quality&nbsp;</p>
<p>The developer should be able to take the prototype and build with it / over it.&nbsp;Let the community speak to itself through the timeline of the learning registry (common metadata timeline).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Key messages:</strong></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Make possible a &ldquo;do-ocracy&rdquo; for those who run the project. Welcoming anyone who wants to make a difference.</li>
<li>Let the community speak to itself through the timeline of the learning registry (common metadata timeline)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Avoid bureaucratic heat death. Do as little as possible, as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Investment of time is a strong currency in education.&nbsp;Time constraint for teachers to find the resources &ndash; make it easy for them.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Panel of those involved in teaching to discuss how OER practice can be developed.</p>
<ul style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Carrie Bisgard, Coordinator of Online Learning (Teacher on Special Assignment), Whittier Union High School District</li>

<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Lisa Petrides (Moderator), President and Founder, Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education (ISKME)</li>
</ul>
<p>Key points:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>sharing of grades leads to sharing of practice</li>
<li>setting time aside for local sharing as well as global</li>
<li>sharing with parents gains positive feedback - teachers remain wary</li>
<li>open classes do encourage connections and early release</li>
<li>showing people oer in action helps to convince others - need data to brag</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Needs from OER:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>content, not so time-consuming, OER is "better not easier", search for fit is needed</li>
<li>OER librarian on twitter. Tweet #oerlib to get crowdsourced resources</li>
<li>YouTube is not enough - need to know it will work, not have unsuitable comments ...</li>
<li>OER needs to grow up - more, better chunked, more high school material</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Do OER for designing authentic inquiry meet a need?</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Need professional development - training how to use</li>
<li>Will be needed more with a bigger base</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>How does training happen for OER?</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Demo based can work - make it fun and worth it</li>
<li>Addressing the enthusiasts</li>
<li>Build vision</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>How to show it works and is cost efficient?</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Data is being gathered - but can be hard to compare as often addressing problem classes</li>
<li>Cost is hard to check as tend to be part of investment - but OER is looking to be cheaper and better</li>
<li>Having laptops in class and access is "just the way we do things" for kids</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>How can community help teachers?</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Need the equipment as well as the content - plus IT support</li>
<li>Become part of the conversation - find space and time to be involved with the students and teachers</li>
<li>Make offers for help - but be specifice about how you can help</li>
<li>As parents to be involved in learning</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Accreditation &ndash; described as one of the biggest barriers to OER. Need to bust the system, which is not sustainable. Both students and employers not satisfied with the current situation. But people are afraid of OER &ndash; it is disruptive change and people remain in denial that change is needed. BUT accreditation and &ldquo;credentialing&rdquo; matters and brings connections. But more regulation is coming, more accountability, more information, more requirements of &ldquo;classroom contact&rdquo; and more models &ndash; will we accept the alternative models. &nbsp;Cartoon: &ldquo;These new regulations will require new ways to get around them&rdquo;. Private solutions are in trouble stories of fraud and abuse&ndash; University of Pheonix numbers down 40% and its share value down as well. Student loan value exceeds mortgage debt in US. University of people aim to get accreditation but may take 6 years. Straighterline &ndash; low cost but not accredited as too much (&gt;25%) outsourced. For DIY-U approach may need to accredit the learner rather than the institution. &nbsp;Plan is to create an OER unit within WASC &ndash; what does it need to do?</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The keynote for the Hewlett Foundation talked about the impact that an approach based on open source/OER, low cost implementation of high tech ideas. OER and free-text books were said to be &ldquo;Realistic, cost effective way to &hellip; school age readers&rdquo; across a range of subjects. A good example of going further was the impact of feedback data &ndash; in a way I see this could be an example of learning analytics in action &ndash; using feedback &ldquo;clickers&rdquo; has led to &ldquo;phenomenal results&rdquo;. But they cost $400-$1200, which is too much to scale. The extra step is then in moving to open source and redesigning the task to make the best of what the clickers can offer based on using recycled smartphones over wifi.</p>
<p>Massive performance increases were described based on embedding new approaches into schools in challenging areas. Problems are also economic and need to develop a clear benefit for learners.&nbsp; Start businesses as way to help them. Online approaches help to support learners through the difficult first year of college. The overall approach also spreads the risk by involving several schools in leading different strands to avoid innovations running out of steam and helping exchange ideas.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Wikipedia is increasingly used by university students for<br />"pre-research", <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/125899/">to gain context and explore ideas for course<br />assignments and research projects</a> [1]. Yet many among scientists,<br />academics and other experts are <a href="http://www.jmir.org/2011/1/e14/">reluctant to contribute </a>to Wikipedia,<br />despite a growing number of <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/members/aps-wikipedia-initiative/">calls from the scientific community</a> to<br />join the project .<br /><br />The <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research_Committee">Wikimedia Research Committee </a>has just launched a survey to<br />understand why scientists, academics and other experts do (or do not)<br />contribute to Wikipedia and other collaborative projects, and whether<br />individual motivation aligns with shared perceptions of Wikipedia<br />within expert communities. We hope this may help us identify ways<br />around barriers to expert participation. The survey is anonymous and<br />takes about 20 min to complete.

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The session of the iiTE conference on OER chaired by Svetlana Kyneszava and Sergei Goncharov.</p>
<p>Rory McGreal: Is the new UNESCO Chair in OER at Athabasca University. The background he gave was that there are pressures on one side for the anti-copyright legislation to become very restrictive, and on the other to use Open Educational Resources that threaten those who believe protection is the way forward. However now need to rethink copyright and think in terms of openness. In Athabasca now using aupress as an open and free publishers &ndash; examples include mobile learning, theory of learning and learning design. Rory also pointed out that in video games &ldquo;1 twitch&rdquo; the movement of a joystick (200 ms) takes the time a signal goes 20,000km &ndash; i.e. around the world. The world was therefore made for playing video games J. OER offers a way that through openness it can address both sharing and cultural elements through editing. The web offers great connections plus also for development should value the needs of mobiles users &ndash; 3.4 billion mobile devices/1.3 internet mobile users in all countries. For example SMS took off first in Philipines rather than Canada. Designing for mobile requires balancing needs across conflicting requirements. Rory ended by pointing out the those such as the Royal Society and even the Pope are now in favour of open design.</p>
<p>Toshio Kobayashi, from Japan, described some of the background to OER before leading into the situation in Japan. There OER has not become established &ndash; while OCW has. However while the OCW model has taken hold in various places across the world. He has carried out a case study of Japan OCW (JOCW) &ndash; which often has not had as much impact as might be expected. He also found that the approach was too linked to existing material and culture while newer trends are to use more media, look for affordable approaches with value added services on top. His pointers to the future are the linking with global sharing of learning objects, and the increasing expectations of cultural transfer &ndash; exemplified by the UNESCO Russia initiative.</p>
<p>Alexei Sigalov, spoke about the survey work carried out for IITE UNESCO on Russian HE use of OER. There is actually an existing large investment &gt;10m($? or roubles?) in free resources e.g.s include school-collection.edu.ru and fcior.edu.ru. But these are often restricted to Russia because of licencing. There are also social spaces such as openclass used by around 10% of all teachers. So a positive view is that much is happening. But there are challenges: motivation to use, competency in professional use, and sharing resources. There are well developed intra-resources in internal eLibraries. There are now some really open courses <a href="http://www.intuit.ru/">www.intuit.ru</a> - which is actually commercial with a business model based on creating demand for associated books. The window.edu.ru initiative aims to provide a single point access to resources. They now have around 1m downloads per month. However downloading is not seen as a prestigious thing to do &ndash; but this is wrong there is scope for such material to inspire and should not be restricted. There is also &ldquo;push from the top&rdquo; in the form of Russian President addressing the concerns of getting value out of the libraries of universities.</p>
<p>Hmayek Danielyan, Armenia, listed factors such as the legal basis. Armenia has low Internet access (117th in the world/14%). OER can be traced back to 2001 with a further push in 2008. There have been successes in initiatives over recent years.</p>
<p>Airina Volungeviciene, Lithuania, was part of the team working with IITE UNESCO to assess OER readiness. Very open approach in university Universitas Vytauti Magni. At first there appears to be a lot of available material &ndash; but actually only a small proportion fits the UNESCO definition. There has been significant ICT investment in network infrastructure and academic libraries. The &ldquo;open&rdquo; digital libraries however are based on licensed materials, and they are not design for study. But there is also a Lithuanian Distance Education Network that has a well developed technology infrastructure including video conferencing &ndash; but then weaker on the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; elements of participation and involvement across all subjects. The Lithuanian Virtual University also shares a technology driven agenda. In particular from all these initiatives people are left with uncertainty &ndash; what can be used, and in which circumstances? There is a lack in culture of sharing and openness for OER/OEP. Institutions lack rules and hence encouragement &ndash; the exception is at the schools level &ndash; emokykia. Even there while provision is good, use is not. There are individual initiatives releasing courses and video lectures &ndash; these are small in number and still lack the clarity if they are to be used. Museums are setting up good access to their materials and are in general being more open. OpenScout (in which the OUUK is also involved through KMi) is helping develop international links.</p>
<p>Recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish OER development culture (international examples/partnerships</li>
<li>Promote OER repositories</li>
<li>Invite global experts to lead research</li>
<li>E-Education program across Lithuania based on OER</li>
<li>Review role of distance education centres</li>
<li>Investigate action model</li>
<li>Direct efforts to adapt existing OER repositories and tools</li>
<li>Invite contributions at policy level</li>
</ol>
<p>Education in the shift to OER is vital &ndash; guidelines are available and need to be directed within Lithuania. Language is a barrier. OER is part of the answer.</p>
<p>Ukraine. iPhone</p>
<p>Mongolia. One of the most sparsely populated coutries in the world (1.6m km^2/2.7m people). Young and rural population. Spends around 20% of national budget on education. Aim to choose convienient, efficient and lower cost ODL for Mongolia. Now have a plan for outsourcing in support of a national programme (e-Mongolia). But &ldquo;computing cannot benefit where infrastructure is not in place&rdquo;. Now have more than 2m users of mobile devices Internet from 30k users (2000) to 106k (2009) 10.7%. Worry about QA in switch to DE approaches.</p>
<p>Challenges across physiological (infrastructure?), culture, capacity. OER is not well developed in Mongolia &ndash; plan to enter the OCWC &ndash; but open source is taking hold in the IT world but not widespread in the general population. Distance education has been seen as way to address insufficient space and instructor overload and led to launch of e-Open University of MUST (Mongolian University of Science and Technology) but lack good models of use. Paper looking at challenge prepared for IITE.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan. iPhone</p>
<p>Svetlana. IITE UNESCO. Outlined the work that has been sponsored by UNESCO that led to the country reports. Ten reports (more than 700 pages) already received and hope to spread the coverage targeting non-English speaking countries. In the countries studies so far OER is not widely recognised. Using the UNESCO definition limited the resources that could count, the Hewlett Foundation definition is even more restrictive as it includes release of IPR under an appropriate licence. An expert consultation and wider questionnaire have been applied. Skipping over the advantages Svetlana focused on the barriers and problems. These include lack of awareness, language (non-English) though Russian has&nbsp; potential to provide some commonality, lack of knowledge-sharing culture (as described in the briefing by Andy Lane), lack of skills, lack of infrastructure (in some countries).</p>
<p>To address these need both top down and bottom up approaches. Plans in IITE now include expanding the geographical scope, awareness raising, online training resources and inventorying the repositories</p>
<p>Mikhail Fedotov. Copyright in Russia. Only in 2002 did copyright get extended to Internet. The definitions that are used are not necessarily good. He has proposed to the Russian Supreme Court and had adopted that publishing on the Internet implies allowing use at any point on the network. This will remove anomalies of the law that did not mention the network. The civil code allows for: use plus fee; use without agreement and no fee; use without agreement and fee paid. There are also provisions allowing publications to be used for education. However OER allows change so stops being a &ldquo;publication&rdquo; and instead becomes &ldquo;information&rdquo; (or possibly mass media). This removes the exception rule. So in the example of the fcior.edu.ru it is hard to answer how copyright law applies. The rules adopted can be a bit strange. For example doctoral candidates need to publish to pass and those articles must be available publicly which enforces release of copyright. But this is a &ldquo;right&rdquo; and yet it has to done if you are to pass the defence. It is also easy to have good intent but cause more confusion. E.g. all authors have the right to protect their work, but also the right to free access to information. Need to compromise between these two rights.</p>
<p>Presumption that author owns everything v presumption of free use unless prohibited. The presumption of fair use is part of the Berne convention but not in relation to the Internet.&nbsp; We have just had a wonderful presentation with options &ndash; CC can be seen as copyright lite. But in Russia the model is of hard copyright. There are alternatives that are also copyright lite but as with CC cannot do this as in civil code need to have a signed or verbal agreement between each side. The option remains for the author to declare how it will be used but then needs to avoid other agreements. Need to take an expanded collective management approach to copyright that involves individuals and organisations. The Internet remains a problem as it does not exist in any particular space or time. But e.g. could have individual, UNESCO publishing house, and a global publishing organisation that establishes the collective. This can also identify the way to reward authors and balance the system. 1. Need to recognise copyright lite and collective management. 2. Need to properly include Internet in legislation. Sea and space treaties give a model for the way that such laws might work. 3. The best approach is to avoid payment by end users &ndash; but to retain income collective billing may apply. 4. The law states use for education is allowed: but it is not possible to tell which use is which.</p>
<p>Q: Where is the contradiction &ndash; can pay for input and then be free.</p>
<p>A: If an author allows OER use or sells to portal that might be ok, but what about the publishing house giving permission based on older legislation.</p>
<p>Q: What about universities giving permission based on contract of work.</p>
<p>A: Yes &ndash; but issue is not resolved it would remain possible for individuals to claim their right. Further the coverage extends to projects, plans, charters and so there is potential for claims from many directions. The way to avoid the problem is to adopt the charter in advance of legislation. You should do your best to eradicate ambiguity.</p>
<p>Sergei Goncharov: we are only at the start line &ndash; dealing with legislation, technology and only a little bit about the change that everyone is and will experience. Do we know enough about the future needs?</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bernard Cornu, CNED</p>
<p>Opened the main part of the conference by talking about the &ldquo;Net generation&rdquo;. There are characteristics that can be broadly stated for baby-boom, X and Y generation. With the changing expectations of behaviour also comes new views :</p>
<p>knowledge as social:</p>
<p><strong>Learning to know, learning to do,     learning to live together and learning to be.</strong> (Jacques Delors)</p>
<p>There is a network view of how things work: switch from a hierarchical pyramid view to multi connected network.</p>
<p>Collective intelligence &ndash; exhibited by animals (e.g. ants) and maybe humans.</p>
<p>Quoted Kevin Kelly &ldquo;The next 5000 days of the web&rdquo; (youtube) illustrates the way in which each individual and their machine is part of the web.</p>
<p>As learning needs to be rethought so the roles of schools need to change &ndash; as the entry point for lifelong learning. Schools will need to be more open and learn through social networks (but where is the evidence for this?). Technology is advancing quickly but pedagogy does not develop and evolve at the same pace. We are left with trying to match old pedagogy to new technology. Equally there is a political need that must be part of the approach.</p>
<p>Alexander Khoroshilov: The next talk in Russian looked at the way that activities by UNESCO are having an influence in the region through IITE on Education for All, OER, Virtual Campuses and the development of guidelines on such things as using open and distance learning.&nbsp; There are a large range of publications available at <a href="http://www.unesco.org/en/education/">http://www.unesco.org/en/education/</a></p>
<p>There are plans for ICT Competence certification for teachers.</p>
<p>Doran Bernard: Spoke about statistical and survey work on five countries Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Russian Federation. The concerns that they had found show worries in <strong>all</strong> countries not just those with development needs. There are existing recommendations from EU and OECD that are trying to make teaching more attractive. Again actions tend to make sense regardless of the country or development state. While there is much good advice the plan is to carry out a 12 page survey to gain data direct from the five regions. They survey sounds like quite a lot of work with descriptive data being sought and ideas for the future. The approach seems to be about the current situation and so I wonder if there needs to be a more forward looking element in particular if there is an intention to look for innovation and change.</p>
<p>Fatma Abdullazade &ndash; presented the situation in Azaerbaijan and made some interesting points both that teachers should not be seen as engaged in &ldquo;transmission&rdquo; or having a desire to be &ldquo;digital natives&rdquo;. Past success from 50 years ago in addressing literacy has been let go too easily. The move to ICT has also brought in elements of political actions and the need to use funding from oil into education. This recent investment is starting to pay back and may lead to all pupils having computers. But that in itself does not solve anything. Recognising the cross over between home and school has potential &ndash; but only if the learner understands how to learn in this situation. All teachers know how to use computers &ndash; training is not the goal. The information environment is a natural educator. 5000 schools, 48 universities, but there is a gap in OER. The basis is there with unified exams linked to university entrance. However there remains the need for teachers to teach the &ldquo;magic&rdquo; of literature and appreciation at the heart of learning. As we adopt the wider resources there is no single model, while sometimes there is the assumption of an inevitable dominance of the &ldquo;American liberal model&rdquo;. Ireland is cited as an example of how a small island was able to work in the global age. Other examples of diverse approaches: Malaysia, Korea, Singapore. The post Soviet models need to come not from economics but from the education sector. The choice of good students of IT and business should also extend to teaching.</p>
<p>Aleksander Asmolov led with 25 years of reorganisation of the schools. While companies have developed the technology (cloud computing, web 2.0, &hellip;) but we need to take responsibility for the pedagogy. If there is a solution elsewhere then we should be prepared to adopt it.</p>
<p>A question asked was what is stopping innovation in pedagogic universities. The answer is that the time is now right for experiments.</p>
<p>Manuk Mkrtchyan: there is a need for face to face - even now with people looking at screens and listening to earpieces he personally finds it hard to talk. Meetings in his view are necessary and there will be an important one in 2012. He referred back to previous talks and the Bolshevik models of the past. This allows more radical approaches to learning groups rather than &ldquo;classes&rdquo; but individualisation is dangerous &ndash; it is ok to customise programmes but need to bring together for collective intelligence rather than individual. Using computers for individualisation could divide people, rather the focus needs to be on bringing people together under an holistic view. Homework changes under this view from individual to collective, while in school the individual can be supported &ndash; reversing the past position. Self management of learning is also enabled by the technology &ndash; provided the learner&rsquo;s role is supported. The focus needs to be on establishing a stable view of pedagogy and then ensure technology supports it rather than the other way around. First use innovation in educating teachers before expecting them to use it in their teaching; realise that the switch to online textbooks will not change things if the texts do not change &ndash; eTextbooks need to be created for the new system changing access is not enough; first create the framework and then use the technology.</p>
<p>Piotr Kuharchik: Belarus. Set out the aims in Belarus.</p>
<p>Dae Joon Hwang: ICT and teacher development in Korea. Included the impact of OER and the way in which that is changing the approach to teacher training. They have launched module based training programme which covers six elearning topics: these have been both popular and highly rated.</p>
<p>Guntis Vasilevskis (Latvia) played a snippet of Russian to show that it is possible to understand even foreign phrases &ndash; unfortunately I feel that I tuned it out and so did not do so myself. There is a mismatch between the training in ICT and the actual use of ICT in practice. Their approach also includes partnership work that enables visits to e.g. chemical works to allow direct experience.</p>
<p>Roumen Nikolov, Bulgaria, described the options for more global online operation: virtual campus, e-science and OER. Bulgaria is a relatively new member of the EU and taking part in several innovation project such as EU2020. He cited I*Teach, TENCompetence, Share.TEC, Open Archive, Atlas, Elica.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The opening remarks by Gennady BORDOVSKY were in Russian &ndash; but with simultaneous translation. His introduction led into UNESCO medals to Dendev Badarch and two colleagues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dendev switched to English to welcome us to St Petersburg and then back to Russian. He outlined the creation of UNESCO chairs in the area aof ICT in Education as one of the key actions. There is a theme of openness to one of the strands of the conference in order to address the limitations caused by copyright. UNESCO views education as one of the &ldquo;rights of the world&rdquo; and the way to build a knowledge society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bernard Cornu spoke on behalf of the governing body to thank those who have invited us here and organised. The role of IITE in supporting the use of ICT in accessing, learning and developing education and knowledge. This involves technical, pedagogical and political questions &ndash; all of which fit with the mission of IITE. IITE has been revitalised leading to this event, a range of publications and activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Representative of the Russian Federation: the need to involve all in education and research. Created the Russian Analytic approach involving competition for grants and prizes that link research and education.&nbsp; Problems remain of access, use and quality. Education resources need to be high quality and the structure and capabilities of those involved in the conference can help address these.</p>
<p>State rep for UNESCO. There is a large programme to provide access to online learning for schools. This needs to be backed up by development of teacher capability and resources. The plan for 2012/13 has 2 year priority to promote ICT access with a remit for access for all. There are also linked meetings and actions on sustainable development.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>His main theme is that the knowledge balance of costs has overtaken material costs &ndash; &ldquo;know how to produce is more valuable than the products themselves&rdquo; (Amidon, 1997)</p>
<p>OUNL has a range of projects across the six areas of OER needs: content (OpenER), search (Share.Tec), metadata (MACE), Delivery (iTunesU), prosumers (wikiwijs), Interoperability (iCoper).</p>
<p>Reflecting on OER Wim&rsquo;s main question to himself is why try to do this for free? His answers are around accumulation of knowledge &ndash; humans build on the past. Through data, information, knowledge and wisdom (Stonier, 1995) &ndash; the same item (e.g. e=mc^2) can be each of these to different people.</p>
<p>OER can fit in a matrix of syntactic/semantic and implicit/explicit knowledge in the simplest point (syntactic and implicit) but with suitable activity and community it can act in other ways &ndash; and that needs to be recognised.</p>
<p>But why free? This is in part down to digital artefacts having almost zero marginal cost. The almost zero though implies there is still some cost and so is micropricing a viable option? &nbsp;&ndash; but there is a big difference (the penny gap) between free and some cost in the number of users. Adding any cost gives a mental overhead that keeps users away.</p>
<p>How to operate for free then? &ndash; the secret is cross-funding. This can be by subsidies, charging other customers (free for children), expensive other products (freemium), shift revenues to the future (first times are free), exchange effort from customers (Google extracting behaviours from free users), non-monetary incentives such as reputation (blogs, Wikipedia, twitter), rock-concert model (Radiohead give away recording &ndash; charge for concerts), negative price model (pay for absence &ndash; fitness clubs no show charging)</p>
<p>The summary is: the content is half the story, experiential learning and tacit knowledge, don&rsquo;t charge for OER &ndash; think about cross-funding (freemium, user data, contributions), alternative incentives, and consider organising tantalising events .</p>]]></description>

              <title>Keynote: Raquel Xalabarder: Copyright laws and OER</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4735</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4735</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Raquel Xalabarder</p>
<p>Raquel&rsquo;s theme is copyright &ndash; defined as a way to encourage innovation. Her approach is to list all the things that we should know by saying &ldquo;I am not going to tell you&hellip;&rdquo; about the impact of laws, limitations, risks of non-copyright uses,</p>
<p>Interest of authors is not the only aspect &ndash; general rights and public interest can take priority and particularly in the academic world awareness is needed of &ldquo;statutorily exempted acts&rdquo; which allow fair use. The uncertainty around this does mean that playing safe may mean licences are bought.</p>
<p>However domestic laws are doing a poor job, international norms at EU levels attention is paid to educational use. Allowing educational and research use &ndash; that is then not reflected in the national laws (which often reflect lobbying).</p>
<p>WIPO &ndash; comparative study of domestic laws shows the need for much work to pay attention to the law on educational use.</p>
<p>Instead licencing is used to work with copyrighted material &ndash; but it does not solve the fundamental issues of the law and the material that is not explicitly licenced. Open licencing will only partly address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copyright maybe difficult but it has some good in it.&rdquo; It can foster creativity and only if we have sensible laws that recognise educational needs to avoid the trap of ending up in a licenced world rather than a legislated world.</p>
<p>Prof Lessig: Copyright should cover something less than it all &ndash; deal with what it needs to. The licenced commons does not equate to the public domain and so a broad exemption for education and sensibly limited terms will free up an give benefits to society alongside those of the author. The benefits of education are very apparent and can provide a good argument for change.</p>
<p>One of the first copyright laws &ndash; 1710. Required 9 copies of the printed books would be deposited with the (9) existing Universities of the United Kingdom. At that time copyright law was there to ensure that education could make use of the output of the authors.</p>
<p>Educational rights are for everyone and this is recognised at international level, author rights though dominate the domestic laws. An opportunity lies in the recognised need for a different approach for developing countries in the annex of the Berne convention &ndash; but not fully adopted. WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organisation) also considers the ways that IP can be sensibly enforced across the world. This is not best done though through bi-lateral agreements that impose the less than perfect copyright laws and harsh view of IP on other countries. Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) takes a territorial and enforcing approach that in attempting to replace fora with enforcement &ndash; but that needs good laws that are not there at the moment.</p>
<p>Access to culture and education in the law needs to enshrined in the law &ndash; so that copyright is no longer seen as a &ldquo;No entry&rdquo; sign but instead allows use for the benefit of society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Qs: US Patent law allows inventions to be declared public is that a good model?</p>
<p>A: That works in US law- but in the EU this is not possible and cannot be given away in a similar way.</p>
<p>Q: What is the right amount of time?</p>
<p>A: There should be variation &ndash; e.g. teaching material is additional to the main activity. Life plus 70 years is too long.</p>
<p>Q: Universities are producers as well as consumers</p>
<p>A: True but need to recognise the use rights more strongly</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Live blogging, 13:30 - OU conference Day 2</p>
<p><strong>Talk by Doug Clow</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://ispot.org.uk/">iSpot  - Your place to share nature</a></strong></p>
<p>Doug starts by saying that (iSpot. org.uk)&nbsp; helps people to identify their  observations of nature. One can take a photo and upload it to the iSpot website,  saying what they think it is (where they saw it etc). If someone thinks it's  something else, they can identify it too. Once&nbsp;the user&nbsp;gets the confirmation of  the identification, then&nbsp;they can learn more about it - in depth information of  other observations people made about the same thing . There is a web page for  every species in iSpto, aggregating all the available content&nbsp; (including  Wikipedia) about the species of the whole world.</p>
<p>At iSpot, after making an identification, the user can see who else agrees  with it. And the individual identifiers are 'ranked' in a reputation system at  the website. Once the user makes an observation and gets feedback,&nbsp;they can  build a portfolio of pictures (as more people agree with your observation) , it  increases&nbsp; their reputation in the website. Observatiosn can be of birds, plants  etc.</p>
<p>Many people who use iSpot also take a short OU course if they wish  (Neighbourhood Nature 5159). This leads to accreditation - it's a 10-point  course. iSpot has a partnership with BBC Radio 4, helping broadcasting the  project and enabling access to 'nature experts' . iSpot is Lottery funded, and  targets under-represented groups.</p>
<p>Users give lots of &nbsp;positive feedback&nbsp;about iSpot - they like the community  of people with knowledge and enthusiasm. People say "I can't go outside now  without 'seeing' things!". 130,000 visits to the site.</p>
<p>A good user story is that a 6-year old girl spotted a moth - Euonymus Leaf  Notcher ( a rare moth in Europe). It was its first observation in the UK. That  discovery was highly publicised in newspapers etc. iSpot counts on  collaborations with a number of specialist societies.</p>
<p>Participatory Learning: research driven by the work on iSpot (Clow,  Makryannis and De Liddo). Participatory Learning is a rich way of using new  online media, Doug argues, as it is in line with&nbsp;the OU mission of inclusive  education.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/fundraising/current-priorities/heat.php">HEAT:  Health Education and Training in Africa </a></p>
<p><strong>Talk by Alison Robinson (programme coordinator)</strong></p>
<p>Challenges in Africa:&nbsp; high incidence of maternal and child mortality,</p>
<p>Live blogging, 2pm - Conference Day 2</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS&nbsp;, TB and malaria increasing, critical shortage of health workers,  inadequate facilities and equipment. In Africa there's 900 maternal deaths per  1000,000 births. Africa has 11% of the world's population.</p>
<p>HEAT helps to address critical health workers shortage. The strengths of the  HEAT program are that it delivers significant impact for relatively small  investment, and it has the potential to train hundreds of thousands of health  workers. HEAT materials can be delivered in print, online or disk.</p>
<p>The pilot country of HEAT is Ethiopia. One of the reasons is that all  post-secondary education and training in Ethiopia is taught in English. Total  population is around 81 million, of which 84% live in rural communities. Every  year around 21000 Ethiopian women die due to complication of pregancy or  childbirth. It is a country of contrasts.</p>
<p>The health extension workers in Ethiopia are paid a small salary by the  Ministry of Health.&nbsp; They need to be female, speak local language and basic  English, amongst other things. Health Extension Workers' initial training need  to be upgraded to overcome the deficiencies in their initial training, and also  because the workers are keen to have a career path. The HEAT training is  provided by distance education. Restrictions on classroom capacity and  availability of teachers would take more than 10 years to upgrade 31,000 health  education workers.&nbsp; Distance learning can be completed between 18-24 months.</p>
<p>HEAT will be an online knowledge bank of training materials, both in text and  in multimedia form, delivered as OER . It will also include self-assessment  questions, resources and toolkits with case-studies etc.</p>
<p>HEAT has the support of the Ministries of Health and Education in Ethiopia,  funded by the Allan and Nesta Ferguson Trust. There will be 16 distance  e-learning modules, each one assessed by means of a tutor-marked assignment. The  first 4 out of 16 modules are being prepared and are&nbsp;due for completion be end  of July.</p>
<p>Challenges: some authors are experiencing difficulties in writing in a second  language. They are also leanring the methodology of distance learning.</p>
<p>Alison says that the work in Ethiopia has been enourmously rewarding.</p>
<p>HEAT beyond Ethiopia: all modules will be free to download. Conversations are  taking place to localise the content to Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana and Zambia.&nbsp;  Modules are adaptable also outside Africa.</p>
<p>HEAT vision: to create a consortium of countries and organisatiosn working  together aiming to tackle social inequalities in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Wikipedia @&nbsp; the OU Conference 2010 </strong></p>
<p>Live blogging, 3:30 pm</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://aisantos.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/600px-wikipedia-logo-svg.png"></a><a href="http://aisantos.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/wikipedia-logo.jpg"><img title="wikipedia-logo" src="http://aisantos.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/wikipedia-logo.jpg?w=249" alt="" width="249" height="300" /></a>Openness  in Education: Talk by Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy starts by &nbsp;explaining that&nbsp;at Wikipedia it is not necessarily the case  that anyone can edit everything - there's a specific group of contributors that  edit, monitor and make the content available to the world. He also explains that  there is no relationship between Wikipedia and Wikiversity.</p>
<p>Jimmy discusses a little bit about the history and scale of Wikipedia. It was  ' the great experiment', he says, being the core idea to create a global  encyclopedia supported by volunteers. The vision statement is that every single  person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge .  Wikipedia is&nbsp;defined by Jimmy as &nbsp;"a free and high quality encyclopedia written  by thousands of volunteers in many languages". Neutrality&nbsp;and quality are  extremely important at Wikipedia. He argues that a minimum level of reliability  is necessary for the encyclopedia to be respected and popular. It is managed by  a series of community processes and control. At Wikipedia the idea of neutrality  has been the core : the firm rule is that there's a neutral point of view.  Wikipedia does not take a stand on any controversial issue - the reader is free  to make their own judgement .</p>
<p>What is free access? At Wikipedia it's first freedom of speech. The texts and  the software of Wikipedia are all free. He argues that Wikipedia is not  necessarily the most helpful format of information for the students to learn  with- but everything there can be repurposed in many different ways. Wikipedia  is an encyclopedia, which means that not everything belongs to Wikipedia. IT  offers a summary of the human knowledge with the depth of the material depending  on the subject.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a charity supported by donations, the average size for donation  is about $30 (dollars), but there is obviously big funding coming from the big  players, as Google etc, says Jimmy. The core of the donations however is made by  small donours. Over 275 million people visit Wikipedia every month. Funding at  Wikipedia happens organically, he says, not necessarily 'top-down'.</p>
<p>There's about 100,00 active contributors to Wikipedia,a ll volunteers. The  site is global. There are more than 3 million entries in English, but more than  500 million entries in other languages. There are 308,000+ articles in Chinese  alone, but it's small relative to the number of Chinese speakers that are  online. Wikipedia was banned in China for over 3 years. The Chinese government  has losen up in many ways, and now Wikipedia is generally available in China,  but certain pages are banned (e.g. some things about Tibet, the independence of  Taiwan etc). It's the 53rd most popular website in China. Jimmy says that they  would like to be more popular in China, and that it's fast growing over  there.&nbsp;Wikipedia has caused a cultural impact in China, he argues.</p>
<p>Wikipedia allows for Global content comparisons. In different parts of the  world, certain content can be more or less popular. Ex. 'Sex' is popular in  every language except French and Spanish. There are certain topics that are  equally popular, such as Star Trek and&nbsp;Star Wars...</p>
<p>Question: what's next for Wikipedia? In the short term, Jimmy explains that  the three priorities for them are: 1. quality (in the large languages, e.g.  English, instead of adding more, improving quality), 2. Growth in the developing  world (by running pilot projects ), 3. Usability (the software is not as  user-friendly as they would like it to be).</p>
<p>Question: Many educators are asking students to create Wikipedia pages, what  are your views on that? Answer: sometimes excited, sometimes not as much. It  depends on how the project is structured - quality is needed, and this usually  happens when the students are given appropriate background.</p>
<p>Question: How has been quality control over the years, and how have you dealt  with that? Answer: Several phases related to quality control, the most famous  quality problem beying vandalism.However, this is the problem we have&nbsp;lots  of&nbsp;hands on. Issues of bias for example, related to less popular and  controversial topics (e.g. Palestine, scientology etc). These articles are  closely monitored and are of high quality. More obscure topics (that people do  not care about much), are also problematic, because there are not &nbsp;many people  monitoring them. We are trying to get a system in which we can go through the  less popular topics, and that's a challenge for the future, I think - says  Jimmy.</p>
<p>Question: how is consensus generated? Answer: there's a pretty informal  mechanism to reach consensus, but it's mostly based on the issue of neutrality,  as I mention before. We developed some techniques over the years, as for  example, mentioning many different sides of the same story.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a very innovative way of sharing content, and it was an  insightful talk by Jimmy Wales.</p>]]></description>

              <title>E-learning Africa 2010: Using, Sharing and Repurposing OER</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3994</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3994</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>E-learning Africa &nbsp;2010 was held in Lusaka, Zambia, from 25th-28th May. There were over 1700 participants, and delegates had a varied professional background: local school teachers, lecturers, researchers, politicians and staff of various Ministries in Africa (education, health, international relations etc). The conference had therefore a number of different strands and dozens of parallel sessions to choose from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here I include a link to a blog post that I wrote about the conference at <a href="http://aisantos.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/e-learning-africa-using-sharing-and-repurposing-oer/">Open Content Online</a>, which contains an account of the conference, some photos and the power point slides that I used in my presentation (presentation also embedded below). I focused on the subject of copyright and licensing of educational materials, and showcased some experiences &nbsp;of the OU UK with sharing resources internationally through <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn">OpenLearn</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of my visit to Zambia, however, was the visit I paid to Aisha Project School. It is a community School (not supported by the government) in which there is a huge effort to include ICT use in the regular teaching practices of the school. Part of this effort is supported by the <a href="http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/centres/cce/projects/ictzambia/">OER4Schools </a>Project, funded by Cambridge University UK. The aim of the project is to help adopting and enhancing ICT use in the school by using enquiry-based learning. In summary and very simplistically, enquiry-based learning usually starts with a scenario, facilitated by a tutor, and the students are encouraged to come up with their own issues and questions. It is interesting to see how this type of pedagogy has been used with open education resources at Aisha Project School. To know more about their experience, please watch the interview with Mr Brighton Lubasi, Aisha ICT Manager and volunteer teacher.</p>
<p>I considered E-learning Africa to be a very interesting event, as it brought examples of practices in many fields in e-learning, to include mobile learning and a number of projects which &nbsp;explore the use of sports (e.g. football, World cup event etc) to capture the students' attention to learn new concepts (e.g. physics) and develop &nbsp;number of skills (e.g. confidence, team building, vision etc).</p>
<p>The info gathered at E-learning Africa about the use of OER contributes to the pool of information that we at <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/edit/olnet.org">OLnet</a> are putting together in an attempt to create an international landscape of OER practices ( examples, barriers and enablers) - coming soon here in Cloudworks.&nbsp;</p>

I teach on A215, which is taught online except for two day schools. My hope was that this video would personalise the experience a bit more for the students, as well as reinforcing some key information at the start of the course.

<p>This particular presentation has had a number of iterations because of technical issues, which has been a good learning experience for a number of people.&nbsp; For the moment I am adding the presentations but I will come back and add a description of what was done and how.</p>
<p>Comments from Janet "I'd like to make a contribution to this conference.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;a collaborative wiki-based&nbsp;activity I have deleloped for our Evolution course (S366).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the link to teh wiki with&nbsp;the live activity is&nbsp;currently being used by S366 students, so it will only be available to those with access to the course website."</p>
<p>"Instead I have made my contribution a powerpoint presentation with video clips and sound which plays automatically, and I have uploaded it to slideshare. However, when I try to view it there, none of the video clips or the sound plays."</p>
<p>"My version of Powerpoint is 2003, as installed on my OU laptop.&nbsp; The camera, microphone with which the clips were recorded were all done with borrowed equipment on someone else's computer in the Regional Centre" (logitech quick cam software set up on Windows XP&nbsp;desktop PC with headphones and mouthpiece).</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>We propose that one of the barriers to adoption of Open Educational Resources (OERs) in common teaching practices is the lack of transparency of practitioners&rsquo; &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; around the production and consumption of those resources.</p>
<p>Thefore we propose to move from a paradigm of <em>opening up contents</em> and OER to a paradigm of <em>opening up people&rsquo;s thinking about OERs</em>.</p>
<p>Our objective is to make this thinking visible and exportable in a way that support the emergence of collective intelligence around OER. To cater for this we designed <a href="http://cohere.open.ac.uk/">Cohere</a>, a first prototype socio-technical infrastructure to gather Collective Intelligence around OER.</p>
<p>You can explore more these concepts by looking at the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AnnaDeLiddo/edmedia2010-de-liddo">PPT presentation</a> embedded here below. This is a presentation  for Ed-Media 2010 Conference, http://www.aace.org/conf/edmedia/, to be  held in Toronto, Canada, June 29 &ndash;July 2, 2010.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about <a href="http://cohere.open.ac.uk/">Cohere</a> you can also watch the movie, embedded here below, from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKykgBo-zGI&feature=player_embedded">submission to the Mozzilla Firefox Competition 2009: Jetpack for Learning</a>.

<p><strong>Part of the <a href="http://olnet.org/" target="_blank">OLnet Project</a>'s mission is to investigate the   socio-technical infrastructure that will assist the Open Education movement in pooling   its "</strong><a href="http://olnet.org/node/102"><strong>collective   intelligence</strong></a><strong>". <br /></strong></p>
OLnet seeks to advance the movement's collective intelligence by   pooling the many different layers of evidence, that currently exist in   disconnected forms, on the use, reuse and unerstanding of Open Educational Resources. We are therefore considering a collective intelligence infrastructure as one way to:   
<ul>
<li>Invite your stories, informal feedback, or formal evaluation results   concerning a particular Open Educational Resource</li>
<li>Invite your inside knowledge of how the Open Educational Resource was designed (<strong>OER   Design Methods</strong>)</li>
<li>Invite your experiences and insights on tackling major challenges   facing the Open Education movement (<strong>OER Grand Challenges</strong>, e.g.   Organisational Obstacles, Remixing, IP Clearance...)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We invite feedback on the design storyboard of the Collective Intelligence infrastructure (please watch the video embedded here below).<br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions for you are therefore...</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>What do you think of this design storyboard?<br /> </em></li>
<li><em>What would make these widgets 'killer apps' for you?</em><br /> ...so that you'd want to have these on your website, e.g. as an OER   educator, learner, publisher, remixer, researcher, funder...? Depending   on which hat(s) you wear, you might ask yourself:<br /> <em>What would I  like to know about an OER before deciding to use it  to learn, or teach  with?<br /> What would I like to know about the state of the art in a  given  debate, before deciding whether to enter it, or fund work on it?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Many thanks,</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>We would like to build up a suggested reading list for academics who  are new to OER and would welcome suggestions in this cloud either as  comments or links below.</strong></p>
<p>SCORE is a HEFCE-funded project (2009-2012) based at The Open University supporting individuals, projects, institutions and programmes within higher education in England who are engaged in creating, sharing and using open educational resources (OER). As well as publishing its own OER content, SCORE has a fellowship scheme, offers support and advice, mentors UK OER projects, offers events and online community support.<br /><br />A central part of SCORE is its fellowship scheme. SCORE expect to fund 36 fellowship projects between 2010 and 2012 with two thirds drawn from outside the OU. Fellows work is expected to inform, influence and impact on OER policy and practice across the higher education sector. Projects may be &lsquo;stand-alone&rsquo; or involve collaborations with other fellowship projects to address important themes in OER activity.<br /><br />Based flexibly at the OU in Milton Keynes, fellows can draw on the OU&rsquo;s expertise in creating, sharing and using OER. They will receive support from the SCORE team, mentors and the OU&rsquo;s OER fellowship community (which includes Open Learning Network (OLnet) international fellows).&nbsp; This reading list will be a useful resource not only for SCORE and OLnet fellows but also an open resource for anyone who is interested in finding out more about OER.<br /><br />For more information about SCORE: <a href="http://www8.open.ac.uk/score/" target="_blank">http://www8.open.ac.uk/score/</a><br />For more information about OLnet: <a href="http://olnet.org/" target="_blank">http://olnet.org/</a></p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Tim Unwin (UNESCO Chair in ICT for Development at Royal Holloway)</p>
<p>A recorded presentation of the way in which OER can influence development &ndash; leading with the issue of why OER is not more widely used in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa where there are significant initiatives).&nbsp; Content and licences as the meaning of OER is not enough in his view the need is to address &ldquo;open integrated learning contexts&rdquo; and the African crafting of &ldquo;knowledges&rdquo;. Co-creating new knowledges. There are several perceived benefits cited on the UNESC OER Wiki but the reality in Africa is that much is led from North America and Europe. On the UNESCO discussion less than18% African (mainly South Africa). Similarly the stories on the OER Wiki and projects on WikiEducator are predominantly non-African implying that there is an imperialist push to content.</p>
<p>Perceived needs in Africa reflect lack of content, high cost of books, poor quality teaching, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of understanding of benefits of technologies.</p>
<p>His own experience coves several projects leading to the ICT3D Collective. In each case trying to build shared capacities in using ICTs in educational delivery.&nbsp; He was self-critical about the impact of some of this work &ndash; tagging content and trying to make it available for different platforms has had limited impact. Though work on African Storytelling has been more successful. With good intentions though why has success been so limited.</p>
<p>Often blamed:</p>
<ul>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bandwidth</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electricity</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; computers</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cost of software</li>
</ul>
<p>But these are not the real issues. Rather:</p>
<ul>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes in personnel &ndash; key importance of leaders</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Funding mechanisms</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time commitment</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to understand meanings &ndash; more than just computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>So need to recognise practical realities:</p>
<ul>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the structure and financing of African universities</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; didactic model of teaching</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; role and income of university teachers</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intellectual elitism &ndash; to serve development needs</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dependency (on grants)</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; human capacity</li>
<li>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dominance of individualism</li>
</ul>
<p>There are ways forward though in building more sustained work in Africa, but also in actions that need to be taken in working with OER in UK: does it match to the direction that UK education is developing? Do we use OER ourselves? Are they of good enough quality? Can we find the time that is need to work with and learn from Africa.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Oxford OER examples: OpenSpire</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3400</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3400</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Peter Robinson led off a session demonstrating the OER work from Oxford University.&nbsp; The OpenSpires work had the dual aims of making talks and lectures available as OER, and to share the institutional implications of that work.. This built on the successful release of content by Oxford on iTunesU with &gt;3million downloads. The iTunesU licence limits to &ldquo;personal use&rdquo; which is more restrictive than desirable. Content across all topics and different types &ndash; with success in recording student-tutor discussions. Examples shown from publc speakers (Gordon Brown), museum collections, straight lectures, illustrated lectures, &hellip; . The central podcasting service used a role out approach to bring in self-recordings as well as supported recordings.&nbsp; Aim to minimise the time required &ndash; ideally to the time the event takes. Overall a syndication approach has been taken with the vision that eventually an ensemble of content from different providers can be constructed.</p>
<p>Reasons to share: personal, reputation, altruism, reward. The contributions should be sustainable as impact is fairly high.</p>
<p>Examples included:</p>
<p>a Philosophy lecturer (Marianne Talbot) who released a podcast of a lecture that then became the global No.1 on iTunesU. Making her possibly the &ldquo;most heard philosopher in the world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>An Art historian (Martin Kemp) described a seminar on how to validate whether or not a Leonardo Da Vinci manuscript is in fact genuine. Important to him was to be able to release his content with the implied quality of the Oxford University and also to then lead into further funding from the Gates Foundation. His own personal profile as a speaker, writer and broadcaster is supported by the free availability of his work.</p>
<p>Tristram Wyatt described how existing work on online study skills from Oxford and South Africa to be openly available and adaptable. The switch to having a changeable resource made them more useful. The investment in the content was fairly high compared to podcasts which has restricted how they have been able to go beyond an initially funded activity.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Q: Considering OER content subject areas and types &ndash; what is most popular, what works well?</p>
<p>A: Jan &ndash; European Schoolnet has considered this around sharing resources and have looked at what travels well across borders. Their findings include the more visual that text based, science over humanities. This data is at school level however.</p>
<p>A: Andy &ndash; surprisingly varied. E.g current top 10 includes law, Welsh history, polymer engineering. Reasons also vary &ndash; topicality, links to courses, promotion, regional difference. Also difficult to track use that does not happen on site.</p>
<p>A: Oxford iTunesU data &ndash; e.g. entrepeneurship material. Science Enterprise took off tremendously &ndash; but not for obvious reasons. Brought benefits to the Business School through open availability.</p>
<p>A: Visual approach has attracted many people and encouraged creativity.</p>
<p>Q: Sara from Strategic Content Alliance. Is the user generated content monitored in any way?</p>
<p>A: Andy &ndash; we do not do any monitoring. The split site approaches allows more experimental approach in LabSpace.</p>
<p>Q: Melissa Highton &ndash; are there examples of local initiatives that offered training and incentives?</p>
<p>A: Jan &ndash; not much to say on training. For incentives &ndash; he has heard that MIT staff have used the OER as a factor in demonstrating pedagogic skills in an open and measured way for salary negotiation.</p>
<p>A: Andy &ndash; The Open University has used the student feedback in courses for reward and recognition. OER provide another factor that is more transferable to campus-based intitutions.</p>
<p>Q: Sheila Webber from Sheffield. There are individual motivations for publishing OER rather than institutional. Particularly hard to motivate reuse.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Giving Knowledge for Free: Jan Hylen</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3397</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3397</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Coming in via video-conferencing to talk about the work that he carried out for the OECD to produce the &ldquo;Giving Knowledge for Free&rdquo; report.&nbsp; (Some initial difficulties hit the presentation of the slides but soon sorted out.)</p>
<p>The basis for the work was recognising the &ldquo;new culture of openness in HE&rdquo; through open source software, open access, open educational resources. The study reported in 2007 looked at the activities through 4 dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>IPR issues</li>
<li>Cost/benefits (sustainability)</li>
<li>Incentives</li>
<li>How to improve access and usefulness</li>
</ol>
<p>Used the OER definition derived by UNESCO with a broad view of OER as including the tools, repositories and different scales of content. A broad definition is appropriate to be inclusive of new actions that are hard to predict.</p>
<p>Drivers for OER can be divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technological (bandwidth, capacity, improved software)</li>
<li>Social (digital natives, desire for interactivity, willingness to share, communities and collaborations).</li>
<li>Economic (lower costs, free hosting, models for monetising user created content)</li>
<li>Legal (Creative Commons licensing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Survey based approach to mapping the field had limited success when targeting universities directly with better indication from an open survey that could be completed by enthusiastic individuals. The result though cannot be seen as authoritative.</p>
<p>OER were targeted at post-secondary instructors, students and general public. The barrierless approach meant data was limited.</p>
<p>Types of initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publicly/institutionally backed e.g.s: OCW/OpenLearn/OpenSpires</li>
<li>Community approach: Open Course, Common Content, Free Curricula Center, &hellip;</li>
<li>In between (hybrid) models: MERLOT, Connexions, ARIADNE.</li>
</ul>
<p>The initiatives can be mapped on dimensions from small to big and institutional to community.</p>
<p>The report in 2007 was followed up in 2008 with a short study of six key initiatives that showed rapid increase in resources, visitors and diversity (languages and global use). The trends were towards less text and more video. And from individual enthusiasts to management adoption and institution recognition.</p>
<p>The US based data from MIT and Tufts implied users were well-educated, self-learners, from North America (note 57% were non-US visits and so no longer so likely to be true).</p>
<p>Use by learners was often as a supplement, in small chunks. Use by educators was limited by lack of time, skills and reward system.</p>
<p>A table of motivations reflected government (expanding access), institutional (altruism, sharing for improvement, attracting students) and individual reasons (supporting community, non-monetary gain, no reason not to go open).</p>
<p>Challenges remain quality, IPR, etc. For example quality can be centralised or decentralised, open or closed. IPR raises practical difficulties such as creative commons use of the non-commercial clause and what it means.</p>
<p>A sustainability checklist was produced to help guide towards sustainability &ndash; linking to grants, other activity (charge for extra content, paper versions), membership models. The contributor pays.</p>
<p>Policy implications at the institutional level reflect the &ldquo;risk of doing nothing&rdquo; and the need to have an IT strategy that recognises Open Access and OER, addressing the training and support and incentives for people to use and produce OER.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Andy Lane.</p>
<p>Content, Collaboration and Innovation: Past, Present and Future. OER can be considered as an extension of how universities have gone beyond their borders &ndash; with outreach. Andy reviewed the motivations that The Open University had for becoming involved in OER &ndash; movement, commitment to social justice, reputation, formal/informal cross-over, test-bed, sharing in as well as out (perhaps reducing costs), and a basis for collaboration.</p>
<p>The three space approach of OpenLearn &ndash; route in and information, safe space for learning (LearningSpace), more experimental &ldquo;educator space&rdquo; (LabSpace) is changing to bring in the many other pieces of content that reaches out from the OU &ndash; the OU/BBC open2.net, iTunesU, YouTube, Facebook and SCORE. With an additional outward looking research network provided by OLnet.</p>
<p>LearningSpace &ndash; has allowed OU to develop experience with offering a direct learning environment for open resources (based on Moodle) and how working with content in XML has provided freedom for the user to choose the format that they need if downloading, and the environment plus additional tools the opportunity to learn with the content <em>in situ</em>. Findings are that &ldquo;content is the hook&rdquo; with the OpenLearn proving flexibility for trying content out and building their own mix and match set that interests them as individuals.</p>
<p>Now nearly 10m unique visitors &ndash; of whom 126,000 have registered. 60,000 download &ldquo;print&rdquo; versions every month. But remains difficult to assess the value &ndash; with some clear examples emerging (eg Daniel Conn Time Online) and indications of recruitment through to the Open University and bothThere are also examples of the content being reworked into new forms and delivered through alternative platforms.</p>
<p>Looking forward &ndash; the lasting result of OpenLearn has been to encourage Open Innovation. There are now many different projects and activity, with new links to collaboration and new plans for the way the site works.</p>

<p>Melissa described the work on OpenSpires supported by the JISC/HEA programme &ndash; this has built on approach to podcasting, using open source platforms and sharing content but with more specific attention paid to the openness and suitable licensing for reuse. In particular using creative commons.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Working with Open Educational Resources raises many questions: How to take part? What benefits does it bring? Which content works best for the users? Is education changing around the use of OER? How can we recognise what is happening and share what we know? &hellip;</p>
<p>At this stage these questions seem to divide into how best that those working on OER can join together and sustain the provision of free content as part of what the education sector does. And the strongly related issue of how can learners and organisations make the best use of free resources to help people participate and gain from the learning experience.</p>
<p>The Research table for a Birds of a Feather lunch will give a chance for discussion around what we should be researching and those ideas that are good to share. And also of course a chance to eat lunch!</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summary: Part of the <a href="http://olnet.org" target="_blank">OLnet Project</a>'s mission is to investigate the  socio-technical infrastructure that will assist the movement in pooling  its "</strong><a href="http://olnet.org/node/102"><strong>collective  intelligence</strong></a><strong>". We invite feedback from all members  of the OER community on the design storyboard introduced below...</strong></p>
<p>At this week's <a href="http://cmi2.yale.edu/hewlett_conference_2010/">OER conference</a> at Yale University, Hewlett Foundation grantees are considering many  of the big issues, which will be a valuable source of input into our  emerging CI infrastructure.</p>
<p>This cloud shadows the 'birds of a feather' Friday lunchtime&nbsp; session to discuss the design concept we storyboard in the slides and  movie below, but we invite feedback from all members of OER community  via this page...</p>
<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><a title="OER Collective Intelligence storyboard" href="http://www.slideshare.net/sbs/oer-collective-intelligence-storyboard-3612188"></a></strong>So, the idea is that working with you, OLnet develops some  "widgets" (attractive little apps you can embed in your OER website),  which enable us to crowdsource input from the community. These are  channelled back to the OLnet website which pools the data, generates  aggregate views, offers recommendations of related people and resources  to your interests, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What would these widgets do?</strong></p>
<p>OLnet seeks to advance the movement's collective intelligence by  pooling the many different layers of evidence that currently exist in  disconnected forms. We are therefore considering widgets as one way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite your stories, informal feedback, or formal evaluation results  concerning a particular OER (<strong>OER Impact</strong>)</li>
<li>Invite your inside knowledge of how the OER was designed (<strong>OER  Design Methods</strong>)</li>
<li>Invite your experiences and insights on tackling major challenges  facing the movement (<strong>OER Grand Challenges</strong>, e.g.  Organisational Obstacles, Remixing, IP Clearance...)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions for you are therefore...</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em>What do you think of this design storyboard?<br /> </em></li>
<li><em>What would make these widgets 'killer apps' for you?</em><br /> ...so that you'd want to have these on your website, e.g. as an OER  educator, learner, publisher, remixer, researcher, funder...? Depending  on which hat(s) you wear, you might ask yourself:<br /> <em>What would I like to know about an OER before deciding to use it  to learn, or teach with?<br /> What would I like to know about the state of the art in a given  debate, before deciding whether to enter it, or fund work on it?</em></li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>OpenSpires is the Oxford University OER initiative sponsored by JISC and HEFCE, from May 2009 to April 2010. The aim of the initiative is twofold: 1) to provide the University's audio and video resources available online for free to a wide audience and 2) to enable the institution to investigate the impact and implications of making its resources available as OER.</p>
<p>Like most UK institutions, Oxford also licenses their content under the Creative Commons License,&nbsp;<a style="color: #0066ff; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: initial;" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/">BY-NC-SA</a>.

              <title>Analysing communicative action in institutions: where the cultural historical shapes the interactional  </title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3063</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Abstract: Analysing communicative action in institutions: where the cultural historical shapes the interactional This presentation is concerned with the way which we understand and investigate the relationship between human functioning and social setting. It deploys post Vygotskian theory which attempts to account for the social <br />formation of mind mediated by artefacts understood as cultural historical products and Bernsteinian theory (e.g. Bernstein, 2000) which seeks to forge analytical linkages between structure, communication and consciousness. As I have noted elsewhere much of the sociocultural or Activity Theory research&nbsp; that claims a Vygotskian root <br />fails to fully articulate an appropriate&nbsp; theory of social structure and an account of&nbsp; how it directs and deflects the attention of the individuals it constrains&nbsp; and enables (Daniels, 2008,1). The central argument of this presentation draws on the work of Bernstein and Vygotsky. A novel approach to the study of the mutual shaping of human action and institutional settings is developed and an empirical example of its application is <br />presented and discussed. The research reported here is drawn from a 4 year ESRC TLRP funded study of professional learning in and for interagency working in Children&rsquo;s Services in England. The talk will describe and discuss an approach to the analysis of innovatory learning as a sequential and contingent process that takes place across many workspaces and over an extended period of time.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Anne Edwards on the development of relational agency in professional practices</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3055</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3055</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Abstract</p>
<p>It takes as its starting point a view of practices as knowledge-laden and emotionally freighted sites of purposeful and expert activity. Arguments therefore draw on cultural historical analyses of activities, practices and the institutions that shape them. Relational agency in inter-professional activities is a capacity for fluid and responsive work. It involves working with others to recognise and respond to what matters for each profession in complex professional tasks. It is seen to be mediated by common knowledge which is built in interactions at the points where the boundaries of practices intersect. The focus will be the development of common knowledge, described by Carlile (2004: 557) as a capacity to 'represent the differences now of consequence and the ability of the actors involved to use it', at the sites of intersecting practices. The argument, supported by evidence from four recent studies of interprofessional work, is that building and using common knowledge is an important feature of the relational expertise required for working across the practice boundaries on complex tasks.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>A new cloudscape has been created to make commenting on individual contributions easier.&nbsp; Please see </strong><a href="/cloudscape/view/2128"><strong>http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2128</strong></a><strong>&nbsp; for a a full list of contributions and links to clouds for each one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>See below for the original call</strong></p>
<p>Want to contribute something about your project, work or research to the OU conference taking place online on 22 to 23 June 2010? We'd love to have it! Unlike previous conferences where papers are selected, we want non-paper based contributions and we accept anything (as long as it's relevant and not rude).</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>First create a digital artefact for us and upload it somewhere - some examples formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://slideshare.net">Slideshare</a> presentation</li>
<li><a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> video</li>
<li><a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> photos</li>
<li>Another Cloud in Cloudworks</li>
</ul>
<p>But you may choose another format (eg an <a href="http://xtranormal.com">Xtranormal</a> movie).</p>
<p>Then post your link below in the comments. If it is an embeddable format (eg YouTube), then I will add it in to this cloud, so all the content is visible here, and if not I'll add it as a link.</p>
<p>In the conference programme we have four discussion sessions where hopefully we can draw on these inputs. To have your contribution considered for inclusion in the main programme the <strong>deadline is 16 June</strong>.</p>
<p>We'd love to hear about your project and for you to help us explore the concept, perspectives and issues around openness in education.</p>
<p>You need to be registered in Cloudworks to submit content.&nbsp; The details of the overall conference are in the cloudscape: <a href="/cloud/view/2994">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2012</a>&nbsp;and the programme is in the cloud: <a href="/cloud/view/2994">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2994</a>.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2777</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2777</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>A culture of sharing and building more context around OERs were among the key and core tasks that are perceived as critical to meeting the needs of students, according to forty leaders in open education and technology who met in Barcelona on October 19-20, 2009, at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://openedtech.org/">Open EdTech Summit</a> sponsored by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.uoc.edu/">Open University of Catalunya</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmc.org/">New Media Consortium. </a></p>
<p><em>Creating the university of the future</em> was the title of the summit and the question is how and whether Open Educational Resources (OERs) are also examples of creative use of Web 2.0 in a higher education context.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://oet.wiki.nmc.org/CallToAction">Call to Action summarizes</a> the major findings of the 2009 Open EdTech Summit; Of those, point 5 is of particular interest:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Content producers and users alike must embrace strategies (reflective blogging, metadata, documentation of process, visualization of learning, etc.) for linking content generation to "pedagogical wraparounds" that embed context within effective learning practices. Such strategies would ensure that the focus remains on learning objectives and process, rather than on the technology used to deliver the learning materials.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What tools, platforms and environments are available and have been a success thus far in this respect? </li>
<li>What are the barriers for embedding such context? </li>
<li>technical literacies, time commitments? </li>
<li>what are the ways to inter-connect pedagogies around OER use? </li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RPfnnF7Plk">In this video</a> Professor Andy Lane of the Open University UK introduces the idea of Supported Open Teaching. IT proposes a move from an individualistic and solitary teaching activity to a more collaborative one, involving a range of professionals: e.g. other teachers, media specialists and curriculum designers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supported Open Teaching is a perspective that complements the well-known Supported Open Learning pedagogy of the OU UK, and is geared towards the use of OER.</p>
<p>But the question is: How can we support "Supported Open Teaching"? Practical ideas are welcome...</p><p>Contact details: Andreia Santos - a.i.santos@open.ac.uk</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>OLnet &amp; OER: How do our practices reflect and inform the&nbsp;world out there?</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the OLnet pilot virtual workshop. The aim of this workshop is to serve as a test bed for the OLnet team and guests on how to run a virtual workshop on OER (structure, tools, activities etc).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week we aim to use the <a href="http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=UNESCO_OER_Toolkit">UNESCO OER Toolkit</a>, the <a href="http://www.wikieducator.org/OER_Handbook/educator">OER Handbook</a> and the <a href="/cloud/view/2745 ">OpenLearn&nbsp;Research &nbsp;Report</a>&nbsp;as sources of information to prompt our discussions and reflections.</p>
<p>The plan is for us to reflect upon our own practices and discuss the ways in which we can better serve the OER community through our research, at the same time drawing on the community needs to drive our work.</p>
<p>The workshop runs from the 7th-11th Dec 2009, entirely online and counting on both synchronous and asynchronous activities and events. The&nbsp;workshop&nbsp;takes place&nbsp;mostly&nbsp; on <a href="/">Cloudworks</a>, and the activities and discussions will be released day by day. Please refer to the section "<a href="/cloud/view/2728">A. Programme</a>" on&nbsp; Cloudworks everytime you want to know what is going on. Alternatively, visit the '<a href="http://olnet.org/workshops">Workshops</a>'&nbsp;area of the <a href="http://olnet.org/">OLnet website</a>. In there you can access the programme and have a look at the '<a href="http://olnet.org/node/166">Noticeboard</a>' to get all the latest information and news about the event.</p>
<p>The <a href="/cloud/view/2728">pre-virtual workshop activities</a> are designed to help you get grips with technology we will use prior to the workshop, and also to get to know each other better. In case you have any questions about the virtual workshop or tools, please email me anytime at <a href="mailto:a.i.santos@open.ac.uk">a.i.santos@open.ac.uk</a>, and I will do my best to help.</p>
<p>A couple of helpful things to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>To navigate through the activities of the day, please use the<em> links </em>in the workshop area entitled 'Programme', then click on the corresponding day of the week (the links will take you straight to the webpages you need); </li>
<li>If you Twitter, the hashtag for the event is #olnetvw (vw= virtual workshop).</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to participate as much or as little as you can, but remember that the more you engage with the programme the better will be the overall outcome, because it is our collaborative work that will make it all happen!</p>
<p>Enjoy it! &nbsp;:-)</p>

<p><strong>The specific objectives of Open Exeter are</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make available via a Creative Commons licence, a minimum of the equivalent of 360 credits of learning resources, from a range of subjects and a wide variety of mediums. </li>
<li>Make the resources available via JorumOpen and also Exeter's institutional repository. </li>
<li>Create a suite of protocols and templates that will facilitate the workflow from identifying resources to making them accessible such that future resources can be released under the same sustainable conditions. </li>
<li>Create an effective metadata schema so that resources can be readily found by end users. </li>
<li>Create an environment within which resources can be effectively evaluated, used and repurposed as part of e.g. student / staff collaboration course design and delivery collaboration. </li>

              <title>What are the main barriers to reusing/remixing OERs?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2594</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2594</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>[First published at: <a href="http://olnet.org/node/119">http://olnet.org/node/119</a>]</p>
<p>In the <a title="OLnet home page" href="http://olnet.org/">OLnet</a> team we lately started a collaborative process of "reflecting" on Open Educational Resources reuse/remix challenges. In order to understand what these challenges may be we tried to answer to the following questions:</p>
<p>Why reusing/remixing and Open Educational Resource?</p>
<p>What are the barriers to reusing/remixing OERs?</p>
<p><a href="/index.php/cloud/view/2432">Liam cloud</a> summarized the answers that the OLnet team members proposed to the first question. In this Blog Post I just open for discussion and improvements the list of 20 barriers to OERs reuse/remix that the OLnet team identified as answer to the second question. Are this all the possible barriers? Are these the rights ones? We need help to enrich, revise, question and discuss this list with a wider group. If you have any idea, answer, or barrier to add to the list please add it in the comments, this would help enriching this collaborative reflecting exercise.</p>
<h2>What are the barriers to reusing/remixing OERs?</h2>
<p>1) Internationalization, OERs may be available but in a different language;</p>
<p>2) Cognitive overload: it is difficult to separate the 'content' from the 'context' in a OER, thus it is difficult to decontextualize an OER and re-contextualize it to a different learning context/purpose;</p>
<p>3) Cognitive overload: in terms of trying to illicit the implicit design of an OER and then needing to create a new design;</p>
<p>4) Cognitive overload due to Lack of good examples/ best practice:&nbsp; "remixing" an OER is a difficult concept to grasp, especially as examples of remixing might be difficult to find or something you wouldn't tend to stumble across;</p>
<p>5) Digital divide: lack of access to digital network implies no access to digital resources;</p>
<p>6) Digital divide: lack of digital literacy;</p>
<p>7) Lack of teacher's preparation and training in how to reuse OERs;</p>
<p>8) Distance from main stream teaching and learning practices and policy;</p>
<p>9) Curriculum alignment: OER may not fit specific curriculum, and vice-versa curriculums may not be designed around an OER reuse/remix culture;</p>
<p>10) Plagiarism: to which extent reusing and remixing an OER can be perceived as a form of plagiarism?;</p>
<p>11) Lack of technical support for teachers; institutionalized support i.e. a dedicated educational technologist team is considered important for promoting re-use within different educational instituions/contexts (relates to digital and socio-economic divides)</p>
<p>12) Copyright issues and different copyright jurisdictions: this is mostly about publishing original OERs, but it also relates to the ways in which an OER is 'translated' to different contexts/locations. It also hinders what other items, media objects can be added that are more relevant to a national culture / pedagogical context;</p>
<p>13) Lack of confidence: many teachers/tutors feel reluctant to reuse and publish their reused materials. One possible reason for that is that they feel that they tamper with something that was designed/published for a specific purpose/context; this relate with the Conceptual overload mentioned at point 2);</p>
<p>14) Lack of confidence: many teachers/tutors feel reluctant to "mess up" with someone else "good" design;</p>
<p>15) Lack of explicit learning design supporting the representation of resources and dialogue around their use in a particular context; if context/purpose and targetted audience alongside learning outcomes are not very explicit this makes more difficult to repurpose in a different context;</p>
<p>16) Lack of policy embeddedness and accepted institutional practices: OER use and re-use in mainstream educational institutions needs be legitimized by accepted national policies on education;</p>
<p>17) Issues of quality/legitimacy: some OERs are not considered worthy of using/remixing. Some advocates insist on putting ratings / quality and context indicators. That will enable tracing of use and perhaps stimulate re-use;</p>
<p>18) Lack of time: too much effort to put in reusing makes easier and faster to do it yourself from scratch;</p>
<p>19) Lack of tools to help deconstruct and reconstruct;</p>
<p>20) Lack of motivation - why should I, what's in it for me?</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The content from an organisation (such as The Open University in the UK) does carry cultural overloadb and this could be seen as&nbsp; negative aspect. However it also demonstrates how OER can act to communicate ideas as well as culture. Providing those involved see themselves contributing as part of a larger community and look for opportunities coming in then individual voices in materials have a role. Considering the user viewpoint and the options implied by openness that people *may* take advantage of gives a route forward and avoids cultutal worries as a barrier.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Why remix an Open Educational Resource?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2432</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2432</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>[First published at: <a href="http://olnet.org/node/68" target="_blank">http://olnet.org/node/68</a>]</p>
<p>One of the ideas in the world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources" target="_blank">Open Educational Resources</a> (OERs) that can be a bit strange to grasp at first is the idea of &ldquo;remixing&rdquo;. When I first joined the OLnet project and was telling people about it, a mention of remixing would often prompt people to ask &ldquo;why would I want to do that?&rdquo;, a perfectly reasonable question as many will have just experienced education as courses they learn from, but wouldn't actually change. Often OERs are just thought of as free courses, but remixing creates a much bigger opportunity. So I thought I would draw on the collective wisdom of the OLnet team and compile a list of twenty reasons to remix an OER.</p>
<p>The list is in no particular order, and by its very nature isn't an extensive exploration of the reasons to remix an OER, so if you think of any more it would be great to hear about them in the comments.</p>
<ol>
<li>Save yourself time and work by mixing in OERs with your own material to make something richer</li>
<li>Adapt the material to make it more accessible for people with different disabilities</li>
<li>Insert some cultural specific references to make a concept easier to understand</li>
<li>Translate it into another language</li>
<li>Correct any errors or inaccuracies</li>
<li>Keep the OER up to date by adding the latest discoveries or theories</li>
<li>Insert more media or links to other resources</li>
<li>Chop the OER up into smaller chunks that might be easier to learn from, or could be reused elsewhere</li>
<li>Adapt it for a different audience</li>
<li>Use the OER as the basis for a face to face lesson</li>
<li>Change the target educational level</li>
<li>Add input and participation from the people who are going to be using your remixed OER</li>
<li>Use the OER for a wider purpose by adding in other information</li>
<li>Changing the format of the OER to make it work in different computer based learning environments</li>
<li>To improve understanding of what an OER is by thinking about reasons to remix it</li>
<li>Insert a different point of view to that originally given in the material</li>
<li>Adapt it for different teaching situations</li>
<li>A way to experiment with new skills yo have gained (could be technical skills, media skills etc.)</li>
<li>To improve it</li>
<li>Because you can!</li>
</ol>
<p>As an IT person not an academic I'm more familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank">open source</a> than open educational resources, but the concepts do have a lot in common. With both you can just use the resources, you don't have to remix or contribute, and there is nothing wrong with that. If you do want to contribute though or you might feel an existing resource is near to what you want, you are free to build on it to meet new challenges.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Thurs, 1st Oct 2009, Venue Design Observatory, Venables Building OU.</p>
<p>A gathering to discuss the connections amongst the various OER and web 2.0 projects existing in the university took place.&nbsp; Representatives from projects such as OLnet, Atelier-D, OpenLearn, SCORM, LDI, iSpot, the TERG&nbsp;research group&nbsp;and the OU Library.</p>
<p>It's intringuing how using 'conventional media' like pens and images from magazines we managed to visualise and represent Olnet.</p>
<p>Even more interesting were the perceptions of participants and their feedback. I am trying to include some here:</p>
<ul>
<li>How could it link with JISC JORUM initiative and 'community bay'?</li>
<li>how do we improve resource discovery to deliver targetted and appropriate level material for reuse/repurposing? </li>
<li>Meta analysis of use is needed</li>
<li>how do we learn more about the sue of OERs? trough which methods?</li>
<li>OER international: all age groups, different cultures, web 2.0 tools</li>
<li>Are you investigating visualisations of qualitative/quant research data? </li>
<li>Researching 'known unknowns'</li>
<li>Communities of learners, delivery, designing, fostering?</li>
<li>global learning and cultures?</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps OLnet has something to contribute in all four themes that emerged from the workshop including:</p>
<ul>
<li>models of learning</li>
<li>models of communication / in social spaces</li>
<li>models of communication / tools for sharing</li>
<li>models of design </li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I guess the evidence is scattered in several national projects and depends on scope (teaching, research, scholarship), pedagogical drive, embedded purposes and situated practices. Any thoughts? what's your experience been as a tutor, student, researcher?</p>
<p>Are OERs a great case for effective use of Web 2.0 in educational contexts? What are the differences among instituional (i.e. those coming from 'traditional universities') and more 'alternative' OERs? (say <a href="http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page">Wikiversity</a>, <a href="http://p2pu.org/">P2PU</a> ?)</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This cloud has been set up for my keynote at <a href="http://www2.open.ac.uk/r06/conference/">the Cambridge International Conference of Open and Distance Learning 2009</a> on 24th September 2009.This cloud can also be used as a discussion space around the themes and issues raised in the keynote.</p>
<p>The talk focuses on work we are undertaking as part of the<a href="http://ouldi.open.ac.uk"> OU Learning Design Initiative </a>and the Hewlett-funded <a href="http://olnet.org">Olnet initiative</a>. A key focus of our work is the development of tools, methods and approached to support the desing of innovative learning activities and Open Educational Resources (OER). The website provide further details on both initiatives and links to assocaited tools, resources and publications. For this keynote I want to focus in on one strand of our work; namely how to leverage technologies to promote bettter sharing and discussing of learning and teaching ideas and designs.</p>
<p>When asked what they would find most helpful to enable them to use technologies more in their teaching, most teachers say "give me examples, in my subject area" and "point me to relevant people I can discuss these issues with". Web 2.0 technologies - with their emphasis on sharing, networking, user production, seem to offer the solution. However uptake and use of web 2.0 sites such as Facebook, Ning, Flckr, and Twitter for educational purposes has to date being marginal.</p>
<p>Some of the key questions in relation to this work are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why have web 2.0 technologies not been taken up more extensively in learning and teaching?</li>
<li>What are the barriers to teachers sharing and discussing their learning and teaching ideas and designs?</li>
<li>How can social networking practices be harness and used in an educational context? </li>
</ul>
<p>Also see related clouds and ongoing discussions on these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/cloud/view/1919">How do we get people to share designs and ideas - is social media the answer?</a></li>
<li><a href="/cloud/view/1921">How do you foster the motivation for learning?</a></li>
<li><a href="/cloud/view/1935">What are the barriers for sharing ideas and designs of OER?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The talk will then outline the development of a social networking site for learning and teaching, <a href="//">cloudworks</a>; which is attempting to apply web 2.0 practices to support dialogue and sharing around learning and teaching ideas and designs.</p>

Although many of the aspects are obvious and intuitive, a discussion of the implications, including risks and benefits, of open and online exposure is essential to fully understand what we are asking our students to do. What does it mean for a student to publish their work online? How does this affect their online identity, and by extension, their identity as a whole?"</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
<b>Audience</b><br />
Workshop for researchers: OER researchers, learning design and pedagogical patterns researcher
</p>
<p>
<br />
<b>Focus of workshops</b><br />
•    To develop an evolving collective set of research questions and cumulative data for the area [Maybe some data that they can take away and analyse themselves]. Sharing of raw data – a principle of an open resource approach – to share and discuss<br />
•    To develop a shared understanding to define the intersections of the three domains and the benefits of combining them, to include: research questions, definitions, areas of activities, tensions and position, and core principles, what are the key journals and areas of activities<br />
•    To develop a shared research domain definition for this new field
</p>
<p>
<b>Resources<br />
</b>•    Key papers for the field – could we have an evolving list – papers plus discussion and in particular are there ones that are working at the interface<br />
•    Expertise database and funding sources<br />
•    Collective data gathering and reuse which can be mined for different purposes<br />
Data <br />
•    1. Collective share knowledge on key research questions, brainstorm and refine research question<br />
•    2. Data on research questions<br />
o    ‘’How do teachers do about the design process?” Source of data, findings, and then aggregate [Design strategies clouds, LD workshops, interviews with teacher]<br />
o    “What are the barriers to reuse of OER?<br />
•    3. Data mining of cumulative data sources [Could we draw in experts in other fields to help with this?]<br />
•    Existing tools, templates, processes and methods
</p>
<p>
<b>Activities/workshop ideas<br />
</b>•    Brainstorm of what they think are the key papers in the field and why and how they relate to this area – could set up clouds to discuss these<br />
•    Hashtag #olnetkeypapers and short rationale for why to read it<br />
•    Main research domain definitions - what are pedagogical patterns what are peoples perceptions of this – an evolving collective glossary for the field, could set up as a wiki, could have a jigsaw first, then brainstorm etc [Some sub-domains already have definitions, so need to hook into these]<br />
•    Virtual writing groups to develop shared understanding to define the intersections of the three domains: research questions, definitions, areas of activities, tensions and position, and core principles, what are the key journals and areas of activities<br />
•    Build a new social network for OER – share your network (and associated tools and resources) and exploit other people’s networks <br />
•    Thinking of ways of how each community can use each other’s resources – patterns – which OER should we be looking at? How can visualisation ideas from learning design be used in a pattern context<br />
•    Workshop on visualising patterns and metaphors for design <br />
</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The follow diagram is intended to give a flavour of a design cycle for the design and resource of Open Educational Resources (OER). In the centre is a representation of the process of design. Imagine a designer is creating a new resource and mapping their design process in a visualisation tool like CompendiumLD. As they work through the design process they can draw on existing content (from say existing OER repositories) and designs (say from existing design repositories or pedagogical pattern repositories). The use these pre-existing OER and Designs to general a new OER and a new associated design which can then be deposited back into OER and Design repositories.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[Rebecca is a researcher in OER and she has to give a 50 minute lecture on the hystory of OER. She enter the OLnet platform and she type in the site search: &quot;What are the OER origins?&quot; the system give her back as a list of OER on the topic, every OER has an image and a hypermedia summary associated to it (text and video).... since she is a visual person she often deside to focus on  resource when she is atttracted by the image...  she finds a couple of interesting resources so she tag them and she import them in her favorite...Ones she is satisfied with three resources she drag and drop them in the canvas. Ones in the canvas the resources are fragmented in sections and paragraphs . ..she can drag and drop in the canvas also just parts she want to reuse. The system also give her a list of learning patterns on the hystory of OER.....every patterns has again a hypermedia summary that she can explore and she realize that one of them is exactly describing the experience that she want her student have!....so she drag and drop it in the canvas, the learnign design pattern unfold as a bar she can scroll forward and backwords. Every step in the learning pattern is a fragment that she can reuse....like in a movie maker tool...she is preatty exhited about that.....every piece is connected by a link that is explianig the semantic between the fragments (Why they are connected), and this helps her in the exploration...., she now starts to compose her new learnin pattern: her presentation for the lecture... At some point she realize that she need to associate references so she go in the area of 'references' and she drag and drop her reference in the learning pattern ban.....she like the reference to be at the end but actually she could put them everywhere and connect to the relevant resource......now she would like to add some images so she explore the suggested images area, she finds there pictures that she would like to reuse....she pick up a few of them... at the end she export her job in several multimedia formats, jpg ppt...she is ready for the lecture!

<li>Before creating my module, I want to know what other resources on this topic are available across OER repositories. Is there a meta-search engine available?</li>

<li>Lastly, I need a method to apply the patterns to the OER to support my reuse of it. Do such methods exist? Might a learning design help?</li>

              <title>Ideas for Olnet activities</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1828</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1828</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[•    What do you think we as olnet should try to do to move this agenda forward (how can we use designs and patterns as an collective/combined approach to get more out of OERs)?<br />
•    The problem we are trying to address is that we have lots of good OERs but they aren’t being used and/or reused?<br />
•    Work in pairs – each person talks for 3 minutes, then reflect back thoughts to the wider group?<br />
Ideas<br />
•    A set of connected face-to-face workshops that might get the knowledge about patterns and learning designs and then try to use this in practice to improve practice<br />
•    Its important to have an expert research base for sharing practices and enable us to move beyond the workshops (cloudworks?)<br />
•    How can we structure the interface of mediating artefacts (tools, designs, patterns, etc) to support the open design process and how do we put these together so that they make sense<br />
•    Have all three things as inter-related <br />
•    Do a survey of real practitioners in the domain we are interested in to find out what is the maximum time they would be prepared today to look at sharing and use that as a constraint for the first set of interventions we develop<br />
•    Look at the way that patterns and the resources and the relationships between them can be summarised and how the visual representations can provide a more efficient way of applying/using the patterns or resources<br />
•    DO a deep analysis of all the learning design patterns that all the groups have produced. 1. Develop a taxonomy of learning patterns – what is used when by whom in what situation. 2. Identify the common bits and the possible relationships between different learning patterns – vision of what I would like to have as a design – I would like to be able to enter a need or a question, I would like to design a 3 week course on x and want to do collaboratively. Then decide step by step which tools, methods and patterns I want to use. Design patterns need to be fragmented as well so it can also be reused. <br />
•    An analysis of existing OERs and also same for patterns. Which patterns are suitable to be applied to which OERs and how does that happen? Also who is the audience – teachers and designers and individual learners. Issue of scalability. How much can we do online rather than in labour intensive workshops.  How do we virtualise a lot of what we do in face to face settings? <br />
•    Rather than solutions looking for problems – OERs (as very expensive “free” hammers)<br />
•    Current situation is separate communities not inter-connected – theorists, researchers, practitioners – need to find ways of making connections more explicit – constant conversation across these different communities<br />
•    Think of some scenarios of some potential new reuse scenarios and then test out some of these<br />

              <description><![CDATA[<b>Research questions</b><br />
•    What is a comprehensive set of tools and approaches for capturing designs?<br />
•    How do teachers and learners currently go about the design process? <br />
•    What would a facilitative design-interface layer between users and content/designs consist of? What tools, methods, approaches and workshop outlines would we need to include? <br />
•    How do we make the products of this work relevance to practice? Criteria for success:  do people use it! <br />
•    What is it that helps people take up and use OER and designs?<br />
•    How are people using our material (or not!)?<br />
•    Three types of actors and associated research questions:<br />
1.    How do we support teachers in the design of OERs or design the use of OERs?<br />
2.    Evaluating researchers in the OER field, how do we support them in the process of identifying, creating and visualising the OER designs and patterns?<br />
3.    What would good learning structures to support the use of OERs by learners look like?<br />

A goal is to make the wide range of educational resources available, in
open (or even, gasp, proprietary) formats easily and productively
accessible to educators and learners. The intent underlying this vision
is to promote choice, i.e. “allow users to access the digital content
that they need from any applications they choose.”
</p>
<p>
Can we develop a collaboration, tentatively titled a &quot;Network for
Content and Curriculum&quot;, to leverage and advance the interest and
success around <b>real-world interoperability</b> efforts for achieving true openness across educational content and software in support of teaching and learning.
</p>
<p>
I can provide more details if folks are interested...

Assuming OER uptake
increases, an analysis of who is being left behind might be in order. 
Based on existing or emerging recognition and reward patterns for
authoring or adopting OER, who benefits?  Are there differences between
disciplines, institutional class, region, and seniority in how
individuals are rewarded or motivated to engage with OER?  For instance
at a research institution is use of OER more relevant to academic
specialists and fixed-term faculty then tenure-track faculty?  Does
this differ with behaivor measured at community colleges?

The UNESCO OER Community has been discussing issues of access to OER
over the past weeks.  To expand access to knowledge worldwide, we have
to consider the local situation and develop materials and means of
sharing that will allow the sharing intended.
</p>
<p>
A small group is forming to develop a project as a concrete outcome of the intense interaction.
</p>
<p>
Anyone interested can contact me at <a href="mailto:s.dantoni@unesco.org">s.dantoni@unesco.org</a> and I will link you to the group.

Create an ethnographic study of student use of materials they search
and find to supplement their formal lectures to learn whether OER
explicitly plays a role and if not (which we'd assume), could it or
should it be an explicit aspect of their seeking materials?

              <description><![CDATA[Brief: The Teacher Education in Sub Saharan Africa (TESSA) initiative has achieved improvements in teacher education through offering support and materials that help teachers achieve their aims. TESSA has established a method of working through coordinators to reach and engage in difficult areas and widen participation and use. As part of a continuing plan of action TESSA will work with OLnet candidates for up to four fellowships in Africa. The need to develop monitoring and impact evaluation of use of TESSA materials in existing consortium partner institutions was identified in the outcomes of the TESSA workshop in Ghana (May 2008). Drawing on impact studies looking at changes in teachers’ classroom practices, pupil learning and cultural mediation of the core set of structured OER across different environments. These will provide evidence at several levels within OLnet and be collated to allow development of items that can be reused within the field, for example an implementation handbook offering sector specific guidance to support extended use of TESSA OER.  <br />
Outcomes on the specific OER level:<br />
1.    Evidence of use.<br />
2.    Insight into use in difficult contexts.<br />
3.    Advice for reuse.<br />
On the network level:<br />
1.    Recruitment of Fellowships linked to development issues.<br />
2.    Linking of TESSA resources and activities into the research network.<br />

              <description><![CDATA[Brief: Establish a framework for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of OER in supporting improved teaching and learning in various contexts. Working with OER producers and users from the OCWC and other OER projects as participatory researchers, we will move several representative OER through the OER effectiveness cycle as the OER travels to a new context. We will organize a network of OER producers and adapter/users, who will develop and use evaluation methods, document the evaluation methods, the data analysis and design practices, and the results of the evaluation showing the mechanisms through which the OER supports improved teaching and learning and the conditions and resources that can support effective travel. In at least one case, we will conduct an intensive case study, as an example of organizational learning. In the study we will work with an OER producer and with faculty at an institution that adopts OER, studying the adopting faculty’s discussions and decisions in which they adapt, amend, and utilize the materials that the OER provide. Goals of this research (both the producer/user network and the case study or studies) include gaining information that can guide the design of resources that can be provided to assist adopters of OER in successfully adapting OER for their local use. Candace Thille will coordinate the network and Jim Greeno will lead the case studies on the mechanisms through which the OER can support improved teaching and learning and on the conditions and resources for travel. The OER producers/users involved in this project will be awarded fellowships to support their participation.<br />
Outcomes on the specific OER level:<br />
1.    Data on the effectiveness of the specific OER in supporting improved teaching and learning.<br />
2.    Data on the conditions and resources that can support effective travel of the OER.<br />
3.    Capacity building in the areas of evaluation and design for the specific OER producers and users.<br />
On the network level:<br />
1.    A framework of progressive refinement for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of OER in improving teaching and learning.<br />
2.    Contribution to OLnet’s collection of evaluation methods, data analysis tools and design practices.<br />
3.    Contribution to OLnet’s evaluation data collection, including an example of a network that provides infrastructure for producers and users of OER to interact and benefit from each others’ experience and learning in adapting OER in local programs and practices.<br />

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1177</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1177</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[Brief: Learning design is an approach that considers learning materials as having both a final product, the educational resource, and a design that captures the intent of the product. This design is often implicit and has not been valued as a product in itself. OER challenge that position as it becomes important to communicate why material has been developed so that users can make best use of the material and also see the designs as shareable in themselves. Designs matter both to educators, to understand potential reuse, and to users to help them select material relevant to their context. The design is a key part of the effectiveness cycle. In this project we will establish collections of designs linked to available OER. Current work in the OU has established use of Compendium (a free knowledge mapping tool from OpenLearn) as a representation tool, and a workshop-based approach to involving the educator and producer community. A community site Cloudworks (http://cloudworks.open.ac.uk) is now in use within the OU to share designs at differing levels of sophistication. This platform is being opened to a wider community.<br />
There is a wider interest in the approach and related methods, such as pedagogic patterns. We will collaborate with that community through an Open Professorship to enhance the understanding of how OER work and connect from design to models of use.<br />
Outcome on the specific OER level:<br />
1.    Design-based description in a shareable representation.<br />
2.    Data on the interpretation of design and how it can support reuse.<br />
3.    Materials to capture the approach and enhance participation.<br />
4.    Use data on designs in relation to OER<br />
On the network level:<br />
1.    A collection of social objects that enable research discussions .<br />
2.    Community building through sharing of representations and interlinking with the OER community.<br />
3.    Integration of tools (e.g. from Cloudworks) within the OLnet framework.<br />

              <description><![CDATA[Brief: The OLI pedagogy and technology is designed to support and evaluate individual learning of content and practices in complex domains. The Knowledge Forum pedagogy and technology developed by Marlene Scardamalia and Carl Bereiter is designed to support and evaluate group knowledge building (Knowledge building is a process of sustained idea improvement fostered by communities in which participants take responsibility for the advancement of community knowledge). We will integrate the two pedagogies and technologies in an exemplar OER so that teachers and learners can participate in both environments simultaneously and so that we can collect a single data store of their use in the integrated environment. As the integrated environment is used to support teaching and learning, we will use the OLI and Institute for Knowledge Innovation and Technology (IKIT) analytic tools to evaluate the ways in which the integrated approach improves both individual learning and group knowledge building. There are many and important related research issues. For example, if learning is enhanced for a few students, do their contributions to the collaborative space enhance the work of the group; how can we assess growth and spread of ideas; can we keep ideas alive and improving in a worldwide open community?<br />
Marlene Scardamalia will serve as a Collaborating Professor. The teachers using the integrated OER will receive fellowships for their participation in the use and evaluation research. OLI and IKIT technical staff will integrate the learning and data collection environments.<br />
Outcomes on the specific OER level:<br />
1.    A resource that exemplifies a combined pedagogical approach of fostering individual learning and group knowledge building<br />
2.    Data on the effectiveness of the specific OER in improving teaching and learning.<br />
3.    Data on the conditions for effective travel of the OER.<br />
4.    Capacity building in the areas of new pedagogical approaches, evaluation and design for the teachers using the integrated OER.<br />
On the network level:<br />
1.    A learning environment that facilitates the simultaneous participation of learners in individual knowledge building and group knowledge building practices.<br />
2.    Contribution to OLnet’s collection of evaluation methods, data analysis tools and design practices.<br />
3.    Contribution to OLnet’s evaluation data collection.<br />
4.    Analytic tools for visualizing both individual knowledge gain and emergent processes of knowledge building over time.<br />

<b>Reflections on the researcher 2.0 workshop </b>
</p>
<p>
How do we reseach large-scale, distributed environments?
</p>
<p>
What are the contemporary equivalent of collecting data that the OU used to collect (for example data on insect distribution, etc) using new technologies? Biodiversity project is an exemplar of applying modern technoligies to data collection 
</p>
<p>
Could we think of an equivalent educational technology reseach questions using the biodiversity architecture?
</p>
<p>
For example use of OERs in the wild, for example innovative use of tracking - but this doesn't pick up on intend. 
</p>
<p>
Are there modern equivalents of the reflective learning log? Microlearn as a applied varient of twitter to aggregate learning moments.
</p>
<p>
Capturing contexts - perhaps by using Rose Luckin's notion of context (in particular her use of the notion of filtering) and her ideas around ecologies of learning or perhaps reapplication of Acitivty theory as a theoretical framework.  
</p>

<b>Research challenges of OERs</b>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<i>What OER offers </i>
</p>
<p>
1. Global opportunities
</p>
<p>
2. IPR vanquished
</p>
<p>
3. Goodwill amongst reseachers? 
</p>
<p>
4. Unlimited reuse potential 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Li Yuan 2008 Cetis whitepage OER opportuniites and challenges for HE sets the scene.
</p>
<p>
<br />
OER projects: MIT. utah stage, rice uni connections, intro to open education, connectivism ad conective knowlege, globe, japan Open course ware, wikiversity, curriki, irish open, carnegie mellon, stanford uni 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
HEFCE/JISC call on OERs
</p>
<p>
£5.7 m pilot 09, £10m possible from 2010 onwards, three areas
</p>
<p>
1. Programme strands - discipline sharing
</p>
<p>
2. Institutional strand
</p>
<p>
3. Individual strand
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Chris has submitted one on the H806 course and around sharing and the social glue that supports this, how OER objects can be reused/reusable (ie simple learning design)
</p>
<p>
Uses web 2.0 tools (including cloudworks) to share and inform around a 30pt course in Openlearn
</p>
<p>
Notion of social objects to share and discuss 
</p>
<p>
Potential to inform TESSA teachers (XO laptops) and how you blend learning in developing world contexts and the idea about developing an OER MA course
</p>
<p>
It is about 'can we show and share how?' 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>
Research questions</b>
</p>
<p>
1. How to know whether content is suitable to resue - waht metadata counts?
</p>
<p>
2. Social interaction = sustainable sharing?
</p>
<p>
3. Could student/user evaluaton of (OER) RLOs create meaningful auto metadata?
</p>
<p>
4. How do we contextualise in reuse (eg are there institutional or discipline traits)?
</p>
<p>
5. What's the value of RLOs as reusable LD? 
</p>

<p>
<i>Open source software business models</i>
</p>
<p>
Chang et al.  
</p>
<p>
Downes models for OERs - concept of open entails at a minimum no cost to the consumer or user of the reosurce, nonetheless costs something in funding or serice to create and distribute resources 
</p>
<p>
Need new funding models (endowment, membership, donation or converstion, contributor pay, sponsorship, institution, governement, partnership and exchanges), technical models, content models and staffing models

<b>Implications for researchers in Web 2.0</b>
</p>
<p>
What are the design implications of these different financial models?
</p>
<p>
How does the financial models that resource are built on impact on the ways in which people interact and engage with resources?
</p>
<p>
Will technology developments change these models?
</p>
<p>
What are the differences between models of open source software and of OERs?
</p>
<p>
What happens when we get to OER saturation point?
</p>
<p>
Is a financial model the appropriate way to think about OERs? Can we quantify the social values of our resources rather than the economic value?

              <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Live blog of presentation:</em>Shailey draws on her experience of researching in second life and how it can be used as a platform for conducting research.</p>
<p>She was initial skeptical but now sees a lot of benefits to using it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second life is a 3D-interactive world, much more human experience that 2D- environments, a sense of 'being there'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of her previous research on students' experience of using blogs and wikis highlighted that they had difficulty critiquing each others work because they didn't know each other well enough. Second life provides a space for socialisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Second life to support research</em></p>
<ul>
<li> Research meetings, networking, virtual collaborations </li>
<li> Seminars, conferences, share resources </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Second life as a platform for conducting research</em></p>
<ul>
<li> Conduct interviews, observations </li>
<li> Evaluate prototypes of concepts and designs </li>
<li> Bring in real data and develop simulations </li>
</ul>
<p>PhD Supervisions in second life plus email, sense of visual presence and a sense of place, large pool of praticiants, transcript of text conversation or audio record of conversation</p>
<p>Sense of realism which is hard to match in other online environments, but there is a steep learning curve, it takes less time to learn to use Skype, flashmeeting or Elluminate. Also demanding systems requirements - graphics card, memory broadband, etc.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Scholarly publishing 2.0</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/838</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/838</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>
<b>What is scholarly publishing? </b>
</p>
<p>
What scholar publish - a distintive sort of conversation by researchers, practices in a particular community, peer review and quality
</p>
<p>
How do we look at quality in an online world
</p>
<p>
Peer review is very important - there are different forms through journal process but also via commentary
</p>
<p>
Publish - twitter, IM, blogs, podcasts, conference presentations, slideshares, journal articles, books - funnel effect from light interactions through to more heavy discourse
</p>
<p>
What has changed is that there are more channels and an information explorsion in terms of speed of distribution
</p>
<p>
Clay Shirky - no information overload, only filter failure
</p>
<p>
Tools to help: e-Journals, citeseer and Zotero, google scholar, OU library federated search, TicTOCs (RSS)
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We underestimate the way we find new resources and information by talking to each other
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<i>What really counts?</i>
</p>
<p>
It's metrics, the REF (research framework etc)
</p>
<p>
Citation counts, impact factors, h-index (N papers with N citations)
</p>
<p>
The problem is 'gaming the system', worse outside academia - technorati (i.e. post techno-bating blogs!)
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Peer review broadly considered is the way we spot what is interesting and what is of value
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>JISc report</b>
</p>
<p>
Marginal cost of publishing is zero
</p>
<p>
Moore's law cost halve every 18 months
</p>
<p>
BUT E-journal price inflation &gt; 10% every year
</p>
<p>
Publishing costs along now in the UK for schalarly material £575 m/y
</p>
<p>
Per article costs 55% is cost of writing it (and alot is reading papers you are citing), 15% on peer review, &lt;1% on library acquisition, 30% publisher cost
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<i>Three models for publishing </i>
</p>
<p>
1. Traditonal subsciption
</p>
<p>
2. Open access (50% author-pays)
</p>
<p>
3. Self archiving - for example e-print at Southampton or ORO at OU (our librarians will check the rights situation for the material you upload)
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
At of evidence that freely available materials get more citations
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>Peer review 2.0</b>
</p>
<p>
Vision for a new mechanism for the journal JIME
</p>
<p>
(which was when started in mid-90s a radical open publishing mechanism with quality)
</p>
<p>
1. Author blogs submission draft
</p>
<p>
2. Editors first filter
</p>
<p>
3. Referees blog reviews
</p>
<p>
4. Author blogs revised draft
</p>
<p>
5. Editor review
</p>
<p>
6. Formal publication 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There is a quantiative change in terms of publishing (more, faster, easier)
</p>
<p>
But arguably no fundamental change: open access imp but small beer (libraries traditionally opne, seamless sign on)
</p>
<p>
Peer review remains key - but what might the new forms be? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>

Recent articles in June 08 issue of journal of science communication - jcom.sissa.it/archive/07/02
</p>
<p>
Delfanti 08 outlines the influence of the collaborative web on open and closed science and a number of authors have provided interesing commentary on this
</p>
<p>
E-Science intro by John Taylor - in the future escience will refer to the large scale science that will increasingly be carried out through distributed global collabroations enabled by the internet. Typically a feature of such collaborative scientific eenterprises is that they will require access to very large data collections very large scale computing resources and high performance visualisation back to the indivual user scientist. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Radical shift in science community in the way they publish and discourse. 
</p>
<p>
Pioneered by physics in terms of open access pre-print journal articles and experimentation by Nature of open peer review
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Recognition of escience as a different way of doing science and the way that escience tools will enable different forms of collaboration.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>Zvivocic science blogger</b> - a science paper of the future will be a work in progress, with diff people with diff skills and talents contributing to a body of work sequentially, one has an idea, another a hpothesis, another designs, another runs etc.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
All bits independently searchable and citable and all interconnected. Power of the collective endeavour. 
</p>
<p>
The unity of the paper - a single date, journal, volume etc. will be gone.  
</p>
<p>
All of science will become interdisciplinary and interconnected.  
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>Tola - science journalist
</b>
</p>
<p>
Reviews the growth of blogging started out as informal but is extending its reach as an activity for scientist, scientific journalists etc 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>Cozzini - an e-scientist view</b>, sharing large amounts of data for analysis, big scale investment
</p>
<p>
What does mean to be an international scientist in a multidisciplinary team trying to share representations and data.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Technical issues limit the usability, but also the community doesn't yet know to do with these large scale distributed data sets, need new visions to make sense of this 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Interested in focusing on understanding the changes in the communication adn publication practices of academic reseachers in HE due t the impact of the information age.

</p>
<p>
2 types 1. looking at a team in a science area who are using these communication tools, 2. groups of educational technologists 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>Some questions to focus on:</b>
</p>
<p>
How is the landscape changed by the technologies
</p>
<p>
What do researchers do with the technologies
</p>
<p>
How does it impact on the nature of publications and how will it be influenced by the introduction of the REF

Scale of youtube and other user-generated content channels. Range of outlets and publication mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>
You can't predict what will be useful to people. 
</p>
<p>
It's not just about open content but about shifting to an open mindset. 
</p>
<p>
iCasting - create YouTube videos and embed in a blog or send a microtweet. Aggregate and share content with others.
</p>
<p>
What about quality? balance of high quality and cost vs. lower quality but more, can we harness more the power of sharing. 
</p>
<p>
Building on collective expertise of others.  
</p>
<p>
What is the fundamental aim of publishing - is it about RAE credits or is it more about sharing of ideas. Martin feels you get more benefit and feedback through blogospheres.  Higher readership of blogs cf. with journal papers. 
</p>
<p>
The cost of sharing has disappeared - buy we act as if it hasn't! 
</p>
<p>
Have we taken on board the implications of free content as educational institutions?
</p>
<p>
'Find your inner geek'!!! Just use and play with the technologies. Try thinking of using a different medium rather than the default of a report - would a movie be more meaningful than a 50-page report?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Look to sharing as your default practice. Tension between what is best for the educational community - ie sharing and what might be best for the individual or the institution.

Technology environment is changed; it's evolutionary but is a step-change over the last few years.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The social environment around these tools is also changing rapidly. Co-evolution of technology and oral and symbols.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Projects actively looking at this: OU Learning Design initiative, Compendium, Cloudworks, Pedagogy schema, OLnet. And Cohere.

<b>Challenges</b>
</p>
<p>
Open world - experiments, asking users, many users, what does it mean? There are so many potential users of our resources.
</p>
<p>
How do we research and understand what our users are doing?
</p>
<p>
Traditional methods for research are no longer adequate for this distributed, connected world.
</p>
<p>
Researching people, networking, sharing ideas, getting input. 
</p>
<p>
How can we reach people, how can we change the way we work, how can we network with people and share ideas with fellow researchers in new ways? There are now so many options for how we can communicate.
</p>
<p>
For example recent use of twitter in workshops exploring requests for help  - #jiscbids
</p>
<p>
Use of video in more innovative ways. How can we capture experience and utilise these in more meaningful ways. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>What are the big questions, what does Reseacher 2.0 mean? </b>
</p>
<p>
Why researcher 2.0? Term has a notion of a new and better version of how we work, still doing researcher but doing it in a new and improved way and better use of tools. 
</p>
<p>
Has been some good writing recently about this concept and how people have changed in how they do things as a result of new use of technologies.
</p>
<p>
Or is it more of a continuum rather than a step change? Different views in the room, shift from individual researchers to more collaborative activities - ways in which knowledge might be changing as a result of collaborative activiites
