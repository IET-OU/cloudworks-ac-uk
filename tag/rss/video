              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Join the&nbsp;OU H818 'The Networked Practitioner' Online Conference 2017 for my presentation on the 9<sup>th</sup> of February at 11:15-11:30</strong></p>

<p><em>By Uffe Frandsen, Video Journalist at University College Sj&aelig;lland</em></p>
<p>In my conference presentation, I will look at feedback received from practitioners in different contexts in respect to Video Concept Cards. Video Concept Cards is an activity and tool, which aims to innovate videos and mixed media projects used in an educational setting. The game consists of real physical cards and is meant to be played in groups of educators in a real physical setting. It is meant to be an open resourse and is free to download, print and distribute under a Creative Commons licence. Video Concept Cards was developed in co-operation with E-learning consultant Anders Thiel from University College Sj&aelig;lland.</p>
<p><strong>What is Video Concept Cards?</strong></p>
<p>Video and media in education is nothing new. However, the evolution of new tools has brought countless options for using and mixing media in new ways to generate a better learning experience. Video can now be used both on its own and as a frame to incorporate many different types of media, creating an interactive video or mixed media project.</p>
<p>With interaction being a major focus in discussions on the future digital learning objectives, it becomes important to look at how different media types can be used and combined in a meaningful way for educators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However large the interest in the various new ways of communicating, it is can be a challenge to find new ways of communicating with these tools in an online context.</p>
<p>So how do we build concepts for these interactive videos, and how do we generate new ideas to innovate the use of media in education?</p>
<p>One can argue, that for building a concept of digital educational media the educators need a language and support, to fully be able to mediate their knowledge base through new types of media.</p>
<p>For this purpose the Video Concept card game was created. The goal of the game is &nbsp;not to supply answers or solutions as such. Instead, the focus is to facilitate collaboration and discussions towards good concepts.</p>
<p>In other words the game tries to innovate by asking the experts: The professionals directly involved with education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Short description of Video Concept Cards</strong></p>
<p>The card game is meant to be played around a table by a group of professionals involved with education. It consists of two categories of cards:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Activity cards. These are examples of activities to do in the context a video or mixed media projects.</li>
<li>Media Cards, which are different kinds of media types that are meant to be used in &nbsp;an educational context.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the game, the players combine the two categories in different ways and have an open talk or discussion about how to best use the potential in different media types to achieve the activity defined by an activity card drawn in the game. This is meant to facilitate knowledge exchange and idea generation for new concepts.</p>

              <title>Introducing ... Open Media Player</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9343</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9343</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm very happy to announce that we have released Open Media Player (formerly called OU Media Player), as a free/open source project. It has been our intention for a while to make the code open source, and we were finally able to plan in the time to make it happen.</p>
<p class="figure center"><a href="http://iet-ou.github.io/open-media-player/"><img src="http://iet-ou.github.io/open-media-player/assets/images/omp-example.png" alt="Open Media Player" /></a></p>
<h2>Why open source?</h2>
<p>We decided to open source because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Media Player aspires to the highest levels of accessibility, while being a mainstream player - a fairly unique proposition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We adopt a service-based approach, where the player is kept separate from the audio/video files, and the web sites it is embedded in. This aids maintenance, feature roll-out and is again a unique selling point;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help drive innovation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Principle - it fits in with the Open University's mission - open to people, places and ideas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educational - help others learn from our best-practices and our mistakes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We've done a lot of work to make the Player straightforward to install, and hopefully understand. Installation via <a title="Open Media Player on Packagist" href="https://packagist.org/packages/iet-ou/open-media-player">Composer</a> is as simple as copying and pasting this at a terminal:</p>
<pre>    composer create-project iet-ou/open-media-player --no-dev -sdev --prefer-dist
</pre>
<p>Some of the highlights of version 2 of Open Media Player:</p>
<ul>
<li>New embeddable, themed YouTube player</li>
<li>Configurable site layout and authentication</li>
<li><a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> adopted, code-base re-factored into sub-packages</li>
<li>Upgraded to <a href="http://mediaelementjs.com/">MediaElement.js</a> 2.17.0</li>
<li>Improved player user-interface in high-contrast (ignore colours) mode</li>
</ul>
<p>And, <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/open-media-player/wiki/Releases#2x">lots more</a>!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

              <title>SAT: A case study in understanding the impact of openness on CPD: how does sharing lesson footage across an open platform enhance professional development?(Mulligan)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8885</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8885</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The need for effective Continuing Professional Development (CPD) in teaching is bigger now than ever before in Northern Ireland. This case study is born out of a desire to reflect and develop as a teacher in a contextual environment which is currently not facilitating that demand. Budget cuts and area-based planning mean that schools are shrinking, teachers are being cut and the duties that teachers are being asked to take on are becoming more diverse.</p>
<p>Current CPD in Northern Ireland (NI) involves a once a year lesson observation from a senior teacher and the filling in of paperwork to show the inspectors. This is uninspiring and unhelpful in a challenging and competitive profession which needs good quality training, with investment from leaders and realistic ideas for how to remain fresh and innovative. Bill Gates (2013) is a strong proponent of teachers receiving ‘real feedback’ in America and there is no doubt that this is very much required for professionals who want to retain their jobs in the current educational climate in NI.</p>
<p>So how can openness and a fifty pound video camera enhance professional development at this crucial time for a teacher in NI: by innovating conventional CPD and opening up a classroom to peers across the world. It is time to put CPD back in the hands of the people who are at the centre of the process; the teachers. The innovation is that of sharing short clips and asking specific questions about them. The hope is that it could offer more effective feedback than an annual lesson observation. The openness element involves sharing lesson footage openly with peers online who would never normally be privy to classroom practice.</p>
<p>The conference presentation will focus on presenting a case study of a trial version of this within the H818 community. The case study being the artefact, the presentation will be a multi-media tour of the key elements of the case study including clips from the classroom in Northern Ireland, screen shots of peer feedback from within H818 and an evaluation of the efficacy of the process in comparison to current CPD arrangements in Northern Ireland. There is a degree of de-formalising the process of CPD within this case study. And this, essentially, is the point. Holmes (2013, p. 97) calls this concept of sharing and learning with peers, ‘informal learning’. The hope is that this peer review process, which has been a significant design feature of the H818 module, can be applied to a teacher in Northern Ireland who is hoping to glean as much as possible to improve specific aspects of teaching and learning within the classroom.</p>
<p>Attendees will leave the presentation with an increased awareness of how making CPD more open might engender better quality feedback. They may also come away with ideas for how to refresh their own CPD in an informal, discreet yet effective way.</p>

              <title>OU Media Player principles</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8848</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8848</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>In order to continue to develop the best possible Media Player for <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">The Open University</a>, we lay down some guiding principles, and notes on how the current player seeks to meet those principles.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://mediaplayer.open.ac.uk/">OU Media Player</a> should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Attain and exceed the highest standards for accessibility to those with disabilities.</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of <a title="Open University accessibility standard" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/about/web-standards/standards/accessibility">the OU</a>, <a title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, W3C Recommendation 11 December 2008" href="http://w3.org/TR/WCAG20">WCAG 2.0</a> and <a title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0, W3C Recommendation 20 March 2014" href="http://w3.org/TR/wai-aria">WAI-ARIA</a> standards and guidelines (W3C),</li>
<li>User and expert testing by IET of early prototypes for new functionality, and of the Player, with time planned in to implement fixes;</li>
<li>HTML5 player based on the third-party, open-source <a href="http://mediaelementjs.com">MediaElement.js</a> libraries, with Javascript plugins to replace and extend functionality;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be usable by the mainstream as well as those with disabilities;</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>User and expert testing by <a title="Institute of Educational Technology" href="http://iet.open.ac.uk/">IET</a> of early prototypes for new functionality, and of the Player, with time planned in to implement fixes;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Represent the OU appropriately. Carry the correct branding.</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>LTS designs visual theme(s) for the Player that are both accessible and usable, and that fit in with The Open University's overall <a title="Open University brand" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/about/web-standards/standards/design-standards/brand-guidelines">brand</a> and <a title="Open University mission" href="http://www.open.ac.uk/about/main/mission">values</a>;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be usable on mobiles and tablets.</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML5 player based on MediaElement.js;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be simple for authors to embed the Player in content;</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of the <a title="oEmbed specification" href="http://oembed.com/">oEmbed</a> specification;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be embeddable in a variety of platforms, (both OU-branded &ndash; OU VLE, <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/">OpenLearn</a>, Study at OU, OU Drupal etc, and non-OU branded sites);</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of a service-based approach;</li>
<li>Use of platform-specific plugins, for example, the oEmbed plugin for Drupal;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be simple to deploy new features.</p>
<p>The current solution does this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platform specific themes and an update process which conforms to IT change request process.</li>
<li>Issues and changes logged and tracked via LTS Redmine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track usage patterns, to help improve the Player and inform other University activity.</p>
<p>The current implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of Google Analytics for the <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/">Podcast</a> Player variant;</li>
<li>Tracking of play, pause and completion events;</li>
<li>Planned: add a feedback form.</li>
</ul>
</li>

              <title>OU Media Player June 2014 release (blog)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8785</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8785</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://freear.org.uk/content/ou-media-player-june-2014-release">Original post</a>.</p>
<p>I'm happy to be reporting on a new release of the <a href="http://mediaplayer.open.edu">OU Media Player</a> that happened in mid-June. This release fixed a number of bugs, including one relating to Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8, and another involved fixing security warnings for non-secure audio/video media files when the Player is embedded on a site via HTTPS.</p>
<p>There were also a couple of enhancements. One entails hiding the title panel on pages that are Open University branded. This has proved to be a stumbling block in some deployments, as the titles are not always meaningful to the public (they may be used internally to distinguish tracks), and it looks odd to have multiple copies the OU's shield logo.</p>
<p>Another feature we added was Google Analytics for the legacy Open2.net media embedded in <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn">OpenLearn</a>. This is feature isn't visible to the end-user. However, it is important so that we can track and report on usage. Based on this, I can already report that the Player is currently embedded in something like 2000 places and receives approaching 4000 plays per month.</p>
<p>Analytics tracks some "events" for the Player, currently, "play", "pause" and the audio/video track is "ended", . <a href="https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement/blob/master/src/js/mep-feature-googleanalytics.js">GitHub: ../mediaelement ../mep-feature-googleanalytics.js</a>. We're interested in doing more with the Player analytics, so please watch this space.</p>
<p>You can see the <a href="http://track.olnet.org/markdown?url=//iet-embed-acct.open.ac.uk/README.md#releases">full release notes</a> for version 1.1.9.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Week 6 All MOOCed out...</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8066</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8066</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I've posted the text pasted below on&nbsp;<a href="http://suewatling.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http:suewatling.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk</a>&nbsp;and have included it here should any one drop by and want to comment on their own experience. I hope when it comes to evaluation, the OLDsMOOC team will contact everyone who enrolled and not just those who stayed to the end, because I think the most valuable information will come from those who started but didn't finish. I'll still be around for the next couple of weeks but having failed to prototype I have nothing &nbsp;useful to offer :-( other than these reflections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a great deal happening over in DIY Multimedia. This is no one&rsquo;s fault. I feel we&rsquo;re casualties of a learning design which made assumptions about its participants. The designers may have failed to take into account the diversity inherent in massiveness and assumed what worked for them would work for all. Failure is never easy. I&rsquo;m sure the OLDsMOOC designers would not want anyone to feel overwhelmed or defeated by their OLDsMOOC experience but I&rsquo;m equally sure I&rsquo;m not the only one all MOOCed out. Disengaged but somehow feeling inadequate at not seeing it through.</p>
<p>MOOCs remind me of the complexity of digital divides. These are not just about access to computers and the internet but the ways in which that access is facilitated. MOOCs require you to have access plus the prerequisite knowledge and experience to ensure you swim not sink. There is no one-size-fits-all model for digital inclusion and the same applies to effective participation in a MOOC. One set of learning materials is not going to fit everyone.</p>
<p>OLDsMOOC has been a challenging experience. I thought I was coping with unfamiliar landscapes, self-selection, self-grouping plus all the social media, but ultimately it hasn&rsquo;t worked for me and I need to understand why. It&rsquo;s easy to blame the multiple demands of the day job but OLD is my role so this was important to me. However, I think fundamentally I misunderstood the purpose of the course. Whereas I interpreted it as designing for online learning, it increasingly appeared to be about learning design using online tools - two very different things. Consequently the majority of discussions across the MOOC related to classroom/client groups rather than virtual situations. Also the mix of participants from training as well as educational sectors clearly had strengths in terms of sharing practice, but the theoretical nature of the course content raised the question of how OLDsMOOC approached one of the first rules of learning design - know your audience. This comment summed up the feelings of many:</p>
<p><em>Plus, I'm not a teacher, so some of this stuff starts even going over my head ... I need to adapt the course activities to my level of experience and field.</em></p>
<p>The idea for DIY Multimedia emerged from a lack of central resources in my institution for staff wanting to create short video clips and podcasts. One positive outcome from OLDsMOOC is seeing the benefit of developing a similar DIY approach to Online Learning Design. In cash strapped times, reusable support and guidance are becoming necessities but they have to be flexible for a diverse audience. In the beginning, I had many reasons for engaging with OLDsMOOC, and have taken from it many&nbsp;valuable&nbsp;insights, but as week 6 rolls on, I&rsquo;m not sure if any of this will be enough to see me though to the end.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Producing 45 minutes of online multimedia activities</strong><br /><br /><strong>To What End:</strong> Teams of three working to create a series of short, simple set of e-tivities. <br /><br /><strong>By what Means:</strong> &nbsp;Introduction to the activity. Collaboration to achieve goal in resources-limited conditions. Reflection on team work, authoring the content, time management and perceived effectiveness of the resource. Day long workshop approach, 2 hours before lunch, 3 hours in the afternoon with ample room for breaks. Expect 15 participants. <br /><br /><strong>Total session time: 300 minutes. 5 Hours.</strong> <br /><br />9.30 am Registration<br />10.00 am Start<br />11.15 am Break<br />11.30 am restart<br />12.30 LUNCH<br />1.30 pm Afternoon Session 1<br />2.30 END<br />2.30 Afternoon Session 2<br />3.30 END<br />3.30Afternoon Session 3<br />4.30 END<br />5.00 Reflection<br /><br /><strong>TLA 1: Introduction to the activity time allotted =55 minutes</strong><br /><br />Instructor presents the session activity, including the objective to achieve, the materials available, the restrictions, and the rules of winning. The task is to create a 45 minute multi-media module using a variety of formats using only Xerte or Wordpress, an accessible power point like platform or a versatile blogging platform and tool. <br /><br />The winning team is decided by peers. (Read Watch Listen - &nbsp;25 minutes)<br /><br />Instructor breaks the whole class into small groups, asks students to introduce themselves to group members and to other groups, and to ask any questions about the activity. (Discuss - &nbsp;30 minutes)<br /><br /><strong>TLA 2: Collaboration to achieve goal in resources-limited conditions time allotted =180 minutes</strong><br /><br />Groups of students work together to complete the task; the instructor walks around the room to monitor the interactions and draft outputs, noting issues for the class discussion; gives 10-minute and 5-minute warnings. Each group makes their finished e-tivity available for the other groups to evaluate.<br /><br />Three iterations of 45 minutes each - with 15 minutes in the hour to break. (Produce - &nbsp;150 minutes)<br /><br />The &lsquo;smorgasbord&rsquo; of activities on the chosen platform might be between 6 to 9, though some of these would be very straight forward - read text, watch and take notes from video, comment on set of pictures or interpret a chart, while others might be more complex, for example creating a set of plausible and valuable multiple-choice questions that both in form and test the participant. Similarly scripting, shooting, editing and loading a short piece of video (aim for under 90 seconds) would take the full 45 minutes allocated. <br /><br />Instructor invites each group to decide on their own criterion for judging what other groups have produced, then to inspect all the others and award 1st 2nd and 3rd prize according to their criterion. (Collaborate - &nbsp;30 minutes)<br /><br /><strong>TLA 3: Reflection on team work time management, criteria formation time allotted =65 minutes</strong><br /><br />Instructor chairs a class discussion about the process, the criteria they have chosen, and prompts them to reflect on their experience of managing time. (Discuss - &nbsp;45 minutes)<br /><br />Instructor sums up some of the key issues for achieving a 45 minute multi-media module using a variety of formats, and the time-management principles that emerge; circulates copies to the class. (Read Watch Listen - &nbsp;20 minutes)<br /><br /><strong>Notes - Post session - Each student is given a similar task to work on independently within a specified time period.</strong><br /><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.33710866514593363"><br /></strong></p>]]></description>

              <title>Week 4 Summary and Reflection: down but not defeated....</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>t&rsquo;s been a good week but maybe not in terms of MOOCing. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t mean to be grumpy &ndash; but OLDsMOOC is reinforcing some of my attributions and I never like it when that happens. In Week 4 I investigated the&nbsp;<a href="http://web.lkldev.ioe.ac.uk/PPC/live/ODC.html" target="_blank">PPC Pedagogical Patterns Collector&nbsp;</a>using the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/olds.ac.uk/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=b2xkcy5hYy51a3xvbGRzbW9vY3xneDozOWYwZDg4NjFhNzBiZGU3" target="_blank">Pedagogical Patterns Collector guide&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;but didn&rsquo;t get very far &ndash; other than finding myself here in Week 5 and looking at making prototypes of my learning activities. Now we have moved into the realms of fantasy. I don&rsquo;t know how to access to a programmer but I know I want one!!!</p>
<p>As if this were not enough cause for frustration, then the Wk 5 video transcript simply depressed me. I wanted to capture the part of the Week 5 video where DL compares &lsquo;.<em>..something you can do yourself like a PowerPoint or sequence in Moodle</em>&lsquo; to how you communicate your idea for a digital design to a programmer. I thought this was a useful reminder of the digital divide between technologists and the day to day experience of most academic staff, but got sidetracked on finding the transcript is an image and this defeats the objective of providing one. Week 4 transcript was pdf. Not ideal but it could be copied into Word albeit with inconvenient line breaks. Text as an image is useless and misunderstands the potential of digitally inclusive practice. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Media_Accessibility_User_Requirements">http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Media_Accessibility_User_Requirements</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In DIY Multimedia we&rsquo;ve stressed the importance of alternative formats from the beginning and it&rsquo;s been&nbsp;reassuring&nbsp;to share awareness of the importance of this element of learning design. &nbsp;Providing digital content in a single fixed format assumes the MEE Model of computer access where users work via a Mouse for navigation and their eyes and ears for images and sound. This fails to reflect the diversity of ways people use computers and access the internet but the MEE Model underpins 99% of digital content. &nbsp;Learning designers have a critical role to play in challenging the limitations of single formats while championing the inherent flexibility of digital data to be customised to suit individual requirements.</p>
<p>One of my many problems with MOOCs is the divide between their potential and the reality. I blogged last week on the&nbsp;<a href="http://suewatling.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2013/02/03/more-wrong-than-right-with-moocing-so-far/" target="_blank">EPIC 2020 and Turning Point 2012 videos</a>&nbsp;which present the threat posed through mass education by MOOCs. Back in the late 1980&prime;s, the founders of the internet heralded the internet&rsquo;s potential for democratic access. This isn&rsquo;t happening and some days trying to keep inclusive practice high on the agenda feels like hard work.</p>
<p>Over in the DIY Multimedia Google Group, the conversations are continuing...<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia " target="_blank">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia&nbsp;</a></p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Monday still feels like the start of a new OLDsMOOC week; which is unfortunate as this leaves only three days in OLDsMOOC time!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loads more good work being done by the group members. Congratulations on finding the time to engage so well. I have to admit to struggling a little to keep up and have blogged today on the similarity with the line in the Stevie &nbsp;Smith poem &lsquo;Not Waving but Drowning&rsquo;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/guide/177868" target="_blank">http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/guide/177868</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been wondering if I&rsquo;ve misunderstood OLDsMOOC; is it more about the online tools to support learning design than learning design for online learners? It would be interesting to share thoughts on this. Let me know what you think&nbsp;<a href="http://suewatling.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2013/01/28/oldsmooc-week-3-not-waving-but-drowning-by-stevie-smith/" target="_blank">http://suewatling.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2013/01/28/oldsmooc-week-3-not-waving-but-drowning-by-stevie-smith/</a></p>
<p>Jonathan&rsquo;s Personas usefully draw our attention to the practical realities of OLD. Thanks for this Jonathan. The next step seems to be to visualise or represent our designs for learning using &lsquo;ideate&rsquo; tools and beginning the creation of our own toolbox see OLDsMOOC Week 3<a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course/week-3-ideate" target="_blank">http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course/week-3-ideate</a>&nbsp;Any thoughts on the 7 C's of learning&nbsp;design?</p>
<p>Several people on OLDsMOOC (including DIY Multimedia) are using AnswerGarden. Sharing practice with different tools and trying them out is one of the strengths on this course although after getting lost in Cloudworks as well as Google; the Facebook group on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/oldsmooc2013/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/groups/oldsmooc2013/&nbsp;</a>demonstrated how a familiar environment&nbsp;enhances&nbsp;engagement! &nbsp;</p>
<p>We now have a selection of possible scenarios/personas and a choice of working with either one of these or one of our own during Week 3 - which ever feels the most manageable.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Videos to support student transition to higher education</strong></p>
<p>A recent survey of international students at Lincoln has generated valuable information about their specific learning development needs, in particular those they would find useful to access prior to enrolment.&nbsp; These include experience of lectures and seminars as well as different types of assessment, reading, writing and using the library. A parallel survey with staff suggests information about referencing and plagiarism would also be beneficial. While information of this type is already available through Getting Started, the university&rsquo;s pre-enrolment Blackboard site, it is largely text based. This project will enhance existing resources with a series of short video clips planned and filmed by students themselves. Students on Students Supporting Transition will produce a set of short video clips; maximum 2/3 minutes each with the final number of videos to be decided during initial consultation with students. Videos will be planned and filmed by students at the University of Lincoln in collaboration with the Centre for Educational Development and Students&rsquo; Union. These clips will feature existing students talking about their experiences of academic practice and how with hindsight they feel these might have been enhanced by early access to appropriate resources. Students across the institution will be welcome to get involved, but in particular international students will be encouraged to participate. Getting Started provides learning development information for students but findings from a recent survey carried out as part of the HEA/JISC OER International programme suggests for some international students, this information is not being accessed. As it is currently in text format, the idea of using short videos may enhance student access to transition information. It is also hoped the process of talking to students while setting up the video shoots will offer useful opportunities to uncover more about individual transition experiences. With inclusive design (e.g. alternative formats such as transcripts, captions, subtitles etc) video has the potential to create powerful learning experiences while empowering &nbsp;students to support new students in coming years. Using the theme of &lsquo;How to get the best from&hellip;&rsquo;&nbsp; the videos will go inside a variety of different&nbsp; learning spaces and cover a range of learning development areas to support the process of transition to HE. All videos will be uploaded to the university&rsquo;s Getting Started site in July 2013 for new students arriving in the next academic year. They will also be made freely available under creative commons licence, uploaded to YouTube and stored in JORUM for sector side reuse.</p>
<p>The internet and digital developments has seen video production move out of the professional studio and into the hands of everyone with access to the necessary equipment. However, support for developing effective multimedia for teaching and learning is often not provided institutionally. This project will offer opportunities for the lead coordinator to assess the viability of a DIY approach to multimedia in order to identify and transfer the necessary skills to other staff across the institution.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <title>&#39;Learning Design&#39; experience - OLD-MOOC 2013</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7796</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Every week I 'design' a programme of learning when I take, one after the other, four groups of swimmers at my local swimming club. </strong></p>
<p>Some 12 years of doing this, training and CPD means that I no longer prepare a programme in advance, rather I know the stroke and skills we are covering each week and have in my armoury a set of activities. These build from warm-up over 5-8 minutes into a variety of drills tailored to fixing problems with a stroke. The pattern whole-part-whole is used - to swim the stroke, spot problems, then put in a series of drills and exercises, typically involving only the legs or only the arms - as in 'part'. There are then advance 'whole swim' drills and any number of complementary fun activities. Diving or racing typically ends the session.</p>
<p>Often I draw on sets of images from 'The Swimming Drill Book' to show swimmers poolside what I want them to do - so a sequence of actions or a particular arm, body or leg position. Used in this way these sets of images can become like a set of cards that can be placed in whatever order I feel is appropriate as we go along.</p>
<p>Planning a programme of work for a squad is akin to creating a curriculum that runs from September through to the competitions season that runs through the Spring and Summer.</p>
<p><strong>Creating e-learning for corporate clients - compliance on health and safety, data protection, graduate induction and so on, might follow a remarkably similar pattern.</strong></p>
<p>The 'warm up' is an introduction, ideally something to grab their attention. Headliners on the banking crisis, a news piece on a data protection scandal, a criminal banged up (CPS induction) or a young person (actor) having an asthma attack. Like the swimming session these modules typically run for an hour, so 12 modules at five minutes each isn't unusual. There will be introductions to themes and ideas, following by activities to check learning or integrating an activity with fact finding.</p>
<p><strong>It isn't all online - learners might have to figure something out on paper and then return to the screen.</strong></p>
<p>It may also be personalised, so going into the system to generate something like a holiday request as per the instructions in the learning activity. Whilst the swimmer is observed and various skills checked off, in the e-learning experience the ticks relate to an activity successfully completed. This is not always linear, sometimes it is more exploratory, or can be done out of sequence, but the goal is to get everything done and demonstrate knowledge. At some stages a follow up set of questions will be issues to keep the information fresh.</p>
<p><strong>The outcome is primary - what are you trying to achieve.</strong></p>
<p>It is either state bluntly or apparent from the activities that day.</p>
<p><strong>GOAL </strong>- To ensure that all swimmers keep their hands in front of their shoulders when swimming competitive breaststroke.</p>
<p><strong>GOAL</strong> - To ensure that all graduate lawyers starting with the CPS can visualise a file as a defendant/law breaker - a person on whom all kinds of institutions and other people impact as their case comes to trial.</p>
<p>I have always used a communications industry brief to spec out the project and to help focus on the ideas that are required. On a single sheet of paper respond to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the problem?</li>
<li>Who are you speaking to?</li>
<li>What do you want to say?</li>
<li>How do you want them to respond to this?</li>
<li>What else do we need to know?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Swimming ideas come from formal courses, from colleagues, from resources online and books. You see something that works, so you give it a go. You show what appears to be an intractable problem with others and they offer a solution.</p>
<p>In e-learning the ideas are developed in a lengthy workshop - the client(s) and several team members strip down the creative brief, draw on the knowledge of an experience L&amp;D manager at the client end, may include a subject matter expert, but certainly includes a learning designer and project manager. Flip charts and post-it notes are used.</p>
<p>A number of creative problem solving or idea generating activities can also be used - moderating and leading techniques compiled, trialed and explained by VanGundy, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Marker pens on large sheets of paper - typically on sheets of A1 Flipchart paper - sometimes these are taped together. </strong></p>
<p>My personal preference is for wallpaper backing paper as the long strips mean that people around a table can all contribute. These sessions need to be carefully choreographed ... and at various points the outcomes stated, written down so that everyone can see and agreed.</p>
<p>Once done the Learning Designer takes it all away and compresses it into a form that can be shared digitally - typically a PowerPoint, with the warning that this should not imply a strict linear expression of the learning. Other programmes can be used, usually something built by the agency or a licensed commercial product.</p>
<p>Other learning experiences I have 'designed' - linear and interactive video to support facilitated learning, run to some 50. These followed a far less collaborative process of taking a brief, brainstorming ideas alone ... sometimes using an interactive tool called 'Ideafisher' then producing a synopsis, treatment and script. When other professionals come in to produce the learning the design stage is complete. For interactive learning the video is scripted as a number of components that are an integral part of the learning journey.</p>

              <title>Putting the &#39;online&#39; into learning design  (Sue Watling DIY Multimedia)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7698</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s distinct differences between Learning Design and Online Learning Design (OLD). When designing for virtual delivery, in&nbsp;particular&nbsp;for distance learners, the materials have to work much harder to sustain interest, motivation and retention. Transferring traditional content to an online environment can be flat and miss the potential for providing variety and interaction. Over in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/" target="_blank">OLDsMOOC,</a>&nbsp;there are many traditional theoretical approaches being surfaced but they also need adapting to virtual environments. I wonder if the Online in Learning Design needs to be seen as an additional layer. Theories within this layer would include Laurillard&rsquo;s &lsquo;conversational framework&rsquo; model; this offers a useful example of how OLD can stimulate dialogue and networks of learning. Garrison and Anderson suggest a Community of Inquiry made up of three presences; social, cognitive and teaching. In the past I&rsquo;ve found enabling communities of shared practice (e.g. following Wenger) can create powerful learning experiences. Online discussion often takes time to set up and encourage (here Salmon&rsquo;s five step model is worth following) but the directions it can go off into can be exciting.</p>
<p>On the practical side of OLD, chunking content up with formative assessment opportunities and using alternative formats such as audio which can be listened to &lsquo;anytime anywhere&rsquo; are always worth building into the course or activity design. Inclusive practice is critical to reaching the widest possible audience; accessible&nbsp;content and alternative formats give students the opportunity to access resources in the way which suits them best. Pilot and evaluate as much as possible; it&rsquo;s one thing to access course material on an up-to-date networked computer but try a range of old and new browsers and operating systems including mobile platforms. Students will use a far greater variety of hardware than you might expect and remember download times vary greatly across the country. Lastly, taking part in an online course &ndash; maybe a MOOC (there&rsquo;s still time to&nbsp;call in and browse activity in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/" target="_blank">OLDsMOOC</a>) &ndash; remains the best way of all to discover how to put the online into learning design.</p>

              <title>DIY Multimedia for Teaching and Learning Week One Summary (Sue Watling OLDS MOOC)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7689</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7689</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to everyone for all your comments and contributions during week one over in DIY Multimedia Google Group https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to summarise these below, apologies if I&rsquo;ve missed things. Please feel free to post reminders :-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been some useful resources appearing; compared to the mess of mindmeister<a href="http://www.mindmeister.com/206981485/learning-design" target="_blank">http://www.mindmeister.com/206981485/learning-design</a>&nbsp;Brian&rsquo;s resource shows a better example of mindmapping software with a great selection of links &nbsp;<a href="http://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/e-learning-tools-and-resources-for-schools-and-education-48511abbfb7e4145a33dbe6453d0f8af" target="_blank">http://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/e-learning-tools-and-resources-for-schools-and-education-48511abbfb7e4145a33dbe6453d0f8af</a>&nbsp;there&rsquo;s enough here to keep us busy all week! I was quite intrigued by the cartoon making software at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.toondoo.com/" target="_blank">http://www.toondoo.com/</a>&nbsp;but resisted the temptations to be diverted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brian has set up an AnswerGarden at&nbsp;<a href="http://answergarden.ch/view/46687" target="_blank">http://answergarden.ch/view/46687</a>&nbsp;where we are all invited to list authoring tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The variety of tools for OLD can in themselves be a barrier. How do you know which to choose and where do you find the time for learning how to use them? Sharing practice is one way forward. I prefer to prioritise free tools like Audacity for audio but when it comes to video it&rsquo;s not so easy to find something as good so sharing our own experience can be really useful. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of us have been looking at Bibsonomy. Esther made some useful suggestions on extending use of it; I got lost with the spheres but took Esther&rsquo;s advice and re-edited all my links with the tag diy_multimedia. Makoto has also arrived there too.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve shared confusion around the massiveness of OLDsMOOC and the strangeness of the clouds way of working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With specific reference to online learning design&nbsp;we've&nbsp;touched on OER and MOOCs as incentives to engage with the principles of OLD and&nbsp;I've&nbsp;been delighted to see conversations around accessibility and inclusive design as digital exclusion is a soapbox I drag out at every opportunity! Thanks Jonathan and Makoto. Too often developers assume people follow a MEE Model and use Mouse, Ears and Eyes to access digital materials when there is a diversity of ways to use computers and access the internet through assistive technologies and personalised learning environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One key point to be raised this week is the presence or absence of central support for online learning design and content development. DIY Multimedia grew out of wanting to empower staff to work with audio and video more effectively yet it&rsquo;s been suggested elsewhere this might actively dissuade senior management from putting resources in place. Interesting debate to be had and here is the place for these discussions.</p>
<p>We need to move onto Week Two: context and scenarios. Mo has made an excellent job of getting us started with a scenario in Google Docs&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O403mNr0xHdgDxkokfPmR6VKxD93lBeXLxhUfO7AX_8/edit" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O403mNr0xHdgDxkokfPmR6VKxD93lBeXLxhUfO7AX_8/edit</a>. I have to admit I haven&rsquo;t watched the video yet&nbsp;<a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course/inquire" target="_blank">http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course/inquire</a>&nbsp;and have given up on the daily emails reminding me of everything I haven&rsquo;t done! The OLDSMOOC organisers are in danger of forgetting many of us have to fit this in with a host of other responsibilities and duties. Having said that, I&rsquo;m looking forward to working on context and the &lsquo;human&rsquo; elements of OLD as this is where the theory can most usefully inform the practice. However, I don&rsquo;t think Thursday will ever become the new Monday and for me this is the real start of Week Two!&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a learning log for week two. I am also updating the Video Production cloud, see link. Apart from my blog - will789 on Posterous - I will try to stick to these two clouds. I am finding Cloudworks VERY confusing. Also I am a couple of days behind. Forming groups is slow and I would like to realte to others not on the course. So I may do things out of order to try for some momentum</p>]]></description>

              <title>Cloudworks and Google Groups in Tandem: What knowledge do staff need to produce an effective multimedia learning experience?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7571</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7571</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>There is a real sense of a DIY Multimedia Group coming together over on Google Groups&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia." target="_blank">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia.</a></p>
<p>I've posted suggestions for the first collaborative group task and am copying them here should anyone be passing and think it looks interesting or relevant to their own areas of work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So, where to begin????</strong></p>
<p>DIY Multimedia for me is less about the tools and more about the way the content can be used to support teaching and learning. I&rsquo;ve see examples of poor learning experiences produced with high cost software while powerful messages are delivered through low end technology. In an ideal world we&rsquo;d have the best facilities but all too often have to make do with what we already have rather than what we&rsquo;d aspire too!</p>
<p>You're all correct suggesting we need to capture what we will be covering. We should begin by contributing the areas we feel are essential components of DIY Multimedia learning design where theory is mixed with the practical e.g. DIY staff have to think about media capture, production and storage as well as a diversity of user experiences and how best to story board to capture the different elements.</p>
<p>Like many institutions, at Lincoln we are looking at the affordances of free software as part of a 12 month project looking at embedding open educational resources (see&nbsp;<a href="http://oer.lincoln.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://oer.lincoln.ac.uk</a>). The cost and learning curves required for branded software can be a barrier to a DIY approach so I introduce staff to Audacity for audio; for video I start with Windows Media Player/Jing/Screenr etc. All these have limitations but for short clips on specific learning activity they can be enough. I use Camtasia for anything more complex and am hoping to spend some project money to make this more widely available. Brian &ndash; you mention Captivate, Articulate etc which I&rsquo;ve worked with. If they&rsquo;re areas you&rsquo;d like to explore further then please so feel free to take this on. I can do the same with the software mentioned above. If anyone else wants to offer other programs please do. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task One:</strong>&nbsp;If you all agree, the first task is to throw in all the different elements to decide:</p>
<p>W<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->hat knowledge do staff need to produce an effective multimedia learning experience?</strong></p>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7568</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;d be really interested to hear about all your experiences of with OLD with or without multimedai. It represents such a major shift from traditional face to face pedagogies and for me, oldsmooc is proving to be a useful reminder of all how challenging it can be to operate within digital learning platforms where the content has to do all the work. Sharing practice is where the learning starts to be fun.</p>
<p>The practical elements of online learning design area are as important as the theory; this is&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;true when using Multimedia. In the past I&rsquo;ve used a five stage framework of Plan, Prepare, Pilot, Evaluate and Deliver, but the Pilot and Evaluate stages were often missed, or inadequate time frames allowed for them, or insufficient variety of different browsers and operating systems were used. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me online delivery works best when time is allowed for students to try out the environment before the teaching timetable begins. this is more than 'testing' the audio and video although that in itself is a&nbsp;critical&nbsp;part of the process. Online induction helps the tutor make sure everyone has &lsquo;arrived&rsquo;, found their way around the site content, has all the necessary plugins and scripts enabled, and tested their confidence with key requirements like uploading files or images or contributing to collaborative activities in blogs, wikis, discussion forums etc. Having an induction activity where people introduce themselves, their backgrounds and reasons for being on the course and doing this in a friendly, supportive environment, constructing their own code on content for language and behaviour, can be time well spent. Gilly Salmon&rsquo;s 5 step model to e-moderating offers a structured approach which covers the key areas and is a useful starting point for tutors new to setting up online learning groups and communities.</p>

              <title>Sue Watling DIY Multimedia Week 1 Reflection </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7459</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7459</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>At the end of week 1 I&rsquo;ve tried to follow the activities <a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course/week-1">http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course/week-1</a> It hasn&rsquo;t been easy to find a way through the different technologies. This in itself has been an interesting experience. It&rsquo;s good to step outside your comfort zone and one way to engage with new ways of working is to have a definite task in mind. My proposal is the development of DIY approach to Multimedia. This aligns with an on going project, so OLD with audio and video is relevant to me. My work role is to find ways to support people to use technology for education and I worry that here on OLDsMOOC&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been unable to translate the initial interest in my proposal into a working team. Cloudworks seems unnecessarily complex with too many ways of doing things resulting in information being scattered with no obvious mechanism for pulling it all together and establishing a single communication channel. I&rsquo;ve tried to understand Cloudworks. My cloud profile and links to my clouds and cloudscape is here&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/user/view/4427" target="_blank">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/user/view/4427&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>I set up an alternative area for DIY Multimedia on Google Groups, this is here&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia" target="_blank">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/olds-mooc-diy-multimedia&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Open education is part of my role at Lincoln. Having just completed a 12 month JISC/HEA OER Change Academy programme, I&rsquo;d suggest engagement with the philosophy and practice of OER comes before MOOCS. &nbsp;With OER you can have a more gentle and less public introduction but OER practice requires a sophisticated use of the internet and attention to specific digital literacies and MOOCs even more so. A key issue for me after this first week of OLDsMOOC is how many people may have tried and been defeated by the barrier of the technology. Rather than celebrating the affordances of online learning, this MOOC may have confirmed individual techno-fears and widened existing digital divides rather than helped bridge them. The spectrum of engagement with digital practices is wide. Many late adopters on the far side benefit from scaffolded approaches to increasing their digital confidence. Too often the technology is presented and users left to get on with it; reminiscent of early days of the VLE when attention was paid to the embedding of the technology and systems rather than the changes in practice necessary to shift from face to face to digital ways of working. OLDsMOOC has been a bit like these.</p>
<p>This is my OLDsMOOC story so far. I&rsquo;ve been trying out MOOCs for some time and blogging about it here <a href="http://suewatling.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/">http://suewatling.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk</a> where there are also OLDsMOOC musings and reflections. I&rsquo;m looking forward to Week2 and to working with colleagues who have found there way onto the DIY Multimedia Google Group. Those who made initial contact and are still out there &ndash; I hope our paths cross again in one way or another.</p>
<h2>Afterthoughts - OER and Multimedia and learning design</h2>
<div>Working with teams of staff developing OER for the past year&nbsp;<a href="http://oer.lincoln.ac.uk/" target="_blank">http://oer.lincoln.ac.uk</a>) I find&nbsp;engagement&nbsp;with openess demands a sophisticated understanding of the internet so is useful for developing digital literacies, but also making work freely available under a creative commons licence&nbsp;encourages the revisiting of learning design principles and practices. The smaller scale of OER reduces the massiveness of the MOOC so can be a useful starting point with online design.. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Learning design with multimedia must include attention to accessibility and inclusion. Making sure content is provided in alternative formats is something to be considered at the beginning of the process, e.g. transcripts, captions, subtitles etc, and not bolted on as an after thought at the end (see TechDis for advice and guidance). This process needs to be meaningful otherwise the result becomes tokenistic. See&nbsp;<a href="http://suewatling.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2013/01/16/tokenistic-captions-on-nss-official-video-2013/" target="_blank">http://suewatling.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2013/01/16/tokenistic-captions-on-nss-official-video-2013/</a>&nbsp;for an example of careless attention to these things!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When designing online learning environments, build in time for induction, finding your way around and making sure everyone in familiar with the channels of communication. This can help people disappearing before the fun begins :-)&nbsp;</div>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>While taking coursera's course, I found that searching content from tons of videos (each course has 50~70 videos), is such a night mare. Also, you can not book mark specific timestamp of the video. Luckily, their transcripts were downloadable, so my friend and I created a caption search and note sharing site, called <a href="http://benkyoplayer.com">Benkyo Player</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I currently put content only I personally study, or materials I teach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dream is to make my site more useful, and scalable, so it's easier for students to participate multiple MOOC services, while teachers could use the site as a analytics for students behavior (eg: which keyword students search which part of the video students stumble upon).&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dream N&deg;1 : online course on social media for learning</strong></p>
<p>I currently teach a 12-week totally online module on social media for teaching and learning, on the<a title="Description of AIGEME Master" href="http://www.univ-paris3.fr/master-2-aigeme-ifd-br-applications-informatiques-gestion-education-aux-medias-e-formation-br-i-parcours-ingenierie-de-la-formation-a-distance-i--26468.kjsp" target="_blank"> AIGEME Masters course</a> for Universit&eacute; Paris 3 Sorbonne-Nouvelle, with an international French-speaking intake of students. I co-teach this module with a great colleague based in Morocco. Until recently, the course was split in two parts, web 2.0 and analysis of educational media.</p>
<p>This year we have revamped the course to improve the integration of the two parts and to get the students using a specific Twitter hashtag for the course combined with content curation via <a title="Scoop.it topic for AIGEME module on social media for learning" href="http://www.scoop.it/t/master-aigeme-web-2-0-et-usages-dynamiques" target="_blank">scoop.it</a>. This revamp was the result of a joint reflection between my colleague and myself, but I would now like to apply what we will be learning in the OLDSMOOC to validate and improve these design choices. I suppose what I'm really looking for is a solid framework and for exchanges with others involved in a similar process.</p>
<p><strong>Dream N&deg;2: improve our staff development programme in teaching and learning innovation through the use of learning technology.</strong></p>
<p>When I arrived at the University of Burgundy a year ago, there was a sound staff development programme already in place, but for the areas dealt with by my department, the focus was mainly on tools (Moodle, podcasts, webconferencing..). We are gradually shifting the focus to 'pedagogical use' and have developed a course we co-run with the pedagogical innovation department, in which the starting point is the pedagogical scenario (project-based learning, collaborative learning...), bringing in the technology as a way of supporting these approaches. The first session is to take place on January 31st, so we still have a bit of time to refine the design, and this is where I hope the OLDSMOOC will come in handy! It will also help us in the evaluation stage. So again, if anyone else is working on staff development programmes in the field of learning technology, then let's team up!</p>

<p>I've started a collection of links to free audio and video software on this bibsonomy site&nbsp;</p>
<p>My project is to provide guidelines for creating audio and video learnng resources which are effective and inclusive. Multimedia can be a powerful online learning experience; in particular when people are speaking about their own experiences. Technology developments mean we no longer have to rely on professional studios but can adopt a DIY approach. I would like to develop a DIY handout guide for staff wanting to use audio and video in their online learning environments.&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Tony <a href="http://blog.ouseful.info/2011/02/06/the-most-accessible-media-player-on-the-web/">Hirst has just blogged</a> about the Office for Disability Issues new accessible media player AKA the "Most Accessible Media Player on the Web". Both he and <a href="http://technocrapy.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/are-waterfalls-agile/">Will Woods</a> have alluded to work that The Open University is undertaking. I thought I'd fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>The OU is at the start of a 6 month development to create a multimedia player that (we hope):</p>
<ol>
<li>Will be an "attractive" player that the average designer/ blogger would be happy to use on their site. </li>
<li>Can be used in a variety of contexts - our Moodle-based virtual learning environment, OpenLearn, OU-Drupal sites, blogs, Cloudworks... </li>
<li>Will deliver content mostly from the OU podcast site in the contexts mentioned above. </li>
<li>Will be accessible to users with disabilities - both in terms of control, and display of alternatives like transcripts and captions. </li>
<li>Usable on a variety of devices, including mobiles and tablets. </li>
<li>Will be delivered in a maintainable way. </li>
</ol>
<p>Taking points 1 and 2 together, my personal mantra is "<em>If its accessible, but not attractive then we haven't succeeded</em>". So we are talking unobtrusive accessibility.</p>
<p>Taking the final point regarding delivery. The main method for embedding the player, will be using a REST-ful web service, based on the <a href="http://oembed.com/">oEmbed specification</a>. This service is available for many providers, including YouTube, Flickr, Slideshare, Vimeo... See the <a href="http://oohembed.com/">oohEmbed</a> and <a href="http://api.embed.ly/">Embedly</a> sites. This will be transparent to the end-user and the author of content. An author on a Wordpress blog will merely type something like:</p>
<pre> [embed] <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/pod/mst209-fun-of-the-fair#079b8e506c">http://podcast.open.ac.uk/pod/mst209-fun-of-the-fair#079b8e506c</a> [/embed]
</pre>
<p>The blog software will handle the rest. oEmbed is used or consumed by various software/sites, including <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds">Wordpress 2.9 onwards</a>, the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/noradio/status/24790949420">new Twitter</a>, Ars Technica, StatusNet, and our own Cloudworks/ <a title="Cloudworks open-sourced" href="http://getcloudengine.org//wiki/oEmbed">CloudEngine</a>. Many multimedia providers can be plugged in with little effort, a great benefit, so authors will be able to embed from YouTube, Flickr and OU-podcast in the same way. The promotion of a service-based approach does not preclude bloggers from using conventional embed codes/snippets.</p>
<p>The player itself will probably be Flash-based on desktops, and will fallback to HTML5 for tablets and mobiles. This is dictated by the encoding infrastructure on the podcast site, and the current state of the various video and audio codecs.</p>
<p>The controls/ buttons for the player will be HTML and Javascript-based, not Flash-based. This follows examples like Chris Heilmann's <a href="http://icant.co.uk/easy-youtube/?http://youtube.com/watch?v=uBdwM7oQivk">Easy YouTube player</a>, and builds on my own <a href="http://maltwiki.org/">MALT Wiki prototype</a> (MALT Wiki is used by Cloudworks, and is oEmbed-based).</p>
<p>We will be using third-party Flash and Javascript components where possible, and implementing the player and web service.</p>
<p>As to the evaluations that we have done. Back in March 2009, I evaluated players including YouTube, Easy YouTube, jwPlayer, NCAM's ccPlayer and Flowplayer. See <a href="http://slideshare.net/nfreear/malt-wiki-techshare2009/18">slide 18 of this presentation</a> and <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AgJMkdi3MO4HdFNDdElzUUhMejAzaWZoMFJ0emw3a0E&hl=en_GB&single=true&gid=1&output=html">this spreadsheet</a>. I tested with screen readers (JAWS, and <a href="http://nvda-project.org/">NVDA</a>), and also compared APIs for the players (how "scriptable" they were), licenses and so on.</p>
<p>As part of the current player project I wrote a design brief with screen shots of various existing players outside and inside the OU. This included YouTube, EasyYouTube and the <a href="http://www.officefordisability.gov.uk/inclusive-communications/channels/odi-accessible-media-player.php">ODI media player</a> - a late addition. It was not an evaluation per se. It instead presented what was out there - we may want to use some features, we may not.</p>
<p>In the current project plan, we have built in accessibility testing, using expert evaluation. And we hope to do testing with real users too, using the <a href="http://jennielee.open.ac.uk/labs/">Jennie Lee laboratories</a>.</p>
<p>I'll conclude by saying that we hope the player will be accessible and will meet the needs of authors/ bloggers and end users. I don't think we will claim to be "the most accessible player on the Web". After all that sets you up for a world of criticism!</p>
<p>Feedback and ideas are as ever welcome.</p>]]></description>

<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p><a href="http://track.olnet.org/">Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr></a> is a <abbr title="Joint Information Systems Committee">JISC</abbr>-funded project to demonstrate technical solutions to the problem of tracking <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> (Open Educational Resources). As part of the Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> project we have developed a service to add license-tracker snippets to resources available through the <a href="http://oercommons.org/"><abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> Commons</a> portal.</p>
<p>And, here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>First visit the link track dot olnet dot org and put at the end a question mark, edge equals one, <a href="http://track.olnet.org/?edge=1">http://track.olnet.org/?edge=1</a> (this just means use experimental features)</li>
<li>Then make sure your browser's bookmarklets/ bookmarks bar is available</li>
<li>Then drag the bookmarklet that's in the bottom-left of the site to your bookmarks or favourites bar,</li>
<li>Now visit <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> Commons, <a href="http://oercommons.org">http://oercommons.org</a></li>
<li>Browse using the menus on the left, among the materials. I'll choose something from the Arts section. Here's a resource available through <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> Commons, the Aaron Copland Collection,</li>
<li>Then simply click on the bookmarklet you saved previously..</li>
<li>Wait a few [moments]&hellip;</li>
<li>And view the resulting license-snippet. You get a preview here, and some copy and paste here.</li>
</ol>
<p>By default the snippet uses <a title="Piwik open source web analytics" href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a> no-Javascript tracking and a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>. You can switch to Google Analytics, here, like so&hellip; Here's the Google Analytics [Java]script&hellip;</p>
<p>Additionally, you can change the license, for example using&hellip; the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike [License] like so.</p>
<p>Currently the Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> bookmarklet service is mostly a demonstration. It can be used by a publisher on small batches of OERs. Download the <a title="Track OER project code, on GitHub" href="https://github.com/IET-OU/trackoer-core">Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> code</a> and consider integrating it into your publishing workflow for full scale integration of tracking. We are considering extending the current functionality into an &ldquo;<em>Embed Me</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Embed 'n' Track</em>&rdquo; service for OpenLearn and <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> Commons.</p>

<p>TRACK <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> is a project supported by the <abbr title="Joint Information Systems Committee">JISC</abbr> OER Rapid Innovation programme (OERRI). It has developed ways to help keep track of Open Educational Reources. <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> have the challenge of being in the open and so actually what happens to content can become a bit of a mystery &ndash;- if content is trackable then we can improve what we know about use, help increase the evidence base and make it easier for those who want to reuse content to do the right thing.</p>
<p>In practice we have built three things. A transferable tracking system combining the Cut and Paste &ldquo;<abbr title="Cut and Paste Reuse Tracking,">CaPR&eacute;T</abbr>&rdquo; software built by MIT in a previous JISC project, A way to add tracking code to downloads so that we can see where new copies are being used and served, and tools to help apply tracking. These have all been through the acceptance testing process of The Open University so that they can be rolled out into our systems and of course, the code is all open source and available.</p>
<p>We see this code as helping us know things that we just couldn't find out before and the content for the Bridge to Success courses has now been marked with the tracking code. We also know that it has triggered ideas that we want to take forward: better ways to embed content with good attribution and tracking, a trackable license chooser for creative commons, and better ways to share evidence in our <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> Research hub.</p>

<p>Instructional design (or learning media design) principles, it is argued, are taken for granted by clients/employers. Are they taken for granted, or are they simply not well known to commissioners of elearning developers' work? Or, as a I suspect, is the assumption that the 'e' makes the 'learning'; in other words, that because technology is involved, learning will inevitably follow?</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello Cloudworkers</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are interested in video/media in education we invite you to join <strong>ViTAL: video in education</strong>, a new Special Interest Group (SIG) of <a href="https://www.outlook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=262ecb912f2a4d67b1068a017dca640e&URL=http://www.alt.ac.uk/sigs.html" target="_blank"> ALT</a> and <a href="https://www.outlook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=262ecb912f2a4d67b1068a017dca640e&URL=http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/detail/ourwork/learningandtech/aboutsectornetworksandsigs" target="_blank"> HEA</a>.</p>
<p>ViTAL  aims to address the growing interest we see at DIVERSE and other forums  in the use of digital video and media especially in tertiary education  in the UK and beyond.</p>
<p>You can get involved in the SIG directly via our Ning site (<a href="https://www.outlook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=262ecb912f2a4d67b1068a017dca640e&URL=http://vital-sig.ning.com" target="_blank">http://vital-sig.ning.com</a>).   This is the platform for discussion, and sharing ideas and thoughts  about the various issues surrounding the use of video within education,  such as pedagogical/ technical/ legal issues and accessibility.</p>
<p>We also plan to run a number of videoconference discussions over the next few months and a live event in London next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These will only be accessible via the Ning site.</p>
<p>ViTAL therefore invites you to join our online community and contribute to the current discussion topics and/or create your own  topics.</p>
<p>The SIG also runs a wiki (<a href="https://www.outlook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=262ecb912f2a4d67b1068a017dca640e&URL=http://alt-vie-sig.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank">http://alt-vie-sig.wikispaces.com/</a>)  and this will be used to publish articles which have come out of discussion. We&rsquo;d really like to update and republish the Click and Go video article from a few years ago <a href="https://www.outlook.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=262ecb912f2a4d67b1068a017dca640e&URL=http://www.scribd.com/doc/24123319/Video-Streaming-a-guide-for-educational-development" target="_blank"> http://www.scribd.com/doc/24123319/Video-Streaming-a-guide-for-educational-development</a>, but we can only do this with your help.</p>
<p>We  value your expertise and experience and hope you will be able to  contribute your ideas and feedback. We look forward to seeing  you online.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>John Conway, Imperial College London</p>
<p>Phil Tubman, Lancaster University</p>

<p>Suite S1, Innovation Centre, Longbridge Technology Park, 1 Devon Way Birmingham B31</p>
<p>E4L is a project investigating learners' opinions and experiences.<br />Core themes - transitional periods, use of shadow technologies, lightbulb moments.<br />Looked at learners from ACT, HE and, most lately, FE</p>
<p>There are interactive case studies, themed and categorised video and audio of learners talking about their experiences, available freely online along with transcripts and the facility for comments, reflections and recommendations from peers. They are intended to be of use to fellow practitioners in evaluating the student experience.<br /><br /><a href="http://elesig.ning.com/forum/attachment/download?id=2007026:UploadedFi58:9383">http://ELESIG.ning.com/forum/attachment/download?id=2007026:UploadedFi58:9383</a></p>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2978</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2978</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>A new cloudscape has been created to make commenting on individual contributions easier.&nbsp; Please see </strong><a href="/cloudscape/view/2128"><strong>http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2128</strong></a><strong>&nbsp; for a a full list of contributions and links to clouds for each one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>See below for the original call</strong></p>
<p>Want to contribute something about your project, work or research to the OU conference taking place online on 22 to 23 June 2010? We'd love to have it! Unlike previous conferences where papers are selected, we want non-paper based contributions and we accept anything (as long as it's relevant and not rude).</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>First create a digital artefact for us and upload it somewhere - some examples formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://slideshare.net">Slideshare</a> presentation</li>
<li><a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> video</li>
<li><a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> photos</li>
<li>Another Cloud in Cloudworks</li>
</ul>
<p>But you may choose another format (eg an <a href="http://xtranormal.com">Xtranormal</a> movie).</p>
<p>Then post your link below in the comments. If it is an embeddable format (eg YouTube), then I will add it in to this cloud, so all the content is visible here, and if not I'll add it as a link.</p>
<p>In the conference programme we have four discussion sessions where hopefully we can draw on these inputs. To have your contribution considered for inclusion in the main programme the <strong>deadline is 16 June</strong>.</p>
<p>We'd love to hear about your project and for you to help us explore the concept, perspectives and issues around openness in education.</p>
<p>You need to be registered in Cloudworks to submit content.&nbsp; The details of the overall conference are in the cloudscape: <a href="/cloud/view/2994">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2012</a>&nbsp;and the programme is in the cloud: <a href="/cloud/view/2994">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2994</a>.</p>]]></description>

<p>&bull; Attention<br /> &bull; Participation<br /> &bull; Collaboration<br /> &bull; Critical consumption ("which includes &ldquo;crap detection&rdquo; &mdash; we live in an age when you can get the answer to anything out of the air, but how do you know what and whom to trust?")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also talks about focused attention verses multitasking and the importance of being able to handle an array of tasks simultaneously.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
Russell Stannard talked about the success of his open
learning resources www.teachertrainingvideos.com and
www.multimediatrainingvideos.com and how these have led to powerful
marketing opportunities as well as being invaluable learning resources
for teachers and students.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Great example of a teacherpreneur. He started the project as an individual and his work has had a knock on effect on his institution - the University of Westminister. It's interesting that his screencasts of how to use certain technologies have had a positive impact in raising awareness of his course through the Google rankings of the content. His tips for success include good content, regular updates and limited objectives so you can focus on delivering something of core need to a certain audience. His screencast development was initially demand led - created to answer questions he received from teachers through a magazine column he writes. 
</p>
The content also exists on YouTube - going to the user, rather than making the user come to him.<br />
<p>
His multimedia training videos for his students
received 60,000 hits a month for the first 2 months and had 2500 users. There are now over 10,000 users indicating that many
users are coming from outside the uni. About 80% of his students want more videos than lecture notes. They like the ability to work at their own pace, see demos again and multimedia.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Russell didn't start this as an open educational resource but is now looking at licensing issues.

              <description><![CDATA[In many professional subjects, students need to learn to apply academic knowledge to their own practice and experience and to develop their fluency in talking about practice issues.

This course on youth work uses video case study material – one DVD featuring young people, one DVD featuring practitioners – as the basis of online discussions towards the end of each study block.

These discussions, each focused into a particular week, involve students sharing their individual answers to questions on the DVD material, building from basic descriptions, through comparisons, to more conceptual challenges.

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/252</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/252</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[Most students find it difficult to analyse deductive arguments, such as are found in the philosophy of Plato, especially when they are presented in discursive form. If given an exercise, intended to help them learn, they may simply skip to the answer rather than engage with the content.

This video-based activity uses talks students through analysis of the arguments, and also forces them to respond to questions before continuing.

The arguments are presented either as mini-plays, the dialogue spoken by actors, or as on-screen text, with parts highlighted by colours or displayed side-by-side for comparison. A narrator adds observations or evaluations about the arguments, and asks questions (eg “What premise was put forward here?”) which the student must answer from multiple choice responses before the next video clip is presented.
