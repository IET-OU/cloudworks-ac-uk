              <title>ARTiFactor&#39;s Dream&#39;s project; a reflection of my OLDSMOOC experience</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Art volunteers for FreeGeekTwinCities and initially envisioned creating</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->"a&nbsp;<strong>map of learning activities</strong>&nbsp;for raising participant's&nbsp;<strong>digital literacy&nbsp;</strong>competencies.&nbsp;Learners could jump in at any time, anywhere on the map,&nbsp;and find guidance to master that particular skill set.&nbsp;The map would be dynamic, continually being improved and expanded, much like in wikipedia." (<a title="ARTiFactor Dream Project" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6942">My Dream</a>)</p>
<p>Art has a BS in Physics Education and created his own curriculum for 10 years but has not been in a class room for thirty years. Art is a life-long-learner and is aware of many recent internet communication technologies.</p>
<p>For years Art has wanted to help people use the internet to realize their potential. He read that 2012 was the "year of the MOOC" and decides to enroll in his first mooc, OLDSMOOC&nbsp;"Learning Design for a 21st Century Curriculum".</p>
<p>For three weeks Art functioned much as he had during his 10 years in college. He tried to do what he thought the instructors wanted. If he was uncertain of expectations he watched and imitated his peers (vicarious learning).</p>
<p>Art was thrilled to learn new tools like MindMeister, NetVibes, BibSonomy, LucidChart,and Twitter. Trying to manage the tsunamy of new resources was overwhelming. He decided not to even start using Diigo because it only allowed 1000 bookmarks before hiiting a paywall . He did start to see why social bookmarking was valuable, though.</p>
<p>Week 4 theme was connecting or partnering up. It did not happen. Art suddenly realized he had not made an entry in his daily jounal after Day 20. Feeling lost and hoplessly behind Art decided to sign up for 2 more MOOCs. He did a week's worth of assignments in foeMOOC but 2 minutes after submitting his homework the foeMOOC was suspended. He jumped over to edcMOOC and did 5 weeks of work, submitted his unfinished oldsMOOC project for his digital artefact requirement and will probably get a certificateof participation.</p>
<p>Now it is Week 8 and Art wants to show his peers he is not a quitter. His Dream Project is not finished but he now realizes how similar it is to the learning design of oldsMOOC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to best enable participants to learn, Art agrees with the learning design theory that &nbsp;<strong>learning is enabled best when it involves an authentic project that the learner is passionate about, and that involves group work with discussion, reflection, cooperation, and peer assessment</strong>. Art's experience in oldsMOOC, leads him to believe that community building, and if necessary, facilitating "partnering up"&nbsp;be a requirement before practicing social networking. He hopes to structure the learning environment so that every participant's contributions are&nbsp;acknowledged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Art's project intends to provide and model using tools for knowledge aquisition, collaboration, reflection, construction, presentation, etc., facilitating networks between fellow students, and also faciltating networking with others contributing to their field of inquiry.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->"Self-organised learning networks provide a base for the establishment of a form of education that goes beyond course and curriculum centric models, and envisions a learner-centred and learner controlled model of lifelong learning."&nbsp;(<a title="Koper 2004 life long learning design" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2004.00427.x/abstract">Koper 2004</a>)</p>
<p>Art is joining up with teams working on similar projects; <a title="Peeragogy Handbook Project" href="http://peeragogy.org/">Peeragogy Handbook Project</a>, <a title="P2PU peer to peer learning" href="https://p2pu.org/en/">P2PU</a>, <a title="wikiversity.org" href="http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page">wikiversity.org</a>, and <a title="MozillaFestival participate" href="http://mozillafestival.org/participate/">MozillaFestival</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some challenges yet to be worked out are:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting site visitors to commit (click on the join button)</li>
<li>match up newcomers by interests (maybe a form that populates a spreadsheet)</li>
<li>scaling if numbers exceed capacity of server or number of facilitators</li>
<li>a way for voting up or down available OER</li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <title>Old learning habits and new technologies: the impact of choice, control and identity in the learning experiences of novice adult students using ICT</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6361</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6361</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This study highlights the role of ICT in potentially disrupting a learner&rsquo;s journey through the early stages of distance education at HE level.&nbsp; Adult learners entering distance education at HE level encounter a learning environment and learner support which are increasingly technologically mediated.&nbsp; In becoming university students, they are often expected to engage with ICT tasks designed around some explicit (or implicit) assumptions, which may not fit their situation or preferences.&nbsp; This study combines a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with a cluster analysis of survey responses to identify four distinct learner identity-types based upon use of ICT in daily life and for learning.&nbsp; The findings suggest that experienced learners new to ICT may have well-established habits and may attempt to incorporate new technologies into their familiar study patterns.&nbsp; This does not always work, and may lead learners to feel a loss of control and thus to reject the technologies in some circumstances.&nbsp; The study indicates that a student who is more experienced in ICT-mediated learning has an identity that better fits the typical assumptions of learning designers.&nbsp; This raises questions about the transition from novice ICT-learner to expert user and what may facilitate or hinder this process.&nbsp; There is a need to recognise learner identity as an important factor that may, in some cases, increase the likelihood of non-engagement with new technologies and thus increase the risk of non-completion of the course.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Review the Continual Professional Development available to careers professionals</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5143</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5143</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The same is true for continuing professional development (CPD), whose activities and definitions are complex and ill defined. Here too a plan will be produced for how content, quality, accessibility and participation in CPD can be progressed building upon the work already undertaken by relevant Sector Skills Councils. This will also consider the inclusion in CPD of specialisms to evolve such as LLD, HE, ICT, LMI, STEM etc. A first step towards improving professional practice is a commitment by individuals to engaging in CPD.&nbsp; The first step is to ask members of the profession to formally commit to this, and to a process for reporting the scale and nature of CPD they have undertaken.</p>
<p>OUTCOME: A plan for reviewing CPD, and if time allows, require the Associations&rsquo; members to declare their commitment to this. Including defined CPD requirements for members of the CPA and identification of the resources to keep skills and competencies up to date.</p>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5142</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The content, as distinct from the level, of initial training varies. Reviewing these variations and producing a more coherent approach will involve both paper-based review of curricula and consultation with providers and students and graduates of those programmes. This will inevitably take time. The review will respond to recommendation 7 of the Careers Profession Task Force, with particular emphasis given to STEM, ICT and LMI embedded as part of initial training. It will also examine current and future options for &lsquo;specialism&rsquo;s&rsquo; to evolve.</p>
<p>OUTCOME: A plan for how such work might be carried out, over what timescale and at what cost, including a descriptor of the skills and competencies required of all new entrants to the profession, and some clear recommendations on the route forward for individuals in the profession.</p>

              <title>Experimenting with a pedagogy of creativity and openness: multimedia for learning in computing and ICT</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3993</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3993</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This cloud presents a short video presentation created for the <a href="/cloudscape/view/2012" target="_blank">OU 2010 Conference <em>Learning in an open world</em></a>. It describes work being carried out as part of the development of the new IT and Computing course TU100 <em>My Digital Life</em> (out in October 2011).</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>TU100 incorporates the use of multimedia, open content and Web  2.0 tools in teaching and assessment. The materials presented here relate to Part 1 of Block 4, which introduces multimedia in a&nbsp; creative and practical way. Students will be asked to create their own short presentations to share and discuss with others, and the various activities around their presentations will contribute directly to assessment of their work in the block.</p>
<p><strong>The course materials</strong></p>
<p>Part 1 (B4) is  structured around the tasks involved in creating a video from stills  with a soundtrack using <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" target="_blank">Picasa</a> and <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>. I used these same tools to prepare the conference contribution.</p>
<p>The video-making is developed as the preparation of a response to Michael Wesch's <em>The  Machine is  Us/ing Us</em> (embedded below). The text explores some aspects of my reading of Wesch's video, in particular, around the idea of 'futures', picking up on a fundamental point: that  we've all got a <em> role</em> to play in creating the future rather than only  prophesying  about  it ('futurology').</p>
<p>In this way, while introducing some basic image and sound  manipulation processes, we're also exploring broader issues related to  borrowing, remixing and sharing materials on the Web, with a view to get  students thinking about what is at stake (in terms of, for example, copyrights) and where this may all be heading.</p>
<p>The video prepared as part of the course materials includes a soundtrack put together from piano samples taken from the<a href="http://www.freesound.org/" target="_blank"> FreeSound  Project</a> and some recordings of my daughter's voice, as well as images chosen  from the  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/" target="_blank">Creative Commons pool in Flickr</a>. The conference contribution uses a soundtrack (already a remix) from <a href="http://ccmixter.org/" target="_blank">ccMixter</a>. Students in the course will be given a Media Database compiled from various open content sources.</p>
<p>At this point, a Take 1 of the course video is available that needs a bit of work to incorporate useful feedback from others (and some improvements to the audio track). However, one  of the points of the Part is to illustrate that it's possible to do   interesting work without masses of expertise of expensive equipment. Perfection in a 'professional' sense isn't what we're after: we're after getting people thinking and engaged in a creative way.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Teachmeets in Hampshire, Oxfordshire and Milton Keynes (South East)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3679</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/3679</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi All</p>
<p>Has anyone seen about the Teachmeets that are happening  in the South East over the next few months?</p>
<p>For those of you  reading this who don't know what a teachmeet is, it is an informal  gathering that is organised by teachers for teachers to share real  classroom practice and to discuss ideas and themes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teachmeets  are free. There are presentation slots that can last between&nbsp; 2-7  minutes, but don't be put off by these presentations as the agreement  is...you are not allowed to be boring, no overkill with PowerPoint and  if you are a company you are not allowed to sell anything!&nbsp; If you are  not doing a presentation, you are still welcome to come along and be a  "lurker" - which means you can listen without having to participate!</p>
<p>There  is also plenty of time to talk to other colleagues to discuss things  like what you are currently doing in the classroom, what you would like  to be doing and how to do it.&nbsp; Basically it is an opportunity to share  ideas and information with fellow teachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The next teachmeet  (teachmeet Hampshire) is happening in Southampton on 20th May, then  there is one in Steventon, Oxfordshire (teachmeet fishbowl - focus is on  planning) on 17th June and then one in Milton Keynes on 7th July.&nbsp; If  you want further details, please visit  http://www.vital.ac.uk/community/course/view.php?id=289 MK one will be  put up as soon as we have confirmed all the details, so keep checking.</p>
<p>If  you've got any questions, please email me on  stephanie.young@vital.ac.uk, I'd be happy to hear from you!<img src="http://community.tes.co.uk/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" /></p>
<p>See  you there!</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
The fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) project is the Australian government's response to the national broadband network (NBN) tender. The tender ended with no winner as prime minister Kevin Rudd announced the FTTH project, which will be run by a company made up of a partnership between the government and the private sector. It is of interest to the education sector since many education tools are reliant on web 2.0 technology and broadband accessibility.

              <title>Emergence of new online spaces and communities</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/1329</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
A summary of the IPTS report on Pedagogical innovations in new ICT-facilitated learning communities (see overview cloud http://cloudworks.ac.uk/node/1326)
</p>
<p>
<br />
<b>Context and motivations for the study<br />
</b>Need for qualified workers<br />
Need for new skills for new jobs<br />
Lifelong learning and mobility<br />
Equity and active participation<br />
Quality and efficiency<br />
Creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship<br />
Lack of transformative impact through ICT in educational systems, although potential exists.
</p>
<p>
<b>Emergence of social computing <br />
</b>Wide take up<br />
Intensive usage<br />
Not only young people!<br />
Not only for leisure
</p>
<p>
Good example for language learning – livemocha ‘a powerful opportunity for people around the world to connect with language partners’
</p>
<p>
<b>Questions<br />
</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Can these emerging online spaces and communities provide learning that is relevant and useful?</li>
	<li>What can education and training systems learn from them?</li>
	<li>How could online communities benefit from lifelong learning and competitiveness in Europe?</li>
	<li>What are the risks and challenges?</li>
	<li>What should and could policies do?</li>
	<li>Online  community?</li>
</ol>
<p>
Preece (2000) an online community consists of 1. People who interact socially, 2. A share purpose that provides a reasons for the community, 2. Policies that guide people’s interactions, 4. Computers systems to support and mediate social interaction and facilitate a sense of togetherness
</p>
<p>
In networked online spaces collective actions also follow from individual activities possibly without shared purpose or sense of togetherness. Also these collective can contribute worth exploring – need for articulating the difference to community.
</p>
<p>
<b>Drivers for participation <br />
</b>1.    Socialising – world of warcract, social networking, YouTube<br />
2.    Production – FLOSS, wikipedia<br />
3.    Organisation – Workplace community, HE online course<br />
4.    Topic – TuDiabetes, Inter VproC, LiveMocha
</p>
<p>
Online platforms and facilities can enable different levels of communities to emerge
</p>
<p>
Often communities accommodation several aspects – especially organisation-based vs. horizontal typically had others drivers as well.
</p>
<p>
<b>Socialisation<br />
</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Examples – media sharing spaces, blogosphere, online social networks, entertainment</li>
	<li>Motivation (from OCLC, 2008) – young people its fun, older people its useful</li>
	<li>Activities (Pew/Internet 2006; OCLC, 2008) – creative expression, share and document knowledge and experiences, manage connections, resources, life</li>
	<li>Individual’s learning – express and build identity, reflect on one’s life when comparing with others (Park et al. 2008)</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Joint production, goal, task<br />
</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Examples – collaborative joint product development, open soure software development, crowd sourcng for a joint task, collaborative resources repository, social knowledge management systems</li>
	<li>Motivation – usefulness for oneself, external requirement, intrinsic interest</li>
	<li>Activiites – collaborative work according to community work model, create concrete products as outputs of work</li>
	<li>Individual learning – learn to work with others, negotiate, collaborate, observe the practices of others, learn from it</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Joint interest, situation expertise<br />
</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Examples – tool-based knowledge sharing, profession based communities, topic based support, personal health, well being, communtities for context and culture</li>
	<li>Motivation – connection and sharing with others and similar situations, need for personal support</li>
	<li>Activities – asking and giving advice, reading and following</li>
	<li>Individual learning – receiving quick and targeted personal guidance when needed, finding and participating in knowledge development for the area</li>
</ol>
<p>
<br />
<b>Organisation based<br />
</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Examples – community model within courses, integrating institutional environment with other resources, lifelong communities set up at institutions, informal workplace communities</li>
	<li>Motivation – requirement, usefulness, avoiding isolation feeling supported</li>
	<li>Activities – striving towards given goals, sharing resources, informal advice and support</li>
	<li>Learning – learn workplace culture to be part of a team, find and create ways for carrying out tasks, change the practices of the organisation</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Conclusion<br />
</b>Online spaces are increasing their importance in people’s lives<br />
Not all online spaces are communities, but they still can support learning
</p>
<p>
Through online communities people can find out, follow and participate much more than was possible before
</p>
<p>
Approaching communities through the member motivations and supported activities (production, topic, socialisation) could help in finding and developing online places and communities for learning
</p>
<p>
Communities within organisations vs horizontal communities can both have specific important features
</p>
<p>
What should and could be the goals and means in educational institutions
</p>
<ol>
	<li>To develop internal communities (learners, teachers)?</li>
	<li>To develop participation in external online spaces and communities?</li>
	<li>To develop horizontal communities?</li>
	<li>To differentiate between communities/online spaces they support?</li>
</ol>

              <description><![CDATA[In a subject such as ICT, new topics develop very quickly, and the body of relevant technical material is large and constantly changing. A course which includes such topics needs to encompass materials produced by the wider professional community, not only the teaching institution. To cover the relatively new topic of wireless sensor networks, this course requires students to search for relevant documents (using search tools, journal archives, databases, and library links), and review their contents with the guidance of a pro forma. They are then led through the study of certain documents in detail. They are supported by an online tutorial on information searching, and frequent self-assessment activities. [Chris Bissell]

              <description><![CDATA[In classroom teaching, students can be hesitant to participate especially in demanding activities such as those requiring critical evaluation.

This sixth-form college course in ICT uses VLE activities as preparation for classroom work. For example, where students are asked to critically evaluate a web-based resources, they post their observations to a discussion board over several days. In class, their contributions are discussed and the tutor provides feedback. This has led to more participation, and more reflective and deeper contributions.

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Some qualifications demand evidence of basic ICT skills, but marking and giving feedback on the entire range required is intensive of tutor time.
<p>
This social work course – part of a degree where the professional body requires the equivalent of the European Computer Driving Licence – includes staged ICT study sessions, in each of which students first read instructional materials and complete activities, and then take a 15 question computer-marked assessment (CMA). They can attempt each question three times, with reducing marks and increasing hints.
<p>
The CMAs, ICT-specific TMAs, and an ICT task in the end-of-course assessment are compulsory, so that the professional requirements are fulfilled.

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Reduce pressure on unconfident learners by teaching a balance of traditional and new skills, with material that is culturally acceptable and relevant. </strong></p>
<p>In this <a href="http://www.wea.org.uk/">WEA</a> course, British Asian women are trained in the use of computerised sewing machines. Some of the students have language and literacy difficulties, and one challenge is to overcome their fear in using computers. The computer component of the course is carefully balanced &ndash; eg 2 hours embroidery to 1 hour computing. Some internet activities, such as searching for patterns, are largely self-directed; use of the sewing machines is more strongly tutor-directed, with peer mentoring. Learners are not pressured to complete a portfolio. For some learners, a Women&rsquo;s Centre venue and creche facilities are necessary for them to be able to take part. Designs from the internet provide a more culturally relevant supplement to the designs of Disney characters which come packaged with the machines. [John Cook, Ian Harford]</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[Newcastle United Football Club’s premises includes a purpose-built learning centre, servicing over 1000 learners a week, attracted by the powerful draw of the football club.

In an informal, relaxed and inclusive atmosphere, learners select activities from an extensive range of programmes in literacy, numeracy and ICT, setting their own learning goals with the guidance of centre staff.

Self-directed online study, including interactive tutorials and simulations, helps everyone progress at their own pace.
