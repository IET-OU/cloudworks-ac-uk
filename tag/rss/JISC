<li>I have been a teacher/lecturer for many years, worked in different countries, taught different subjects, at different levels. I am originally from Sweden, but have lived in Ireland or Britain for many years. At the moment I am teaching English to Oman i students in Sohar, Oman. I am also an academic involved in research, mainly in English language and literature, which has been my discipline for the last 20 years. My PhD is in English literature. I am also interested in pedagogical matters, and have embraced using technology in teaching. Last year I completed an MA in Online and Distance Education (OU, UK). I want to learn more about the technical side of developing elearning material.</li>

<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p><a href="http://track.olnet.org/">Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr></a> is a <abbr title="Joint Information Systems Committee">JISC</abbr>-funded project to demonstrate technical solutions to the problem of tracking <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> (Open Educational Resources). As part of the Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> project we have developed a service to add license-tracker snippets to resources available through the <a href="http://oercommons.org/"><abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> Commons</a> portal.</p>
<p>And, here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>First visit the link track dot olnet dot org and put at the end a question mark, edge equals one, <a href="http://track.olnet.org/?edge=1">http://track.olnet.org/?edge=1</a> (this just means use experimental features)</li>
<li>Then make sure your browser's bookmarklets/ bookmarks bar is available</li>
<li>Then drag the bookmarklet that's in the bottom-left of the site to your bookmarks or favourites bar,</li>
<li>Now visit <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> Commons, <a href="http://oercommons.org">http://oercommons.org</a></li>
<li>Browse using the menus on the left, among the materials. I'll choose something from the Arts section. Here's a resource available through <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> Commons, the Aaron Copland Collection,</li>
<li>Then simply click on the bookmarklet you saved previously..</li>
<li>Wait a few [moments]&hellip;</li>
<li>And view the resulting license-snippet. You get a preview here, and some copy and paste here.</li>
</ol>
<p>By default the snippet uses <a title="Piwik open source web analytics" href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a> no-Javascript tracking and a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>. You can switch to Google Analytics, here, like so&hellip; Here's the Google Analytics [Java]script&hellip;</p>
<p>Additionally, you can change the license, for example using&hellip; the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike [License] like so.</p>
<p>Currently the Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> bookmarklet service is mostly a demonstration. It can be used by a publisher on small batches of OERs. Download the <a title="Track OER project code, on GitHub" href="https://github.com/IET-OU/trackoer-core">Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> code</a> and consider integrating it into your publishing workflow for full scale integration of tracking. We are considering extending the current functionality into an &ldquo;<em>Embed Me</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Embed 'n' Track</em>&rdquo; service for OpenLearn and <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> Commons.</p>

              <title>Track OER - impact</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6567</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>We're now at the end of the Track OER project, so this is a suitable point to consider the impact of the project and any next steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Google Analytics (and Piwik-based) license-trackers for the Bridge to Success downloadable archives/ Zips have undergone technical testing, and have been approved. They will be deployed to the production OpenLearn-Labspace environment in mid-November.</li>
<li>The license-trackers for B2S archives incorporate GA campaign tracking.</li>
<li>The CaPReT-Google Analytics and CaPReT-Piwik Javascripts have also undergone testing. They will also be deployed to LabSpace in mid-November.</li>
<li>We have contributed fixes to the <a title="Tatemae/capret on Github" href="https://github.com/tatemae/capret">original CaPReT code</a> base.</li>
<li>There is a demo bookmarklte service to add license-trackers to content available through OER Commons.</li>
<li>And all code is on Github, and available under a GPL-compatible open source license.</li>
</ol>
<p>On this basis the project has achieved what it set out to achieve - demonstrating practical analytics-solutions for OERs.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Apart from the deployments mentioned above, these are the next steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the current command line PHP batch processor (part of Track OER) as the specification for production-ready XSLT templates. This is the route to add license-tracking to OpenLearn and OpenLearn-LabSpace at scale.</li>
<li>"Tracking evidence" - find ways to integrate the Google Analytics data in (Google) maps in the <a href="http://ci.olnet.org/#org-orggmap">OLNet Evidence Hub</a>.</li>
<li>Document recipes to create and export analytics reports.</li>
<li>Explore an "Embed Me" / "Embed 'n' Track" button for OpenLearn (and OER Commons).</li>
<li>Show Creative Commons the project outputs.</li>
<li>Other dissemination activity.</li>
</ol>

              <title>Status, 26 September, CaPReT-GA, testing, performance - Track OER</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6494</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6494</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm a bit behind with my blogging and I have lot's to talk about, so let's dive in...</p>
<p>Way back on the 12 September I had two very useful meetings, including one with the wider Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> team/group. The response to our progress on the technical activities was positive. Some significant outcomes from the meetings were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we take the <a title="Cut and Paste Reuse Tracking" href="http://capret.mitoeit.org/">CaPReT</a>-Piwik work and extend it to <a title="Google Analytics" href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>? After some discussion we decided that this was my next high priority task.</li>
<li>A suggestion from <a class="@" rel="interwiki" href="https://twitter.com/guybarrett">Guy Barrett</a> regarding the [CaPReT-<abbr title="Microsoft Internet Explorer browser">MSIE</abbr> problem][cloud:6474] - can we put a HTML comment into the pasted content, to offer the user some help? <code>&lt;!--...--&gt;</code></li>
<li>Can we ensure that CaPReT/-Piwik/-<abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr> works with Drupal 6 - jQuery 1.3.2 (ie. an old version of the jQuery Javascript library)?</li>
<li>Can we ensure that the CaPReT Javascripts do not degrade the page load-times for OpenLearn, LabSpace and so on? (<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2007/05/10/performant-isn-t-a-word.aspx">Performant isn't a word</a>.. <a class="Define" rel="interwiki" href="http://google.com/search?q=define:performant">it is now</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I got stuck into Guy's suggestion straight away, and extended it to include a link to <a class="Toer" rel="interwiki" href="http://track.olnet.org/help/capret/ie">further sources of help</a>. You can see an <a class="Gdoc" rel="interwiki" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aGNOPFACD5KUbSPHELy9CVlrj2AJUzY18YJIZgJjrqI/edit">example of the comment in this Google Doc</a>.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to say that we have at least a partial solution for CaPReT-<abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr>. I've used <a class="Gdev" rel="interwiki" href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/eventTrackerGuide">Google Analytics event tracking</a>, with actions of 'copy' and 'view', the copied text as the event label, and the length of the copied text as the event value (for copy only). The copy action is fully tracked (source host and <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator,">URL</abbr>), but we haven't been able to get the destination host/<abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator,">URL</abbr>. This seems to be a limitation of Google Analytics. A CaPReT copy uses Javascript, while the tracker that is added to the copied text and used to track views of the pasted content is a no-Javascript web beacon (web bug). You may like to view an <a class="Toer" rel="interwiki" href="http://track.olnet.org/test/capret/math/course-ga">example of CaPReT-GA</a> - and try copying.</p>
<p>We've done some work on performance too, using Google's <a href="http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home">online Closure Compiler</a> to [compress the CaPReT Javascripts][Toer:build/capret]. If you wish to add a version of jQuery and change "whitespace-only" to "simple optimizations", <a class="Toer" rel="interwiki" href="http://track.olnet.org/build/capret/simple/1.8.0">try this build script</a>. The <a class="Toer" rel="interwiki" href="http://track.olnet.org/capret/build/capret-ga.min.js">minified CaPReT-GA Javascript is here</a></p>
<p>The third round of technical testing was put back a week, but I'm happy to say that Roger Moore and Mick Deal have shown great flexibility. Testing is underway this week, <a class="Gdoc" rel="interwiki" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-NUFoxRB2U2xha1TvHC5D25ZYTUPwIv5EDFLf9dVN5M/edit">using this test script</a>. It concentrates on <abbr title="Bridge to Success project">B2S</abbr> testing with campaign tracking, CaPReT-<abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr> testing, and a new strand C, testing the <a class="Toer" rel="interwiki" href="http://track.olnet.org/oerform?edge=1">OER Form service and bookmarklet</a>. I haven't talked much about this last point, but I'll leave that for a future post.</p>
<p>Nick, signing off. Over and out..</p>]]></description>

              <title>CaPReT, Javascript clipboard and Internet Explorer</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6474</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6474</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The big headline from technical testing of CaPReT, was that <a title="Thanks to Mick Deal/LTS Tech. Testing" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ci8U920B6DgydrBZZvYZxtvOTw_OpH1AnCX61-OWjpA/edit">copy and paste doesn't work as expected in Internet Explorer (versions 6 - 9)</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, in other browsers you can copy from a CaPReT Javascript-enabled page, and simply paste into an online rich-editor (we tested on live Cloudworks, which uses Tiny MCE).  This pastes the text with formatting, with the Piwik web-beacon image and attribution/license meta-data from the source page's <a title="Resource Description Framework - in attributes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">license RDFa</a> appended.</p>
<p>My apologies in advance for the technical complexities I detail below. I thought it best to record what we've found before we forget!</p>
<p>In Internet Explorer, when you try to do a simple paste it pastes the source HTML markup, escaped - so you see "&lt;a href="..."&gt;..&lt;/a&gt;..</p>
<p>Obviously this workaround is not elegant, so I've been looking at a better solution.  The crux of the issue is the way that CaPReT hooks into the Javascript "copy" event using <a href="https://github.com/niklasvh/jquery.plugin.clipboard">Niklas von Hertzen's jquery.plugin.clipboard Javascript</a>.</p>
<p>The Internet Explorer branch of this plugin's logic uses clipboardData.setData, which supports copying as "Text" or "URL" (no "HTML" value available).  When the user pastes the destination rich-editor handles the clipboard data as text, escaping and revealinfg the markup.  The plugin's logic for the other browsers manipulates the <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/range_intro.html">W3C Range</a> that is to be copied,  then hands over to the browser to actually perform the copy (that is, it doesn't prevent the default action).  So, when the clipboard data is pasted it is recognized as rich-text/HTML and works accordingly.</p>
<p>I've been exploring solutions using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ierange/">Tim Cameron Ryan's 2009 ierange Javascript</a>, and re-working von Hertzen's clipboard plugin.  So far unfortunately, I've been unsuccessful. ierange.js provides a shim for Internet Explorer, implementing the  <a href="http://w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Traversal-Range/">W3C Range specification (Version 1.0/ 2000)</a> and DOM Selection.  Manipulating ranges is a complex business and I haven't yet determined if the bugs are in ierange.js or my re-worked clipboard2 plugin.</p>
<p>I need to check priorities with my colleagues, but I am tempted to abandon the ierange/jquery.clipboard2 based solution for the moment, as it could become a big time-sink.</p>
<p>The work has not been in vain however, as I have a much better understanding of how Javascript interacts with the clipboard, and I've  <a href="https://github.com/tatemae/capret/issues/9">fixed a number of bugs</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/trackoer-core/blob/master/application/assets/capret/js/jquery.plugin.clipboard.js">fork of von Hertzen's jQuery Clipboard plugin used by CaPReT</a>.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Track OER - status, 29 August: looking back, looking forward..</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6449</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6449</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>We prepared for the first round of testing, with LTS Technical Testing team at The Open University. This involved writing <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hqqm1Rhmsi3SaWwMJ1mRE5gyyIdfFdxqM3D2LKxsYOc/edit">an initial test script</a>. And, significantly we relied on the <a href="http://capret.mitoeit.org">CaPReT evaluation server</a>, which does not have guaranteed up-time or support. So, we took a copy of the CaPReT Javascripts, and extended them to work with Piwik (capret-piwik.js).</p>
<p>Testing proceeded on schedule last week, and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ci8U920B6DgydrBZZvYZxtvOTw_OpH1AnCX61-OWjpA/edit">results are online</a>.</p>
<p>We also worked to separate the 'AlternateImage' Piwik plugin in to it's own project repository, and added two more Piwik plugins - 'ExternalLink' (a utility), and 'ContentReuse'. The growing <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6442">list of outputs is in the register</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I finished the command line batch processor. This is our initial solution to add license-tracker code into the HTML pages in the various Zip archives that can be downloaded from LabSpace. We are looking at XSLT solutions going forward, but this has enabled us to proceed with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIWRsGFQf4CmiPoHl3BMubz3w6TMiFN_oQbnuSKtQA0/edit">second round of testing this week</a>.</p>
<p>This week and next I'll be working on improving the Google Analytics Javascript to work on work on a local machine (the "file://" protocol). And looking at no-Javascript Google Analytics..</p>
<p>Last week:</p>
<ul>
<li> 20 August, trackoer-ga.js </li>
<li> 20,23,24,28 August, initial command line/CLI controller/ batch processor, </li>
<li> 21 August, setting up technical testing round 1, </li>
<li> 21 August, adding CaPReT test view(s) to trackoer-core based on LabSpace, </li>
<li> 21-22 August, capret-piwik.js </li>
<li> 23 August, Piwik 'ExternalLink' utility plugin </li>
<li> 24 August, separated Piwik plugins (now three) into separate Git repos. - set up .gitmodules/ sub-modules (git clone --recursive..) </li>
<li> 24-26 (Tuesday 28) August, Oercommons_serv </li>
<li> 28 August gajs.js </li>
</ul>
<p>Looking forward:</p>
<ul>
<li> Google Analytics solution for use on local machine ("file://" protocol) - looking at gajs.js - Remy Sharp, </li>
<li> Google Analytics no-Javascript solution, </li>
<li> Build script for CaPReT-Piwik Javascripts etc. </li>
<li> Bug fixes from weeks 1 and 2 of testing, </li>
<li> Prepare for 3rd round of testing, week of 17 September, </li>

              <title>Stipple and its potential usefulness for tracking OER</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6434</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6434</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Stipple is a&nbsp;a platform which facilitates the tagging of products and people in images. &nbsp;Both services use embedded javascript to track images as they are copied and distributed across the internet. &nbsp;The main technical difference between Stipple and TrackOER is to do with where the relevant javascript is located. &nbsp;Stiple is enabled by website publishers at the site level. &nbsp;If the code is installed then images can be tagged and these tags persist and are transferred over to other users.</p>
<p>Stipple conveys richer data than TrackOER as people are encouraged to add 'information and stories' to images. &nbsp;It does this through linking to 3rd party APIs: &nbsp;YouTube, Twitter, Soundcloud, Google Maps, etc. but you can also enter content directly or just add links. &nbsp;TrackOER simply registers when a resource has been re-used in some way (though we can get a lot of data from this alone).</p>
<p>Here's what Wikipedia has to say about their business model: "&nbsp;Stipple Pipeline allows brands to tag their products in photos uploaded to Stipple. Through Stipple Network,&nbsp;the photos are open to use by website publishers, who are paid by companies with products in the photos.&nbsp;Consumers can then click on the products tagged and buy them.&nbsp;As of May 2011, Stipple had contracts with nine photo agencies, 50 brands, and 1,300 publishers<sup id="cite_ref-Gannes_5-0" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->"</sup></p>
<p>Stipple could be seen as doing the inverse of TrackOER. &nbsp;Both are tracking the spread of resources across the web, but whereas TrackOER aims at improving OER, Stipple use the same analytics for targeted marketing and delivering advertising through images. &nbsp;Image tags are used like Adsense keywords to target advertising.</p>
<p>Stipple offers two kinds of analysis: &nbsp;how far (geographically) content has reached, and; the level of audience engagement (clickthrough, 'like', re-tweet).</p>
<p>They claim "Stipple makes sure your images are attributed to you and link back to you wherever they go. When you claim an image, your information and tags travel the web with it". &nbsp;It seems to me that using Stipple to track OER across the web in the same way as the TrackOER script is perfectly feasible. &nbsp;It might even be easy. &nbsp;You could get richer analytics as well as access to promotional tools. &nbsp;The links through to social media are also quite well done. &nbsp;However, you might not be able to get the analytics that you want.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Track OER - challenges &amp; lessons</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6431</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6431</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>We'll be documenting the various challenges we're experiencing, and the <a href="#lessons">lessons learnt</a>.</p>
<h2>Re-purposing analytics software (Google Analytics, Piwik)</h2>
<p>Problem type:  technical/ user-interface</p>
<p>Problem:  Analytics tools are conventionally used in scenarios where the person viewing the reports knows the <abbr title="Uniform resource locator,">URL</abbr> where the pages reside. In trying to track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> re-use, we present a different scenario where the destination <abbr title="Uniform resource locator,">URL</abbr> is unknown (and the server component is variable).</p>
<p>Solutions:  For Piwik, creative use of the '<code>url</code>' and '<code>urlref</code>' parameters in the <a title="Piwik tracking interface documentation" href="http://piwik.org/docs/tracking-api/reference/">tracking <abbr title="Application programming interface,">API</abbr></a>. For Google Analytics, creating and documenting custom reports, which reveal for example the destination 'hostname' (not reported by default).</p>
<h2>Acommodating the OpenLearn test and release cycle</h2>
<p>Problem type: technical/ management</p>
<p>Problem:  We are demonstrating the Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> technologies on OpenLearn-LabSpace, and this needs some technical changes to LabSpace, which need testing before deployment.</p>
<p>Solution:  Schedule testing early, plan, liase with OpenLearn colleagues.</p>
<h2>Lessons learnt &ndash; short intense projects can be productive</h2>
<p><em>"towards of the end of the project, a list of lessons that someone like you would find useful"</em></p>
<p>Like many development teams we are currently very busy, so we planned the development for Track <abbr title="Open Educational Resource,">OER</abbr> as a classic <em>"short intense"</em> project (aka, short fat project) (<a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6KXOxHIQEwIC&pg=PA28&dq=short+intense+project+management">KENDRICK, Tom. (2011). 11. How should I manage short, complex, dynamic projects?. In: - <em>101 Project Management Problems and How to Solve Them: Practical Advice for &hellip;</em> -: Amacom. p28.</a>). Having a developer working at nearly 100% on the project in a relatively short burst (first commit 8 or 9 August &ndash; development tailing off in the third week of September 2012) (<a title="Project activity graph on Github" href="https://github.com/IET-OU/trackoer-core/graphs/commit-activity">Project activity graph on Github</a>) proved to be effective. So one of my big lessons learnt is that scheduling a short intense project, with planning and preparation beforehand, can be a good idea.</p>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6430</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I'll be discussing some topics in more detail, but I thought it would be usful to give a brief run down of what we've been up to and what we'll be doing in the next week...</p>
<p>At the start of last week I forked Piwik and worked on the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6426">AlternateImage plugin</a>. I've already had some  <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/piwik-trackoer/issues/4">feedback on that work</a>, which is great.</p>
<p>In the middle of last week I was experimenting with the no-Javascript image-tracker based around Piwik, and I started on  <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/trackoer-core/">Track OER core</a>, which is a CodeIgniter-based web application. It provides short/clean-URL redirection to  the Piwik (<a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/trackoer-core/blob/master/application/libraries/trackers/Piwik_Tracker.php">Piwik_Tracker class</a>)  and Google Analytics (to do) web-beacons, some test and demonstration pages, form-tools (more on that later), and links to Piwik, the project blog and so on.</p>
<p>We were also configuring Piwik and trackoer-core on our demonstration server, and by the end of the last week, with the help of our <a href="http://www8.open.ac.uk/iet/main/core-services">IET-SST colleagues</a> (thanks Phil and Dave) and central IT, we had <a href="http://track.olnet.org/">Track.olnet.org</a> publicly visible.</p>
<p>My plans for the next few days are to blog about the project in relation to external APIs, and privacy. I'll be improving the current Piwik-based license-tracker snippet, and pressing on with the Google Analytics-based one. Oh, and testing, testing...</p>
<p>I alluded to the short/clean-URL redirection provided by trackoer-core above. Although I believe this is useful, the other key role of the redirector can be summed up by the comment and code on <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/trackoer-core/blob/master/application/libraries/trackers/Piwik_Tracker.php#L45">lines 45-6 of Piwik_Tracker.php</a>,  <em>"For the no-Javascript web-bug image, the OER's destination URL is the referrer."</em>&nbsp; This highlights one of the key challenges of this project - re-purposing tools like Piwik and Google Analytics from a scenario where the person viewing the  reports knows the URL where the pages reside, to an OER-reuse scenario where the destination URL is unknown (and the server component is variable).</p>
<p>(Note, please excuse the indentation/white-space inconsistency in the trackoer-core source files - I'll fix this over time.)</p>]]></description>

              <title>Extending Piwik for Track OER</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6426</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6426</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>A software component that we had in mind for the Track OER project from early on is Piwik.  <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a> is an open-source Web analytics tool, that offers similar features to Google Analytics,  in terms of logging page views, and outputting reports.</p>
<p>It offers a number of advantages over competitors:</p>
<ul>
<li> You host Piwik yourself, so it can be easier to debug problems, particularly for our no-Javascript work, </li>
<li> You also have more control over access to the analytics reports on the site, </li>
<li> Piwik has an extensive plugin interface, widgets, and an API to access data over the Web, </li>
<li> There is good documentation, and a wide community, </li>
</ul>
<p>To date I've found it quite simple to install and customize.  There are a number of considerations,</p>
<ul>
<li> As Piwik is self-hosted it needs to be installed on a robust server, with similar uptime/support to your other production servers  (if it goes down, you risk users seeing a broken image), </li>
<li> There may be issues around the new EU cookie laws -  many sites use Google Analytics, so adding another system to the mix may cause confusion and concern, </li>
</ul>
<p>Against this last point, I would say that precisely because Google Analytics is so prevalent, with Google able track journeys between sites and sell advertising, adopting something like Piwik may be seen as an advantage by some end-users.</p>
<h3>Web bug</h3>
<p>At the heart of most analytics systems, including Google Analytics and Piwik, and with/without Javascript, is a one-pixel hidden GIF image. This so-called Web beacon (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug">Web bug</a>) is hosted by the analytics server, and is used to record a user's visits.  (The Javascript provided by most analytics tools are merely wrappers around this web-bug, to add extra parameters like screen-resolution and browser capabilities among other things.)</p>
<p>One aim of the Track OER project is to explore the use of a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/">Creative Commons License</a> image in place of the hidden GIF.</p>
<h3>AlternateImage plugin</h3>
<p>So, to that end, we have <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/piwik-trackoer">forked Piwik</a> (<a href="https://github.com/piwik/piwik/network">network</a>), and created a plugin named  <a href="https://github.com/IET-OU/piwik-trackoer/tree/trackoer/plugins/AlternateImage">AlternateImage</a>. This adds an extra parameter named <code>img</code> to the <a href="http://piwik.org/docs/tracking-api/reference/">Piwik tracking API</a>, which is used to specify the image to display. The value takes the form <code>cc:{license}</code>, for example <code>cc:by-nc-sa</code>.</p>
<p>A standard Piwik no-Javascript tracking call takes the form,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Piwik Image Tracker --&gt;
&lt;img style="border:0" src="http://demo.piwik.org/piwik.php?idsite={$IDSITE}&amp;rec=1" alt="" /&gt;
&lt;!-- End Piwik --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extended tracking call looks like this,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Piwik Image Tracker --&gt;
&lt;img style="border: 0;" src="http://demo.piwik.org/piwik.php?idsite={$IDSITE}&amp;rec=1&amp;img=cc:by-nc-sa" alt="" /&gt;
&lt;!-- End Piwik --&gt;

<p>The AlternateImage plugin currently contains the larger 88 x 31 pixels PNG images. In time it will be extended with the compact Creative Commons License images,  with the parameter taking the form <code>?img=cc:by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/80x15</code> (URL encoded, naturally).  As an aside, the value for <code>img</code> is a form of <a href="http://w3.org/TR/curie">Compact URI</a>. So AlternateImage can be extended for other logos and icons.</p>
<p>You will be able to see Piwik and the AlternateImage plugin in use soon.</p>
<p>I've also found a very useful PHP library called <a href="https://github.com/wingdspur/codeigniter-piwik/">codeigniter-piwik</a>, and developed by Bryce Johnston (wingdspur).</p>]]></description>

The first 30 minutes will be led by me (Rebecca Galley) and will use the OULDI 'Course Features' and 'Course Map' resources to promote design thinking around four dimensions of the curriculum: Guidance &amp; Support; Content and Experience; Communication &amp; Collaboration; and Reflection &amp; Demonstration. The last 45 minutes will be led by Brock Craft and will use a Collaborative Sketching approach to support creative and collaborative thinking about MOOC technologies and pedagogies.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Track OER in a nutshell</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6392</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6392</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The Track OER project is funded as part of the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/ukoer3/rapidinnovation.aspx">Rapid Innovation strand of the UKOER</a> programme by the Higher Education Academy (HEA) and the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC).</p>
<p>The aim of Track OER is to develop and demonstrate software and techniques that can give quantitative data for the use and reuse of open educational resources. Currently, little data of this type exists. When an OER is taken from its host or origin server, in order to be used and reused the origin institution and the community generally lose track of it.</p>
<p class="figure"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/edtechie/4745363421/"><img title="Day #23 - Chatting with the Nessman by edtechie99, on Flickr" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4745363421_00c18f2ca3.jpg" border="0" alt="Day #23 - Chatting with the Nessman by edtechie99, on Flickr" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>The project contains two strands to address this problem. The first strand is the development of an easy to use no-Javascript web-bug. A web-bug is the 1 pixel transparent image that when included in a web page can be used to log its usage. While most analytics systems like <a href="http://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a> and the open-source <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a> wrap the web-bug in a Javascript library for ease of use and extended data-logging, a no-Javascript web-bug utilizes the image alone.</p>
<p>We will base our work on code developed in collaboration with Scott Leslie of BCcampus as part of the OLnet project (<a href="http://www.olnet.org/node/149">olnet.org/node/149</a> | <a href="http://snipplr.com/view/37647">snipplr.com/view/37647</a>). The existing code will be comprehensively re-worked to provide a working service linked to one or more analytics systems such as Piwik.</p>
<p class="figure"><a href="http://mashe.hawksey.info/2012/01/oer-visualisation-visualising-caprt-oer-tracking-data-day-32-ukoer/"><img title="CaPReT 'timemap' mashup by Martin Hawksey.

<p>The second strand is based on CaPReT - cut and paste reuse tracking. CaPReT has been developed by &nbsp;MIT and Tatemae (<a href="http://capret.mitoeit.org/">capret.mitoeit.org</a> &amp; <a href="http://github.com/tatemae/capret">github.com/tatemae/capret</a>) to track the informal use of OERs. It is an innovative and promising tool that is currently limited to text resources. Our work will seek to extend CaPReT to log the copying of image and multimedia resources.</p>
<p>Both these strands will be piloted on <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk/">OpenLearn-Labspace</a> and initially on the <a href="http://labspace.open.ac.uk/b2s">Bridge to Success OER modules</a>.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>There has already been some discussion about what models and tools we might use to help us review and articulate the design problem space in advance starting of any MOOC design work proper. So far the models on the table are:</p>
<p>Simon Cross's <a href="http://latestendeavour.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/the-lattice-model-for-designing-learning-defining-the-design-problem-space-and-guiding-the-design-solutions/">Lattice Model</a> and Yishay Mor's <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BneOQmlmG6ZQFUIjVWehA487g7-_-Gpi36-d41rzlwY/edit">Scenario/ Force map</a> tool</p>
<p>To summarise our discussions so far, I think that we feel that Simon's lattice model is too complicated to use in an activity, so we think we will probably use Yishay's activity and then review activity outputs using the Lattice Model (correct me if I'm wrong anyone!) so that we can begin to locate priorities and concerns.</p>
<p>Do you know of any other learning design tools we might use to define the problem space at this early stage? Please join in :-)</p>]]></description>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The JISC-funded OULDI project sees 'learning design' as an all encompassing term to cover the process, representation, sharing and evaluation of designs from single activities, right up to whole curriculum level designs. We are interested in providing support for the entire design process; from gathering and sketching out initial ideas, through consolidating, producing and using designs, to sharing, reuse and community engagement. We see learning design as a conscious, creative and social activity, where tools, representations and resources of learning design frame, guide and mediate discourse between individuals within and across programme teams.</p>
<p>Central to our method has been the use of tools and activities to prompt shifts in the thinking and working practices of programme teams from an isolated belief-based implicit approach, to more collaborative, systematic, explicit and empirically informed curriculum design.</p>
<p>In this presentation we review a number of evaluation strategies we have used across five UK universities for capturing these shifts in thinking and practice, evaluating the impacts of this approach on individuals, academic programme teams and the institutions as a whole as well as discussing critical success factors for adoption in other settings.</p>
<p>Keywords: <em>learning design, evaluation, impact,</em></p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>LUCERO (Linking University Content for Education and Research Online &mdash; <a href="http://lucero-project.info/">lucero-project.info</a>) is a collaboration between KMi, the OU Library and the Faculty of Arts, working in partnership with many other parts of the OU in order to apply linked data technologies and principles to public information from the OU. Linked data relates to the principles and technologies to make data which might usually sit in dedicated repositories accessible and linkable on the Web. The aim of LUCERO is therefore to build, sustain and exploit a linked data platform exposing linked data from OU's repositories and research projects: <a href="http://data.open.ac.uk/">data.open.ac.uk</a></p>
<p>In this presentation, we will introduce the technical and organisational challenges related to setting up such a platform and populating it with data from a large variety of sources (Study at the OU, ORO, OpenLearn, Podcasts, databases from research projects, etc.) More importantly, we will discuss the benefits brought by the use of linked data in this context, both internally through better access to inter-connected information, and externally, through making our data reusable by others and better connected to others. We will in particular detail some of the applications that are being developed to support OU students and researchers with their use of public data.</p>

<p>I'll be live blogging...</p>
<p>Linked Data panel, 11:00 16 February 2011.<br /><br />Panel, left-to-right:<br />* Alex ?, OpenStreetMaps, OpenOxford.<br />* ? works with Alex.<br />* ?<br />* ?<br />* Steve Owen, Lucero Project, OU.<br />* Ton Hirst.<br />* Adrian ? Lincoln university - we aren't doing linked data, but we are doing lots of JSON, ...<br />* ?<br /><br />--<br />'Open' - if there is no open license, then people can't build a business plan around your data - too risky<br /><br />Use 'data' specific license - or Public Domain.<br />* Don't use a Creative Commons License.<br />* Except CCZero / ...<br /><br />Open Knowledge Foundation<br />* Maximum of Attribution-ShareAlike.<br />* Can't say 'NonCommercial'<br /><br />Universities - 2 types of data:<br />1. Products of research (products of teaching?)...<br />2. Infrastructure - where my buildings are, where to get coffee...<br /><br />Attribution can be difficult, messy espec. for mashups...<br />* So, PublicDomain + an attribution norm. - so make a requirement for every data-item in a mashup.<br />* An about page for your mashup application.<br /><br />Suggestion - analytics is the point - how is my research data used?<br />* Tony - referer from an about page.<br />* Pingback, as in blogs...<br /><br />The 5 stars - of linked open data:<br />* 1 star - Put it on the web, any way.<br />* 2 stars- Machine-readable, but not proprietary format.<br />* 3 stars- In an open-format - CSV, JSON...<br />* 4 stars- Assign unique addresses to everything - URLs.<br />* 5 stars- Joining up the data.<br />-- Open is more important than linked.<br /><br />So, Alex - Open/Mobile Oxford- OpenStreetMap - 4 stars.<br /><br />** Conclusion - Cloudworks/ CloudEngine API needs an open-license.</p>
<p>An example - Cap Gemini - linked but not open. Apparently, Cap Gemini produce and consume linked data internally each day as part of their business processes. However, it is private, and so not open.</p>

<p>Bidding is a two stage process, with the initial submissions being lightweight to cut down on time spent reading and writing bids.</p>]]></description>

<div>
<p>The &lsquo;Co-generative Toolkit&rsquo; is a package of online resources to  support the planning, design, implementation and assessment of curricula  in higher education.</p>
<p>The toolkit, produced as an output of the JISC-funded <strong>Co-genT Project</strong>, was primarily set up to facilitate the co-generation of curricula by academics and employers <em><a href="http://resources.glos.ac.uk/tli/lets/projects/cogent/index.cfm" target="_blank">more...</a></em><br /> However, the resources are practical and versatile tools which can be  used by education professionals, employers, students, and the wider  public e.g. individuals who are seeking information on higher education  entry levels and provision across the sector.  Some functions are  restricted to registered users, but in general, the databases are  accessible to all.  The site as a whole is moderated by the Co-genT  Project Team.</p>
<p>The toolkit comprises four separate, but interfacing, components.  These are the <strong><em>Vocabulary Builder</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Outcome Builder</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Task Builder</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Design Builder</em></strong>.

              <title>Activity: 30 mins: Learning Outcomes view</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This representation maps a learning design at the meso- (middle or intermediate) level. It provides a view which shows how the learning activities and assessment tasks are aligned with the learning outcomes that are intended in the course or module. This view is informed by John Biggs&rsquo; work on Constructive Alignment (Biggs, 1999). The premise behind constructive alignment is twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students construct meaning      from what they do to learn.</li>
<li>The teacher aligns the      planned learning activities with the learning outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>This activity will provide a very quick introduction to the CompendiumLD learning design tool and the Learning Outcomes view. We strongly recommend that after this taster activity you try out the real thing - watch the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/index.php/cloud/view/1874">Getting Started with CompendiumLD</a> SlideShow!</p>
<p><strong>What you need</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A piece A3 paper </li>
<li>A page of CompendiumLD node      stickers. (See embedded .pdf doc below. This can be downloaded from      SlideShare) </li>
<li>A course or module to map      out (real or scenario)</li>
<li>Pens</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>Using the CompendiumLD Learning Outcomes icon stickers, identify and map out the higher level learning outcome(s) for the module, establish how the achievement of this/these outcome(s) can be monitored and measured (assessed), define the learner activities that will enable learners to achieve these outcomes, and the outputs you expect the activities to generate. Use the node stickers to map out your activity on the A3 paper. Decide yourself the best way to structure your map and use pens to make and explain links between nodes.</p>
<p>As you are working, ask yourself design questions for example:&nbsp; Is there an alignment between the&nbsp;outcomes, learner activity, learner output and assessment? Who or what is at the centre of the design? What is your design intent, and what are the challenges or barriers to achieving this? (20 mins)</p>
<p><strong>Respond</strong></p>
<p>Consider the following questions and add to the discussion below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who might be interested in      seeing this view of your module or course? </li>
<li>How easy do you think it      would be for someone else to understand your map? What could you add to      your map, or how could you restructure it, to help them understand?</li>
<li>(For support teams) How      might a CompendiumLD map of a course help you talk to course teams about      the resources, advice, tools and activities you department offers?</li>
<li>Where in the course design      process do you think course teams could usefully complete this activity?      (10 mins)</li>
</ol>
<p>This activity format is based on the <a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/beyond-distance-research-alliance/carpe-diem-folder">e-tivity format</a> developed by the Adelie Project Team working on the Carpe Diem project.</p>

<p>Crowdsourcing is the term used when this problem is broadcast to a wide audience or community that could solve the problem collectively. Mundane tasks could be outsourced to a motivated and enthusiastic community of experts. The community can assess the answers and provide the quality assurance. Wikipedia is probably the best example of crowdsourcing on the web at present.</p>]]></description>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em><strong><a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/events/2010/07/the role of the change manager - ros penny.ppt" target="_blank">Open session slides in a new window</a></strong></em><strong><em><br /></em></strong></p>
<p>The role of the change manager in an Institution is often overlooked.&nbsp; The first part of this session will explore the importance of the role, how change agents within the institution can be identified and what it takes to be an effective change manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second part of the session will comprise a real life example from the University of Derby where the students became the change agents during the rollout of the DERBI project <a href="http://www.derby.ac.uk/experience/jisc-enrolment-project">http://www.derby.ac.uk/experience/jisc-enrolment-project</a> .&nbsp; Sue Morrison and Jean Mutton will talk through the service design techniques and tools they used, how these can be applied across other areas within institutions and provide valuable insights into their successes and challenges.</p>
<p>There will be plenty of time for questions, thoughts and ideas in the third and final part.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Session Overview</em></strong></p>
<p>In the current cost-cutting climate, the success of projects is becoming paramount to the reputation and future funding provision for Institutions. The biggest risk to a project is lack of understanding of how to approach and manage the work or incorrect use of a methodology.&nbsp; This session explores the use of 2 methodologies, their benefits and the types of project for which they are appropriate.&nbsp; The session will include real life examples and an opportunity to discuss the issues facing you and your project.&nbsp; It will look at how adoption of elements of a methodology can vastly improve the success of your project.</p>
<p><strong><em>Session Chair</em></strong></p>
<p>Alistair Miles</p>
<p><strong><em>Speakers</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Agile Methodology - David Flanders&nbsp;- JISC Programme Manager - Information Environment Team</li>
<li>Prince2 / Prince2 light - John Burke&nbsp;- JISC Infonet</li>
<li>Some general pitfalls of applying methodologies: Mark MacGillivray (odaesa</li>
<li>Agile Representatives: Ben Charlton (Shuffl, University of Kent); Tony Hirst, (jiscPRESS,&nbsp;Open University) ; Graham Klyne (Oxford University)</li>
<li>Prince2 Representatives: Len Tildsley&nbsp;(Shrewsbury College),&nbsp;Jonathan Day (Lancaster University)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>What can delegates expect to learn / gain / take away from the session?</em></strong></p>
<p>This session will provide an overview of Agile and Prince2 methodologies (with real life examples) to allow delegates an insight into ways in which they can improve management of their projects. Project managers leave the session with a greater awareness of project management methodologies and the enthusiasm to follow up further using resources highlighted in the session &ndash; i.e. Infokit on Project Management and details on Agile.</p>
<p><strong><em>Who should attend?</em></strong></p>
<p>Delegates with an interest expanding their knowledge base&nbsp;of Project Management tools and&nbsp;methodologies and their practical application</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>OpenSpires is the Oxford University OER initiative sponsored by JISC and HEFCE, from May 2009 to April 2010. The aim of the initiative is twofold: 1) to provide the University's audio and video resources available online for free to a wide audience and 2) to enable the institution to investigate the impact and implications of making its resources available as OER.</p>
<p>Like most UK institutions, Oxford also licenses their content under the Creative Commons License,&nbsp;<a style="color: #0066ff; text-decoration: none; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: initial;" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/">BY-NC-SA</a>.

<p>Most of the content at OpenSpires is in the form of audio podcasts. This is because the University decided to build upon their ITunesU initiative.

              <title>What is a Design Atelier? </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2715</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2715</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Prompted by an interesting discussion at a JISC Cluster Meeting I have created this cloud to explore further what a Design Atelier actually is?&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Background<br /></strong>The <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearning/curriculumdelivery/atelierd.aspx">ATELIER-D</a> project takes as its starting point the centuries-old methods of learning and teaching in the studio of a master artist or craftsperson. The project brings the spirit of the atelier into the 21st century. It develops the notion of the &lsquo;virtual design studio&rsquo; using ICTs to create powerful learning and teaching environments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In his keynote presentation at the OpenLearn conference&nbsp;30-31st October 2007 at The Open University (OU), John Seeley Brown used the term &lsquo;atelier&rsquo; to characterise an emerging form of learning and teaching based on social networks, a distinct participatory approach by learners and teachers and pedagogy rooted in practice. Seeley Brown drew on his experience in architecture education but many in the parent domain of design education will recognise the well-established and powerful approach offered by the atelier (see link below).<br /><br />As part of the JISC funded ATELIER-D project the OU are researching how a virtual atelier can be created using the latest Web 2.0 tools that support a wide range of distance learning designs students.<br /><strong><br />This cloud<br /></strong>This cloud seeks to promote discussion about what you think a Design Atelier is?</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the key attributes that make up a Design Atelier?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>What makes it so special?</li>
<li>Is the nature of the physical space important?&nbsp; Should it be large and open or small&nbsp; and private?</li>
<li>What type of teaching methods should be used?</li>
<li>How can communication be used to support learning?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>This link&nbsp;below takes&nbsp;you to a short video clip to prompt the discussion. <br />Your thoughts and views are most welcome.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Peter argued that Universities current ways are working are not sustainable. He identified the challenges of Universities as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining standards</li>
<li>Rising demand and widening participatrion</li>
<li>Strained resources</li>
</ul>
<p>He suggested that in order to survive they need to become 'edgeless' and that technology can help with this, supporting collaboration, availability of information and people ie that technology is/ should be central to the way institutions provide learning and facilitate research.</p>
<p>In the second part of the keynote he suggests that Universities can embrace technologies in different ways in the move towards edgelessness - helping teachers teach and learners learn, communicating research and in thinking about ways of connecting with the world. He invited the audience to vote on the issues.</p>
<p><strong>Helping teachers teach and learners learn</strong></p>
<p><strong>Priorities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Teaching students to analyse information and work collaboratively</li>
<li>Putting lecture notes, podcasts and videos on line</li>
<li>Providing more interative teaching</li>
<li>More online contact with students</li>
<li>Training staff and academics</li>
</ul>
<p>In a vote the audience of this keynote thought the first and last of these should be priorities.</p>
<p><strong>Inhibitors and challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Staff skills and awareness</li>
<li>Staff engagement and willingness to learn</li>
<li>Lack of institutional interest or leadership</li>
<li>A lack of resources to invest</li>
<li>It's difficult to know what and when to change</li>
</ul>
<p>The audience said the 3rd of these most significant - if you get this right the rest will follow.</p>
<p><strong>Priorities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Making research more freely available</li>
<li>'Curation' of research data</li>
<li>Openness with institutions' data</li>
<li>Promoting shared resources</li>
<li>Understanding researchers'/ academics' needs</li>
</ul>
<p>Promoting shared resources scored the most highly.</p>
<p><strong>Priorities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>New more flxible degree courses</li>
<li>Links with alternative providers like School of Everything</li>
<li>More purely online provision</li>
<li>Collaboration between institutions</li>
<li>Staff training in supporting new kinds of learning</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inhibitors and challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The way formal education in funded mitigates against innovation</li>
<li>We don't know enough about what learners want</li>
<li>It's hard to balance online provision with face to face needs</li>
<li>Universities should retain the current models of teaching provision</li>
<li>maintaining a pursuit of 'widening participation'</li>
</ul>
<p>The first of these was considered fundemental by the voters.</p>
<p><strong>Catalysts for change</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Staff training and support</li>
<li>Supporting collaborative research platforms</li>
<li>A greater recognition of and status for high quality teaching</li>
<li>Understanding the value and role of your university</li>
<li>More resources dedicated to improving the use of technology</li>
</ul>
<p>Middle one scored higher than the others here.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>From the website:</p>
<p><em>"The programme focussed on the learner voice. Learners allowed us into their worlds and showed us what it is like to study in a technology-rich age. The projects produced a huge collection of rich, detailed data that sheds light on what learners expect from the use of technology in post-compulsory education and the choices they make about using technology to support their study.</em></p>
<p><em>The research took a holistic approach to technology use. We were not so interested in how technology is used on one module, or in one part of the institution, as in how learners interact with technology throughout their learning lives.</em></p>
<p><em>The resources here will be of interest to teachers and staff supporting learning in post-16 education, researchers of student learning, e-learning developers, policy-makers and institutional managers.

<p>She argues that the use of technology in learning, <em>and learning design itself</em>,&nbsp; has tended to increase this distance. She suggests that good designs will make explicit this distance.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>During the November Cluster C CAMEL meeting, Helen Beetham pointed out that although we clearly share similar understandings about what we mean by Learning Design, we had not as a Cluster made our understanding explicit. One of the shared assumptions about Learning Design that she highlighted was that we seemed to see design as a series of interlinked and sequential processes (have I summarised that correctly Helen?!)</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are our assumptions about Learning Design? What are the simularities and differences? </strong></p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>During the sessions with Alison Muirhead and Helen Beetham at the Cluster's November CAMEL meeting, some key challenges in evaluating the impact of the projects were identified. (See also Grainne's notes from the session with Alison <a href="/cloud/view/2650">here</a>). Broadly these questions were asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>How might we evaluate the <em>quality</em> of designs? What criteria are we using?&nbsp; Are they the same across the projects? </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What do we mean by the terms '<em>sharing</em>' or '<em>community</em>'? Do we mean the same things? How do we evaluate and document change in these?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How will we capture the impact of the 'principles' on practice? How can we be 'sure enough' that the changes we discover are as a result of the interventions we make?</li>
</ul>]]></description>

<ul>
<li>How has the baseline reports informed your evaluation plans? </li>

<li>How to measure time on course creation activities?</li>
<li>Understanding what people are doing with that time?</li>
<li>How to measure the softer aspect?</li>
<li>Project as a messy, complex environment, doesn&rsquo;t occur in isolation and so how can we really attribute outcomes to this specific project</li>
<li>Can we pin down what are our core concepts, can we look at this in terms of our evaluation? </li>
<li>Time is a really interesting aspect of looking at design&hellip;. </li>
<li>Measure of time or quality of outcomes</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s all about helping teachers to improve learning and teaching</li>
<li>How do we assess quality of the designs</li>
<li>How do you assess how much L&amp;T strategy has been taken into account?</li>
<li>Quality is about meeting certain benchmark?</li>
<li>Measuring impact of intervention (on learners)</li>
<li>Evaluating design not in development</li>
<li>Strathclyde know the REAP principles work but its getting them into practice that is the tricky bit</li>
<li>Is it about measures of risk and measure of usefulness to the different stakeholders, its about measures of application</li>
<li>Effect of other variables </li>
<li>Getting principles into practice is tricky!</li>

              <title>JISC Cluster C curriculum design baseline reports </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2649</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2649</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This cloud summarises the discussions at the JISC Curriculum Design Cluster C meeting in Milton Keynes on 11th November 2009. Cluster C consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Open University - JISC-OULDI</li>
<li>Strathclyde Univers ity - Principles in Patterns</li>
<li>Ulster University - Viewpoints</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cluster C &ndash; meeting 11<sup>th</sup> November 2009</strong></p>
<p><strong>Helen Beetham &ndash; Baseline report</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Has read all three baseline reports and looks for common themes and differences</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Questions to focus on</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the state of play of learning design and what are the opportunities for individuals&nbsp; - what do we have in common and how do we differ?</li>
<li>What externally facing outcomes can we bring forward to help other institutions use learning design approaches more effectively</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Focus of the cluster could be deemed to be around learning design</li>
<li>Might want to consider producing a joint report from the cluster</li>
<li>Three things  
<ul>
<li>Commonalities</li>
<li>Differences</li>
<li>Outputs</li>
<li>A particular approach to curriculum design, based around learning design</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Commonalities</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum      design as a series of linked decisions &ndash; design as multidimensional,      design as a series of decisions informed by educational theory</li>
<li>Focus      on pedagogical aspects of those decisions</li>
<li>Attempts      to ensure learning/pedagogical design is given due importance, time,      representation etc within curriculum processes</li>
<li>Interest      in representation and sharing of good designs</li>
<li>The      value in 'patterns', 'designs', 'principles' or otherwise abstracted      representations of good design practice</li>
<li>The      specific benefits of visual representations (again this as a research      issue as well as an implementation agenda)</li>
<li>Institutional      restructuring, linked to streamlining/efficiency in curriculum process</li>
<li>Interest      in points of intersection between institutional policy (or large-scale      statements of educational good practice) with the pragmatics of design &ndash;      how are they mutually informed?</li>
<li>Developing      practical design tools that are integrated into current curriculum      processes</li>
<li>Ensuring      information, advice and guidance about design practice are available and      useable at key decision points.</li>
<li>A      clear differentiation of issues at task, module and programme level (see      e.g. PiP's tables)</li>
<li>Thesis      that a focus on learning tasks would support a more learning-centred      design process (focus on what learners will actually be doing as they      learn will enhance the learning experience).</li>
<li>An      interest in actual design practice as a research issue (see OU table of      design representations from baseline report)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Questions for discussion</em></p>
<p>Do we have an overarching theory or research question?</p>
<p>Do we have an over-riding priority for institutional development?</p>
<p>Do we have a shared vision of what success looks like?</p>
<p><em>Discussion</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps we need to have a more clearly articulated vision for the work of each project and over</li>
<li>Interest in learning and teaching and how learning design can improved that</li>
<li>Have to accept that this is multi-levelled and need to take account of the different aspects</li>
<li>Also about the mapping out the approval process shifts the emphasis to design decisions.</li>
<li>What is the state of play of learning design as we understand it &ndash; in reality in most institutions its around approval and it&rsquo;s a more administrative process than pedagogically driven. The real design is a software more tacit process</li>
<li>Is learning design a noun or a verb?</li>
<li>What does a good pattern look like that others can copy &ndash; LD as noun and then there is a the practice of using it , the process/practice of design - LD as a verb</li>
<li>There are lots of uses of the word tacit in the reports which point to this type of behaviour</li>
<li>There are lots of different interpretations of learning design</li>
<li>Is there a thing as a unified entity that is being represented in different ways or are there simply multiple representations? </li>
<li>There may be difference amongst the projects in terms of how designs get represented and shared? </li>
<li>The common problem: there is a mismatch between the formal and informal aspects of design or the business /educational aspects of design. </li>
<li>Informal/educational designs are fairly poorly represented. A lot of innovation may go on under the institutional radar. One solution is to say this is ok, educational design is tacit and professional. Would be good to represent the informal design more clearly and then share that. </li>
<li>Representing the process may be problematic, whereas capturing the output would be good. </li>
<li>Stakeholders are being asked to make decisions on the pedagogical validity of courses where they don&rsquo;t have any details to help them do that</li>
<li>Research interests of the cluster are about how you represent designs and how you share them? Viewpoints projects tools are a way to do that, PiP&rsquo;s thinking about the process teachers go through. </li>
<li>There is no similar process for different course teams and development</li>
<li>Output from the cluster &ndash; describing the educational thinking would be really useful</li>
<li>Our view as a cluster is that the process of educational design is to be principles rather than constrained<em>&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Differences</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Different institutional missions and priorities (obviously), e.g. Strathclyde: technology, research mission, links to business and local communities, international recruiting profile, Ulster: flexibility, innovation, creativity in curriculum design; coordinated first-year experience; Somewhat different focus for transformation arising from these differences, e.g. Strathclyde: assessment and feedback; Ulster: first-year programme design; The OU would seem to provide a unique case, for several reasons many deriving from the integral role of technology in managing distributed course teams, centralised control, and the sheer economies of scale. Though interesting that the 'reflections' at the end of the report record similar problems to other institutions e.g. version control, over-complexity, lack of ownership of parts of the process</li>
<li>However, I'm interested that the OU has been particularly successful at developing a quality enhancement approach that brings together business-related factors&nbsp; (opportunity review and the business case) with academic questions (learning outcomes, teaching and assessment strategy), within a policy framework (OU Futures), with reference also to educational research/evidence base. The OU curriculum strategy also requires all staff to have or develop skills in teaching online and in learning design. Could these approaches be replicated in other institutions? What would that look like</li>
<li>Issue of design(er)&rsquo;s &lsquo;distance&rsquo; from the learning event: how far is it helpful to understand design as a distinct process from the implementation and enactment of the learning activity?</li>
<li>Question: what is the real value of case studies to designers? OU and Strathclyde staff have reservations: what kinds of representation are accessible, 'trusted', pragmatically actionable? There are different views in terms of the value of case studies</li>
<li>Changing roles &ndash; there are some tensions and differences between projects</li>
<li>How is educational thinking represented to students?</li>
<li>What is the role of designers and how much are they embedded?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Discussion</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Are our projects different parts of the same picture &ndash; is there a bigger picture about learning design that the projects are addressing different aspects of?</li>
<li>Or are there tensions and issues within our overall theory/vision, which it might be productive to explore through the different projects trajectories?</li>
<li>There are differences given the missions, but underneath there is a lot of similarities. All the clusters reference the learning and teaching strategies and similar terms such as enhancing the student experience</li>
<li>Distance can both be about physical distance and temporal. Design for a year later will be very different. Also distance in terms of involvement &ndash; designers who may be little involved in the actual running of the course. &nbsp;People delivering courses are interested in how to actually instantiate at the task level, they are having to interpret the designers intentions</li>
<li>There is an interesting issue in terms of how much the academic is the actual designer? </li>
<li>Can technology collapse some of the distances of time, space and role that occur in the design process? One of the other projects is looking at use of the e-portfolio system, Mahara</li>
<li>Are there ways in which aspects of the design can be left open? How might this be represented</li>
<li>Gap between those who design and choose the resources and those who teach</li>
<li>Actually exciting to think about the idea of thinking &lsquo;distance from the learner&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;learner-centred&rsquo; as an either/or, how far from the learner are decisions about design being made</li>
<li>What is it that each stakeholder will need from each of the different representations</li>
<li>We need a small number of killer questions that get to the heat of the course team&rsquo;s educational thinking. Are there diagnostic of an educational design team need to think. Strathclyde 12 principles for assessment. </li>
<li>Question of value &ndash; how you address that? Difference between immediate and longer term value</li>
<li>There are a different set of value representations/ways of sharing practice &ndash; need to identify this, see when they are useful and by whom</li>
<li>Purpose and solution &ldquo;I want case studies&rsquo;&rdquo;- actually means &ldquo;I want to be told what to do&rdquo; People are looking for specific things for a specific purpose. Parallel with students wanted &lsquo;worked example&rsquo;</li>
<li>Mod4L project did a lot of work looking at different forms of presentation in an earlier JISC project</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key outputs suitable for external communication</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strathclyde's design 'tables' (pp 17-21 of baseline report)</li>
<li>Strathclyde's REAP assessment and feedback principles</li>
<li>OULDI's guidelines on various aspects of learning design</li>
<li>OU business models: OU classic, Wraparound, Brought-in, Disaggregated Assets (Learning Objects), Empty-box and web 2.0. </li>
<li>OU survey of staff attitudes to use of technology, to visualisation of the curriculum, and to current design practices/representations (of general interest &ndash; though unclear how OU-centric these attitudes are)</li>
<li>Viewpoints diagrams (process framework, reference information, process support, and outputs), anonymised, for a range of curriculum design processes &ndash; x-ref with Strathclyde's 'tables'???</li>
<li>Notion of a 'complex gateway' (Strathclyde) and a 'stage gate' (OU) &ndash; useful for thinking about the design process? Can we define some of these in inter-institutional terms?</li>
<li>Analysis, evaluation and other representations (walk throughs, guidelines etc) relating to specific applications e.g. cloudworks, compendium LD, viewpoints course tools</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What else is there?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What are credible indicators of transformation in the direction of the articulated vision, this evidence will be a highly values outcome!</li>
<li>What other types of outcome will be valued by our own and other institutions?</li>
<li>What could we be producing now to articulate the vision beyond this cluster</li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Outline of the day</h2>
<p>9.30 &ndash; 9.45&nbsp; Arrival activity Setting personal and team objectives</p>
<p>9.45 &ndash; 9.55 Welcome and introductions</p>
<p>9.55 &ndash; 10.15 Derek K Milligan - Blended Learning at Brunel</p>
<p>10.15 &ndash; 10.35<strong> Activity: How to ruin a course</strong></p>
<p>This activity will focus on the key issues and   strategies that impact on the success (or otherwise) of learning and teaching   within your context. The output of this activity will be a team checklist   which will be used as one of the design evaluation tools in the design review   and at the end of the workshop.</p>
<p>10.35 &ndash; 11.15 <strong>Activity: &lsquo;At a glance&rsquo; course map</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;We will propose 5 key components of a course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidance and support</li>
<li>Information and experience</li>
<li>Communication and experience</li>
<li>Thinking and reflection</li>
<li>Evidence and demonstration</li>
</ul>
<p>and introduce a framework/ tool to begin mapping   out the key elements and &lsquo;flavour&rsquo; of the module/ short course designs. We   will discuss the nature of the resultant representations and explore possible   uses of these.</p>
<p>11.15 &ndash; 11.30 Tea and coffee</p>
<p>11.30 &ndash; 12.00<strong> Activity: Design review</strong></p>
<p>We will introduce 3 tools which can be used at   various points in the design process to represent, inform and reflect on   designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogical profiler</li>
<li>Design decision assistant</li>
<li>Ruin a course checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>Each team will use these tools to evaluate their   designs and inform their design decision making.</p>
<p>12.00 &ndash; 12.40&nbsp; <strong>Activity: Stalls activity</strong></p>
<p>Teams will split in to focus groups. Individuals,   with the support of expert facilitators, will explore one of the following   themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Library, media services and accessibility</li>
<li>Open Educational Resources</li>
<li>Pedagogy (including assessment)</li>
<li>Visualisation and representations</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals will then rejoin their work teams,   share findings and consider what the impact of these findings might be the   emerging designs. The expert facilitators will be available to offer support   for the remainder of the workshop and will upload links and resources to   Cloudworks as appropriate.</p>
<p>12.40 &ndash; 1.30 Lunch</p>
<p>1.30 &ndash; 3.00 <strong>Activity: Visualising designs</strong></p>
<p>Using all the online and physical resources   available, teams will draw up a more detailed representation of their module.   These representations are likely to include i.e. sequence, learning outcomes,   outlines of activities, technologies used, assessment strategies etc. Using   Compendium it is also possible to create links to specific OERs, tools and   resources. Designs and discussions around design problems and decisions will   be added to the Cloudworks site &ndash; allowing for collaborative discussion   between teams and opening up discussion beyond the workshop.</p>
<p>3.00 &ndash; 3.15 Tea and coffee</p>
<p>3.15 &ndash; 3.45<strong> Activity: Design Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;This activity will provide an opportunity to view   and review the designs of other teams and give and receive feedback. It is   recognised that designs at this stage will contain detail but will not   necessarily be &lsquo;finished&rsquo;.</p>
<p>3.45 &ndash; 4.15<strong> Activity: Next steps and action   planning</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is hoped that this practical session will lead   to the design or redesign of modules/short courses and that these will be &lsquo;launched&rsquo;   over the next few months. This activity will give teams an opportunity to   identify the next steps in the design process and what further support they   may need from the University or the OULDI project team.</p>
<p>4.15 &ndash; 4.30 Close of session and evaluation of workshop</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Two laptops per team will be provided but please also feel free to bring your own if you would like to.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;So that your teams can export the Compendium maps and save any other work done on workshop laptops, please ensure that you bring at least one USB memory key with you per team.</em></p>]]></description>

The morning activities have been designed to give you&nbsp; the skills and knowledge you need.&nbsp; By this time you will have considered design questions such as staff to student ratio, balance of physical to online learning, the technologies you will use, assessment strategies, pedegogical approach and accessability issues. You, or someone in your team, will have learnt about approaches to visualisation and representataion too.</p>
<p>We recognise that this is just a one day workshop - and course designing often takes far longer than 6 hours - but we anticipate that by the end of this activity you will have a sound&nbsp; design outline on which to build. Please make proactive use all of the resources that you have to hand.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>In this activity you will move temporarily out of your curriculum teams and into special interest groups (stalls). The groups available for this session are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogy (including assessment</li>
<li>Library, Media services and Accessibility</li>
<li>Visualisations and representations</li>
<li>Open Educational resources</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure a good skills spead in your team, make sure at least 1 person goes along to each of the stalls.&nbsp; An expert will be facilitating each special interest group and the activity you will do in these groups is likely to be discussion based and focusing on some of the practicalities and also some of the issues. You will spend about 20 mins in your special interest group and then have an opportunity to feedback your findings to your team.</p>
<p>Learning outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develops Learning Design networks</li>
<li>Develops individual knowledge in an aspect of learning design/ e-pedagogy</li>
<li>Broadens teams' knowledge base in aspects of learning design/e-pedagogy</li>
</ul>

<p>In this activity evaluation/ reflection tools will be used to review teams' designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedagogy profile</li>
<li>Course dimensions</li>
<li>How to ruin a course checklist</li>
</ul>
<p>Each tool looks at a different aspect of your design, and each has strengths and limitations. It is intended that they should work effectively together.</p>
<p>1. Use the 3 tools to review your design (no more than 10 mins per tool)</p>
<p>2. Make a list of the changes you will make as a consequence of the review</p>
<p>3. Amend the design, save it to your pen drive and add to Slideshare</p>
<p>4. Update your&nbsp; Cloud with progress update and images as appropriate</p>]]></description>

The tool is text based and built around the premise that key learning design decisions will fall into one of&nbsp; 4 catagories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidance and support</li>
<li>Communication and collaboration</li>
<li>Reflection and demonstration</li>
<li>Content and experience</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'at a glance' representation gives a one-page overview of a module or course and can effectively communicate the 'flavour' or 'vision' of the course.</p>
<p>1. In your team, and using the Word proforma on the pen drive, outline your 'vision' of your module or short course.</p>
<p>2. Save a copy&nbsp; to the pen drive.</p>
<p>3. Upload to the workshop Slideshare account</p>
<p>4. Have a look at the other groups 'at a glance' representations and discuss the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well do the representations communicate the 'flavour of the course'?</li>
<li>Who might find this representation useful and when?</li>
<li>What would it be useful to add?</li>
</ul>]]></description>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim of this arrival activity is to provide teams with an opportunity to review personal objectives within the team and decide on team objectives for the day. The list will be used at the end of the session to frame reflection and evaluation.</p>
<p>This activity will take place while everyone is settling in, setting up lap tops etc and before the session starts properly.</p>
<p>1. Write down 3 personal objectives</p>
<p>2. Briefly share these with the team</p>
<p>3. Agree team objectives by identifying common themes within the team (no more than 6!)</p>
<p>4. Write these on the flip chart paper provided</p>
<p>5. <em>If you have time</em> add team objectives to this Cloud (by clicking on '<em>add extra content'</em>)</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I have set up this cloud to gather views on different approaches to design in an educational context. This is in relation to the work we are doing at the Open University in the UK in terms of our<a href="http://ouldi.open.ac.uk"> OU Learning Design Initiative</a>. As part of this work we have just undertaken a major baseline mapping of our curriculum design - procedures and policies, as well as different stakeholder perspectives. We would love to gather your views, some questions you might like to consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you think pedagogy is fore-grounded within the work you do and within your institution?</li>
<li>How structured is the way in which you go about designing learning activites and resources for your students and how well it is integrated in the overall institutional production process?</li>
<li>How much focus do you place at the present time on pedagogic quality, cost-effectviness, innovation and fitness for purpose of the designs you produce?</li>
<li>What sense of comunity currently exists at your institution in terms of sharing and discussing learning and teaching ideas and designs?</li>
<li>What demand is there&nbsp; for teaching and learning communiites, for space to share and discuss learning and teaching ideas and designs?</li>
<li>How do you think cloudworks might help in terms of supporting sharing and discussing of learning and teaching ideas and designs, to what extent do you think educators will be willing to engage with the site?</li>
<li>What are your views about current approaches to curriculum design?&nbsp;</li>
<li>What tools and methods are you using to help you improve how you design learning activities and resourcs for your students? </li>
<li>What strategies are in place in your institutions to innovate and reform approaches to curriculum design?</li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This Cloud has been set up to aggregate tools, resources and discussion around Visualisation and representation of the Curriculum at three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum</li>
<li>Module or unit</li>
<li>Activity</li>
</ul>
<p>The Brunel Blended Design workshop will focus on representing at module or short course level but it should be noted that less work has been done around representing at this level. It is likely that you will take tools and strategies from both the Curriculum and Activity level 'toolboxes'.</p>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2500</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2500</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Young peoples digital cultures, Keri Facer</strong></p>
<p>What are they doing? Study - "The learner and their context", BECTA 2008-2011, Oxford, John Furlong</p>
<p>At home: gaming, social networking, looking up information, different patterns of use by age &ndash; 4 different groups &ndash; active participation, all-rounders, normative, peripheral &gt; learning to use digital tools from peers, from cultural artefacts, from conversations</p>
<p>In School: office basics taken for granted by end of primary school, in exceptional cases some use of twitter and social networking (usually clamped down), school introduces mathematics functional tools, interactive whiteboards, VLEs and e-portfolios, audit and performances tools, mobile devices increasingly used (with limited pedagogical understanding?)</p>
<p>Implications? Dual identities&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Schizophrenic educational experience of an 18-year old in 2015</em></p>
<p>Born 1997 &ndash; standards, targets and centralised control</p>
<p>Primary school: SureStart programme, literacy and numeracy strategies, prescribed personalised, in later years SEAL (Social and Emotional Learning), hot-housing/tutoring (esp. London/Kent/Grammar regions)</p>
<p>Secondary school: failure of centralised command/control; failure of standards approach. Freeing up curriculum. Curriculum aims, competencies and learning to learn, student voice/distributed leadership, extended schools, area-based partnerships, creative partnerships, every child matters extended services, compulsory attendance to 18</p>
<p>Also the rise of alternative educational experiences &ndash; 5min.com, 12 sec.com and YouTube, online schools, the school of everything, UK rise in homes schooling and alternative modes of schooling, Steiner education</p>
<p><em>Socio-technical developments?</em></p>
<p>From the Horizon programme</p>
<ul>
<li>Demographic changes: over 50% of population ages 50 by 2030 with a further 40 years life expectance</li>
<li>Working and living alongside machines becomes increasingly normal &ndash; devolving responsibility to machines, simple manual tasks or outsourcings the management of complex systems, ethical tensions and public debate, different generations with different degrees of comfort in delegating power and responsibility to machines</li>
<li>We will have the capacity to know more stuff, to remember more</li>
<li>The personal cloud &ndash; capacity to connect to a network and constantly connected to knowledge, resources, people and tools</li>
<li>Distance matters less, geography still counts</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What are the roles of universities and colleges in interesting times?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What sort of relationships between people might university&rsquo;s and colleges foster? What will our new roes and responsibilities be?</li>
<li>What sorts of knowledge and understanding might learners in these different contexts need?</li>
<li>What curriculum works for &ndash; mixed demographics, networked, mobile learners, operating in information rich environments and preparing for highly polarised workspaces?</li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>There are many projects looking at how we might usefully represent the curriculum. It is becoming increasingly important to communicate this information in a responsive and accessible way; in addition it is becoming clear that one representation will not fit all needs...so what representations are you using?</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Prompted by a tweet from @janshs I thought I'd set up this cloud as a space to discuss the value of e-portfolios and how they can be used in teaching and learning. I have added a link to @janshs' blog post about her thoughts on this. So some questions to stimulate the debate:</p>
<ul>
<li>What value do e-portfolio's provide for learning?</li>
<li>What examples of good practice are there on the use of e-portfolios?</li>
<li>What demands do e-portfolios place on assessment practices?</li>
<li>What tools are available and how do they differ?</li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Review of the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/elp_designlearn.html">JISC design for learning programme</a> (2004-2008)<br /></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Design practice is very varied</li>
<li>Design tools must allow for collaboration, contingent/responsive design and effective sharing of design processes and outcomes</li>
<li>Design processes need to be integrated with other institutional processes if design practice is to be transformed</li>
<li>Practitioners want rich expressions of curricular purpose and bite size curriculum elements that can easily be repurposed and reused</li>
</ul>
<p>How many approaches to design are there?</p>
<ul>
<li>Associative, </li>
<li>Constructive, </li>
<li>Situated</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All approaches emphasize learning activity and constructive alignment and feedback and integration across the activities</li>
<li>What are the crucial decisions teachers make? They differ tin the role and importance of others in mediating the activity, the authenticity of the activity (situated/abstracted), balance of scaffolding with flexibility and the locus of control (learner, peer, tutor, other)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Lessons from D4L &ndash; tensions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Different levels of design</li>
<li>Design for learning/design for teaching</li>
<li>Representational forms</li>
<li>Structure/flexibility of designs</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Representational dilemma &ndash; pedagogical intentions need to be represented differently to by different actors in the learning system</li>
<li>Tension between articulating designs clearly in educational terms and working powerfully with designs in educational systems</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Towards a typology of designs</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Mod4L project concluded that there is no obvious typology of decontextualised designs or patterns.&nbsp; </li>
<li>May be more product to try modeling relationships between design elements</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><em>The learning/teaching dilemma</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Good teaching (conception and enactment of a pedagogic intention) is not the same as good self directed learning (conception and enactment of a personal learning goal)</li>
<li>Different but dialogically related human activities</li>
<li>Teaching supportive and learning supportive tools/services fulfill different needs</li>
<li>Learners and teachers skills are different but need to develop in dialogue</li>
<li>What are the points of intersection but in terms of activity and in terms of the supporting tools/services</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Modeling good design tension</em></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a tension between modeling good design practice and offering tools for educators to express their own pedagogical intentions</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Modeling concepts allows strong forms of guidance in the design process (the system supports good design but must define it. Open ended tools are often more accessible to practitioners</li>
</ul>
<p>Web 2.0 dilemma</p>
<ul>
<li>The web 2.0/power to the users dilemma</li>
<li>Web 2.0 tools allow users to determine the purposes, values and meaning of knowledge; applied to learning there are fundamental challenges for design and for educational practice as a whole</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Final thoughts</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Design a contests space</li>
<li>Need for well-designed tools to support teaching process</li>
<li>Contingency and collaboration are key</li>
<li>No one tool is the solution and tools need to interoperate</li>
<li>Need to put learners progressively more in control of their own learning</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><span lang="en-gb"><b><i><font face="Arial">Press release</font></i></b> </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Arial">Guardian supplement explores 'profound transformation' of higher education by technology</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Arial">'Digital Student' looks at support for institutions as they 'respond to present challenges and predict future developments'</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Arial">A Guardian supplement published today looks at the way technology has transformed education over the last decade. Sponsored by JISC to launch its 'Student experiences of technology' campaign, the supplement - 'Digital Student' - explores the achievements of institutions in this area and some of the future challenges as universities and colleges look to exploit technology and place the student experience at the heart of learning and teaching.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Arial">As Stephen Hoare reports in the opening article: 'Technology has dramatically changed the way students experience university life, and not just in terms of the number of gadgets they own. It has affected where and how they study, helped them collaborate with each other and broken down barriers between students and teachers, social life and study. It has also given students a bigger voice in they way they learn.'</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Arial">Podcasting, wikis, immersive worlds such as Second Life and texting are just some of the technologies highlighted in the publication, technologies that have placed technology at the heart of the learner experience. How such technologies have impacted on assessment, the management of intellectual property rights, student progression and retention, the building of new and more flexible learning spaces, is also a focus of the supplement. </font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Arial">The challenges faced by institutions during this period of change is a further theme of the supplement. As Stephen Hoare continues, 'All this presents major challenges for institutions, which are also learning to cope with a larger, more demanding and more diverse student body.'</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Arial">The supplement also highlights JISC's and others' work to support institutions meet these challenges, through innovation projects and through its support for the take-up and use of new technologies. Among the JISC projects and services highlighted are 'learner experience' projects such as LEaD and STROLL; Users and Innovation projects such as APT Stairs, Sounds Good, Web2Rights; e-portfolio activities; the JISC TechDis service which supports the use of technology for disabled students and staff; the Regional Support Centres; market research into students' expectations of technology, and much more.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="en-gb"><font face="Arial">The supplement also features an interview with Sir David Melville, whose Committee of Inquiry is soon to report on the implications for institutions of students' use of new technologies, and explores a number of institutional initiatives, such as University College Plymouth St Mark and St John's decision three years ago to offer a free laptop to all undergraduates, the University of Leicester's Media Zoo, and the University of Hertfordshire's scheme in which students mentor lecturers in their use of technology.</font></span></p>

              <description><![CDATA[This site provides an overview of the DIAL-e framework developed by Kevin Burden and Simon Atkinson. It includes a great introductory video on the project. 

"The framework was developed as part of a UK project, sponsored through the Joint Information Services Committee (JISC), to encourage academics and other educators to adopt digital artefacts (in
this case video) as part of their teaching, learning and research strategies.

Simon and Kevin have three papers about this at the Ascilite conference. I really like this framework and think it has great potential. I think it is a good example of a 'design schema' i.e. a framework to enable teachers and designers to think differently about learning and teaching.]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="../../files/AcademicTalk.jpg" alt="" /> <strong>AcademicTalk is an educational tool which promotes peer learning through critical discussion, by supporting deep engagement through argument and reasoning between students. Hello<br /></strong></p>
<p>It provides a structured discussion environment for small groups of 4-8 students, and is particularly suitable for induction into more academic forms of discourse. The discussion environment can be flexibly configured to the educational context of the students and pedagogical requirp and has considerable advantages over both ordinary synchronous chat and other asynchronous CMC applications. It is one of a suite of Open Source distributed e-learning tools funded by the UK Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC). [Text taken from project website]</p>]]></description>
