              <description><![CDATA[<p>Throughout OLDSMOOC I've been working on my MOOC Skills Project. Here's a presentation of this project which I created on my iPad with an app called SonicPics. It's a first draft, too long and unpolished but I was keen to submit something for this weeks plenary. </p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-7b2Du693FIXzh4SjJ4VTQzam8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-7b2Du693FIXzh4SjJ4VTQzam8/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately when it was uploaded to Google Drive the accompanying titles on each slide didn't appear.</p>
<p>Here's a text outline using the <strong>STARR Framework</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>SITUATION: Where are you coming from? </strong></p>
<p>After teaching in secondary classrooms for over 20 years I decided to move into online teaching and learning, about 3 years ago. Over this time I've been facilitating webinars for the Australia e-Series, helping students online with maths tutoring, completing online PD, using social media to share and learn with peers...and so on. I've enjoyed several mentoring roles over this time and can see a need for developing and delivering a course, specifically for educators, around the new digital skill set needed for online teaching and learning. I've called it the MOOC Skills Project due to the high dropout rate of participants in MOOCs....people drop out for many reasons, one of them is the difficulties they face with the MOOC kind of online PD. I wanted to find a way to support MOOCers in their learning. It's a generic course though, based on the skills needed for open, connected learning of any kind. </p>
<p><strong>TASK: What did you hope to achieve?</strong></p>
<p>I had no idea in the beginning, but in the early days of OLDS MOOC I became part of a group that formed to investigate online webinars. I'm not sure why, but things fizzled out before anything was designed. Perhaps it was too early to think about a project, but it did gave us a chance to network and build relationships. <br />I went my separate way and thought more broadly about putting together something that could help others in their MOOC journey. I based my project on what I'm doing online now...connecting with educators from around the globe, presenting and organising my learning in a Personal Learning Environment and using a range of tools and apps to find information, create & share new knowledge.</p>
<p>I was hoping to help others build their own PLE & PLN and to develop the confidence to take on and finish a MOOC. </p>
<p><strong>ACTIONS: What did you do?</strong> <strong>What were the main events, interactions, practices and activities in which you participated? What were the obstacles - and how did you tackle them?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I  thought about why it's necessary for educators to develop these skills. There's a changing paradigm in education...student expectations are changing, enrollments are declining in some institutions and there's less money for quality face to face teaching. </li>
<li>the rise of MOOCS...Massive Open Online Courses...is placing pressure on educators to be part of a new movement, jump onboard, experience the new way of teaching and learning online. Many people don't have the skill set to cope with this fast paced style of open, independent learning. </li>
<li>first step was to set up an online infrastructure (e-frastructure /course learning environment) to run the course out of, with cloud-based, mobile supported web tools we could share and use together. I wanted to model the active learning I'd like them to undertake while doing the course. </li>
<li>Using the moocskills username I created the following accounts: moocskills.com on wordpress.com, moocskills@gmail.com, Flickr for photo sharing, Diigo for social bookmarking, Google Reader for RSS, Google Drive for collaborative documents, a Wikispace, Facebook Group and Page, @moocskills & #moocskills on Twitter. </li>
<li>The MOOC Skills CLE being developed <a href="http://moocskills.com/" target="_blank">http://moocskills.com</a></li>
<li>MOOC Skills on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/moocskills" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/moocskills</a></li>
<li>The next step was to crowdsource participants to see who was interested/what personas were interested to have a go at prototyping MOOC Skills . <br />Here's the Google Doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xjIGo5hM0UMPkiQhlDP7f41iz6eElwOCRbnzYlZhKXQ/edit" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xjIGo5hM0UMPkiQhlDP7f41iz6eElwOCRbnzYlZhKXQ/edit?usp=sharing</a></li>
<li>Another announcement went out via social media and gmail to confirm participants to trial MOOC Skills using a new tool I was keen to try out.<br />Tackk   <a href="http://tackk.com/xm75k2" target="_blank">http://tackk.com/xm75k2</a></li>
<li>I collected 10 MOOC Coping Skills into an image to kick off a conversation on moocskills.com <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/penbentley/8533543008/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/penbentley/8533543008/</a></li>
<li>Trialed several tools/ways of delivering audio/visual media to participants in this course: <br />Enhanced Podcasting with SonicPics (created and shared using an iPhone 4S) <br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D-3IUA5nAA&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/0D-3IUA5nAA</a><br />Audio/video recording using iPhone 4S video-camera<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMAPfiUcpg8&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/tMAPfiUcpg8</a><br />Podcasting using SoundCloud<br /><a href="https://soundcloud.com/penbentley58/rubbish-trucks-warblig-magpies" target="_blank">https://soundcloud.com/penbentley58/rubbish-trucks-warblig-magpies</a></li>
<li>Started our MOOC Skills digital library on Diigo<br /><a href="https://www.diigo.com/profile/moocskills" target="_blank">https://www.diigo.com/user/moocskills</a></li>
<li>OBSTICALES: <br />Not finding someone to help out with graphic design...so I used a pre-existing header created previously for my blog. <br />Project cut short due to family illness and time away from home...project now on hold while I'm thinking about where to take it from here. Don't want to toss it all away.<br />Finding that, as a mobile MOOC Learner while I was away, I needed to rethink the mobile side of things. I found it hard to cope with OLDSMOOC on a mobile phone while away for 9 days...how could I learn from this experience and change MOOC Skills design. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RESULTS: </strong>What were the outcomes? Did you meet your goals? What went well, what didn't? What unexpected outcomes did you notice?</p>
<ul>
<li>Outcomes: infrastructure for course mostly in place, course not planned (on "paper" that is) or trialed. </li>
<li>Goals, as far as running a course, not met. Not enough time to achieve what I wanted to do. </li>
<li>Trialing of webtools to deliver content went OK, continued with that while away from home.</li>
<li>I didn't communicate well with those participants who expressed an interest in protopyping the MOOC Skills course...I realise that now. </li>
<li>Unexpected outcomes were: changing ideas when I was thrown into a position of being a mobile mooc learner, positive interest in the MOOC Skills Project from outside OLDSMOOC course, connections with others along the way</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>REFLECTIONS: What did you learn? What advice could you give others?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>as a teacher I'm used to planning on the go, in a hurry and not putting ideas on "paper" or planning thoroughly. I now realise that, as a Learning Designer, this part is vital in the beginnign...to keep us on track and to "see" the boundaries we need to work within. I can't just keep tossing ideas in as they arise and expect them to slot into what's already done. Paying more attention to my constraints would have kept me in line. </li>
<li>advice would be to start smaller, be clear about what you want to do at the beginning, be creative within loose constraints, get to know how to use a few tools well rather than many tools not so well, focus on skills not tools</li>
<li>that being a Learning Designer draws on a skill set that's way bigger than what I have, I'm thinking it's a collaborative role...particularly if we are talking about using great digital/rich media. So, don't think you can do it all yourself...bring in the experts.</li>
<li>this point goes back to my first one, that others don't necessarily see/understand the big picture you are carrying around in your head. Plan, brainstorm etc...more at the beginning. </li>
<li>think about what you are doing in terms time, space and sector and communication....can it be applied to any educator, in any sector, at any stage in the course they are teaching and can they share it with others. </li>
</ul>
<p>I'd better finish rabbiting on here...but I want to say how valuable the whole experience has been. I suspect OLDSMOOC has turned me into a MOOCaholic & I'll be back for more :) This is way more exciting than doing "e-Learning" whatever that is...not sure anymore. </p>

              <title>ARTiFactor&#39;s Dream&#39;s project; a reflection of my OLDSMOOC experience</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8152</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8152</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Art volunteers for FreeGeekTwinCities and initially envisioned creating</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->"a&nbsp;<strong>map of learning activities</strong>&nbsp;for raising participant's&nbsp;<strong>digital literacy&nbsp;</strong>competencies.&nbsp;Learners could jump in at any time, anywhere on the map,&nbsp;and find guidance to master that particular skill set.&nbsp;The map would be dynamic, continually being improved and expanded, much like in wikipedia." (<a title="ARTiFactor Dream Project" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6942">My Dream</a>)</p>
<p>Art has a BS in Physics Education and created his own curriculum for 10 years but has not been in a class room for thirty years. Art is a life-long-learner and is aware of many recent internet communication technologies.</p>
<p>For years Art has wanted to help people use the internet to realize their potential. He read that 2012 was the "year of the MOOC" and decides to enroll in his first mooc, OLDSMOOC&nbsp;"Learning Design for a 21st Century Curriculum".</p>
<p>For three weeks Art functioned much as he had during his 10 years in college. He tried to do what he thought the instructors wanted. If he was uncertain of expectations he watched and imitated his peers (vicarious learning).</p>
<p>Art was thrilled to learn new tools like MindMeister, NetVibes, BibSonomy, LucidChart,and Twitter. Trying to manage the tsunamy of new resources was overwhelming. He decided not to even start using Diigo because it only allowed 1000 bookmarks before hiiting a paywall . He did start to see why social bookmarking was valuable, though.</p>
<p>Week 4 theme was connecting or partnering up. It did not happen. Art suddenly realized he had not made an entry in his daily jounal after Day 20. Feeling lost and hoplessly behind Art decided to sign up for 2 more MOOCs. He did a week's worth of assignments in foeMOOC but 2 minutes after submitting his homework the foeMOOC was suspended. He jumped over to edcMOOC and did 5 weeks of work, submitted his unfinished oldsMOOC project for his digital artefact requirement and will probably get a certificateof participation.</p>
<p>Now it is Week 8 and Art wants to show his peers he is not a quitter. His Dream Project is not finished but he now realizes how similar it is to the learning design of oldsMOOC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to best enable participants to learn, Art agrees with the learning design theory that &nbsp;<strong>learning is enabled best when it involves an authentic project that the learner is passionate about, and that involves group work with discussion, reflection, cooperation, and peer assessment</strong>. Art's experience in oldsMOOC, leads him to believe that community building, and if necessary, facilitating "partnering up"&nbsp;be a requirement before practicing social networking. He hopes to structure the learning environment so that every participant's contributions are&nbsp;acknowledged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Art's project intends to provide and model using tools for knowledge aquisition, collaboration, reflection, construction, presentation, etc., facilitating networks between fellow students, and also faciltating networking with others contributing to their field of inquiry.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->"Self-organised learning networks provide a base for the establishment of a form of education that goes beyond course and curriculum centric models, and envisions a learner-centred and learner controlled model of lifelong learning."&nbsp;(<a title="Koper 2004 life long learning design" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2004.00427.x/abstract">Koper 2004</a>)</p>
<p>Art is joining up with teams working on similar projects; <a title="Peeragogy Handbook Project" href="http://peeragogy.org/">Peeragogy Handbook Project</a>, <a title="P2PU peer to peer learning" href="https://p2pu.org/en/">P2PU</a>, <a title="wikiversity.org" href="http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page">wikiversity.org</a>, and <a title="MozillaFestival participate" href="http://mozillafestival.org/participate/">MozillaFestival</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some challenges yet to be worked out are:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting site visitors to commit (click on the join button)</li>
<li>match up newcomers by interests (maybe a form that populates a spreadsheet)</li>
<li>scaling if numbers exceed capacity of server or number of facilitators</li>
<li>a way for voting up or down available OER</li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <title>Week 8 - the journey so far (Sheila MacNeill)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8135</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8135</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Well it has been quite a journey.&nbsp; I started the course with great intentions. This would be just the focus and stimulus I needed to build a "real" learning design.&nbsp; I've been involved on the learning design community for a while, but as I'm not an actual teacher or designer I don't get much opportunity to build real designs. &nbsp;<br /><br />Week one started well, I had my idea of using a PgCert module on curriculum design which I "guest presented" at last year, and extending it with some examples of learning design tools. There seemed to be a few people interested and a some similar ideas. A team was formed, google hangouts were hung out. Along the way I got distracted and started to think about my learning context and in particular Cloudworks. From previous work I knew that alternative views of cloudscapes was possible e.g. viewing it as a mind map (see the link above for my oldsmooc cloudscape mindmap).&nbsp; But what else was possible. Tony Hirst rose to the challenge and some really fascinating experiments around network visualisations started to appear.&nbsp; I kept returning to these and they provided the foundation for my experiments in the prototyping week. &nbsp;<br /><br />I decided that I needed to try and at least create one cloud per week so I could use that as a basis for sharing my learning journey, connections and content which I've managed to do.</p>
<p>I experienced feelings of almost inherent guilt for not always sticking to the planned activities for each week.&nbsp; My confessional clouds I called them. Then earlier this week, near the end of week 7,&nbsp; whilst catching up on the evaluation convergence session something clicked. Briar asked the team what there measures of success for the course were. Amongst the replies Yishay said something along the lines of: we need to redefine what success means in MOOCs as opposed to traditional measures of success. This is a project based course, there is no certificate so if you get one thing that you can put into practice then that is success.<br /><br />Guilt lifted almost immediately.&nbsp; I have been gaining a huge amount from the course both about learning design, and different approaches to it. No, I've not done all the tasks, but that doesn't matter, I'm not being assessed on that and as the course content is open I can always revisit bits as and when I need.<br /><br />I've also started to clarify some nascent thoughts about using SNA/learning analtyics approaches from a learner centric point of view. But also, and I think more importantly for me, I've learnt so much about being a learner in a MOOC. Context and confidence are key. There's a bit more about this in my week 7 cloud and it's something I will be returning too and reflecting on more over the next 2 weeks.</p>]]></description>

              <title>My week 7 learning and reflections (Sheila MacNeill)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8130</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8130</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Back in my confessional space this week!&nbsp; I haven't really engaged as much I would have liked this week.&nbsp; Partly because of travel and other "stuff" but also because initially I though that I might not be able to do much as I still haven't created a proper learning design.&nbsp; However, on reflection I did do a bit of crowdsourced evaluation with my week 5 protoype for a redesign of the cloudworks profile page.&nbsp; I did get feedback both on my blog and the cloud from students and the course team which was encouraging as they seemed agree with my overall ideas, and contributed their thoughts.&nbsp; I also had an email exchange with Juilette Culver the developer of Cloudworks, which as useful. Juliette has also posted to my prototype cloud giving some feedback and refelction on what is actually possible.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was at a workshop for the wid@t widget tool, which I shared as part of the toolbox activity way back in week 3 I think.&nbsp; And as I was working through their design template, I was reminded of personnas again and realised that if I was to take my prototype design forward I really need to think about a personna. I implicitly based my ideas on my "oldsmooc student persona", but I think if I had taken some more time to make that more explicit and get views of others that would (and still could) help to explain my design rationale more clearer. Which in turn would help conversations with developers like Juliette who have to balance my needs/wants of the site as a learner on an course, with the other users and help to prioritise any potential developments. A lot of my ideas do require quite a major redesign. So, I've found this week has connected some of the earlier topics.</p>
<p>I've just been catching up with the convergence and it was really interesting again to hear the team and Briar talk about what success means, and redefining it from measures associated with traditional courses. Yishay made a very good point about drop out not being a failure if you have got something out of the course.&nbsp; That is a key message for MOOCs, which relates to learner control and confidence and I guess literacy too.</p>
<p>I think Briar also made a good point about the pace of the course and meeting deadlines. I've made a concerted effort to do "something" each week. That something is sometimes more involved than others, but just creating and writing up a cloud each week has been really helpful for me own sensemaking.&nbsp; Again that's one of the motivations for looking at Cloudworks in more detail as I think it provides a really useful dedicated, contained, linked and social space for learners to reflect.&nbsp;</p>

              <title>Evaluation Targets - Helen Whitehead [NOOC]</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8123</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8123</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been working with this particular design all through OLDSMOOC but haven't posted much about it as it hasn't always been at the right stage at the right time.</p>
<p>We started out with an idea for a module for our student Award programme (credits gained on top of degree credits&nbsp; to enhance skills and employability, among other things) and a colleague developed two learning designs for a 10 credit and a 20-credit module.&nbsp; These were combined so that the learning design could accommodate both at once.</p>
<p>We then added open online elements so that the module could also be studied along MOOC lines, without credit. The next iteration of the learning design accommodated that.</p>
<p>We then evaluated the learning design.&nbsp; Prototyping will happen next week with a group who will then facilitate the course.</p>
<p>Evaluation decisions include (with comments):</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the content appropriate for the needs of all types of student? Should the content be adapted &nbsp;and/or do we need find new content?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our content is built around open educational resources which are themselves excellent, but we are tweaking them and adding extra readings etc. to suit</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any likely student expectations that we haven&rsquo;t yet met? If so, how do we address them? Do we need to add different types of media or different activities?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve added more video, for a start!</p>
<ul>
<li>To what extent do we need to use social media channels? How do we choose appropriate ones?</li>
</ul>
<p>Blogging and Twitter are certain, especially as facilitators have expertise in these. Blogs are being built into the design and assessment. Moodle is being used as the Hub for the course. Do we need Facebook? Social bookmarking? Google groups? Google +? My gut feeling is to keep it straightforward, not least so that measurement is easier (cf the oldsmooc_conv discussion this Tuesday)</p>
<ul>
<li>Have we succeeded in meeting the constructive alignment criteria? Does the content and the assessment align with the learning outcomes for all three groups of students? Is there anything further we need to do to ensure this?</li>
</ul>
<p>We tweaked the design to add more activities and assessment for the 20 credit module.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should we put in further opportunities for evaluation of the design? Do we need to know more?</li>
</ul>
<p>We will need to bear this in mind. I am leaning towards a mid-course questionnaire and an end questionnaire, plus identifying students to ask for fuller feedback at the end.</p>
<ul>
<li>How should we manage assessment?</li>
</ul>
<p>It will be more formal, done by tutors, in the case of the credit-taking students, but for the open learners, it&rsquo;s probably going to be necessary to use peer assessment. What tools can we use for this?</p>
<p>The open educational resources have within them suggestions for assessment activities, but we have not necessarily identified the same ones so we will need to make it very clear to participants which are the actual assessments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should we offer Open Badges as an incentive for participants to complete the module?</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably we won&rsquo;t do this during the pilot, as there are larger issues related to this, and the timescale makes it difficult. It&rsquo;s something for the future.</p>
<p>It's been a very thoughtful week coming up with and thinking about these decisions, and because launch is imminent we are acting on thems traightaway. As it's a pilot we'll be evaluating throughout and tweaking later weeks as well as making plans for the next one.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Our converge on this (yes, I am doing this out of sequence!) raised an important issue for me - again.&nbsp; This has also led to a slow dawning realisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In truth teaching practitioners have probably been practising the priciple of open resources in an informal paper-based way since teaching began.&nbsp; Sharing of resources is not as odd for practitioners as it is for researchers for several good reasons (the primary one being that competition and the need to publish original or novel materials is not part of the teaching role so we don't have a need to protect our work).&nbsp; However that wasn't the aspect that I was still left with when our very useful chat was finished.&nbsp; My difficulty is that when you are preparing a single learning session (tutorial or dayschool) rather than an entire course, finding open resources that do the job you need often takes longer than creating them and sometimes you don't find appropriate material at all.&nbsp; A 'grab what you can and adapt the lesson accordingly' approach undoes all the careful consideration that has gone into the early design stages, disregards the personas lovingly identified and may slide a little off the learning arc defined.&nbsp; Teaching across several faculties, I need great certainty about the quality <em>and </em> aptness of resources and that I will find them quickly when I sit down to design a session.&nbsp; In the days when the world turned more slowly, we would collect and hoard good resources as we came across them, gifted by colleagues, and re-use for years.&nbsp; With the need now to maintain a more current and cutting-edge collection, how do you sift through in the three hours you have to design a session?&nbsp; [Yes, I am now having fun with the SCORE site, will work on refining&nbsp; a list of good sources for the future from what is discovered here]</p>
<p>So it was good to spot the example of systems arising to deal with this reality:</p>
<p>http://www.edcanvas.com/lessons/nTm4WQdU_qZyOA/plate-tectonics</p>
<p>Quicker than a google and then checking through, wider reach than going to a few known sites, this is a starting point for future curating approaches.&nbsp; Not really aimed at the level I teach, but a good sign of things to come.</p>
<p>Then it struck me - this is the point that is being shared with us this week, why this is 'Week 6 - Curate', not 'Week 6 - Find OER'.&nbsp; (I think a D'oh would be appropriate here...).&nbsp; We curate to make a current shareable hoard of resources, not to strut our current reading list and finds.&nbsp; Who'd a thought it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS this does not directly contribute to my original design, but throwing it down to get into the habit of doing this in the open...</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>For one of my projects we've gone straight to our University's open educational resouyrces repository because we knew they were there!</p>
<p>To give myself a little more of a challenge I thought I'd carry on with one of my other current design challenges, the Moving on with Moodle training course which I prototyped last week.</p>
<p>I used Xpert.nottingham.ac.uk first (which is for searching OER), and then Jorum, which is an actual repository.&nbsp; There I found a lot more basic resources, but also a couple which might come in handy for advanced Moodle training:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dspace.jorum.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/16026">Moodle Quiz training</a> (from LSE)&nbsp; <a title="Licence" rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://dspace.jorum.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/16026/license_url?sequence=11?iframe=true&width=75%&height=75%">Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales</a>&nbsp; (Although it mentions both 2.5 amnd 3.0 licence versions in the text of the item)</li>
<li><a href="http://dspace.jorum.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/16272">How to add questions to a Quiz activity</a> from York St John&nbsp; Licence <a title="Licence" rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://dspace.jorum.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/16219/license_url?sequence=2?iframe=true&width=75%&height=75%">Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dspace.jorum.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/16220">Moving Question banks&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>licence: <a title="Licence" rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://dspace.jorum.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/16272/license_url?sequence=2?iframe=true&width=75%&height=75%">Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these allow amendment.</p>
<p>Also looking into how to make my own publicly available Moodle training materials and helpsheets available as OERs.</p>]]></description>

              <title>My week 5 learning and reflections &amp; cloudworks profile page prototype(Sheila MacNeill)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Week 5 is prototyping week. I have to say it's not quite what I was expecting.&nbsp; I think I was expecting more work on the design and not so much on prototyping but I can sort of see the logic of spending time seeing how your design would work in action. In a previous life I was a "proper" learning technologist who actually designed courses and worked with web developers so I'm quite comfortable with my ability to discuss sytsem and design requirements.&nbsp; So, instead of prototyping a design/system this week, I've decided that the best use of my time would be to go back to some of the thoughts I had in the first couple of weeks of the course about the layout and alternative visualisations of Cloudworks itself.&nbsp; I spent some time yesterday (Sunday) and today (Monday) exploring Balsamiq. I know a number of people who have really liked using this mock up software so this was a really good opportunity to try it out for myself. I've created a mock up page and this morning created a little video walk through explaining it in a bit more detail</p>
<p>take one link&nbsp; screencast.com/t/rVv5oDBKNwqf and take 2 is embedded.</p>
<p>I've also expanded a bit more in this blog post</p>

              <title>Prototyping in order  to navigate the online course site and syllabus</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;"In the online classroom, students will seize upon your syllabus as if it were a map. Students will want to know how to proceed and where everything is&nbsp;located. So, one of the first things you must do, whether through the syllabus or in an introductory message, is to explain the &ldquo;geography&rdquo; of the course (Ko and Rossen, 2012 ,p.20).</p>
<p>I need to design such "geography" with the hypothesis&nbsp;in mind&nbsp;that students will be able to navigate the online course site&nbsp;and syllabus with ease and&nbsp;efficiency as a result of my design.</p>
<p>To best design for the "navigational" aspects of the course syllabus, namely the&nbsp;hyperlinks,&nbsp;taxonomies,&nbsp;drop down boxes etc, and to ascertain how students would like to interact with such functionality, I think that a paper based prototype tool will best serve my purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, having undergone the exercise and designed the prototype, I'd seek to collect feedback on the design experience by asking a group of students to undertake a "trial run". After which, I'd invite them,&nbsp;in pairs,&nbsp;to discuss their experience. I'd record the discussion and analyse their feedback.&nbsp;</p>

              <title>Reflections on OLDS-MOOC week 3</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7903</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7903</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>What three words describe this week's activities?</strong></p>
<p>Practical. Articulation. Frustration (mild).</p>
<p><strong>What did you like about this week?</strong></p>
<p>I liked the way the taxonomies and tools give you a relatively (see below) easy to use method of articulating learning designs. Being an awkward b*gger, I am trying to use them to <a href="http://davidjennings.wordpress.com/2013/01/27/new-project-learning-design-of-everyday-things-oldsmooc-w3/">design a learning experience that isn't a course</a>, so I accept some of the difficulties that come my way in attempting this (though I also think that the C21st curriculum is going to be <em>much</em> less course-based).</p>
<p>Because of time issues (see below), I ended up doing the "short route" through this week. I hope to have time to do more on the activity design for my project in the next week or so.</p>
<p>I also took time out to read Conole (2007) on Designing Learning Activities. This was because I'm curious about the taxonomy of learning activities, where it comes from, what the evidence base is for it, and how 'universal' it is or could be in terms of contexts of application. As far as I can see (I stand to be corrected), it is not derived from evidence, but more from general experience?</p>
<p>I was curious about how I might apply it another project I'm working on, which (helpfully) is a course. I found that in the authoring template I wrote for that course, I'd specified&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"a set of 4-8 activities that involve a combination of<strong><strong><br /></strong></strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><em>reading, viewing, listening to absorb ideas and perspectives</em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em>individual reflection and relating issues to personal experience and ambitions</em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em>discussion with fellow participants, and collective articulation of shared understandings</em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em>practical activities and demonstrations</em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em>critiques of case studies"</em></li>
</ul>
<p>... which, on reflection, seems not a million miles away from the taxonomy.</p>
<p>So I'm wondering whether part of this methodology is about codifying common sense, or at least codifying common current practice... Not that there's anything wrong with that: codifying practice to make the tacit elements explicit and shareable is valuable.</p>
<p>Am I missing another dimension, though?</p>
<p><strong>What could be improved?</strong></p>
<p>I got stuck on a couple of usability/implementation problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>I could easily use the Course Features Cards as I don't have a colour printer and my b/w printer is low on toner, so not practical to print the toner-heavy design. I made my own cards, and used them, but this made the activity longer, and means that I haven't done as many of the other activities as I might have done otherwise</li>
<li>I also tried to use the Activity Profile spreadsheet, but -- hopelessly non-standard that I am -- I don't have Excel, and I lost more time trying to get the spreadsheet to work either in Google Spreadsheets or Apple Numbers, in vain.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, while I'm on the subject of usability issues, it would be great if Cloudworks allowed you drag the corner of the text entry box (the one I'm writing in now) to make it bigger, as with many other forms on the web. It's frustrating only to be able to see five lines of text...</p>]]></description>

<li>Did they help you to think more creatively?</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>@JeffWaistell sent me a tweet suggesting that learning design was even more messy, iterative, dynamic and political than the models and frameworks we are introducing in week 3 of the OLDSMOOC might suggest - and I didn't disagree. My view is that at the heart of our learning design practice is our view on what learning is for - and that is highly political.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff response was to ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"So learning design can = mind control? How to avoid? How to balance learning agenda by involving key stakeholders and views?"</strong></p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.&rdquo; - Albert Einstein <br /><br />As we wrote in our <a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/blog/week3weekendround-up">weekend summary</a> (OLDS-MOOC week 3), we have been struck by the creative response to the tools we have offered up this week and levels of enjoyment some of you have expressed in using them. One of the messages that has come out loud and clear from our own research is that staff involved in the curriculum design process in institutional settings do not generally find the process very creative, and they feel that their ideas get tied down too early. We'd argue that from a learning design perspective, the balance and tension between creativity and precision is an important one. Where do you sit on this? Is creativity actually more important than precision? What is the relationship between precision and creativity?</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3 dir="ltr">Yezin&rsquo;s Engineering Odyssey</h3>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.06367512908764184">Yezin lives in Riyadh and is hoping to study engineering at university. He is in a preparatory year program that includes instruction in English, math and science. Yezin has difficulty reading the articles he is given and is specially worried about the technical vocabulary.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.06367512908764184">Yezin&rsquo;s English teacher suggests that he try using a social-network based glossary application on his phone. First, he scans the article he is reading with his learning set and saves it to text. Then he uses the application to identify several words and enters them into his personal glossary. He tags two words using pre-configured tags and creates his own tag for a third. Using concordance software he finds examples of these new words in the British National Corpus and compares these to his own text. He writes a provisional definition for the word and saves it to his learning space. <br /><br />Later, Yezin scans another text and finds his previously entered words highlighted in the new text. He remembers two of these but has forgotten what the third one meant. He finds it in his glossary, linked to the text where he tagged it. He looks there and remembers what it means. Yezin is impressed and tells other people in his learning set about the tool. He thinks that if he can get them to work with him, they will all benefit by sharing their personal glossaries.<br /><br />Using the application, Yezin and his friends have been able to turn an isolated and dull reading task into a social activity. The application not only helps them learn together, but it helps them learn more quickly by connecting prior knowledge to new tasks, and by connecting their individual expertise to that of the group. &nbsp;They also begin to discover shared areas of interest within their field of study and think they might like to collaborate on other levels too.</strong></p>]]></description>

              <title>My week 3 learning activities and reflections</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Week 3 Learning outcomes</p>

*Conceptualise the learning design process from different perspectives

*Apply some learning design resources, tools and methods to your design

*Critique a range of pedagogical approaches and the role that different technologies play

*Review, share and discuss the theoretical underpinnings, benefits and limitations of design representations across educational contexts

*Develop an innovative storyboard, learning activities and a structure for implementation

*Opportunity to gain the 3 Weeks and Resource Gatherer badges (tick)

<p><b>Sunday 27 Jan</b></p>
<p>I think these week clouds are becoming more and more like a confessional space for me. I am reminded of what I should be doing and the learning objectives of the week, and then reconciling that with what I am actually doing/ have done.</p>

<p>I had a bit of time of Thursday so after a look at the overall structure for the week started with the toolkit.  I'm very fortunate that I have been able to follow the development of the OULDI and Viewpoints projects so am familiar with them.  The toolkit was useful in terms of just seeing a representation of a small number of tools/resources/activities in the one place. I also added a couple of resources and updated one (the CogenT learning outcomes tool).  Getting the badge was an added bit of fun, and as I said on twitter weirdly motivating</p>

<p>Of course, being me got distracted again by the "list" layout and the potential for some alternative representations, having thrown down the gauntlet of data challenges in the previous 2 weeks, there was demand for more:)  This week was a bit simpler as I think there just needs some tweaking of the list view which should be relatively simple as there is a simple (manual) categorization.  The storify (see link) captures some of the conversation.</p>

<p>Now off to trying and contribute to at least one discussion, try and think a bit more about my design. Ironically I don't think this week I'm going to be able to do much with my team, I think it will be more of an individual effort, but that's OK</p>

<p>#oldsmooc forgive me, it's been 3 days since my last entry into this cloud.  I have spectacularly failed to move forward from Sunday.  However in my defence as I said before I am familar with quite a few of the tools already. I have had a look at the discussion and sharing spaces and the responses just seem to confirm the appeal of visual design aids such as the card sort activity.  I was also pleasantly pleased that a couple of the additions (the WIDE design template and the Widgat tool) I'd put into the toolbox were commented on, and most impressively used by a team. (http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7785).  I've been able to share this with the team at Teesside who developed the tool and they have now joined cloudworks and invited the team to an event they are running at the end of Feb.  I've also made my first contribution to discussion forums.</p>
 
<p> My response to the feedback questions:
<br> What three words describe this week's activities?: practical, focused, challenging</br> 
<br>What did you like about this week?: I was really looking forward to this week as it was more focused, however due to other "stuff" I haven't had the time I'd like to spend on it. But I did like getting the resource gather badge:-) and also a sense of helping others on the course as they used one of the tools I'd shared.</br>
<br>What could be improved? I am wondering if there was just a bit too much to do in one week?  Ironically this is the first week I've not really had much contact with my team. Or maybe I'm just lazy.</br>

<p> Despite not moving actually moving my design idea forward the way the design of the week encouraged, I found that the time I have been able to spend on this has  really helped me to think about what how the resources particularly the dream bazaar and the toolkit could be used in a short, focused webquest to dicover tools and design ideas.</p>]]></description>

              <title>OLDsMOOC Week 2; learning but not as we know it</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7770</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7770</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is my reflection on the experience of OLDsMOOC Week 2</p>
<p>Week 2 has been an exercise in balance. In stretching and being stretched. OLDsMOOC; where experience is all &ndash; this is learning but not as we know it. Context is critical to success.</p>
<p>OLDsMOOC operates on multiple levels; the challenges of the technology, the keeping up with comments and discussions, accessing the range of learning materials, making notes, critically reflecting and then &ndash; finally &ndash; actively engaging with the learning subject. Deconstructed in this way, it doesn&rsquo;t look so different after all. What exactly is it presenting the challenge?</p>
<p>At the end of Week 2&nbsp;I&rsquo;m&nbsp;finding my way around; much the same as being on a new campus or in a new town. The strange is becoming familiar. The challenge has been working through the materials and learning activities. But there&rsquo;s nothing new about this either. Any learning experience has content and OLDsMOOC is flexible, it&rsquo;s not as though the assessment is critical so what exactly is my problem? Because there is a problem, and as Week 3 begins, I&rsquo;m realising it&rsquo;s more about me than the MOOC. It&rsquo;s about how I manage my workload and respond to new experiences. In particular it&rsquo;s about reaching a point where I&rsquo;m no longer keeping on top of the essentials. I&rsquo;m not blaming the MOOC; it just happens to be the activity skewing the balance to a point where some reassessment is required.</p>
<p>So why do a MOOC? Firstly, why not? The potential challenge of free open educational opportunities can&rsquo;t be ignored. Media have hyped up the implications, presenting them as threats as much as opportunities. The MOOC word has embedded at a speed symptomatic of a twitter trend or viral email. Concepts associating worth with monetary value are being challenged by MOOC openness where are experts are seemingly giving away their expertise for free and networks of subject specialisms emerge out of nothingness. &lsquo;Everything solid melts into air&rsquo; is reversed. Out of virtual space comes the solidity of connections, working groups, the #oldsmooc hashtag. Far from the self-destruction of modernity, MOOCs are creating realities at a speed and intensity which has to be experienced to be evaluated. No one knows there they&rsquo;re going and to be part of the journey is exciting.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m still MOOCing&hellip;</p>
<p>Hanging on in there&hellip;</p>
<p>Knowing some critical reflection on work load balance is required, but this insider experience of the digital revolution is too important to be ignored. I&rsquo;ve might have only cursorily glanced at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/personas.html" target="_blank">Personas</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/representations-and-languages/force-map" target="_blank">Force Maps</a>&nbsp;and<a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/methods-and-methodologies/eor" target="_blank">Ecology of Resources</a>, missed the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course/inquire/convergence" target="_blank">Google Hangout&nbsp;</a>and not yet watched the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course/inquire" target="_blank">Week Two video</a>&nbsp;but in terms of learning, OLDsMOOC is invaluable. Bring on&nbsp;Week 3&hellip;</p>]]></description>

              <title>Week Two Summary Contextualisation (Sue Watling DIY Multimedia)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7769</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7769</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Less about DIY Multimedia and more reflections on the contextualisation of OLD</p>
<p>Learning and isolation are poor partners. Focus on the learner context enhances the process of OLD through revealing motivations as well as potential barriers. Context can reveal attention hot spots e.g. ease of access to materials, availability of support, the loneliness of the long distance online learner, guidance on specific design criteria e.g. the variety of activities, collaboration with peers and tutors, interaction with content, formative and diagnostic assessment opportunities etc. Context assists the designer make appropriate choices, in particular providing mechanisms for customising learning to suit individual preference e.g. providing information in alternative formats. All this runs in parallel to theoretical approaches to LD for example constructive alignment (Biggs and Tang, 2011).</p>
<p>Scenarios,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/personas.html" target="_blank">Personas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ld-grid.org/resources/representations-and-languages/force-map" target="_blank">Force Maps</a>&nbsp;are useful approaches to OLD. Context can be presented in textual formats but also displayed through mind mapping or diagrams where a visual approach can offer an effective overview of key issues. Constructing context encourages sharing practice; drawing on own experiences and incorporating those of colleagues to bring key issues together. Doing this online rather than round a table can in itself reveal areas of online learning design which need attention.</p>
<p>For my own practice inclusion is a key concern. Without attention to access, the application of theory to practice becomes diluted. Effective OLD takes into account the diversity of ways people access learning resources and opportunities, this is particularly important where there are no face to face clues or opportunities for discussion. Identifying potential barriers to access and participation are key to retention and success.</p>
<p>In the future I will be looking to building a collection of contrasting scenarios for future reference and experiment with alternative ways of presenting these e.g. diagrammatically.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<div style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>Activity 1: (15-20 minutes):</strong>&nbsp;Research has shown that individuals, teams and institutions can adopt quite different approaches to how they set about conceiving of and describing learning designs. In part this may reflect different approaches to teaching and different institutional cultures. Spend 10 minutes thinking about the last time you needed to design a learning experience (for other learners or for yourself) and post your thoughts on this Cloud (below), or on your blog, via twitter (#oldsmooc_w3), or on the thread on Google Groups called <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/olds-mooc-open/sdXOas6KEoA">Different approaches to design</a>. The following questions may help to focus your thoughts:<br />
<ul>
<li>Which part/s of the design do you usually think about first when you begin a new learning design? Do you start with &ndash; the learners, the technology, learning approach, previous designs, resource constraints, time constraints, institutional strategy, or ... ?</li>
<li>Where do your ideas originate? From colleagues, from conferences or events, from student data or feedback, from personal experience, from case studies, or ...?</li>
<li>What difficulties do you encounter when trying to describe your design ideas to colleagues or to yourself?</li>

Not sure that it tells me very much, but hopefully all will become clear in future weeks!</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[A technology advisor for a national service has been involved with a number of learning design tool developments; and often has to introduce projects to work of other projects.  She would like a simple online (and easily updatable) online resource that could link and explain a number of tools to anyone who was interested in using/and or developing learning design tools/approaches but make it more interactive than just scrolling through a list.  She is wondering if a webquest approach (identify, explore, contextualise, share) approach might work. ]]></description>

<p>This is&nbsp; my 3rd MOOC so far</p>
<p>I'm interested inOER; OEP; MOOC, open ed,quality. My PhD which I earned DEc 2012 from Oulu University in Finland was about benchmarking e-learning in higher education. I have recently been appointed to take the lead for my University to goopen and to be part in teh MOOC movement,<br />That is teh reason why I follow the OLDSMOOC, trying to learn about</p>
<ul>
<li>methods for design and innovation</li>
<li>&nbsp;inquiry learning</li>
<li>developing web-based and mobile stuff to support learning (trajectories) across settings and episodes.</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3>That Was The Week That Was</h3>
<p>This has been one of the most inspiring, frustrating, confusing, exciting and stimulating weeks I have enjoyed for such a long time. It has taken me a while to get to grips with some of the technologies being used here - and I'm still finding difficulty at times, regardless of the fact that I consider myself reasonably well versed in using online resources and tools. I didn't really settle properly until I watched the <a title="Converge Video Stream" href="http://youtu.be/Sj_N1jMD7hQ" target="_blank">Converge</a> video stream. I had been approaching this MOOC from a traditional scheduled course perspective i.e. meet the daily challenges and keep up with the flow -a method that was an impossible task for me to accomplish - I simply do not have enough time to complete this MOOC following that format and at the same time gain the most from what is being presented to me here. I relaxed in my thinking, realising that this course is for ME to explore and not an exercise in satisfying some set criteria laid out by the lecturers. I am not "on schedule" because of laziness, lack of ability, lack of motivation or any of the other negative emotions that one can feel when faced with a mountainous challenge; rather I am behind schedule because I'm finding so much reading that is simply compelling and I would be doing it an injustice if I didn't take the time to actually read it. Also, I learn best by reflection and it takes time for me to "join the dots" and place what I've read into some semblance of order and I need enough time to conceptualise and compartmentalise my personal responses to what I've read - in other words place it within and around my own current context.</p>
<h4>What have I learned?</h4>
<p>The main learning outcome for me so far has been this; &nbsp;most (if not all) of my attempts to create stimulating, structured, engaging &nbsp;and visually rich online content have not succeeded. I see this as a positive outcome. &nbsp;It is perhaps worth mentioning here, that I have not had the opportunity to teach any subject wholly online and my use of online resources has been within a classroom environment. Students all have access to these outwith college but I have little in the way of measuring how much some of them are used. One of the other outcomes in doing this course is that it has highlighted how out of practice I am at writing and getting my thoughts down quickly so, hopefully this will improve as the weeks go on.</p>
<p>I have already learned much about the new thinking and pedagogies required for online teaching - I was aware of some of this prior to starting but, in a little over a week, I have gained an enormous amount of knowledge on the theories and approaches. I was clear (I thought) on how NOT to use a VLE and have seen many examples of that - including an online course purporting to be about teaching online. However, I didn't have any real authoritative knowledge to convince others of the need for a new approach. This MOOC is filling that gap. I have shared with colleagues and anyone else I thought interested, my "discoveries" along my journey including the work of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChaQjN6tViOSPvY9LLaq_Mg/videos" target="_blank">Michael Wesch</a>&nbsp;and in particular his videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLlGopyXT_g" target="_blank">The Machine is Us</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGCJ46vyR9o&list=PL01C06F0B5E2B9EE4&index=2" target="_blank">A Vision of Students Today</a>&nbsp;(particularly relevant to Week 2's topic of Context). An examination of the dates of these videos will give an indication of how long ago my personal journey started. Inspirational (I thought) but, it seems not enough so to convince many of my immediate peers. Another shared "hero" is <a href="http://sirkenrobinson.com/skr/" target="_blank">Sir Ken Robinson</a> particularly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U" target="_blank">Changing Education Paradigms</a>&nbsp;again, it seemed, not quite enough to stimulate the need for change. Incidentally, I felt somewhat validated that my approach and thinking was relevant when some 2 years later this video was shown at a Scotland's Colleges staff development session. This is not to brag or boast but rather illustrate the (sometimes) uphill struggle to convince educationalists of the need for change.</p>
<h4>Evaluation of previous attempts at creating online content; using tools and resources</h4>
<p>Week One also prompted me to revisit my early attempts and approaches and examine their shortcomings in light of what I'd learned so far. I suppose it is inevitable that given my background in visual art, my initial approach was to try to present content in a visually rich manner. After much searching and trips down blind alleys, I found <a href="http://compendium.open.ac.uk/institute/download/download.htm">Compendium</a>&nbsp;, an excellent and highly recommended OU tool. I used it to create a structured visual guide to the course content of a unit on Acoustics delivered to HE Sound Production students. &nbsp;Each purple map expands to show detailed content in much the same format as the image of front page shown below; the asterisks show brief notes when mouse hovers over it. The chief benefit of using this tool (for me, in my context, yes there's that all important word again) is that it embeds into Blackboard VLE in the form of an exported zip file which expands to a fully active, linked site/document.&nbsp;I should also mention my gratitude to Rod Nave of Georgia State University for magnanimously allowing me to embed content from the excellent&nbsp;<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html" target="_blank">Hyperphysics</a>&nbsp;site. I highly recommend it to anyone teaching science. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Compendium image by An Dearg, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lescowley/8405906801/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8075/8405906801_22cac45c84.jpg" alt="Compendium image" width="472" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>The shortcomings of this approach?: it is a static representation of <strong>my guide</strong> to suitable online resources. How to improve on this? Enter <a href="http://compendiumld.open.ac.uk/">CompendiumLD</a>&nbsp;- my next learning curve. I hope to use CompendiumLD to build some scaffolding onto this. My Dream Project for this MOOC.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Flickr&nbsp;</a>I have used this site when teaching Digital Photography and Digital Imaging in a variety of courses at levels from basic non-vocational evening classes, FE units and at HE (PDA in Digital Imaging). This has probably been the most successful tool I've used. However, there are some problems, especially with "mature" students getting started (creating the account, remembering their username, password etc., etc.) and I have found that they need careful and patient guidance in the early stages. I create separate groups for each student cohort, the students upload their images, then add them to the group after they have joined that group. I can then create Galleries of some of the "best"&nbsp;work. These entries in these galleries are sometimes created by me and I have sometimes asked students to vote on which photos should be selected. If I am creating the galleries, it gives me the opportunity to include images based on all sorts of criteria; image showing good improvement by an otherwise "poor" student - great encouragement for them; images showing use of editing software; simply stunning photos and so on - again it depends on the student context. The groups are by invite only, the photos are public but individual student-student and tutor-student comments are private, visible only to members of that group. That in itself is a shortcoming - I have yet to find a way of easily expanding this community to include all students, past and present and avoiding it becoming over complex, especially in the early stages. I may at some point create a "global group" and invite students to join that. I have also experimented with the use of "tags" on photos to feed aggregators such as <a href="http://www.netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> and to introduce HE students to the concept of using tags as a search refinement tool. Final verdict? - I will continue using this but seek to refine the ways it can be more useful to me/students e.g. exploring the sharing options to Facebook, Blogger etc.; experiment further in using Flickr's API</p>
<p><a href="http://www.diigo.com" target="_blank">Diigo</a>&nbsp;a Social Bookmarking site. Prior to using this I used <a href="https://delicious.com/">Delicious</a>&nbsp;but found the extra features in Diigo preferable. In Diigo I can do everything that I've seen possible with other social bookmarking sites (lists;tags;comments;community search) but in addition I have access to the Teacher Console - from memory I think I had to apply to Diigo for this added functionality. This enables me to create and administer student accounts, thereby avoiding some of the shortcomings mentioned about Flickr, and create groups in much the same way as Flickr. I've used this as a way of trying to encourage student collaboration in that, as members of the group they can post links to content they have found relevant/interesting and comment on what they have found. Diigo was initially blocked by our web filter on the college network and I had to ask for it to be allowed. This met with some initial resistance from our network security expert as it was listed as a "spoofing" risk. I got really excited when I discovered that Diigo allowed me to place "sticky notes" on sites, visible only to members of my group(s), providing a "breadcrumbs" trail so that I could direct them to a site ask them to read my note(s) which could be instructions/questions ..anything you'd want to say under classroom conditions. Diigo also allows you to create slideshows of websites you have collated in lists. However, there are problems in fully utilising this resource. For instance, not all sites allow the notes to be added; on some sites I have encountered "public" notes that were nothing short of offensive - there are ways round this but in my context i.e. teaching younger FE students, this is unacceptable. So, for the time being, I have abandoned even trying this approach and use it solely as a group collaboration tool. Also, to fully utilise&nbsp;the facilities in Diigo, the browser toolbar needs to be installed - not something the students are permitted to do on our network. So, final verdict? - useful but needs careful consideration before "jumping right in". Future development? - questionable.</p>
<p><a href="http://nhcncart09.blogspot.co.uk/">Blogger</a>&nbsp;this was my first attempt at using Blogger in a classroom setting to meet the criteria of an NC (FE) unit on Art &amp; Design: Digital Media and it seemed to be a huge success. My bubble was soon burst when I tried the same thing with other student groups. Different contexts at work? Same unit, different students - why the resistance to using this? Tried it with FE music students - almost total resistance. I was forced to abandon this in subsequent attempts for lack of engagement with this medium. However, I haven't abandoned it completely because it is a wonderful way of collating student work by taking feeds from their individual blogs and embedding them into a single class blog allowing student to share their work and which also acts as a "light touch" guiding hand by the tutor. I also later tried using the blogging facility within Sharepoint, our college intranet, which lacks all of the panache of Blogger and has a very "corporate" look and feel. This was in response to feedback from industry saying that students lacked the ability to take notes in meetings using traditional means i.e.&nbsp;pen and paper. So I gave very short lectures using a whiteboard,&nbsp;in a very traditional, old school approach and asked the students to take notes. Since this was an FE group, I needed some way of a. improving their IT skills and b. checking the "quality" of their notes. So, I asked them to transfer their notes onto their blogs, again I took feeds from them all and aggregated them in a single class blog. In effect they were creating their own content. I think it worked. I haven't had a subsequent student cohort where&nbsp;I felt this approach was appropriate but will do so as soon as opportunity allows. Final verdict?: keep trying, try to find ways to "sell" the method.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.netvibes.com/lescowley#Olds_MOOC" target="_blank">Netvibes</a>&nbsp;is an aggregator tool which I have found extremely useful. The link given here is my public experiment at using this to aggregate content from various areas of this MOOC in a way that is familiar to me. Netvibes allows the creation of Private pages as well as the public link given here. I used the private page as a one-stop method of having everything I am currently working on or need access to, including email, on one tabbed, configurable page. Shortcomings: college network does not (for as yet some unknown reason) load the pages properly. Works a treat at home though. Can find little or no ways to allow collaboration. Final verdict?: could be extremely useful in delivering wholly online extra-institution courses as a method of collating and evidencing research sources used by HE students.</p>
<h4>Evaluation of new tools presented in this MOOC</h4>
<p>Cloudworks - I can see potential in it. May need some form of introductory tutorial for students. Still experimenting with it. Need to find out more about the options when I add hyperlinks - Class?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google+, Google Groups, Circles, Communities, Hangouts &nbsp;- all very new to me, apart from having a Google+ account I had never really used it. This has mileage without a doubt. Need to get more familiar before evaluating its usefulness in my context.</p>
<p>Bibsonomy&nbsp;- yet to really explore it but can see its usefulness for HE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, all of this and more is rummaging around in my head while thinking about Learning Design. I'm just getting to the point where I feel I have fully completed week one. Phew!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

              <title>My week 2 learning objectives and reflections (Sheila MacNeill)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7500</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7500</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>So list of the "official" objectives and outcomes</p>
<p>From the week 2 overview page:</p>
<p>Design Outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore and represent context in relation to your design challenge.</li>
<li>Communicate and receive feedback on your analysis of context for your design challenge.</li>
<li>Gain insights into your design challenge by applying one or more contextual learning design approaches</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning Outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review & revise your understanding of learner context and it's relevance to learning design.</li>
<li>Increase your awareness of approaches to context for learning design.</li>
<li>Evaluate the relevance of contextual approaches to your own learning design practice.</li>
<li>Plan further learning about contextual approaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well first few days have been distracted by thinking about potential of cloudworks and visualistaion to make it a more useful and contextualised learning space (more on blog post of 18 January)</p>
<p>Looked at context slide presentations - and lots of the quotes there are just confirming my hunch that cloudworks itself coud provide a really useful context for learning - although in its current state, and with the other techs/systems/spaces being used in this course I can't help feeling that lots of learning is taking place "despite" the context of the overall implementation of the learning design.</p>
<p>Have arranged for another online meeting with my team for Sunday. </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>

<p>Preparing for team meet up  on Sunday 20th, and looking at persona cards, and watching the #øldsmooc team videos from their planning day, was reminded of the Widgat project. Although primarily concerned with buillding widgets they have develope a nice design template http://arc.tees.ac.uk/WIDE/Widget-Learning-Design-Template.ashx  </p>

<p>Wednesday 23rd. So managed to have a quick chat with Clare on Sunday (still having issues with google hangouts on my ipad). We both agreed that even virtual face to face contact was really re-assuring. We agreed to develop a persona/scenario each - Clare did a far more comprehensive job than me and I really enjoyed reading her scenario.  During our chat we were talking about guilt, time pressures etc and I mentioned that I had been half thinking about writing a "blaggers guid to mooc-ing", and in true distraction from doing the real course work fashion I wrote "how to succeed at Mooc-ing without really trying" (http://blogs.cetis.ac.uk/sheilamacneill/2013/01/20/how-to-succeed-at-mooc-ing-without-really-trying/).  I was slightly nervous about posting this on my work blog, but it has had a very postive reaction and hopefully brough a bit of much needed humour to things.</p>

<p>It's always difficult to "plan fun" -particularly on-line but I think in moocs when there is so much going on and everyone is feeling a bit overwhelmed, a bit of fun and "let's not take it all so seriously" is needed.</p>

<p>I've found the daily summaries particularly useful this week as I just haven't spend enough time in any of the oldsmooc spaces this week.  I'm not quite sure how Josh has had time to do anything this week - he's even left comments on my clouds.  So the whole issue of staff time for MOOCs has been on my mind too in terms of mainstreaming of MOOCs,  in terms of design of activities, faciliation and management strategies.  Massive commitment seems to be key here.</p>

<p>I took part in the weekly convergence session (unfortunately due to work commitments could only make it for half an hour). Again it was great to see some fellow students and hear their points of views and see their work.   Again was impressed by the honesty and openness of the course team in the  part of the converstation about context, and the impact of design context and just how hard it is to design for "massive" - you're never going to get all the personas.</p>

<p>I started the week thinking about my personal context/learning space, and as the week draws to a close, I'm still pondering. In terms of MOOCs maybe getting students more comfortable with their learning context more important than "traditional" online socialising activities. I'm thinking of Gilly Salmon's five stage model - perhaps the online socialisation part of that needs extended to have much more emphasis on contextualising multiple learning spaces. Something I hope to explore more in the 7c's next week.</p>

<p> So I probably not stuck exactly to the over-arching plan for the week, but I'm quite comfortable with what I have been able to do.  Next week I'm going to make a concerted effort to engage in my 'scary spaces' - google discusion groups:-)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility within paced task structures</strong>. Week 1 on "courses" often involves a multitide of complexities (range of interests, entry-levels, comfort zones, goal settings, cultural factors) and with a multitude of areas (twitter stream, google docs, cloud-specific discussions, personal cloud creations) contributions seem dispersed. Some confusion is noticeable but with this dispersion (both felt and read) will more insight into "ownership" of learning spaces flow? </li>
<li><strong>Personal objectives</strong> and reflections vs. input and contributions from other participants. Easy to get carried away by both. Need to find a balance.</li>
<li><strong>Clouds and the related terminology</strong> (cloud-based environments, cloudworks, cloudscapes, cloudstreams, fishbowl discussions) Happily and safely cloud surfing but need more time!</li>
<li>Mulling over <strong>learning design</strong> principles, ideas, models and narratives and how the multiple context of participants will bring a lot of these to life over the next few weeks. There's uncertaintly, there are many clouds emerging. How will all this re-look, reconfigure and inspire?</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>INTRODUCING MYSELF</strong></p>
<p>My comment here has already been posted in the Google Group Discussion.    Having just returned from my summer holiday on a beautiful Australian beach, I feel a little behind already.   I'm Penny, an Australian secondary maths and science teacher. After 23 years I'm no longer teaching in a traditional classroom but have become interested in online teaching and learning. I've done a number of online courses and my experiences varied enormously. One of my goals for 2013 is gain more skills, knowledge and experience of teaching online....that's why I'm here, to learn how it can be done properly and to come away with something I can deliver.   So, that's my motivation for participating in #oldsmooc, now on to the other questions.  I've also done a "traditional" course in this area and I'd say my motivation was the same as participating here. I'm a teacher by profession and have discovered that I love the design aspect of online teaching and learning. Roles are changing...can I work in this field without re qualifying as an "Instructional Designer"? At the moment I'm learning all I can, any way I can....I'd love employment in this area though :) Re completion, yes. When I begin something I like to follow through and finish it to the best of my ability.  As for certification...what I need is recognition by my Institute of Teaching that what I'm doing is appropriate ongoing professional development. I have certain criteria to be met before I apply for re-registration later this year. So whether it's a digital certificate, badge or acknowledgment in some other format, recognition of my learning is important for me...not so much a formal qualification. I guess it's more informal.  As a result of completing this MOOC I hope to gain more skills, knowledge and experience of online teaching. I'd like to develop this in the context of delivering professional development to teachers or mentoring pre service teachers. I'm currently involved in a research project at Victoria University, Melbourne, looking into the relationships between pre service teachers and their mentors. Cheers Penny</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[This week I hope to.
- understand how the MOOC operates
- set up my workflow on desktop computer and iPad
- connect with other participants
- work my way through the activities
- watch the introductory video
- think about and decide on a project

How do I know if I've achieved this?
- once I get the "big picture"
- when I'm satisfied that I'm covering all aspects of the MOOC in the best way possible
- the notifications will start rolling in
- tick them off the checklist
- done
- once I stop changing my mind, have connected with someone and settled on a project title]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>So maybe I've got the wrong end of the stick with the Study Circles, or maybe this has already been posted in another cloudscape, but surely we should have at least one London meetup for the course, shouldn't we? I would have thought the only question is whether we want to do one in the centre of town or divide into north/south of the river etc. Or is everyone sticking with their colleagues in their HE institutions? If so, that's me scuppered because I'm not in one.</p>
<p>Anyway, please comment/favourite/do as you will if you'd be interested in meeting for a coffee or something stronger a few times during the course.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Darren Gash: My Dream: Learning Design Project Proposal: Redesign of a level 6 mentorship module for blended and online delivery</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7307</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7307</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h1>Darren Gash: Redesign of a level 6 mentorship module for blended and online delivery&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>Your situation</h2>
<p>The Mentorship module is a 15 credit level 6 module accredited by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), and run by Surrey University&rsquo;s Health and Social Care faculty. The module focuses on mentoring and the enhancement of coaching, assessment and facilitation skills, through a &ldquo;reflective and supportive approach&rdquo;. Out of the 150 notional learning, there are 30 taught hours over 5 days, 30 hours practice learning activities and 90 self-directed study/learning. The module runs over a period of 16 weeks, with approximately 60 students per intake and 10 cohorts per year</p>
<p>The VLE has previously been used to distribute course materials. Since Surrey moved over to a new VLE in 2012 (from WebCT to Desire2Learn) materials have not been transferred across and are currently distributed by email.</p>
<p>The programme leaders for the module are keen to transfer the module content across to the new VLE and to develop the module for SurreyLearn to make better use of the technology on offer. This would be initially as a blended offering to be offered from June 2013 onwards, however they would also like to offer a fully online option for students in the future.</p>
<h2>The Change you would like to see (challenge)</h2>
<p>For me the primary challenge is to redesign the module so that it is blended in the truest sense of the word, i.e. a combination of seamlessly integrated face to face and online activities aligned with the module outcomes. The programme leaders&rsquo; initial aim was to simply transfer the course materials across to the new VLE, i.e. use it as a repository for storing materials to support face to face activities only. Adopting a more blended approach is vital as I believe this will be easier to then offer a fully online option that is comparable in terms of experience and outcomes to the blended option, as well as the NMC who will need to validate the online version.</p>
<h2>How you might go about bringing that change</h2>
<p>What I first need to do is get a more detailed picture of the current offering, e.g. the type of students doing the course (I will ask the programme leaders to provide a couple of user case scenarios), the pedagogical approaches used to deliver course, what works, what doesn&rsquo;t work, areas they would like to change or improve in particular.&nbsp; In terms of technology, Desire2Learn has the usual VLE type tools that can be used to support learning, including forums, blogs and an e-portfolio.&nbsp;</p>

              <title>@isharacomix: My Dream: A MOOC that explores low-level hacking</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7071</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7071</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>@isharacomix: A low-level and historical MOOC</p>

<p>One of the most inspiring things I've seen in my life has been the Raspberry Pi. A low-cost, credit-card sized computer that can be used for anything from OS development to robotics. I got to go to a talk last night where a bunch of local hackers got together and showed us the cool things they've done with their Raspberry Pis. At a price of only $35, it would be awesome to see a MOOC that explores low-level computing.</p>

<p>Computers have become so powerful and abstract that many computer scientists can succeed in school without ever understanding what goes on under the hood. Special purpose computers have been replaced by general purpose and consumer hardware, and because there aren't really jobs for "6502 Assembly Programmers" anymore, you don't see students signing up for the classes in earnest.</p>

<p>The Change I would like to see?</p>

<p>I want to see a course that addresses these concepts - we introduce them just barely at State with our "Assembly and Software Tools" course, but I want students to explore old computing in more detail. Given the appeal of development on the web and cloud these days, lower level hackery isn't nearly as glamorous. Development on constrained devices made coders more like wizards, being able to squeeze out amazing things like games in less than 32KB of space. Not only is it interesting in its own right, it helps expose new programmers to the mindset of their predecessors.</p>

<p>What I'm going to do?</p>

<p>I've already made up my mind and decided that I want to make a MOOC on this topic. This is how I'm going to do my final project for several of the classes I'm taking this semester, developing resources and infrastructure to support this MOOC on my own, without the help of big powerhouses like Coursera. Even if it doesn't go worldwide, I just want to be able to expose it to my fellow students at State.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2 style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Situation (context)</h2>
<p>I'm developing and delivering a new unit within our MA in CPD (Academic Practice) framework. Most participants will be University of the Arts London teaching staff who are taking the unit as an elective for their PG Cert.</p>
<p>We have a small but passionate and motivated team contributing to the unit, with a considerable amount of expertise in Open Practice and OER use/production. My own expertise is more on the Open Reflective Practice side; I've dabbled in the production &amp; use of OERs but I'm definitely not an expert in them. The teaching team - and their<em> very approximate</em> specialisms (oh, I really need to find out more about what they do... curses) will be:</p>
<p><strong>Myself</strong> (Open Practice in Teaching)<br /><strong>John Casey</strong> (OER management)<br /><strong>Chris Follows</strong> (OER use &amp; production: logistics &amp; standards)<br /><strong>John Jackson</strong> (OER production: tools)</p>
<p>We have around 10 participants signed up to take the unit in February. We have the benefit of our own fantastic OER database for arts education (<a href="http://process.arts.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Process Arts</a>), and a management team that supports innovation and gives us the autonomy we need to experiment with different approaches and environments. Our main challenge is - as always - finding enough time to do these things well...!</p>

<h2>The change I would like to see (challenge)</h2>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next few weeks (ok, lets be realistic - the next two weeks - I need to have developed my plans for this course beyond the handbook and assignment briefs, and to have fleshed out the details of the learning activities that participants will complete, the environments in which they do them, and the content we will ask them to engage with. If I don't do this in a timely manner, the course won't be very good. I need participants to feel confident that we (ok, I) know what we're talking about and can advise and support them effectively in their projects.</p>
<h2>How I might go about realising that change</h2>
<p>In terms of the development of the OEP unit in the context of this course, I'm going to start by presenting the current handbook, scheme of work and assignment briefs, and the feedback given to me so far by the other three members of the team. They have given some great suggestions for tweaks that might be needed, additions to the reading lists and topics that might need to be included in the face-to-face sessions. I think bringing all of this into one place will be a good start... and I'll take it from there!</p>
<p>In terms of the pedagogic approach itself... It's going to be quite problem-based; as with this course, participants will be asked to identify a project of their own quite early on, and base their assignments on this. The pre-course research activity and the first workshop day will be focused on getting participants engaged with some key issues and tools associated with Open Practice and the production of OERs.</p>]]></description>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7019</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h3><strong>This is my Learning Journal for OLDS MOOC</strong></h3>
<p>I will be using this space reflecting on this course</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Week 1 reflections</strong></h2>
<p><strong>My learning outcomes (before start)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>defining my personnal workspace</li>
<li>defining my learning design project</li>
<li>sharing ideas with other</li>
<li>defining a space for collaboration</li>
<li>defining 'Learning Design'</li>
</ul>
<p>Before assessing if my LO have been achieved, I would like to start first by comparing my feelings with the ones I had during a module of the MAODE (Master of Online and distance education, OU). I think it could be interesting to compare a cMOOC with an OU online course.</p>
<p>To it, i will use the<a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-tivities/5stage.shtml" target="_blank"><strong> Salmon's 5 stage model for e-tivities</strong></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-tivities/5stage.shtml#1">Stage 1 - Access &amp; Motivation:&nbsp; </a></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;&lt;E-tivities at this stage therefore need to provide a gentle but interesting introduction to using the technological platform and acknowledgement of the feelings surrounding using technology and meeting new people through the online environment. Even the most apparently confident individuals need support at the beginning.&gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>OU module</strong>: Usually all the information concerning the course can be found on Moodle. Everything is perfectly explained form the start (learning outcomes, ressources, 'wellcome messages from the course team', interaction modes mainly through online group forum on Moodle, wiki features, assignment, Library services, etc..) As participants, you just need to follow instructions. You work in group (about 10 people) with a tutor. Group communication and interaction are done on the tutor group's forum on Moodle. All the ressources and tools are centralised on Moodle.&nbsp; Moodle is rather user-friendly and intuitive.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>OLDS MOOC</strong>: All the needed informations can be found on the oldsmooc's website. I've found them extermely well organised and explained. Thanks to the url links and explanation, It has been easy to create my personal workplace (clouds and cloudspaces) on cloudworks and to post first messages on google forums.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-tivities/5stage.shtml#2">Stage 2 - Socialisation</a></li>
<li>&lt;&gt;
<ul>
<li><strong>OU module</strong>: An ice-breaker is usually organised on a general forum where all course's particpants can meet and on the group's forum. Both forum are on the same place on the course's space on Mood<br />Personnaly, after 2 -3 days, I usually feel reassured because I know who are the other fellow students in my group and the tutor who will support us. I know what I will have to do, how and where the interaction and activities will take place because everything is centralised on moodle, and few tools are used to interact. <strong><em>At this stage</em>,</strong> usually the tutor&nbsp;is building the bridges between the participants.</li>
<li><strong>OLDS MOOC</strong>: Once the personal workplace created, the problems have started :-( !!! I find difficult to find information on cloudworks and to follow the huge number of messages on the different threads on the google forums. Compared to the OU module where discussions occur between about 10 people, it's much more difficult to follow the discussion. Discussion appears in different places on cloudworks,&nbsp; google forums, google + , twitter. .... I think that I will take a little time to become familiar with all this. Concerning the study circle, Arthur Oglesby has taken the initiative to create a team workplace for participants interested by digital literacy.&nbsp; <em><strong>At this stage</strong></em>, the bridges are built by us (the participants) around a common topic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-tivities/5stage.shtml#3">Stage 3 - Information Exchange</a></li>
<li>&lt;&lt; At this stage, information can be exchanged and co-operative tasks can be achieved. The big advantage of asynchronicity is that everyone can explore information at their own pace and react to it before hearing the views and interpretations of others. Participants&rsquo; learning requires two kinds of interaction: interaction with the course content and interaction with people, namely the e-moderator(s) and other people.&gt;&gt;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><strong>OU module</strong>: &nbsp; <strong><em>At this stage</em>,</strong> the information exchange is done through the asynchronous group's forum on Moodleexclusively between the group members and the tutor.&nbsp; In some module, the synchronous tool Eluminate has been used one or two times for a lived session<strong><em>.&nbsp;</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>OLDS MOOC</strong>: <em><strong>At this stage</strong></em>, the interactions occur not only between participants in the study circle, with also with the course team and all the participants through twitter and the different google forums. OLDSMOOC encourage the participants to self-organised their communication tools, enhancing by then their PLE (Personal Leanring Environment). The interactions between the participants are richer.&nbsp; We can use the ones we want to communication. In our study circle, we have started to use: cloudworks, mindmeister, google forum, twitter, google docs, scoop it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-tivities/5stage.shtml#4">Stage 4 - Knowledge Construction</a> : will occur in the following weeks</li>
<li><a href="http://www.atimod.com/e-tivities/5stage.shtml#5">Stage 5 - Development</a>: will occur in the following weeks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I've learnt during w1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>defining my personnal workspace: <strong>done</strong></li>
<li>defining my learning design project : <strong>done </strong></li>
<li>sharing ideas with other: <strong>yes</strong>&nbsp; I've posted different messages on Google forum and comments on different design projects on cloudworks. I've joined a study circle On digital Literacy.</li>
<li>defining a space for collaboration:&nbsp; Thanks to Arthur Oglesby yes ! I think that we have now different tools to communicate and share our ideas and ressources. I've tried to contribute by creating a scoop it</li>
<li>defining 'Learning Design' : <strong>more or less</strong>&nbsp; :_(I've participated to the Google forum discussion, but I've to admit that I spend most of my time this week to become familiar with the OLDS learning environment than on learning design reflections and readings ....</li>
</ul>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6996</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Although philosophy is taught more widely in schools than when I was in Sixth Form/attending school (I&nbsp;did not formally study/read philosophy until I reached University), it would be great to have an accessible, free, complete&nbsp;course which develops critical thinking skills and introduces people to philosophical ideas. The aim would be to widen participation in philosophy...</p>
<p>I'd like to see the use of social media and am particularly interested in developing the course so that it makes use of (or develops) open educational resources (OER)...</p>

              <title>My week 1 learning objectives (sheilamacneill)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6992</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6992</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>OK so for week 1 I aim to:</p>
<p>Complete the tasks as outlined (http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course/week-1)</p>
<p>So set up cloudspace/reflective journal - tick</p>
<p>join the google discussion group and introduce myself - tick</p>
<p>create/share/review "dream learning design" - tick ( and luckily found very quickly another two participants who are thinking of much the same idea as me)</p>
<p>team up</p>
<p>as of Sunday this seems to be happening</p>
<p>** 16 Jan update**</p>
<p>have managed to team up with Helen and Claire (despite my home broadband chucking me out of our google hang out) see http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6981</p>
<p>brainstorm - not quite managed to get to grips/ find time to engage with the design mind map.</p>
<p>reflect - have posted some early reflections on my blog (see link below).&nbsp; Overall first week has been quite chaotic, but I think things will settle down a bit more now.&nbsp; I feel that the teaming up aspect was slightly easier as I already know a few people taking the course so one less hurdle to overcome.&nbsp; I've also been impressed by the "openness" of the the team, particularly Yishay, Simon and Peter who have been very candid about the difference between the designing of the course and the "messiness" of the reality of it when in is running. I didn't mange to get to the google hang out yesterday but listened to most of it today. I have also been slightly distracted by the potential for representing cloudworks in different ways ( as outlined in my post) and the potential of SNA techniques for visualising cloudscapes as shared learning spaces/communities.&nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <title>My dream learning design project: practical learning design for PGCert/ peopl interested in trying out LD tools</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6990</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6990</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>I would like to design a short module (or perhaps series of short sessions) which provided some scaffolding for PGCert in Academic Studies (or similar) to combine the theory of course design with some more practical/pragmatic experience of using some of the learning design tools which are now availalbe e.g. LAMS, LDSE. This would hopefully encourage students to take their ideas and actually use (and share them). It would also be useful as a stand alone resource for anyone with a spare half hour or so.</p>
<p>Outline of exisiting course outline:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Course (re)Design module:</p>
<p>Aim: to&nbsp; provide participants with the necessary educational understanding and pracitcal skills to desing an effective coures in their discipline.</p>
<p>Objectives: course particpants will:</p>
<ul>
<li>explore the thinking underpinnng teaching, learning and assessment with your discipline including drivers and opporuntities</li>
<li>Critically evaluate an existing design&nbsp; in relation to current educational ideas drawn from research and practice</li>
<li>Design or re-design a course to effectively meet the needs of learners and to satisfy disciplinary and institutional requirements</li>
<li>Reflect on the quality and effectiveness of your (re)desing from both an educational and pragmatic perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assisgnments - 3 x written submissions ( 1 x 500 word outline, 1x 1500 essay word design and reflection on design, 1x 1500 essay design of learning task and crical reflection on its educational potential.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>My dream is to help create a MOOC that will enable world wide <strong>Digital Literacy.</strong></p>
<p>I envision a <strong>map of learning activities</strong> for raising ones <strong>digital literacy</strong> competencies. Learners could jump in at any time, anywhere on the map,&nbsp;and find guidance to master that particular skill set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The map would be dynamic, continually being improved and expanded, much like in wikipedia.</p>
<h2><strong>Structure</strong></h2>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong><a title="digital literacy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy">Digital Literacy</a></strong> includes an enormous range of competencies.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>Mapping</strong> out the ever growing skill sets could perhaps be structured as a massive <strong>outline</strong> with collapsing/expanding branches (or a <strong>MindMap</strong>)</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong><a title="Multi-level Marketing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing#Setup">Multi-level Marketing</a></strong> techniques - newbies would sign up and be given a number of tokens/coins. They would offer to pay a coach/mentor/teacher coins &nbsp;in order to master a particular competency. Eventually they would advance into the mentor-coach role and pay their former mentor coach for back-up or support.</p>]]></description>

As a novice how does this feel right now? Well rather confusing, but I think I have now got cloud works sorted and I hope to meet up with others to design something about local and global labour markets.]]></description>

Generally, I like a bit of confusion, a bit of an intellectual 'soup', but so far things are a bit too far out here. I have little concept of what we are trying to do or where we should do it, or how, or with whom. Hopefully, meaning will begin to form...</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I am going to be using my <a href="http://helenwhitehead.com/blog2/tags/oldsmooc/">Wordpress blog</a> for OLDSMOOC posts mostly (link attached).</p>
<p>I'm Helen Whitehead and I'm a learning technologist at the University of Nottingham.&nbsp; My interest in learning design is related to my responsibility for supporting learning design within the University as a consultant to different types of modules, courses, and learning oppportunities. I help, train and support staff and write documentation for learning technologies and how to integarte them in course designs. I specialise in Moodle, Rogo, Xerte Online Toolkits, Adobe Connect and social media for learning.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of using the OLDSMOOC to help me create some learning resources that can be used in self-study online course in e-assessment, to support face to face training in e-assessment and in training to facilitate MOOCs.&nbsp; So I hope particularly to look at how MOOCs can be assessed where there is a mixture of types of attendees including some doing it for (different levels of) credit, professional development points, non-credit, or for interest as a MOOC participant.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Sue Watling Cloud for OLDs MOOC</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6837</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the challenges of working online is the proliferation of places to work in. It is early days on the OLDs MOOC but already there is additional email traffic and new online places to explore (Cloudworks, Google Groups, Bibsomony etc). This in itself is an interesting experience. Many of them are strange and digital confidence directly relates to existing experience &ndash; in particular with navigating around social networking platforms - so for participants new to working online this in itself may pose a barrier.</p>
<p>When it comes to online presence, I prefer less to more &ndash; like single sign-on in reverse &ndash; one post which appears in multiple places. I would be interested to know how other people manage their online lives. &nbsp;</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Use this cloud to help plan your participation in OLDS MOOC week 2.</strong></p>
<ul style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<li>Watch the 3 minute&nbsp;<a href="http://youtu.be/QQHvyWJIvTU" target="_blank">video introduction</a> (embedded below)</li>
<li>Look at the design &amp; learning outcomes&nbsp;(embedded below)&nbsp;for the week and consider how well these align with your goals</li>
<li>Look through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EskqQ9rxIMoGC7r7nzUApXtXWgv0n6FVt8zDmqcREj8/edit" target="_blank">activity outline</a> (embedded below)</li>
<li>Plan your own objectives and activity for the week (<a href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course" target="_blank">see course planner</a>).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Summarise your plans <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2449#clouds-in-cloudscape" target="_blank">to your learning journal</a> and comment on how you might measure achievement of your objectives (for <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6681" target="_blank">an example see Week 2 Planning in my learning journal</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>
<ul style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<li>Make a copy of, or your own activity outline or task list, share it with your team, cross things out as you do them, embed it in your learning journal...</li>
<li>Make a copy of the week 2 calendar events. Adjust events, tasks and reminders to suit your timetable. If you are in a team share your calendar within the team.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea here is for you to adapt the plan for this week to your own objectives and to schedule and share these with potential collaborators (shared calendars and task lists may be useful).</p>
<p>You might want to make suggestions about other useful tools and strategies in the discussion around this cloud.</p>
<p>We want you to be thinking about (self and/or peer) assessment with respect to your own objectives throughout the course.</p>
<p>You may also be thinking about evaluation and the extent to which the learning designs used in this course help you achieve your objectives and the designers' objectives (or not). This is also something to reflect on in your learning journals.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Skim through the presentations (embedded below) to get a feel for how the EoR design framework has been used in:</p>
<ul>
<li>design of support for better connecting primary school and home numeracy learning using tablet PCs.</li>
<li>co-design of technology-enhanced learning about sustainability with teenagers.</li>
<li>co-design of BYOD support for self-managed learning field trips with teenagers.</li>
<li>workshops with teachers designing technology-enhanced participatory science inquiry activities for secondary &amp; primary school.</li>
<li>participatory design of an Android app for foreign language vocabulary learning with self-directed adult learners.</li>
</ul>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Flick through the slides and start thinking about scenarios you might develop for your design challenge.</p>
<p>You can add/view additional references and links relating to scenarios at the bottom of this page but <a href="http://www.bibsonomy.org/tag/oldsmooc-w2" target="_blank">using oldsmooc-w2 on bibSonomy</a> may be easier. If anyone knows how to embed that in cloudworks please do so!</p>
<p>You can ask and answer questions about scenarios in the discussion on this cloud.</p>
<p>You may also add or embed content you think others will find useful.</p>
<p>Add your own scenarios as clouds to the&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2453">Scenario-based Contextual Learning Design</a>&nbsp;cloudscape.</p>
<p>This cloud is used by OLDS MOOC Week 2 Task 2 - <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2453">Scenario-based Contextual Learning Design</a></p>
