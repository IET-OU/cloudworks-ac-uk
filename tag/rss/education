              <description><![CDATA[<p>Careers work is intensely political. It shifts depending on your viewpoint and where you stand. There is the Government who fund work with adults by setting targets for advisers. This in turn incentivises support that leads to returning to work, education or training. There are schools and colleges, some of whom see careers work as a means to reduce the number of students falling NEET (not in education, employment or training) after Years 11, 12 and 13. Finally, we have advisers who look to work through a client centred approach in a non-directive manner. How do we navigate such turbulent waters, where so many different stakeholders have their own valid needs from the work? Is it possible for the 21st Century Careers Management Professional to be everything to everybody?</p>
<p>Firstly, let&rsquo;s look at the assumptions we make when we discuss careers work; we often assume that it is a uniform activity, split into four easily understood parts of Careers Education, Information, Advice and Guidance (CEIAG). Yet this can be misunderstood, depending on who is delivering and what ideological position they subscribe to. I have written previously in the CXK Blog with regards the importance of identifying the position[i] from which we practice as careers professionals and declaring this to the clients we work with, in line with our professional ethics[ii]. However, this assumes the careers work in question is being delivered from a client centred viewpoint. Just because we as Career Management Professionals subscribe to this approach, it does not mean it is the only one.</p>
<p>Careers work can and does exist as a directive approach, where telling a client what to do is seen as a valid approach and strategy. This ideology sits in contrast to that delivered by professionals who are members of the Careers Development Institute (CDI). Unaffiliated advisers &amp; coaches, employers, some teachers and trainers, may deliver CEIAG in this way, inadvertently or deliberately. Messages which we may provide as professionals, working from an ethical base regarding decision making, may come up against individual and culturally significant different approaches. This is nothing new and isn&rsquo;t necessarily wrong, for example Gideon Arulmani reminds us to consider the wider cultural context in which we deliver our work[iii]. Indeed, he asks us to see the idea of a &ldquo;career&rdquo; as a constructed concept; one that not everyone subscribes to in the same way and which may differ from person to person depending on the context or culture in which they have developed their understanding of what a career may be. As a concept, the idea of who can have a career, what sort of career is possible and what it is, has shifted over time. Historically, careers were split into &ldquo;jobs for girls&rdquo; and &ldquo;jobs for boys&rdquo;; something we are now diametrically opposed to as a profession.</p>
<p>We know that &ldquo;having a career&rdquo; is one solution in making sense of and leading a meaningful journey through life. To assume that it is the only way though is once more an assumption we can make in error. Some people approach the world of work as a way to build a career but for others it is just a means to an end; others will seek alternative answers to life through family, travel, religion or even crime. Many careers professionals now see discussions about career as moving beyond the world of work, to encompass discussions about wider choices and how we live our lives in a changing future[iv].</p>
<p>However, this approach to careers work is in stark contrast to the view of &ldquo;career&rdquo; by many (but not all) of the other stakeholders listed previously. What do these differing concepts of career and life mean for us as professionals working with others? It means we must make a decision as professionals, do we impose our view on clients as to how they discuss their career decisions or do we take our lead from them and help them to discuss what is important to them? To assume that all clients are looking for a career, or to persuade them that meaning can only be found through building one, is for us to work within &ldquo;our construct&rdquo; of what a career is and what is important and not theirs.</p>
<p>However, the danger of attempting to work within the client&rsquo;s context alone is that when clients meet with us they sometimes try and tell us things, or behave in ways in which they think we wish to hear or see. Inadvertently, they make the assumptions about what careers work and CEIAG is about. So, what can we do to break this cycle of assumption, to enable us to get to the truth of what our clients are really wanting or seeking, as our belief is to work in a client centred way?</p>
<p>As a starting point, we need to allow them to feel safe and understand that any position in terms of what they want from life is acceptable. We will not judge them or try and persuade or trick them into living alternative lives. We must provide them with a space to show them what is possible, as they may not have an idea of how they wish to live their lives yet and/or, the different life paths which are possible.</p>
<p>In school, this can be delivered through introductory assemblies or small group works as well as careful introductions at the start of one to one guidance sessions. It can also be facilitated through activities which move clients outside of their comfort zone, for example, through the use of verbal or pictorial vignettes taken from their collective to provide, &ldquo;distance from &hellip; personal opinions and hence provide an opportunity to move beyond socially acceptable responses and discussions[v]&rdquo; as explored by Gideon Arulmani in his work. Creating distance from &ldquo;acceptable responses&rdquo; is also utilised as an active principle within Lego Therapy, developed for Careers Work by CXK in 2015 and presented at the National Career Guidance Show as part of a seminar in 2016. Through this careful setting of the context in which we have discussions, we have a much greater chance of building trust and finding out what is really important for our clients.</p>
<p>At times, our wishes to be client centred can be in contrast to the agendas of others who hold a different view on the purpose of &ldquo;careers work&rdquo;. How can we respond? We either shift our ethical and ideological positions, going back on our beliefs that clients have a right to make their own choices without being directed or &ldquo;sold an idea&rdquo;, or stick to our guns. If the former, we lose faith with our profession and if the latter we need to recognise that &ldquo;sticking our heels in&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the only option or way to solve the issue. We can continue to communicate and discuss with other stakeholders why we work the way we do, to help others understand our approaches with the long term hope that positions will change.</p>
<p>However, there are times when this isn&rsquo;t possible, where funding and payments by results is focussed on outcomes or restricted by time. What happens then, in terms of social justice and the right to a non-agenda led space for clients to make decisions? When those who can afford professional careers guidance as a non-agenda led activity is contrasted with those who can only receive guidance restricted in possibility by additional criteria (such as outcomes), or lack of time to deliver an equitable service. As professionals, we find ourselves working in these contexts and challenges, how we handle them is key for ourselves as professionals, our organisations and the clients we support.</p>
<p>For our clients, we must disclose if we are compromised in what we can deliver, whether this is by time or outcomes; our professional ethics say we must be transparent and so we should be so. In the longer term, whether we believe as organisations in fighting for social justice, depends upon our individual viewpoints, priorities and agency. We must decide whether we collectively strive for a longer term access to a more equitable provision for our clients or do we deliver professional guidance services as a product for whom only those who can afford it can access the service unrestricted?</p>
<p>Whichever we decide, we have made a political choice. Whether it is to continue to work within the status-quo or reimagine what is possible and to fight for a more equitable future. Alternatively, do we shift to a middle ground where careers professionals deliver &ldquo;pro-bono&rdquo; careers guidance alongside paid for services? To make no decision and to take no action, is still a decision.</p>
<p>My personal view is to continue to lobby for a Universal Service which is unfettered and uncluttered by the agendas of others so we can, with our clients, explore all of the possibilities life has to offer. Careers Guidance sits as an umbrella covering a wider spectrum than just opportunities related to work. Careers Guidance considers all that is possible when we consider the idea of &ldquo;career&rdquo;; not just as a way to explore work or find work, or as a way to provide greater security for our families, or as a tool for social mobility or materialistic growth, but also as a way to provide growth and meaning through other means, such as volunteering, travel, exploration, our hobbies and wider life choices.</p>
<p>Careers Guidance sits within, and next to, Life Coaches, Counsellors, Social Workers, Job Coaches, Teachers, and Religious Guides. Let&rsquo;s keep it free from artificial constraint. Our role as advisers is to draw upon and then share all the relevant possibilities life has to offer with our clients, according to their needs, and with room for exploration of the implications of each choice, for each individual. It is not just the exploration of those possibilities we may find ourselves funded to target.</p>
<p>We must be vigilant, as our future as a profession is ours to fight for, or to sleep-walk into.</p>

              <title>Curiosity Killed the Cat</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10224</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10224</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Curiosity as the popular saying suggests, can get us into trouble. If we delve too deeply into places we shouldn&rsquo;t then we may find ourselves in serious difficulties, so often as adults we hold back and play it safe. Yet for young people exploring their career ideas, curiosity is crucial. Combine this with their innate feelings of indestructibility (found among many young people) and they can and will get out there and explore. Not only does it help them to form an idea of how the world works and what the world can offer them, but it allows them to work out what they may like to do and not do.</p>
<p>We know from relatively recent reports that if young people have at least four or more encounters with the world of work they are more likely to remain in Education, Employment, or Training (EET)[i]. Yet, this is mirrored with the fact that fewer young people are working in Saturday jobs[ii] alongside their studies, therefore having fewer encounters with work in their formative years. This is one of the reasons why there are so many initiatives encouraging and enabling young people to encounter employers, from the Inspiration Agenda of the National Careers Service through to the Careers Enterprise Company itself.</p>
<p>Yet, encounters with employers on their own does not necessarily enable young people to make sense of the world. This is where clear and independent Careers Guidance is important, as through guidance young people can begin to build a framework of understanding to place their experiences within. Combined with education to build the fundamental core skills for young people to pursue their goals and clear information on the labour market to check the facts and we have a winning formula for success. Each part on its own is not enough, but together, the world can be made sense of and seized by our young people if they are curious and hungry or excited enough.</p>
<p>There is however, another use of curiosity which is vital to the success of our young people. It is that of Professional Curiosity; the ability of professionals to not just take what they see on the surface of the young people or adults they are working with as read. Yet, some professionals forget to be curious or follow their instincts; they may be worried that something is uncovered that they are ill equipped to deal with or haven&rsquo;t got time to deal with in their busy lives of work based targets. Yet, to do so; to ignore our gut feelings, is potentially to do far more harm than good. It is to leave a young person at potential risk or floundering in a world in which they don&rsquo;t know where to turn.</p>
<p>As adults, and especially as professionals, we have access to such wide and vast networks of support that if we do uncover something we can&rsquo;t deal with on our own, we can tap into support to help us with the most appropriate course of action. We can be in danger of forgetting that it is our most vulnerable clients who don&rsquo;t have these networks or resources of support; we are in danger of losing sight that every child matters.</p>
<p>It is down to us as professionals in any given moment, when we pick up on something which doesn&rsquo;t feel right, to pursue it. We have the capacity to ask &ldquo;Why&rdquo; or &ldquo;How?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tell me more&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a discussion, a client may say something innocuous to you which will make you think, &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t seem right, I wonder what happened there&rdquo;. Sometimes, they will say these things as a way of asking for help, when they can&rsquo;t form the words to do so, hoping that a professional will take notice and intervene. Sometimes, they don&rsquo;t know that what they are experiencing can be sorted out, if only we as professionals take the time to be a little more curious and then proactive. Either by resolving whatever we uncover ourselves or referring onto the right charity or professional who can then help. Such curiosity is vital in areas of child protection and safeguarding, but it is also important in helping those who are lost and confused and just need a little help. Whether we are teachers in school discovering that a student hasn&rsquo;t a clue what they are doing after 6th Form, a local authority service tracking school leavers and discovering that a young person needs help working out what is out there, or a support worker on a National Citizenship Programme talking to a young person who is having second thoughts about what they have chosen to do after Year 11. All of these examples would benefit from a referral to a Careers Guidance Adviser. Yet, imagine if these professionals hadn&rsquo;t been curious and gotten help for the young people they encountered&hellip; a 6th Former falling into doing nothing after results day, a young person already NEET remaining so and possibly falling into depression at home and a Year 11 dropping out of education in September.</p>
<p>Now, imagine if the reason each of these young people were lost or confused was because of something far more than confusion&hellip; abuse at home, neglect or worse.</p>
<p>The consequences of not being curious, of not asking &ldquo;are you ok?&rdquo; could not only be disastrous, they could be fatal. We each have a professional duty to be curious and ask the &ldquo;what, why and how&rdquo; questions if we see that something isn&rsquo;t right. With fewer professionals working with young people than in previous years, there is a far greater responsibility on those of us who do work in the sector to take notice and take action if we see something which isn&rsquo;t right or when we sense something is wrong.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was providing careers guidance at an options evening in one of my schools, and had a queue of students and parents who were looking for support. It was a great evening, with many different conversations. What struck me was the wonderful variety of aspirations, dreams and ideas; all of these fantastic young minds searching for direction and clarity (ways to move forwards). Reaching the end of their studies in Year 11, each individual is on the edge of moving from the compulsory to optional, making (for some) their first big decision in life.</p>
<p>It is as this point that it can be easy to forget that they don&rsquo;t have the benefit of hindsight or experience to help explain their decisions. In many ways they haven&rsquo;t had the chance to learn from their mistakes and are in that really exciting time of deciding what they wish to try first, which may be the right step or might not; this is something that only time will tell. None of us can know with one hundred percent accuracy which step is the right one for them, or even us. Yet, through experience we gain career management skills and learn what works for us and what is important to us.</p>
<p>Many of us also learn that what works for one person, doesn&rsquo;t for another, with each of us having different priorities. For example, I always knew that I wanted to help people or try and make a difference in the world; as well as enjoy the work I do. My wife, however, is far more pragmatic and sees work as the means to an end, to support her hobbies such as kite surfing. For our young people in Year 11, they are tentatively figuring out what is important to them; often from a view of the world which has been quite sheltered or mediated.</p>
<p>It can be easy for those of us who are slightly longer in the tooth to dismiss their quandaries and indecisions as painless or straight forward. We must remember what it was like for us and our friends at that age, the mixture of feeling indestructible and knowing that anything was possible, whilst thinking we knew how the world worked (when in reality we were quite naive). At the same time I can recall that some people in my peer group were feeling fearless and others fearful (depending on the individual). I remember the dreamers, a few pragmatists, the arrogant alpha males and those who were happy being quieter, the organised who had it all planned out, contrasting with those who were just happy to leap and trust in luck or faith, as well as those who were rebellious. It was a very emotive time and continues to be for our students to this day.</p>
<p>As the years pass and we stay working longer in the sector, it becomes vital for those of us in education and community support to guard against becoming flippant or disinterested in the plight, feelings and paths of our clients, whether adults or young people. What really matters is making sure we are tuning into their perspective on reality/life and how they feel about where they are heading and the choices they are making. For one person that which can easily be overcome, can be a mountain to another. Just because we see a situation as &ldquo;easy&rdquo; to resolve, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that for them it is. It is crucial that we hold this understanding and be there with them, whilst they work through their dilemmas; to try and &ldquo;fix them&rdquo; or the situation doesn&rsquo;t do them any favours, as they are then unable to learn and develop their own career management skills through experience.</p>
<p>For example, one of my students this year has dropped in to see me three to four times, as they explore different factors in their decision making process, because this is what they need. To rush them isn&rsquo;t to help them, but to hinder their reflection and explorations. Another client in a similar situation has been quite happy in making a similar decision very quickly, with very little intervention. It is for these varying situations that we need to provide not only suitable levels of access to careers guidance within the settings we work, but also individual choice, so the client who needs several sessions can access this, and the student who may need only one isn&rsquo;t forced into more or made to feel they ought to have more. When we look at how we inspire, support and work with our clients, how we set up our services (within the various commercial constraints), it is vital to consider how we get this balance right.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t just stick to the same model for years because it is what we have always done. We should reflect, gain feedback from all our stakeholders (parents, teachers, clients and employers), and use this to review and develop our services, to ensure our clients are getting the best possible service they can. Thereby, we will be providing them with the space and support to explore, research, reflect and grow through their own decision making skills.</p>

              <title>MON: Tacaí - Supporting the Understanding of Mathematical Concepts in Further Education in Ireland (Paul Curran)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10194</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10194</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Taca&iacute;&rdquo; is an online, free-to-use learning support tool, aimed at being used within the Irish Further Education sector. It supports the learning of mathematical concepts commonly encountered at QQI Level 4 in the Irish system, specifically those required in Functional Mathematics 4N2138. The support itself will be offered online and open to all, at least in its initial stage as currently envisaged. The word &ldquo;Taca&iacute;ocht&rdquo; is of the Irish language (or Gaeilge), which roughly translates into English as &ldquo;support&rdquo; and can be understood in a literal physical way but also in the context of moral support and encouragement. "Taca&iacute;" means supporter in the same sense. The approach to learning taken by the project is one of scaffolding learning which is a metaphor referring to a structure offering physical support that is removed when it is no longer needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mathematical ability and numeracy has long been linked to employment prospects as evidenced by the National Adult Literacy Agency (2014), the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) report (2012), the School Completion Programme and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Hughes and Schwab (2010) describe literacy as a situated social practice. By this they mean that literacy is more than just a set of discrete skills. Numeracy is rightly considered a form of literacy by Hughes and Schwab and by NALA (2014). It is in this context that this project approaches mathematical skills. An activity system in the style of Vygotsky gives recognition to a number of factors, including mediating artefacts or tools. This is the role Taca&iacute; envisages for itself: as a tool that supports learners who are also supported in other ways including interacting with a community of learners. It forms an artefact around which interactions can occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a mediating artefact Taca&iacute; will draw upon the theory, much cited in the context of reading and writing literacy, of scaffolding. This is the idea that during the learning process the teacher or a facilitator offers a variety of supporting mechanisms to assist the learner to grasp a concept. As Taca&iacute; is a support to mathematical learning it will take the form of hints, suggested strategies and useful metaphors towards the aim of understanding mathematical concepts and procedures. &nbsp;Central to the approach taken by Taca&iacute; is the strategy of progressing from concrete materials to abstract concepts. Thompson (1994) describes how the effective use of concrete materials can help avoid misunderstandings. Lee and Tan (2012) discuss the effectiveness of a concrete-pictorial-abstract (C-P-A) progression. They develop a role for virtual manipulatives within this progression and outline a C-V &amp; V-P-A alternative. The use of virtual manipulatives is a tool that Taca&iacute; will employ to allow learners to explore concepts and relationships between concepts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work of Richardson et al. (2014) on colour and contrast in e-learning and instructional design and the work by Murch (1987) on readability have been used to design the tool with accessibility, split-attention issues and cognitive load in mind. Development is on-going.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Since 1974, disabled students in England have been able to apply for non-repayable grants, known as &lsquo;Disabled Students&rsquo; Allowances (DSAs)&rsquo;, to assist with the additional costs incurred whilst completing higher education study (Willetts, 2014). Such grants provided allowances for specialised equipment, non-medical assistance such as note takers and specialised tutors, books and consumables, as well as travel allowances (Disability Rights UK, 2015). In addition to the support provided by DSAs, the introduction of the Equality Act 2010 placed a legal duty on businesses and education providers to take positive steps, referred to as &lsquo;reasonable adjustments&rsquo;, to remove barriers faced by people, due to their disability (Citizens Advice, n.d.). This includes making changes to the ways things are done e.g. provision, criterion or practice; physical features of buildings such as entrances and exits; as well as the provision of extra aids or services such as: induction hearing loops, providing information in alternative formats etc. (Citizens Advice, n.d.).</p>
<p>Despite the reasonable adjustments implemented by higher education institutions (HEIs), the costs of the DSA provision have risen sharply from &pound;101.3m in 2009-10 to &pound;145.8m in 2012-13, an increase of 44% (Weale, 2015). In 2014, the Minister for Universities and Science announced a series of changes to modernise the existing system to &lsquo;rebalance&rsquo; responsibilities for student support. Thus, ensuring that the limited public funding is available to those most in need, and provides the support they require (Willetts, 2014). The changes are designed to move away from a system of individualised support funded by DSAs, to one where HEIs play a greater role in supporting all students, regardless of whether they have a disability or not.</p>
<p>With these changes coming into force from September 2016, HEIs within England have been required to review and, if required, revise their current student support arrangements to ensure they are prepared for these changes and can support learners effectively (McNaught, 2016). Whilst there are many small and simple changes academic staff can take to improve the accessibility of their teaching such as: providing information ahead of sessions, creating learning materials which meet accessibility guidelines and encouraging students to record teaching sessions etc. (Canterbury Christ Church University, n.d.), this does not resolve the underlying issues. As McNaught (2016) summarises &lsquo;[t]eaching and learning pedagogies, practices and technologies can inadvertently create barriers for students with disabilities&rsquo;, to overcome these a different approach is required.</p>
<p>To address some of the challenges raised by these recent changes and the need for HEIs to make anticipatory, rather than reactive changes, this conference presentation will provide an overview and demonstration of a short online course being developed by the author. Built using the Canvas open education platform, this short course aimed at academics working within UK HEIs, will provide a more in-depth overview of the changes to disabled student support, whilst also introducing delegates to two educational frameworks; Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Inclusive Curriculum. Building on research undertaken by Marquis et al. (2016), this course will utilise a flipped learning pedagogy; whereby the learning materials are placed online and classroom sessions are used to enable deeper exploration and discussion of the topics raised (The Higher Education Academy, n.d.).

              <title>Lessons From Adult Careers Guidance</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10136</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10136</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>As a careers adviser with CXK I am mainly deployed within the Schools Team, delivering careers guidance and education activities across a range of different types of schools in Kent. However, over the summer I was privileged to spend some time with the National Careers Service Community Team delivering services to adults within Job Centre Plus offices. I say privileged for two reasons, firstly whenever we are working with clients, regardless of age, it is a privilege to be part of their lives even for a short time (as a source of support and assistance). Secondly, to work with and learn from highly experienced careers advisers, who work in a different part of the sector, is an opportunity to learn new skills and push our own boundaries.</p>
<p>From this work I picked up some further lessons for careers practice in schools and colleges. These focused on:</p>
<p>Transition and change<br />Recognising the value of skills<br />Networking for survival and success<br />Transition and change</p>
<p>Some of the adult clients I encountered found it hard to cope with transition and change in their lives. In school we discuss this with students in terms of &ldquo;careers theory&rdquo; and &ldquo;developmental processes&rdquo; or even considering that many of us will now hold ten or possibly more different jobs or roles in our lifetimes; moving through a constant cycle of change. Yet, the reality of this can have a huge impact. Changing directions, careers or roles through unexpected events can be unsettling for many due to the threat involved. I returned from my work with adults (many of whom had faced redundancy) to GCSE and A-Level results days in school. I found many students, whose plans had changed unexpectedly, having to find mechanisms to cope in the same way the adults I had been working with were also trying to do. This raised the reality (in my mind) of change in our own lives; many of us may not feel as safe or secure as we hope to be.</p>
<p>It also highlighted to me the need for access to good careers guidance for all. Guidance supports strategies with how to cope with change as well as access to accurate information; whether this is in the context of what makes a strong and serviceable CV to look for work or what the options are on results days when things don&rsquo;t quite go to plan; guidance is crucial. It also made me realise the importance of exploring with our students how they are going to transition, from school to a new setting or even to a Post 16 offer in their own schools. Some students have fabulous support mechanisms at home and others have none or struggle with change in their lives. It is in particular, for these latter students that we must go the extra mile (often as multi-disciplinary teams), to ensure they do not get lost in transition.</p>
<p>Recognising the value of skills</p>
<p>As a professional who understands quite clearly the practical value of transferable skills, it was mind blowing for me to see this being explored in practice with adults. I was able to witness some amazing transformations as the clients the team worked with were able to understand their own value, thanks to the advisers who helped them to define, through reflection and exploration, the skills they had and where they could put these to use in the labour market. Education we know is crucial but what we as educationalists need to also shout loudly about are transferable skills; not only the range which is out there but, also where they fit within the labour market. We should also go further; we need to help clients understand what the skills are which they are gaining through education as well as their interests and how they can boost and enhance their skills as they progress. This means breaking the cycle of students gaining merits and grades for their own sakes and helping students understand the actual skills they have and how they can evidence these to prospective employers. I heard stories of graduates who just didn&rsquo;t know the value of their Degrees and were facing unemployment because they didn&rsquo;t know how to show their own value to employers. This was echoed time and time again, where adults from various sectors and roles couldn&rsquo;t see what they had to offer. Guidance unlocks this potential in our adult clients, as well as students in school, when we give this process time coupled with strong careers education programmes.</p>
<p>Networking for survival and success</p>
<p>This was an interesting lesson and one I have begun to see replicated in schools. Building a network of contacts for the future is one way in which we can future proof ourselves against unexpected change. Adults who have robust networks of contacts have a greater chance of accessing the hidden job market if made redundant or seeking a career change; such networks can be virtual, through business or social contacts. Within these networks, individuals have a greater chance of being referred into a job vacancy and/or having a wide range of references to tap into if needed. For our students, lessons with regards how to network and maintain networks can be crucial in helping them to develop skills in this area, along with the standard careers education packages regarding safe use of social media and clean email addresses.</p>
<p>We need to ensure these ideas are pulled into our programmes. Students need help coping with transition, indeed sometimes their parents and carers need help as well; let&rsquo;s be there for them. With skills, we need to ensure that the value of what we teach is set out loud and clear beyond the grades they each achieve; students must come away from their studies knowing what they have to offer the world. Lastly, let&rsquo;s not assume they know how to network but prepare them for this through employer talks, in-depth guidance provision and robust careers education programmes. Each of these three key lessons I learnt through my summer with my colleagues in the National Careers Community Team. These lessons can be bought back to our work in schools with students at the start of their career journeys. Let&rsquo;s provide them with the best start we can so they can cope better with change in the future.</p>

              <title>Why do we need Career Advisers?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10132</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10132</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Came the cry of an individual with a vested interest in these websites. It could be argued I have a vested interest in the counter argument, as it is my job. However, let&rsquo;s have a look at the evidence.</p>
<p>We have hundreds and possibly thousands of different careers websites at our disposal, from those that offer matching services to those which are information led. We even have area prospectus sites, providing us with details about courses on offer. So why was it that yesterday I sat with a client trying to make sense of careers information, his head in his hands? He was bright and capable but could find no sense in what he was looking at.</p>
<p>A week before I had sat with several Year 11 students as they made some late applications and heard them echo what their more organised and career ready counterparts had said earlier in the year. &ldquo;What courses do I need?&rdquo; and &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find them!&rdquo; were some of the comments I heard as they flitted through and around the area prospectus. This was echoed by the teacher nearby who remarked that she didn&rsquo;t know enough to make sense of the information on the website either. She felt that she didn&rsquo;t know enough about where the courses led, nor how careers develop, and how the students and their ideas will flux and change as they discover more. This teacher admitted to being frustrated at times that the ideas of the students won&rsquo;t stay neatly fixed, although I know she recognises that this is half the fun and joy of education. Students will develop their ideas messily and need access to more than one opportunity to discuss how their ideas are evolving and to receive help to make sense of the plethora of information available.</p>
<p>Now these are generally good websites, well designed and full of great information. Yet they cannot help students extract meaning from the information presented. These websites put us in danger of drowning our students in options until they can no longer move and they are stuck by the weight of choice, in much the same way we are stuck when offered too much choice whilst shopping at the weekend in the supermarket.</p>
<p>So why do they need us?</p>
<p>We help clients find what is meaningful for them out of all the choices, narratives, opinions; from the various data sets which have the depth to be factual and useful, to those stats masquerading as facts but really marketing and those openly out there as marketing. We help them sift and sort, analyse the information and their own feelings and thoughts. It can look and feel a bit like chaos, which it is at times. We help clients find order in the mess, even if it is helping them to recognise that there are no certainties, nor guarantees but, that there is a path that may give them the chance to achieve their dreams and aspirations.</p>
<p>It is for the same reason that we need teachers and not just a YouTube video or webinar for individuals to learn. Whether through face to face contact, in groups or alone, telephone or webchat, individuals reach out for help; they cannot rely on information alone. It is possibly why the Open University provides access to tutors and why University courses don&rsquo;t rely on lectures alone but have seminars as well. If we are to learn, to grow and understand we need the space within which to do this; whether virtual or real, everyone needs a guide they can trust. For our students the best learning is often when they can discuss what they have learnt, to embed learning or check facts and implications. Arguably, different environments suit different people so if we are to meet the needs of as many individuals as possible, we need as diverse a range of environments as possible; we must remember this in our careers work.</p>
<p>As an example, in many of the schools I work in, I provide access to group guidance, email guidance, one to one guidance, guidance in pairs and guidance at lunchtimes, before school and after school, sessions with parents or carers and sessions without. Different students thrive in different contexts, some get a lot from being in a small group and hearing what others are doing; social influence has a huge impact here. Some come and &ldquo;check in&rdquo; with me for weeks on end, at my lunchtime drop-ins, taking their career learning in bite sized chunks and steps. Some prefer Mum or Dad to be there. One client did better with their older brother at the session.</p>
<p>So, why do you need us?</p>
<p>We unlock the magic from the myth and clear the pathways ahead from the weeds and distractions. We add signposts, we find detours which work and understand that the first step on the path is one of many. We understand that a discussion with a guide is just a catalyst for change and not a route they must follow blindly. Paths may change a hundred times or none but, whatever happens we are there to be a guiding light, empathise and make sense of the mass of information with kindness and a non-judgemental, positive regard.</p>
<p>It is all of this that websites can&rsquo;t do and it is why schools can&rsquo;t meet the Ofsted criteria for Careers Guidance through access to websites alone.</p>

              <title>Options for Life, Not Just for a Living</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10131</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10131</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>As students go about choosing their options at key decision points, whether in Years 8, 9, 11 or 12 and 13, we often help them make these choices based on the jobs they are thinking of doing in the future, helping them build skills for work and not play. Yet, is this the only way to make these choices? Systems Theory teaches us that there are many factors affecting our lives and decision making, from informal social settings and family through to institutional influences. When working with clients we are in danger of assuming they wish to make their decisions based on the world of work alone and not based on or combined with, other ideas, values or factors.</p>
<p>It is important that we don&rsquo;t force them to make option choices through a default process which focuses on just work, but check in with them to find out what else is important to them as they make their decisions. When we ask them questions to help them consider the impact of their educational choices based just on the world of work, we do so through the lens of a very particular set of values and agenda which we have bought to the process. How often do we speak to students who wish to pursue education for the love of education? How often do we show or explain to them this choice? We often collude with the idea of choices having to be inexplicably linked to work and therefore defining career as only focusing on work, when career can be considered in a much broader context than this, relating to how we choose to live our lives as well as earn money for living.</p>
<p>As client centred practitioners I wonder how often do we provide scope for this wider narrative or do we move straight in to discussing option choices along narrower, preconceived notions of career and unconscious bias? It is why as Career Management professionals we must be clear with ourselves and our clients what our agendas are when we begin to ask questions. Are we helping them choose options for work alone and/or options for life? As discussed in previous blogs, we are independent from external institutional influences but, not from our own agendas, no matter how benign.</p>
<p>For example, in Years 8 or 9 when choosing GCSE options, the Government focus has been on education as preparation for the world of work which understandably is a big concern for many individuals. Being able to earn a living means being able to put food on the table and live. Yet, philosophy and theories of education show us that schooling is just as much about developing well rounded individuals who can make a positive contribution to society. It is also about learning where we come from and our place in historical, sociological and geographical contexts; about morality, ethics and understanding life itself. When choosing options, the choices we make may help us learn more about ourselves as individuals and the part we wish to play in life, as well as society. These reasons for choosing options shouldn&rsquo;t be discouraged, omitted, left unexplored or play second fiddle to choosing options based on skills for work alone.</p>
<p>Career thinking is much broader than this and option choices are not only for getting into work but also to help us grow as individuals. Consider the student who takes Sport not to gain a career in the area, but to belong to a team and develop the self-esteem which is gained via healthy competition. A student who takes Performing Arts because of their love of the stage, resulting in greater confidence. How about the student taking Food Technology, gaining the skills needed to live independently at University or when they move out of home once working? All of the above options can be taken to gain access to work in these sectors, but each can also be taken alongside other options, to support life and living. Option choices need not only be for work but can be considered part of a wider skills set, taken for enjoyment, interest or self-development.</p>

              <title>Future Shock: Imperfect Science</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Making predictions for the future based on Labour Market Information (LMI) which is robust and trustworthy lets us assume that this will lead to a greater chance of individuals finding work, however it is not fool proof. Through some commercial data sets (available at a cost), we have the ability to predict to a certain extent what work will be needed where and how many employees we may need in a given sector. This is not the same as guaranteeing an individual work, but it is a much more accurate guide than some of the data in the public domain which is currently available for free. Trying to make decisions on the likelihood of where the work will be using these free data sets is a struggle, as the sets are often only providing a partial view of the labour market. The students often need help turning the jumble of information into intelligence, which is where career guidance professionals can add real value. To have complete data sets which have real detail and are freely available to students remains an ideal to strive and aim for.</p>
<p>Even though such data sets aren&rsquo;t yet in the hands of those planning their careers, we can still hope.</p>
<p>Imagine a world where we did have this data. It is almost enough to see such a situation as a utopia or near perfect environment for ensuring everyone could find work and make an informed choice. Yet there is a small catch, and that is the human element, which remains unpredictable and often on the surface, illogical.</p>
<p>Consider a future where everyone has similar skills when they leave school.</p>
<p>We could say this is due to changes in an education system which pushes schools into focusing on the core subjects and reduces their ability to offer the rest of the subjects (to ensure they meet their targets on success and progress). We could say it is because these skills have been focussed on by students consulting the LMI data which, tells them these will be &ldquo;skills in-demand&rdquo;.<br />Now, imagine if all the students were using the same data sets to make their decisions.</p>
<p>All of the students can see shortages in the same areas, so they all take the same subject or suite of subjects to ensure greater chances of work. It could be that someone has told them that studying these subjects to a higher level will increase their chances of earning more money.<br />This leads to consequences.</p>
<p>A few of the individuals will be able to do jobs which the others can&rsquo;t, as these jobs require advanced skills, such as the medical professions. These few individuals find work, leaving the other students the remainder of the vacancies. <br />After their studies, the amount of students who are of average ability, finishing their studies and aiming for the particular option or pathway identified by the data, become huge in number (as they have all been told that this is where the work will be). Perhaps, in such a scenario, we suddenly have more potential employees than there are vacancies for work.<br />Some of the students see this coming and realise that they aren&rsquo;t as unique as they thought.</p>
<p>Only those who did more extracurricular activities than the others, to make themselves no longer average, stand out and find work.<br />Other students who have studied for these opportunities (who don&rsquo;t stand out), find themselves jobless or in work where very little training is required; they are shocked and disenfranchised from education. How did they end up in low paid or zero hour work?<br />They are stuck unless the system they are in changes and offers them a chance to retrain and live whilst doing so.<br />Hmmm, there seems to be a problem if everyone uses the same data and makes decisions the same way. Identifying the same jobs or type of jobs to go for. Let us imagine a second scenario&hellip;</p>
<p>In contrast, imagine the student who is just as average in ability; they see an area where there is predicted to be very little work but still some work requiring some skill; for example as a Farrier (which is seen as a declining occupation). No one else hones or develops their skills in this area (everyone else has gone for the popular opportunity due to the data).<br />When this student finishes their studies or training, they look for work and find work, as there is no competition for the lone job vacancy which arises (no one else has the skills). It is this student who finds gainful and fulfilling employment and not the others.<br />As we can see data and logic could lead to problems in scenario one, especially if everyone makes the same decisions, using the same steps. Some of you may be thinking that generally we don&rsquo;t all make the same decisions in the same way. However, when we take a step back and look at the system from a distant perspective. We see many students going to college or university, having made very similar decisions about how to advance their careers. It is because their values, influences and expectations are all very similar. This relates to a career concept called community interaction theory which, looks at how groups of people develop their career ideas.</p>
<p>Some may argue that the first scenario we explored is more fact than fiction when, according to the relatively recent skills survey we have potentially more graduates than graduate jobs available in the UK.</p>
<p>When students make decisions based on ideas which float like memes around schools such as, &ldquo;go to university to get a good job&rdquo; these narratives end up forming the basis for a shared logic which everyone pursues blindly. In the future, we may find ourselves applying this same blind logic to the bigger and better data as it becomes more and more accessible.</p>
<p>If the above shows us that making decisions based on data and logic isn&rsquo;t enough, nor is following the herd, how can students make smart decisions in such a topsy-turvy world?</p>
<p>Perhaps it is by surrendering to chaos and relinquishing the desire to control the future, allowing chance to play its card. It can also be by keeping their choices open and remaining adaptable or, resilient as many have come to remark. Our second scenario also shows us that, there is a benefit in keeping their skills wide by also developing their unique skills and interests, in doing so they may shine brighter than others and be able to do what others can&rsquo;t. Ultimately, each individual must decide which careers strategy works for them, whether the tried and tested or one which stands seemingly against the odds.</p>
<p>We can give them a path to aim for, but remind them they will be running a race against everyone else taking that same path and that it will be competitive. Interestingly, what our LMI doesn&rsquo;t currently show us in any depth, is not only how many vacancies there are in any given year but, how many people on average are actively competing for those vacancies in each pathway and their locations (whether Apprenticeship, School Leaver or Graduate Scheme); I would be keen to see what this data might look like and use this with students (to help them be more informed).</p>
<p>We should also be mindful that the competition for places isn&rsquo;t just against those that graduate with them in the same year, but those that also graduated before who haven&rsquo;t found a job yet. Whether we are talking about students from plumbing courses at college looking for an apprenticeship to become fully qualified, or graduates from university looking for a graduate placement &ndash; the pressures are the same.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s help our clients hone their skills, whether they are &ldquo;in demand skills&rdquo; or &ldquo;unique skills&rdquo; or both, as well as coach them to be resilient, adaptable and ready for anything.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>There are many different types of guides in this world, and each arrives with their own agenda, whether benign or otherwise. Many people are able to provide their own take on what they believe careers guidance to be.</p>
<p>Consider the teacher offering guidance underpinned by the belief that education provides the best life chances for students; for it to be a transformative activity for all. Alternatively, we can consider the successful business manager who rose to the top via a university pathway and their views that to be successful, a Higher Education pathway is the way to go and a maths degree is the only way to get ahead in business. Consider the successful entrepreneur who has built their own company; their advice is to work your way up from school&hellip; don&rsquo;t get &ldquo;caught by the debt from University&rdquo; they cry! Other guides include our religious leaders who offer insights into the values which should be applied in our careers. Some religious leaders say to be good, be kind, be honest and hardworking whilst others encourage shunning material goods and living for love alone&hellip; this is your path to success! Our different political leaders offer guidance on which subjects should be taken in school and which can lead to a &ldquo;successful future&rdquo; (see some of our earlier blog posts on this). They have the added authority to impose their views through legislation. All of these guides differ and have their own views and opinions on how to be successful, yet each is happy to share them.</p>
<p>I freely admit these are clich&eacute;s and not all of the above are as described. For example, we know not all teachers see formal education as the only path to success. However, a good friend of mine once said &ldquo;stereotypes are based on fact&rdquo; and so in turn, there is a grain of truth to some of the above examples. We do meet people with these views, offering such careers guidance to students on a regular basis, often with the best of intentions.</p>
<p>Yet, when these best of intentions are given free rein, without consideration of who might pick up on them, problems can arise. I recall in one school how a visiting employer described their own career journey, being very dismissive of other routes. Several of the students came to see me afterwards quite devastated, as they were worried that the options they wanted to take wouldn&rsquo;t get them to their desired destination after all. If they had all been of a similar temperament to the employer, and suited to the academic route presented, we probably wouldn&rsquo;t have had any concerns. Employers can be a great source of inspiration, but to be the sole voice is dangerous, as other pathways then become closed off or shut down.</p>
<p>We would be churlish to say that any particular form of guidance is superior to another or that any type should automatically be dismissed. People do succeed with different forms of support. However, it is providing access to these differing forms that is crucial to those we support. Let&rsquo;s have the employers in, the business mentors, the apprenticeship providers, the universities, but let&rsquo;s also provide access to the sort of guidance which doesn&rsquo;t judge, doesn&rsquo;t tell our students there is only one way to success, when evidence shows us there are hundreds (if not more). Let&rsquo;s provide access to the type of guidance where there are no hidden agendas leading the questions, such as retention of students or targets. In this unique form of guidance, the only agenda is that of helping young people explore their ideas so they don&rsquo;t miss any opportunities. With this guidance they are empowered to make their own informed decisions.</p>
<p>This form of guidance is Careers Guidance, offered by the many trained and dedicated independent Career Management Professionals across the country. These professionals can see the bigger picture and a thousand strands, routes and possibilities but, they don&rsquo;t overload students with this information. Instead they work with them gently, knowing when less is more and when they need to give them time and space to reflect. They know when to encourage and when to ask a particular question. They stand as professionals, quietly, competently; the catalyst for change, not directive instructors telling their clients what to do but, as guides along the way. Not there for their own journeys but for the students that walk in their doors, whether offices, hallways, schools, colleges, prisons, community hubs and youth centres. There is no one else quite like them, they are unique and we take off our hats to them!</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes we have to imagine something before we can pursue it, even if it is unrealistic or a complete fantasy. At times the pursuit of the fantastical isn&rsquo;t always as dangerous as it seems, because during the journey to get there, we often discover something we would never have imagined (and sometimes it is better than the initial fantasy we set out with).</p>
<p>Careers work is constantly at odds with itself, as it balances our ability to dream with logic based reality checks. We access labour market data to help clients make an informed choice or use league tables of universities to help prospective students access a course which will increase the odds of them getting onto their chosen career. Yet without the dream or sense of direction, even if it is just the desire to study a certain course at university or to do something practical, the pragmatic tools become meaningless.</p>
<p>Careers work can help inspire clients and show them what might be possible by introducing them to opportunities, careers and ideas which they may never have heard of. It can also help them to consider philosophies or viewpoints that may never have occurred to them, such as the changing rate of the job market and emerging careers. Many of our students will dream an initial dream and change their mind a dozen times, as their ideas flux with research and reflection or, as they get older the practical reality of competition for jobs or location of work, affects their journeys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any of us working in the area of careers have to tread carefully on the hopes and dreams of others and seek to find a balance between pragmatism and hope, through reflecting on the interactions we have. Each of us ask ourselves, do we stay at the logic based end of the spectrum, analysing every hope and dream for the odds of a realistic outcome or, do we remain at the end of the spectrum which supports hopes and dreams, no matter how fantastical? I think both extremes are dangerous and harmful as they are in danger of reflecting the value base and agenda of the adviser who is helping the client to explore, rather than the needs of the client. In contrast, the middle ground is often the most grounding for clients and advisers.</p>
<p>If we were to have a client, for example, who desired to be a Veterinarian but hated Science or was of middling to low ability, we would challenge the reality of this happening, as there is (unless the student took a huge cognitive leap forward) very little chance of this student becoming a Vet. Yet it is in the challenging of this fantasy that, a skilful and professionally trained adviser can unlock hope and possibility. A blunt way to face this difficult dashing of dreams would be to tell the student it will never happen. In contrast, one technique I have seen colleagues use is to set the scene first by exploring related careers to the dream, from across the spectrum of the related job family; from animal care through to zoology (this can easily be done with a diagram drawn on a piece of paper). An adviser can through this approach, look at what is involved in each job and which ones appeal for the client, before addressing skills and entry requirements needed.&nbsp; In many cases the client is caught (before they fall) by the related occupations they like, so when they realise for themselves that they are unlikely to achieve what they first thought they have a safety net for their aspirations.</p>
<p>Instead of being left broken and in some cases no longer motivated to study, they are then revitalised for a new journey as they set their sights on a new horizon. It is this careful and mindful managing of hopes, dreams and feelings which sets qualified advisers apart from their unqualified counterparts. It is also how professional guidance can be used as a catalyst for change and focus within the life journey of our clients. A colleague of mine once told me that life is as much about the journey as the destination.&nbsp;</p>

              <title>making the most of life&#39;s design</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>The idea of life design sets out an agenda for enabling people to become agents of career success in an increasingly career-challenging world (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000187910900058X">Mark Savickas et al, 2009</a>).&nbsp; It's a vigorously ambitious project, based in America.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was there at the time, and I can remember how brit careers work was slower off the mark than the Americans.&nbsp; In the early days we needed to import American ideas. &nbsp;But they never fully took hold of brit experience.&nbsp; We needed to think for ourselves - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUW8V7Jupns&feature=youtu.be">and we did</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But reading about life design has given me a dose of d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu - it's an idea well worth importing.&nbsp; Life design engages psychological constructs to catalyse career-development in response to a changing world.&nbsp; It's good stuff.&nbsp; And, with some European help, it can be better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm talking about unrealised potential.&nbsp; The realisation agenda is set out here in a five-stages..&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by re-constructing life-design possibilities</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by recognising significant influences</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by re-examining dynamic experience</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by resolving demanding issues</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by narrating meaningful action</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li></li>
<li><strong>1. possibilities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Life design is an ambitious programme, and that willingness to take things on can connect to a wider agenda for action. &nbsp;The life-design conversation is with a free-standing individual - it's a person-to-person technique.&nbsp; That person is then understood as revealing some inner and recurring ways of seeing this - psychological constructs.&nbsp; That's good, but there are other ways of talking about how to get on with a career.&nbsp; They crop up a lot on this side of the pond. &nbsp;And they're at least as likely to talk about neighbourhoods and their goings-on as they are about inner life.&nbsp; Life design can be talked up to take on more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a particularly influential European voice on this (<a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674510418">Pierre Bourdieu,1991</a>).&nbsp; His ethnographies set out social and cultural experience.&nbsp; They illuminate how individuals and communities attribute meaning in experience.&nbsp; Life design is in a good position to take on this wider range of social sciences - and the social constructs that they develop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2. influences</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together talk of psychological and social constructs build broad-based foundations.&nbsp; They lift the social sciences to where they can glimpse other platforms for understanding career. &nbsp;The humanities have their own voices on drama, literature, society, culture and geography.&nbsp; All speak of career.&nbsp; History is on that list. &nbsp;And a richly-informed and arresting example of its thinking (<a href="http://www.academia.edu/15623012/Timothy_Snyder._Black_Earth._The_Holocaust_as_History_and_Warning_London_The_Bodley_Head_2015_forthcoming">Timothy Snyder, 2015</a>) probes the damage that mismanaged change can cause.&nbsp; It shows how political and professional stances are claimed by agencies and accepted by onlookers.&nbsp; It is an extreme example of how reactions to change can formally reframe culture, politics and professionalism.&nbsp; And that reframing reshapes informal social behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The humanities can expose what the social sciences miss.&nbsp; And so, while experience may find what is felt to be a problem, and the social sciences may welcome it as an opportunity, it can take history to expose it as a conflict of interests.&nbsp; It is talk of careers as politics, raising questions about who gets to do what, who is favoured and who is marginalised.&nbsp; No learning programme lives in a political vacuum.&nbsp; And history speaks of how those influences play out.&nbsp; Such talk is necessary for establishing the credibility of life-design processes.&nbsp; The programme will be strengthened by being able to identify the political and constituency interests that it reflects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3. dynamics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Any construction of life design as a response to change needs an understanding of what is changing, and how, and why.&nbsp; It's a long story: as a species we have learned to deal with change associated with migration, and then settlement, and then communication, and then invention.&nbsp; It is change after change.&nbsp; But twenty-first century dynamics are different because all of these changes are invading our lives simultaneously.&nbsp; The emergence of the trends, the crises and the reforms overlay each other.&nbsp; This is change upon change.</p>
<p>Its causes are in the leverage of commercial practice, in the proliferation of digital technologies, and in the diversification of cultures.&nbsp; Its consequences are new ways of finding things out, of settling on what to do about them, and of linking to the people who will share them. &nbsp;The dynamics are fired up both on- and off-line (<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/NICECHit&Myth.pdf">Bill Law, 2012a</a>). &nbsp;And those dynamics are constantly shaping and re-shaping careers. &nbsp;Navigating that turmoil calls for a stage-by-stage process of learning and re-learning.&nbsp; It needs to be portable - transferable from one thing to another.&nbsp; That learning enables students to take charge of their careers - they define the agenda. &nbsp;So this is more about student self-propulsion, and less about expert recommendations.&nbsp; It is called 'career management' rather than 'career development'. &nbsp;These are expansive dynamics, and they belong to a root-and-branch expansion of the life-design programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4. issues</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Talk of career management, where students define an agenda, raises issues for how far-ranging that agenda can be.&nbsp; As it stands the life-design process introduces a client to a career counsellor, opening a question-and-answer process.&nbsp; Clients are free to talk about whatever surprises them, what troubles them, what excites them, what is important to them and why.&nbsp; The conversation is then about how those thoughts-and-feelings figure in career management. &nbsp;It's a process of recalling experience, revisiting memories and finding patterns which suggest priorities. &nbsp;There need be no limit to where that conversation can go - that is life-design's strength.&nbsp; But there is an issue for career counsellors who don't want career-development expertise to be diluted by career-management autonomy. &nbsp;Expert exclusivity curtails, student inclusivity expands (<a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461494591">Bill Law, 2014</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>That expansion needs greater place-and-space than face-to-face work can find.&nbsp; The reality is that life design is set in an hinterland occupied by social attachments, political-and-commercial manoeuvring, and accelerating change-upon-change. &nbsp;This issue is for how the enablement of stage-by-stage and portable learning can taking hold of self-propelled career management.&nbsp; A question is how much of a future is there for a life-design contained by face-to-face encounters. &nbsp;An answer is that life-design needs to link encounter to curriculum.&nbsp; There is no part of the curriculum incapable of carrying some part of career-management freight.&nbsp; The outcome is then for students and their helpers to learn from each other about what issues are thrown up and how they can be navigated.&nbsp; It enlarges the scope for life-design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5. narrative</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A summary: the hinterland of life design is a place of puzzling complexity, out-of-the-blue surprise and confusing dynamics.&nbsp; The essentials for an acceptable educational response are being narrowed by politics, its sponsors and some professionals. &nbsp;Educators who listen to students find learning-for-living developing an inclusive rather than exclusive agenda.&nbsp; That's because what people do about career is what they do about life, and neither the social sciences nor the humanities have found any limits to that.&nbsp; The life-design project is right, therefore, to assemble its careers constructions into a narrative.&nbsp; People are better able to make sense of a narrative however vague, than of analysis however precise (<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/NICECSbEnlarge.pdf">Law, 2012b</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A narrative is a sequence - one thing leading to another.&nbsp; It can be long-term or short, plodding or wide-ranging, trite or layered.&nbsp; An inclusive agenda needs a long-term, wide-ranging and layered narrative.&nbsp; It can raise who-what-when-where-how-and-why questions.&nbsp; And that doesn't whizz its audience along, it draws them in.&nbsp; Now they are both interested onlookers and galvanised agents.&nbsp; And students and their educators want to know how the story speaks of their lives, their child, their family, their work, their fear and their hope. &nbsp;That narrative is expansive.&nbsp; And that account of life-design is most expansive a response to change when it features turning points, changes-of-mind, and ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">____________________________________</p>
<p>Was there ever a time when that ability - to look and look again, to reflect and discover another way, to be shocked and to resolve to do something about it - were more needed? &nbsp;With America It is the change-after-change back-and-forth story of migration, settlement, communication, and invention.&nbsp; Living memory knows a lot about that Euro-American story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of it is where brit careers work got its ideational kick-start.&nbsp; But now, and throughout the globe, change-upon-change puts pressures on work-life that have never been more intense, and controlling interests that have never been more entrenched.&nbsp; This expanded life-design programme, realising more of its potential, will engage students and educators in new and more inclusive ways for finding out what's going on, and firing up a more complete apparatus for dealing with it. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The evidence is that more is <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094">learned from failure</a> than from success.&nbsp; That learning requires the acknowledgement of failure.&nbsp; But a well-documented tendency is to <a href="http://assets.sfzc.org/cms1/sp_download/Mistakes Were Made.pdf">off-load blame</a> onto other people.&nbsp; The consequence is embedded in regressive reforms.&nbsp; But contemporary conditions call for progressive reforms.</p>
<p>Two questions for educators...</p>
<p align="center"><em>is there any </em><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf"><em>reason to exempt careers work</em></a><em> from regressive tendencies?</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">and&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>how much of a</em><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8787"><em> shock is needed to galvanise</em></a><em> a progressive wake-up?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->uses of history</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Timothy Snyder's <a href="http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/black-earth/9781847923493">compelling history</a> of European societies and their cultures is shocking. &nbsp;It uncovers parallels between twentieth- and twenty-first-century politics. &nbsp;You'll recognise the villain. &nbsp;The report carries an urgent warning for education - and especially for careers work. &nbsp;It's important because it calls on previously disregarded evidence and neglected testimony. &nbsp;Its analysis includes a probing account of the influence of policy on professions. &nbsp;Although you'll recognise the villain - his followers and his victims - reading it as a generality, involving us all, invites you to see you and your students as <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9272">agents of history</a>. &nbsp;Which you are.</p>
<p>The account is timely on politics because <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/25/jeremy-corbyn-earthquake-labour-party">electoral opinion is shifting</a> in ways that conventional politicians find it hard to understand. &nbsp;And this researcher is especially useful in his call for constructive movements which are local, independent and creative. &nbsp;This is not Westminster's strongest suite.</p>

<p>Timothy Snyder&nbsp;sets out a sequence of historical causes and effects. &nbsp;They describe a nation-state claiming that its reforms are necessary, inevitable and rational. &nbsp;The trigger is a changing world and its consequences for national survival. &nbsp;But the movement has no evidence to supports its claim. &nbsp;What it has instead is a preference which suits ready-made interests.&nbsp; And that fit renders evidence redundant.&nbsp; Sound familiar?</p>
<p>The resulting movement has existential consequences for the people who become its victims.&nbsp; They are judged to be contaminating the nation, and are therefore deemed unworthy of survival. &nbsp;At the same time the movement is positioning itself for more territory.&nbsp; So there is, at the same time, more ground to be occupied and more conformity to be required. &nbsp;That claim, on space and expectation, gathers its own dynamics. &nbsp;So much so that it persuades malleable professionals to embrace theories and methods which, in their former work, they would have given no room at all. &nbsp;So cultures are transformed - their memories, their beliefs and their expectations are overturned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regime maintains control and silences opposition with its imposition of power - 'might is right'. &nbsp;But, as it eventually turns out, the regime's warnings - of dire economic consequences for non-compliance with its plan - are never actually fulfilled. &nbsp;Might turned out to be powerfully wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The research points to then-and-now similarities.&nbsp; It raises questions - incuding some about whether there could be teachers maintaining a finger-hold on order by imposing similar 'pay-attention-and-do-as-you're-told' demands. &nbsp;Any progressive movement understands that control and subordination are not education.&nbsp; And, where the value of learning is shared with students, no such regime is needed.&nbsp; So Timothy Snyder opens the door to the possibility that contemporary change does not need to require ready-made prescriptions, but to galvanise something more like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.academia.edu/15550214/Learning_through_the_soles_of_our_feet_unschooling_anarchism_and_the_geography_of_childhood?auto=download&campaign=weekly_digest">the inventive anarchy of creativity</a>.&nbsp; In a tightly controlled regime it would need a not-so-malleable courage in educators.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->risk and comfort</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Timothy Snyder finds courage on the margins of all this.&nbsp; There are groups running terrifying risks by setting up rescue organisations. &nbsp;Those risk-takers are themselves victims who have escaped capture.&nbsp; There are also non-compliant helpers setting up resistant outfits.&nbsp; They prove to be most successful when they get a foot in the door of unvisited corners of local state apparatus. &nbsp;It's a stupendously dramatic example of the effectiveness of <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/nicecspace&place.pdf">local understanding for local action</a> - using local resources to find local solutions for local people.</p>
<p>Alongside all that, poorly-informed citizens inhabit a comfortably familiar space with exclusively controlled boundaries. &nbsp;The imperatives feed into popular politics.&nbsp; Their curtailed ideas and theorising over-control the professions. &nbsp;The culmination of that colonisation is the destruction of neighbouring states. &nbsp;And that is how unhampered action crystallises justifications for the rejection of the unwanted. &nbsp;Existential threats can then be immediately murderous.&nbsp; These extremities have passed into history.&nbsp; But the dynamics persist.&nbsp; They can't fairly be condemned as attempts to <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_332904.pdf">eliminate the unwanted</a>, though that is an effect - on a longer time-scale but with no less a finality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->turning points</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So what has Timothy Snyder got? &nbsp;He identifies features in a perennial struggle between constructive and destructive movements. &nbsp;Significant in the latter is a confusion between what is desired and what is justified. &nbsp;It allows people to claim what they want as an entitlement. &nbsp;Meanwhile the more critical the threat of change the more intense the manoeuvring. &nbsp;Where localities are robbed of responsibility the nation-state is dealing with unmanageable levels of complexity. &nbsp;In global movements the complexity is exponentially greater. &nbsp;The greater the resulting discomfort the greater the state is urged to find readily-recognisable simplicity. &nbsp;But the more short cuts in that thinking the greater the regression and the more serious its collateral damage. &nbsp;Then blame for the damage must be offloaded onto outsiders - people who are not one of us. &nbsp;Insiders are then able to invite their supporters to celebrate the comfort of an uncomplicated way of living. &nbsp;And that simple-mindedness does not ask for more government control, it demands less. &nbsp;Sound familiar?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Timothy Snyder's then-and-now comparison exposes what, in the contemporary world,&nbsp;has become the neo-liberal political economy.&nbsp; And there are attempts at a <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">neo-liberal capture of education</a> - in particular of careers work.&nbsp; The same evidence suggests that careers work leaders are ready to comply.&nbsp; In the resulting debate speaking of predatory commerce is to be accused of being unfairly 'anti-business'.&nbsp; But the evidence is of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23120225-the-establishment">global business routinely positioning itself for unearned advantage</a> - and that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/27/volkswagen-capitalism-morality">evidence is accumulating</a> on a daily basis. &nbsp;Its activity includes firms&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/23/uk-wage-growth-stifled-by-tepid-investment-and-low-skilled-migration">off-loading responsibility</a> for investment, while manipulating markets, distorting evidence, avoiding tax and manoeuvring governments.&nbsp; Global technologies locate all of this beyond the reach of democracy, of its representatives and of their constituents.&nbsp; In view of the fact that the clients and students of careers work are on the receiving end of this treatment its <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8844">professionalism is unaccountably quiet</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->finding hope</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a story of historical and repeated failure.&nbsp; Is anything changing? &nbsp;Timothy Snyder finds little sign of any slowdown in regressive tendencies. &nbsp;Prevailing ideas still favour small-government. &nbsp;They advocate an economics simple enough to be contained by talk of targets, markets and bottom-lines. &nbsp;The interests of insiders can then be thought to be blameless. &nbsp;Wherever there is blame to be assign it's attributed to outsiders claimed to be blameworthy. &nbsp;Whistle-blowing educators feature on the list of culprits. &nbsp;Though some adjust stance to gain status. &nbsp;There is a shocking irony in the way even educators will do this, despite how insider alliances dismiss authoritative cultural commentaries and deny reliable scientific findings.</p>
<p>This search digs deep, and what it finds ain't pretty. &nbsp;It probes exposed societies and compliant cultures. &nbsp;It finds politics unable to deal with a shift in electoral priorities. &nbsp;It is not the first to expose helping professionals <a href="http://www.propel.stir.ac.uk/downloads/JuliaEvetts-FullPaper.pdf">unable to sustain a reliable independence</a> of power. &nbsp;Neither is it the first to identify <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf">claims to righteousness</a> in movements which damage the interests they say they are defending.</p>
<p>So what have we got to go on? &nbsp;The evidence points to the power of the margins - local groups running the risks of opposition in small-scale outfits plugged into local apparatus. &nbsp;This is not big-society do-gooding, neither is it local-authority politicking. &nbsp;It's <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">civil society and its stakeholders</a> working independently of out-of-touch politics and its well-healed sponsors.</p>
<p>And it's where Timothy Snyder finds hope - in the establishment of institutions each capable of independent thought and each open to a plurality of view-points. &nbsp;That movement engages creativity rather than control. &nbsp;We should also consider putting his work on the curriculum. &nbsp;It's sound history. &nbsp;I think it would count as education for citizenship. &nbsp;And, Adolf aside, was there ever a time when such&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9272">independence of mind, critical thinking and discontented creativity</a> were ever more needed?</p>

<p>This account of the future poses some pressing questions for careers work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>is careers work usefully thought of as an institution or a movement?<br /></em><em>does it most need defending or galvanising?<br /></em><em>does that mean it knows where it's going?<br /></em><em>and who it needs to take with it?<br /></em><em>and does that mean supporting some interests and opposing others?<br /></em><em>and if it does is there any agreement about which is which?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the issues, and this is an account of a careers-work leader who took them on - and did so some time ago. &nbsp;He's worth listening to now, because no issue was resolved then, and none is resolved now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are existential issues - if careers work can't tell itself what it is about, it needn't expect anyone else to show much interest.&nbsp; Careers work needs the issues resolved now.</p>
<p>The examination comes in five stages...</p>
<p>1: &nbsp;<strong>unemployment</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the politics of careers work damages society<br />2: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->education and the local state</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; central controls are displacing local understanding &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />3:&nbsp; <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->manpower and careers services</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;central and local actions are inseparably entwined<br />4: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->youth opportunities</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the best training in the world does not create work<br />5: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->the future</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a good future brings dignity, respects individuality and conceeds control</p>

<p>What follows is the most insightful polemic on the issues facing careers work that I have come across.&nbsp; It is compelling stuff and intended to galvanise change.&nbsp; It's Kevin Devine's presidential address to The Institute of Careers Officers annual conference, in September 1981. &nbsp;Contemporary careers work is yet to catch up with him. &nbsp;And yestrerday's ICO was the forerunner of today's Career Development Institute .&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've edited this version into the available space.&nbsp; None of Kevin's ideas have been lost.&nbsp; A post-script takes a look at the implications of his long-ago thinking for today's and tomorrow's action.</p>

<p>Kevin Devine<br /> President, The&nbsp;Institute of Careers Officers</p>
<p>I run the risk of falling into the category of...</p>
<p align="center"><em>...bleeding hearts&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so-called liberals &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marxist agitators</em></p>
<p>But what I hope to do is demonstrate that the way society treats its young people, and particularly the unemployed, is nothing less than a prescription for social chaos and confusion. &nbsp;And when I say society I mean all of us.&nbsp; More importantly, we run the risk of perpetrating one of the greatest social outrages that this country has seen. &nbsp;It is to cause youngsters to be the victims of a society which behaves as though it has no place for them.</p>
<p>I will take a look at the nature of unemployment among young people and society's response to their needs.&nbsp; It means examining the place of education, the nature of the local state, and the youth opportunities programmes. &nbsp;I want these threads to come together in a glimpse of a future which can enable young people to participate in their society, to improve it, but - most of all - to have a sense of dignity and self-respect in whatever they do.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1:&nbsp; UNEMPLOYMENT</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For many careers workers a detailed examination of the features of youth unemployment is clearly unnecessary.&nbsp; However, on the off-chance that there may be some who have learned about unemployment from pernicious propaganda, and whose higher consciousness is immersed in the theories of monetarism, I will briefly look at some aspects of unemployment among young people because this background is relevant to my theme.</p>
<p>I shall refer later to the role of the Manpower Services Commission.&nbsp; But itis interesting to note now that it established a working party which, with the support of parliament, produced the package we now know as the <em>Youth Opportunities Programme </em>(YOP). &nbsp;Its report, <em>Young People and Work</em>, is adocument of profound significance - not only for members of this Institute's careers services - but, in my view, also for local education authorities and for society itself. &nbsp;The report established that juvenile unemployment was likely to stay at on exceptionally high levels. &nbsp;It also noted that there is an increase in seventeen- and eighteen-year-olds entering the labour market. &nbsp;The results have been, by anybody's criteria, a remarkable achievement in delivering a programme of opportunities, from which many young people have benefited. &nbsp;However, one significant conclusion is notably absent from the report: it is that unemployment among young people was no longer a cyclical phenomenon, but essentially structural in nature. &nbsp;At least YOP affords society a chance of buying time to consider other strategies that meet the real needs of unemployed young people - who are now affected to an extent unthinkable a decade ago.</p>
<p>The young jobless frequently hit the headlines in the media. &nbsp;Most of us know that it is young people in the age range of sixteen-to-twenty-four who are now adversely affected. &nbsp;The majority come from backgrounds where craft or manual occupations are common. &nbsp;In the early days of the growth of unemployment, most of the youngsters affected were unqualified.&nbsp; It is now becoming increasingly difficult, sometimes impossible, for any young person to find a job.</p>
<p>We face a future where the total unemployment figure continues to rise. &nbsp;The grim government figures are an under-statement.&nbsp; An economic consideration is the failure to invest in training.&nbsp; It is difficult to imagine the anxieties of sixteen year-olds leaving school. &nbsp;Teachers are reluctant to prepare young people for unemployment.&nbsp; And they are beginning to experience the backlash of students no longer motivated for trying to benefit from education.&nbsp; Students see little purpose in it. &nbsp;Many are sharp enough to perceive that learning comes to nothing with no employment at the end.</p>
<p>In the five years to 1900, there was a sixty per-cent increase in unemployment and a fifty per-cent rise in young-people's suicides. &nbsp;&nbsp;Young blacks are disproportionately affected.&nbsp; Yet for each prosecution for tax evasion there are 160 for social-security fraud. &nbsp;The ministerial response?...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'there are many people in our society <br /> who are harder pressed than immediate school leavers'</em></p>
<p>My purpose, then, is not to offer raw material for some sociological journal, but to illustrate the reality of these cruel inequalities.&nbsp; Part of it is the vicious phenomenon of fascism whose propaganda blames unemployment on Jews, and which sees the dole queue as a fertile recruiting ground. &nbsp;Part of the reality is the materialistic advertising of the popular press - offering an anodyne escape from the reality of unemployment. &nbsp;It lays a smoke screen, obscuring the realities underlying what it sees as unacceptable expressions of antipathy or alienation.&nbsp; Aneurin Bevan has already voiced it...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'this so-called affluent society is an ugly society' <br /> 'it is a vulgar society<br /> 'it is a meretricious society<br /> 'it is a society in which priorities have gone all wrong'</em></p>
<p>These are the turbulent waters on which teenagers embark when they leave school. &nbsp;The secondary curriculum has precious little to do with their real needs. &nbsp;There are pious statements about...</p>
<p align="center"><em>...personal and social education.</em></p>
<p>They show every sign of being written in a cosy and secure world, they are an emasculated programme far-removed from the overcrowded tenements of inner cities.</p>
<p>And there is also what passes for...</p>
<p align="center"><em>...careers education.</em></p>
<p>It emphases content over the process by which youngsters learn for a life after school. &nbsp;The resources available to teachers encourage conformity, fitting pegs into holes - and, heaven help the ill-fitting. &nbsp;If careers education is to have any real guts as a subject, then one of its principal purposes must be to enable young people to learn how to take control of their own lives.</p>
<p>On leaving school youngster becomes clients of a careers service. &nbsp;Careers-service staff know the profound effects of the remorseless day-in-and-day-out pressure of dealing with young people - who conclude that society has nothing to offer them. &nbsp;The risk is that the service becomes an agency siphoning off resentment which might be expressed in activity against society. &nbsp;Feelings of apathy give way to a sense of rejection. culminating in angry and melancholic alienation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The path of escalation is obvious - for some in society the only remedy is to silence the protest. &nbsp;A more insidious call is for doing whatever is necessary to preserve the fabric of society.&nbsp; But there is a third possibility...:</p>
<p align="center"><em>we must do something so that these young people can help <br /> in changing the fabric of society</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Careers officers help youngsters do something worthwhile in their lives. &nbsp;But for many the initial optimism about the Youth Opportunities Programme has given way to a weary sense of forlorn hope. &nbsp;There is no need to criticise the programme, but there is a need to examine the odds stacked against its success. &nbsp;In sharp contrast with apprentices and students, the jobless-young lack a sense of purpose and - most importantly - any sense of status.&nbsp; They need the help of the community around them.&nbsp; This must not be condescending prescription but a constructive enabling.&nbsp; More is needed from education, and not only inside their institutions but also through setting up fulfilling and vigorous roles in their communities. &nbsp;But has local education the resources and freedom to get it done?</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>2:&nbsp; EDUCATION AND THE LOCAL STATE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a decline in the financial resources available to local education authorities. &nbsp;It has led to some centralisation.&nbsp; There is also an intrusion of party politics into education.&nbsp; The local management of education is the most consistently political part of local government services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The most recent example of that intrusion is in central-government initiatives for curriculum.&nbsp; It famously began with the speech by the then Prime Minister at Ruskin College.&nbsp; It was followed by a series of great debates, a spate of publications, and persistent pressure from the central education ministry. &nbsp;But there is still a wide gap between all this and the facts of life facing school leavers.&nbsp; While almost every aspect of the debate raises questions for local autonomy versus central direction. &nbsp;The curriculum is dominated by the examination system, itself centrally influenced by the universities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But the practice of local authorities varies widely - perhaps too widely. &nbsp;And the debate raise doubts about whether they can properly meet the demands. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>I think they can - and should. &nbsp;And there has been some government acknowledgement of the need to have local mechanisms to deal with local needs.&nbsp; But the only effective answer to this is to reform the financial structure - and base it on local income for local authorities.</p>
<p>How do we reconcile these traditional values of local democratic accountability with the need to reduce all aspects of national expenditure?&nbsp; The pressure is to bring all into line with central economic policies.&nbsp; Various groups protest and fight the resulting cuts.&nbsp; They include the students' parents, council tenants, the elderly, the infirm and minorities. &nbsp;But there are fewer who actually organise for more to stimulate employment.</p>
<p>The underlying conflict is between what government can do about social <em>investment</em> and what local authorities can do about social <em>provision</em>.&nbsp; The issue becomes...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what is the role of local government in the British state?'</em></p>
<p>Take first the notion of the British state, and assume that it is a capitalist rather than communist state.&nbsp; Centralisation then positions local government as an arm of capitalism. &nbsp;It's argued that government has two key functions: to maintain social order, requiring either legitimation or coercion; and to maintain profitability in the private sector, requiring social investment contributing to citizen well-being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The involvement of the state in social investment is frequently overlooked by opponents of increased public expenditure.&nbsp; But it provides resources which the private sector does not supply. &nbsp;And once those infrastructure costs are pushed upwards to government, the private sector shifts away from improving private-sector profitability. &nbsp;And that reduces employment opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile jobs in industries which contribute to social investment, such as the steel industry, are eroded.&nbsp; Some, such as the railways, are under-capitalised.&nbsp; And price increases are forced elsewhere, for example in gas and electricity. &nbsp;The results are a drop in labour requirements, falling demand and rising prices. &nbsp;Yet we stifle industries which could bring recovery, and there is under-investment new industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time local-government expenditure on social provision is curtailed.&nbsp; That is the case for housing, hospitals and welfare.&nbsp; And social provision indirectly ensures a local supply of labour.&nbsp; But, if local employers don't need workers, they see little point in social and welfare services to look after them. &nbsp;Local government has had some responsibility for social investment, for example in gas, electricity and water, roads and public transport.&nbsp; But those services have been taken away.</p>
<p>There is conflict between social investment controlled by the central state and social provision consumed in the locality. &nbsp;At the national level corporate boards have direct access to policy-making. &nbsp;At regional level non-elected authorities are gaining control of essential services.&nbsp; However, housing and welfare remain local provisions where priorities can be locally argued. &nbsp;That also applies to education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Central government is taking measures to bring local authorities into line. &nbsp;It must also try to reconcile its economic priorities with the social demands expressed in democratic protests.&nbsp; But the impositions of central government, the remoteness of its officialdom, and the insensitivities of whitehall departments all contribute to a growing cynicism in society. &nbsp;Cynicism gives way to apathy and apathy to alienation.&nbsp; And public-expenditure cuts are a constant companion of rising unemployment.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>3:&nbsp; MANPOWER AND CAREERS SERVICES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Manpower Services Commission Is a central agency for social investment.&nbsp; It is not democratically appointed. &nbsp;The investments aredesigned to contribute directly to private-sector profitability - they serve employer interests. &nbsp;Services which do not serve that main purpose are discarded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A careers service is a local agency for social provision.&nbsp; It is democratically accountable.&nbsp; As part of social provision, consumed locally, careers services have had both losses and gains - but on balance they have contracted&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notable is the loss of the centrally-based Careers and Occupational Information Centre. &nbsp;The centre has made an outstanding contribution to the provision of information and resources to clients and students.&nbsp; It found a ready acceptance among youngsters, their parents, their teachers and in careers services. &nbsp;To the extent that this service has maintained its principal priority, of offering a service to young people, it resembles social provision.&nbsp; Examples include providing group work, counselling, interviewing and&nbsp; placement services. &nbsp;All are locally consumed.</p>
<p>The question must now be asked...</p>
<p align="center"><em>given the distinctions between central investment and local provision <br /> what is the role of careers services in local government?</em></p>
<p>There can be no simple answer.&nbsp; The operation of an employment service cannot succeed unless it attends to the needs of employers.&nbsp; A majority of employers would probably accept that, by providing a first and significant priority to the needs of job seekers, the&nbsp; service is helping employers.&nbsp; Careers services have a much better record than any private provision in covering work vacancies.&nbsp; They therefore offer a uniquely sophisticated pre-selection service to the labour market. &nbsp;Employers make the final recruiting selection, but careers services are as much a form of social investment as central government.&nbsp; There can be no simple separation between central-manpower needs and local-consumer needs.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>4:&nbsp; YOUTH OPPORTUNITIES</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In a recent joint publication of the Manpower Services Commission and the Education Committee of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the following statement appears.</p>
<p align="center"><em>'The Youth Opportunities Programme is designed around<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->the needs of unemployed young people of different levels of ability,<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->and for whom work experience, training in basic skills and constructive vocational advice and guidance are likely to be of value in their search for suitable employment'</em></p>
<p>The big problem is that there isn't any suitable employment for many youngsters. &nbsp;There is considerable evidence of disaffection among youngsters who question the value of going on the programme when on completion there are few, if any, employment opportunities.</p>
<p>About a million young people are to take part.&nbsp; And the programme certainly has some significant successes - it has been a life-line for many. &nbsp;But, although a vast majority have derived some benefit, the number completing the programme and going into suitable employment is decreasing all the time.</p>
<p>A <em>Youthaid Review</em> of the programme reports concerns&nbsp;&nbsp; A disproportionate burden of unemployment is carried by young black school leavers. &nbsp;There is a 'creeping rigidity', and repeated complaints that the programme is weighed down with rules, regulations and administrative procedures.&nbsp; The most common cause of complaint seems to be bureaucratic delays, particularly in the approval of schemes.</p>
<p>The Youth Opportunities Programme was originally intended to be an alternative to unemployment, but - as matters have developed - it has become an alternative to employment. &nbsp;Red tape aside, the most effective training programme cannot create jobs.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5:&nbsp; THE FUTURE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A radical and new approach is necessary. &nbsp;But the creation of new jobs is a long-term and ambitious goal.&nbsp; Even a sudden switch to a crash programme of public expenditure, investment and expansion will not achieve overnight.</p>
<p>For too long an assumption has been that employment services and training sum-up the national enterprise. &nbsp;But local authorities have more active roles - in stimulating employment growth, and operating employment services.&nbsp; Local services are more client-centred, more responsive to need and more accountable to consumers. &nbsp;We allaccept that education, training and employment are closely linked together - but they are also local services designed to meet local needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To any who doubt the ability of local authorities to respond, I cite examples of what can be done by a determined and dedicated services. &nbsp;There are local authorities which have vigorously pursued radical policies for stimulating employment growth.&nbsp; The Inner-London Education Authority has a consistently good record of making available resources to careers services so that they can meet the demands made on them.&nbsp; Those services have provided for unemployed youngsters over-and-above what is afforded by the Manpower Services Commission.</p>
<p>We don't need more agencies, we need a more radical approach to cut through red tape of existing agencies and to get on with expanding work opportunities. &nbsp;We must be prepared to re-appraise the relationship between local education, careers services and government. &nbsp;Careers services will play key roles.&nbsp; &nbsp;But how that reappraisal works out in detail is a task for local authorities.</p>
<p>I see training workshops and real community projects as the backbone, closely linked to a purposeful programme of skills training. &nbsp;Whatever the provision, it must be based in the local community, draw on its resources, and serving its needs.</p>
<p>It must also show respect for the individuality of each young person - enabling them to feel that they have status and purpose in society. &nbsp;That means socially providing learning which is relevant to their needs, over-compensating for disadvantage, and positioning all young people for taking control their own futures.</p>

<p><strong>POSTCRIPT<br /></strong>Bill Law</p>
<p>Kevin's voice has authority.&nbsp; He spoke as the Head of Cambridgeshire Careers Service and president of the ICO.&nbsp; He was later appointed director of the government-funded Schools Council research-and-development project on working life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were other authoritative voices at the time - <a href="http://www.cegnet.co.uk/blog/peter-daws">Peter Daws</a> had most influence on government.&nbsp; But Kevin was not negotiating with government, he was galvanising a profession.&nbsp; The speech is not about attaching careers work to politics, it's about attaching careers work to the lives of clients and students.&nbsp; His is not a voice for defending convention, but for catalysing reform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He spoke from the guidance wing of careers work, and I'm mostly on the curriculum wing.&nbsp; So I didn't come across his lecture until he casually mentioned it.&nbsp; On hearing his summary I asked for a copy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I admire the nerve that blows the whistle on the narrow self-interests of the simple-minded - some of whom are among the influential.&nbsp; I don't remember anybody so comprehensively taking on the task as Kevin - dismantling trends, disentangling analyses, facing reality.&nbsp; It predates by decades today's careers-work thinking. &nbsp;And it was way ahead of any current argument for reform -&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/careers-work reform">including my own</a>.</p>
<p>Kevin Devine was the first in his field to identify the impact on careers work of neo-liberal austerity. &nbsp;And he developed an early grasp of the way the locality influences career development. &nbsp; Those local authorities have since been seriously damaged by central government. &nbsp;And what is going wrong still needs probing...</p>
<p align="center"><em>is careers work usefully thought of as an institution or a movement?<br /></em><em>does it most need defending or galvanising?<br /></em><em>does that mean it knows where it's going?<br /></em><em>and who it needs to take with it?<br /></em><em>and does that mean supporting some interests and opposing others?<br /></em><em>and if it does is there any agreement about which is which?</em></p>
<p>I can report hands-on experience of a failure to address such questions. &nbsp;The government's Careers and Occupational Information Centre was the publisher of my<em>&nbsp;</em>open-learning pack, whose title coined the term '<em>Careers Work'.</em>&nbsp; For several years, in centres throughout the country, and running to three editions, the pack was a resource for locally-based programme development.&nbsp; An official unilaterally replaced it with a few pages of advice to practitioners.&nbsp; He had been a former careers adviser and I had helped to train him. &nbsp;I can't help feeling, on encoutering him in government, that this former careers worker was, after all, rooted in the narrow, the self-interested and the simple-minded.</p>
<p>That self-serving mentality is an enemy of progress. &nbsp;And change is the agenda. &nbsp;But, left to itself, there is an unreadiness that displaces free-thinking enlightenment and hard-won evidence with whim and superstition. &nbsp;Conflicting versions of religious extremism spill into our schools, colleges and universities. &nbsp;It gets harder to appreciate migration as a gift. &nbsp;Life, well-being, and survival are put at risk - while commercial and political interests&nbsp;move on unhampered. &nbsp;They capture and curtail the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">usurped and weakened public services</a>&nbsp;- by which civilised societies manage change. &nbsp;The agenda needs to be progressive change, and its enemies are any combination of the complacent, the narrow, the self-interested, the simple-minded and the powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did anybody predict any of this in 1981? &nbsp;Contemporary careers work cannot afford to ignore it. &nbsp;Public-service careers work is in a worse state now than in 1981 - brought&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf">close to extinction</a>. &nbsp;And this twenty-first-century failure was set in motion by that plodding twentieth-century complacency. &nbsp; A persistent unwillingness to&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094">learn from failure</a>&nbsp;means that the last careers-work leader left standing will, in any now-and-future, be empty-handed.</p>
<p>Education has a counter-narrative, offering careers work wider horiizions. &nbsp;Kevin Devine's thinking on 'central investment and local provision' gets on-going research-based support, examining '<a href="http://cdj.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/suppl_1/i132.abstract">corporate management and community development</a>'.&nbsp; There are massive areas of expansion for careers work to understand and enable. &nbsp;People are <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094">learning from experience</a> at least as much as from expertise.&nbsp; That experience is increasingly shaped in <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/nicecspace&place.pdf">locally-based</a> enclaves.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/NICECHit&Myth.pdf">internet</a> is at the same time a help and hindrance to learning. &nbsp;Local educators know more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tes.com/news/further-education/breaking-views/productivity-a-puzzle-policymakers-not-fe">improving productivity</a>&nbsp;than central government, its sponsors and its favoured advisers. &nbsp;The way people understand themselves in the world is <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9272">outflanking conventional politics</a>.&nbsp; It is even possible that the word 'socialism' no longer attracts&nbsp;knee-jerk&nbsp;derision from closed minds. &nbsp;Instead the call is for the <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9272">ready-for-anything-flexibility</a> of independent minds, critically thinking, and creatively inventing.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>People are changing the way they manage their lives.&nbsp; Careers work cannot afford to neglect the news.&nbsp; But it comes with a <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/nicecspace&place.pdf">warning about priorities</a>&nbsp;- should careers work embed prevailing expertise, or rebuild it in response to change?&nbsp; It's a balancing of convention and reform - guess which is a way foward and which a blind alley?</p>
<p>Reform needs new ideas.&nbsp; The new idea here understands contemporary career management as a process of 'holding on' and 'letting go'. &nbsp;The idea cropped up first in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbnarrative.pdf">narrative thinking</a>.&nbsp; It can connect to policy, professionalism and practice.&nbsp; It would expand the careers-work repertoire. &nbsp;More importantly, it can position clients and students as agents of change.</p>
<p>To get anywhere with this means documenting how a person <em>holds on</em> to friends that matter, to assumptions that feel right, and to privileges that stand a person in good stead.&nbsp; But people might instead&nbsp;<em>let go</em> of friends, or assumptions or privileges if they are found to obstruct what that person finds important.</p>
<p>Navigating the pushes and pulls of these dynamics is among the most significant features of contemporary career management. &nbsp;Knowing when to hold-on and when to let-go enables people for ready-for-anything flexibility. &nbsp;Was there ever a time when that was more needed?</p>
<p>Much of the evidence and analysis here is heavy-duty - with occasional tongues-in-cheek. &nbsp;It will stand some back-and-forth revisiting. &nbsp;The analysis is illustrated with examples of useful encounters, materials and practice. &nbsp;The evidence uncovers five dimensions...</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1: &nbsp;<strong>connection</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; finding links to what's happening and with whom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->reach</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;developing ready-for-anything flexibility<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->buoyancy</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; making good use of bad news<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->grasp</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;establishing learning for life-long living<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5: &nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->direction</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; realising independent critical-thinking and creativity</p>

<p align="center"><em>a shorter but fully referenced version of this appears&nbsp;</em><br /><em>in the&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.nicec.org/html/journal.html">The NICEC Journal</a> for Autumn 2015</em></p>

<p><strong>1: &nbsp;CONNECTIONS</strong></p>
<p>There are causes-and-effects, there are meanings a person attributes to those events, and there are purposes set in motion by those atrributions. &nbsp;Defnding convention or pursuing reform, careers work needs to <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">track those links</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The possibilities are varied, dynamic and expanding.&nbsp; In one way or another people are connected to family, friends and school-or-college contacts.&nbsp; There are neighbourhoods, where communities can link to locally-based agencies. &nbsp;Links to shops, bars, advertisers, stylists and media are constantly appearing - both off-line and on.&nbsp; Connections to politics, campaigns and demonstrations are being forged and broken as you read this. &nbsp;All raise question about what's worth holding-onto and what can be waved goodbye.&nbsp; People&nbsp;act on and&nbsp;live by their answers - they move and shake.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>move or shake</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf"><strong>professional thinking</strong></a> has a spectrum of links that clients and students deal with. How much of it can you and your colleagues recognise as significant in their lives?...</p>
<p><strong>there's what everybody seems to know...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>people act on <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->instinct</strong>&nbsp;- impulsively looking for immediate pay-offs</li>
<li>they are most aware of their <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->individuality</strong>&nbsp;- at the extreme as though in a social vacuum</li>
<li>but lives are also&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->situated</strong>&nbsp;- what people do reflects where they live</li>
<li>and there is&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->background</strong>&nbsp;- where people learn how people-like-us manage all this&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;no big surprises so far, but more to say about social settings</strong>...</p>
<ul>
<li>individuals are located as a members of a <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->community</strong>&nbsp;- with its agreed way of doing things</li>
<li>it is also where <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->attachments</strong>&nbsp;are forged - shaping give-and-take relationships,&nbsp;loyalties and aspirations</li>
<li>and each locality nurtures a <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->culture</strong>&nbsp;- with its shared beliefs, values and expectations</li>
<li>social <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->enclaves</strong>&nbsp;are formed - each with its own set of&nbsp;sympathies, tolerances and hostilities</li>
<li>the dynamic of such social life is <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->habitus</strong>&nbsp;- where the inhabited culture shapes habits-of-mind</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;political influences rate more attention...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>social <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->polarisation&nbsp;</strong>builds over time - separating into 'like or not like us', valued or disdained, becoming strangers to each other</li>
<li>by contrast a <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->nudge</strong>&nbsp;is immediate - reinforcing behaviour which serves such interests as market, profession and business</li>
<li>while <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholding</strong> is deeper - more than shareholding, it represents the interests of customer, citizen and worker</li>
<li>among those&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->interests</strong>&nbsp;- are some people's beliefs in the certain deserving of one's own success, and the probable deserving of other people's failure</li>
<li>more inclusive interests voice <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->identity politics</strong>&nbsp;- opposing discrimination on&nbsp;gender, race and sexuality although, though less on class &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;change provokes fast-developing accounts of career influences.</strong>..</p>
<ul>
<li>influences are defended in <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->political theory</strong>&nbsp;- voicing beliefs, interests and evidence ranging from economic necessity to planetary survival</li>
<li>people are increasingly asked to show <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->resilience</strong>&nbsp;- seen as a 'good' upbringing for building character</li>
<li>and <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->intuitions </strong>are not lightly to be dismissed - our brains know more than we know they know and that insight can be worth heeding</li>
<li>but ideas of <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->enlightenment</strong>&nbsp;oppose entrenched interests - urging independence-of-mind, and expecting to be taken seriously in education</li>
<li>enlightenment also signposts <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->critical thinking</strong>&nbsp;- which undermines arbitrary controls by developing reliably-informed progression</li>
<li>and <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->creativity</strong>&nbsp;takes a similar stance - refusing to settle for how things are with an&nbsp;inventiveness which reconnects how &nbsp;life is experienced</li>
</ul>
<p>Reality&nbsp;is muddier than analysis. &nbsp;Instinct and intuition are not easy to tell appart. &nbsp;Impulse can both trap and liberate. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/review-how-good-we-can-be-by-will-hutton">claims of stakeholders</a>&nbsp;are contested. &nbsp;But what are their drivers? - different <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5322">interests</a> (pragmatically served) or different <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/enlightened_citizens_vs._moral_sheep/">philosophies</a> (epistemologically&nbsp;scrutinised)? &nbsp;Some interests are rooted in the memories of a <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/opinion/can-higher-educations-golden-age-of-plenty-continue">privileged</a> and&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/review-baby-boomers-and-generational-conflict-jennie-bristow">ageing generation</a>.&nbsp; And the&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/journals/rsa-journal-issue-4-2014/">polarisation</a>&nbsp;of interests&nbsp;can thwart reforming zeal in all but the bravest (pp.20ff). &nbsp;So independence-of-mind calls on <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/CCREAD/etscc/kant.html">courage</a>.&nbsp; And, full circle, some of the <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=7Ze0ohBVFY0C&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=samual+oliner+pearl+oliner+altruistic+personality&ots=wo1b6PwfL2&sig=6ZyWjC2DJtr4ZMD65_zGQDp9nLY#v=onepage&q=samual oliner pearl oliner altruistic personality&f=false">bravest political action</a> is rooted in upbringing.</p>
<p>Links in all directions - and few certainties. &nbsp;There's no straightforward conversation to be had about holding-on-and-letting-go. &nbsp;But how refreshing to find <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2015/02/17/martin-sheen-tells-pupils-to-walk-with-him-to-social-activism.aspx">a celebrity</a>&nbsp;recognising students changing the world. &nbsp;And what more-important education agenda could there be?</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>who shaking what</strong></p>
<p>It's an education agenda, but it's also political - about who who gets to do what in society. &nbsp;Politics is <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094">getting clever</a>&nbsp;about this - enough to lead and mislead. &nbsp;A&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n20/owen-hatherley/who-will-stop-them">framework for action</a> is based on three elements. &nbsp;Firstly, any dominant group is an 'establishment'.&nbsp; It is supported, secondly, by 'outriders' - research-and-development outfits capturing connections for the establishment. &nbsp;Some of these are&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8875">careers outfits</a>. &nbsp;Thirdly, all politicking needs to persuade people about 'what everybody knows', and that frames an 'overton window'.&nbsp; Named for its inventor, it contains what people can be persuaded to believe - and that need not be truthful. &nbsp;The products appear daily in the media. &nbsp;And students who know how politics works can outflank it.&nbsp; There is such&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/04/russell-brand-changes-mind-about-voting-and-urges-support-for-labour">student politics</a>. &nbsp;Does it count as education for citizenship?</p>
<p>Students and their helpers never more needed to engage politics.&nbsp; There's no shortage of&nbsp;<a href="http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/">myths and findings</a>&nbsp;to probe. &nbsp;The evidence is that however much <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview">a politico thinks he knows</a> he&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/31/finnish-teachers-special-train-teach">probably doesn't</a>.&nbsp; So there is a <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1014635203149#page-1">world-wide search</a>&nbsp;for people ready to deal with politics in their own terms.&nbsp; But how many regimes can you list where the population is schooled in superstition, myth and compliance, rather than educated for independent and critical creativity? &nbsp;I can't help wondering whether you listed any part of the UK.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p><strong>2: &nbsp;REACH</strong></p>
<p>People are developing their own ways of dealing with work-life. &nbsp;They reach beyond career development and its&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.teachingtimes.com/articles/iag-strategy-question-answer.htm">information, advice and guidance</a>&nbsp;(IAG). &nbsp;They reach towards career management - which is&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUW8V7Jupns&feature=youtu.be">not the same thing</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time political interests are becoming more of a problem. &nbsp;They talk of individuals making economic decisions based on <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8509">impartial information</a>. &nbsp;It's narrow thinking, fitting into an overton window framing business interests, political time-lines and habits-of-mind.</p>
<p>Time is up on both IAG and impartiality.&nbsp; Neither deal with the accelerating&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">change and complexity</a>&nbsp;of contemporary lives. &nbsp;Research into <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf">work-life experience</a> speaks of a search for work-life balance and a rejection of arbitrary demands. &nbsp;It intensifies pressure on education, looking beyond self-advancement and towards <a href="http://eax.sagepub.com/content/2/1/63.full">finding meaning</a> in their lives. &nbsp;It calls for a hold-on-let-go career conversation - and bigger windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>career conversations</strong></p>
<p>Talk of IAG&nbsp;conjures&nbsp;two favourite words: 'choice' and 'decision'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Choice speaks of acting on 'this-or-that?', decision on now-or-when?'.&nbsp; Both lurk in this conversation between questions and answers...<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">'does it have to be sciences or arts?'<br /><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'no, you can get a better deal from the college'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">'suppose I just can't face any more exams'<br /><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'there are jobs where your personality will take you a long way'</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">'if I don't grab it now do I lose the chance?'<br /><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not necessarily, the firm might respect you asking for time to think'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">'I thought you were supposed to tell me what to do'<br /><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'I can't do that, but your test and inventory scores are very promising'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center">_______________________________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>this and similar inserts are illustrative</em><br /><em>of possible conversations<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->based on what I remember and can imagine<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->you have more recent memory and imagining</em></p>
<p align="center">_______________________________________________</p>
<p>Such conversations go down well with some interests. &nbsp;They attend to what evaluators need. &nbsp;They get frequent airings in the literature. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/moving on/cafcurriculum.pdf">influential approve</a> - including politicians, employers and conventional leaders. &nbsp;But something gets lost in the applause...&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>'you can get a better deal from the college'<br /></em>'so what makes it better?'<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'there are jobs where your personality will take you a long way'<br /></em>'but all my mates are leaving now'<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'a firm like that might respect you asking for time to think'<br /></em>'will the firm want to listen to me talking about my baby?'</p>
<p align="center"><em>'your test and inventory scores are very promising'<br /></em>'they'd feel more like the real me if they contradicted each other'<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>There's surprise, puzzlement and <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20159814?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">ambivalence</a>&nbsp;here. &nbsp;Research suggests it's what drives creative change. &nbsp;But convention has little to say about change-of-mind. &nbsp;So reform needs a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">counter-narrative</a> featuring departures, turning-points and new-horizons. &nbsp;Reform calls for an expanding dynamic of change rather than a narrowing settlement of choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wide-ranging talk like this can shake confidence - conventionally upheld as a condition for success.&nbsp; It's true that positive&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview">talk of confidence</a>&nbsp;comes across well. &nbsp;But <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.tesdigital.com/magazine">evidence suggests</a> that the habitual use of rewarding talk can hold back learning (17/07/2015 pp.12-13).&nbsp; And there are&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/people-are-overly-optimistic-about.html?m=1">well-documented</a> accounts of over-confidence, misleading confidence and deluded confidence. &nbsp;They identify&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/NICECSbEnlarge.pdf">self-contradicting</a> and <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf">self-serving</a> beliefs.</p>
<p>These exchanges feature conflicting interests. &nbsp;Some attempt to&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">capture education</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Stakeholders&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/30/ofsted-learn-instead-alternative-inspections-headteachers-schools-naht">reach for release</a>. &nbsp;Either way, they raise hold-and-let issues - with degrees of not necessarily helpful confidence. &nbsp;Somebody once mentioned how a <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.tes.co.uk/teaching-resource/the-beatitudes-cartoon-6070434">reach for the meek</a> will get things right.&nbsp; The evidence on confidence suggests that he had a point - or she.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>affect and effect</strong></p>
<p>A long-standing account of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf">learning from experience</a>&nbsp;illustrates the affective dynamics of conflicting interests. &nbsp;And, on top of everything, career management is a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">response to change</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;charged with affect. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcegs.pdf">Clinical evidence</a> sets out a spectrum of affect.&nbsp; It starts from fight-or-flight instinct.&nbsp; It moves into an account of approach-or-avoid emotion.&nbsp; It settles on a sustained feeling about how things are. &nbsp;But it has all has been lumped togather as 'emotional intelligence' - said to be good for personal development. &nbsp;And, while that supplies a conventional account of what works well or needs help, reform needs an account of what transforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf">professional thinking</a>&nbsp;</strong>sets out a three-fold spectrum of career-management affect. &nbsp;What sense do your students make of it?&nbsp; And recognise in their experience?...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;thinking on feeling-good in upbeat experience...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->self-esteem</strong> - widely thought to be necessary to achievement</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->confidence</strong> - said to be needed for risk-taking</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->ambition</strong> - held to be made possible by both</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;thinking on demanding attention is less upbeat than astringent...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->self-regulation</strong> - appeals for a disciplined state-of-mind</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->character</strong> - deals with difficulties and obstacles</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->resilience</strong> - is a bouncing-back response to loss or failure</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->mindfulness</strong> - a special focus on here-and-now reality</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;thinking on transformation engages the excitement of change...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->independence of mind - i</strong>nterrogating and confronting arbitrary influences</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->critical-thinking -</strong> an unwillingness to settle for the way things are</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->creativity&nbsp;</strong>- transforming how people see reality and how they will now live in it</li>
</ul>
<p>There's <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497">no consensus</a> here. &nbsp;There are view-points reflecting mixed feelings, different interests, and conflicting priorities.&nbsp; It is a narrative. &nbsp;And in a narrative nothing need be unchallenged, or under control, or believed without doubt. &nbsp;The thinking speaks of a <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/sbjournalarticle.pdf">rounded story</a>&nbsp;which has&nbsp;muddles to unpick, bad news to confront and minds to change. &nbsp;Nothing is taken for granted.</p>
<p>Careers work has plenty to consider - ranging from <a href="http://www.hse.ru/data/2013/01/28/1304836059/Standing. The_Precariat__The_New_Dangerous_Class__-Bloomsbury_USA(2011).pdf">precarious employment</a>, through&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21648627-controversial-new-book-says-islam-must-change-five-important-areas-thoughts-its">arbitrary religious demands</a>,&nbsp;to <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/12/sure-start-childrens-centres-face-worst-year-of-budget-cuts">neglected child care</a>.&nbsp; It brings&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.localschoolsnetwork.org.uk/2015/04/time-to-put-an-end-to-excessive-testing-of-our-children/">stress-related anxiety</a>&nbsp;where bad feelings can bury everything.&nbsp; It's hard to know where 'passion' belongs on this spectrum. &nbsp;But suppose it were a willingness to risk, endure, and suffer for something <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.allaboutjesuschrist.org/the-passion-of-jesus-faq.htm">bigger than self</a>? &nbsp;Wouldn't that change some minds? &nbsp;</p>
<p>And there's no ready-made script here.&nbsp; It's a hold-and-let-go process reaching beyond feel-good, and beyond demanding-attention, and leading to start-again transformation. &nbsp;Ready-for-anything flexibility is attainable when nothing is thought inevitable.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p><strong>3: &nbsp;BUOYANCY</strong></p>
<p>The idea of self-regulating character has a tough 'get-over-it' tone.&nbsp; As a teacher and lecturer I never found such 'pull-yourself-together' talk doing much to help angry or panicky students.&nbsp; And, these days, there's plenty to be angry and panicky&nbsp;about. &nbsp;There are also ways of making&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">good use of bad news</a>, and that's part of what I'm calling&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">buoyancy</a> - staying afloat in turbulent conditions. &nbsp;It's learned in day-by-day encounters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf"><strong>professional thinking</strong></a>&nbsp;takes account of such encounters. &nbsp;Your colleagues will recognise them. &nbsp;But which do they think it worth strenthening as links?...</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;the most basic learning encounters are inter-personal...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->families facing tough times</strong> - for whom coping is a priority and who may prioritise a shared sense of what's right-and-proper</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->privileged families</strong> - whose wealth and contacts mean that they can expect success, protect these advantages and share them with chosen beneficiaries</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->neighbourhoods</strong> - where shared&nbsp;experience unites people, but when little is shared people become strangers to each other</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;locally-learned like-mindedness forms groups...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->gangs</strong> - where insiders display loyalty and allegiance, and outsiders are treated with hostility</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->devout</strong> - valuing what is thought of as spiritual and sometimes looking for religious obedience</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->associations</strong> - loosely organised clubs, societies and websites where people follow shared interests</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;institutions shape and frame resources for learning...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->organisations</strong> - with rules and roles like those of sport, clubs, cadets, leisure centres and scouts</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->schools and colleges</strong> - valued for what is examinable, but also for meeting your mates</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->businesses</strong> - where learning needs to be about customers, effort, costs and supply-and-demand</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->services&nbsp;</strong>- such, as careers and youth work, where people learn to deal with what's going on in neighbourhood and officialdom</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->officialdom</strong> - both nationally and locally shaping who gets access to what learning services and opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>Conventional thinking has developed&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hecsu.ac.uk/current_projects_graduate_market_trends.htm">a lot to say</a>&nbsp;iabout 'me-and-my-plan'. &nbsp;But wondering about which these locations are serving whose interests is a reforming conversation. &nbsp;Different locations, differently understood, make different sense of that.&nbsp; And&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf">community-interactive</a> talk signposts its possible breadth.&nbsp; While other evidence speaks of students&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30210514?SThisFB">learning from each other</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And so reform talk is shared, exploratory and releasing. &nbsp;It includes explaining to herself how she manages her life, or why his children are so precious, or how they feel about the invasion of change.&nbsp; And an employer at the civilised end of the commercial spectrum can recognise the value of that learning. &nbsp;So there can be plenty of hold-and-let&nbsp;reform talk. &nbsp;Conversation is buoyant when it lifts people, to where they can see how things are, and what needs changing, and where to make a start.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>education for a change</strong></p>
<p>Dealing with change can be thought to depend on character.&nbsp; Causes and effects then tidily fall into place: character comes from 'good' upbringing, and 'bad' upbringing causes failure. &nbsp;Research&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/psychological-perspectives-poverty">probes the thinking</a>,&nbsp;exposing it's self-serving unfairness. &nbsp;The poor are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/rethinking-unemployment-and-the-work-ethic-beyond-the-quasi-titmuss-paradigm-by-andrew-dunn/2017770.article">deprived</a>&nbsp;by an officialdom which chooses to see them as authors of their plight. &nbsp;While educators are vulnerable to attempted capture as <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=2017752">agents of control</a>. &nbsp;Snobbery is a prototype of such discrimination, laying blame where no blame belongs. &nbsp;The damage is at its greatest when provoking anger about who is worth holding onto and who can go and fuck themselves. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever those feelings are, that is an educator's starting point - the opening of a conversation.&nbsp; Educators need to hear talk of 'where we live', 'what it's like' and 'how we feel about it'. &nbsp;They also need to hear about 'who we know', 'how they are respected', and 'why they can be trusted'. &nbsp;So how do educators rate in this exchange? &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's worth asking what teacher-talk gets as much as a nod...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'learning gets you ready to claim your place in society'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'that means your work-life and citizenship'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'there's no hope in giving up on either'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not for you and not for anybody you care about'</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'a free society means people have the right to live by their beliefs'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;'but nobody has a right to impose their beliefs on you'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not the people who treat you badly'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not the people who are close to you'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>'we all need each other's help in finding how things can be better'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'not forgetting the past but not living in obedience to it'&nbsp;<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'you and your people can be bigger than that'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'learning how big you can be is what education is for'</em></p>
<p>Would they know what this teacher is talking about? &nbsp;Anything to say to each other? &nbsp;Worth setting down? &nbsp;Suppose they come up with another version - by making a movie, showing others and hatching a plan? &nbsp;So they are revisiting remembered experience, but attributing new meaning, and finding reformed purpose. &nbsp;That can become self-propelled hold-and-let. &nbsp;Then it's buoyancy.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>what's left of rights</strong></p>
<p>Not everybody sees education that way; and it really is vulnerable to <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">capture</a> by dominant interests.&nbsp; A much-canvassed interest in education is for employability. &nbsp;But employability is a moving target - not a cause of anything, but a wavering effect of recruitment rates. &nbsp;Nonetheless it's pushed by commerce, majorities and convention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's put to a test by the idea of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/RARDM2ETwdWn9euNSmdV/full#.VNC8R0Ik-JU">career image</a>&nbsp;- looking good to recruiters in...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'appearance' --- 'attractiveness' --- 'self-presentation'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call it the cosmetic curriculum. &nbsp;And the best career work in the world can't jig it to create jobs or improve conditions. &nbsp;What it can do is change the pecking order for available work.&nbsp; But that doesn't favour ability, it favours people&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/128348-sincerity---if-you-can-fake-that-you-ve-got-it">who can fake</a> it, because recruiters are <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jasp.12157/abstract">not hard to deceive</a>. &nbsp;Is this what convention means by employability: business assigning success to image? faces-that-don't-fit discarded? myth excluding reality?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are faces-that-don't-fit all over:&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/02/many-pupils-are-expelled-illegally-and-not-as-a-last-resort-charity-alleges">students who kick over tracers</a>, <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/comment/opinion/the-big-grants-the-big-papers-are-we-missing-something/2017894.article">independent researchers held back</a>,&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.socialsciencespace.com/2014/12/ref-an-idea-whose-time-never-came/">dissenting educators supressed</a>, <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/10/what-would-you-pay-to-be-happy">compliance commodified</a>,&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=11006155">the erosion of student rights</a>. &nbsp;At the same time the idea of <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/mkngtwork/cafimages.pdf">competitive employability</a>&nbsp;fails to understand work-life motivation.&nbsp; Workers in demanding jobs find <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0511.pdf">monetary rewards a disincentive</a>.&nbsp; They look for <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://deliveringhappiness.com/the-motivation-trifecta-autonomy-mastery-and-purpose">meaningful work satisfactions</a>,&nbsp;which - as it turns out - prove impossible to fake.</p>
<p>The cosmetic curriculum will collapse - it loses its edge when everybody learns to do it. &nbsp;It's a product of playground economics and will be displaced by a&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.neweconomics.org/blog/entry/labours-living-standards-index-does-it-go-far-enough?&utm_medium=email&utm_source=nefoundation&utm_content=3+-+Labours+living+standards+index++and+our+&utm_campaign=Feb-eletter-2015&source=Feb-eletter-2015">reliable account</a>&nbsp;of how things are. &nbsp;It has nothing to say about issues ranging from work-place well-being to planetary survival. &nbsp;&nbsp;But suppose it survives? &nbsp;You'll notice compliant workers, uniform in 'appearance, attractiveness and self-presentation'. &nbsp;While reforming independence-of-mind, creativity and critical thinking will have their unfit faces excluded. &nbsp;Try to imagine that.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p><strong>4: &nbsp;GRASP</strong></p>
<p>Dealing with the realities of career management calls for what I'm calling reach and grasp. &nbsp;I mentioned reach earlier - learning that helps here-and-now action. &nbsp;But reach needs grasp - carrying learning to some there-and-then action. &nbsp;Any hold-and-let process needs breadth in reach and strength in grasp. &nbsp;And in any collection of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30210514?SThisFB">education aims</a>&nbsp;that grasp is part of meta-learning - learning to learn. &nbsp;It is knowing what to do in who-knows-what futures. &nbsp;It is not learn-and-score now, it's learn-as-needed later. &nbsp;The more unexpected the later the greater the need for grasp. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's no quick-fix. &nbsp;Meta-learning's grasp is engaged stage-by-stage: from getting a sense of what's going on, through sifting that into useful order, onto focusing what matters, to getting an understanding of the causes-and-effects to be managed. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">career learning</a>&nbsp;research sets out how to practice the process so that it becomes second nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But most learning is forgotten - because it's disposable, out-of-date, not used or inconvenient. &nbsp;Meta-learning thrives when it reminds students of their lives so that their lives remind them of their learning. &nbsp;This learning is then transferred from where it's gained to where it's used. &nbsp;It's&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">learning for living</a>, it's&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf">infinitely reusable</a>, and it's ready for anything.</p>
<p>Enabling grasp is no pushover.&nbsp; Few are in a better position than <a href="https://www.tesdigital.com/magazine">educators to do it</a> (23/01/2015 pp. 26-29).&nbsp; But convention pushes them for prescribed performance, and meta-learning doesn't lead to ready-made prescriptions. &nbsp;Indeed, students - having learned hold-and-let processes - might let convention go.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>meta conversation</strong></p>
<p>So - with no ready-made answers, to unforeseen futures, in ready-for-anything flexibility -&nbsp;how can the conversation go? &nbsp;A conversationally-worded version of <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">career-learning</a> opens up some wondering...</p>
<p>in <strong>finding out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what's going on?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'am I being pushed?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'held back?'</em></p>
<p>in <strong>sorting out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'why does it matter?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'what can I be sure of?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'who's involved?'</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in <strong>checking out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'who and what is important?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'why?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'what can anybody say and do about this?'</em></p>
<p>in <strong>figuring out</strong>&nbsp;- wondering...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what will I say and do about it?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'with who and about what?'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'how will that work out?'<br /></em></p>
<p>There's no prescripted endpoint here. &nbsp;But that doesn't exclude evidence of outcomes. &nbsp;A feature of <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8844">creativity</a>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;unwillingness to allow the past to control the future. &nbsp;And some versions of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/01/long-term-thinking-investment-internet-age">resilience</a>&nbsp;thinking show how impatience damages the process. &nbsp;Similar losses are found in work-life where there is&nbsp;<a href="http://asq.sagepub.com/content/60/2/189.full">unresisted control</a>. &nbsp;And creativity is found to depend on the very ambiguity that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20159814?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">impatience represses</a>.&nbsp; In positive terms this means that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-organized-mind-by-daniel-j-levitin-1408137852">new thnking is enjoyable</a>.&nbsp; So, could joyousness be an <a href="http://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/2014/06/24/ctq_faridi_finland.html">outcome of education</a>? &nbsp;The question is worth asking because teachers are reported to find the curriculum '<a href="https://www.tesdigital.com/magazine">staggeringly dull</a>'&nbsp;(17/07/2015 pp. 6-7). &nbsp;I wonder whether Ofsted knows about this. &nbsp;Or whether a conversation about grasping uncertain futures with no prescribed anchorages calls for a greater breadth of mind.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>grouded help</strong></p>
<p>And having no ready-made endpoint does not consign grasp to a social vacuum. &nbsp;Meta-learning works in social settings - agency, church, museum and more. &nbsp;It is a grounded network where people apply grasp to life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf"><strong>professional thinking</strong></a> can here re-examine the help it offers as part of a range. &nbsp;But what most count are students' ideas about who in that range is worth calling on - or not...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;there are formal outfits claiming trained expertise...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->careers services </strong>- often what people first think of, but seriously under-resourced, providing information to identify work-life possibilities</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->careers education </strong>- delivered as 'lessons' in schools and colleges, though variable in materials and in designated staff</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->mainstream education</strong> - where educators get to know students over a prolonged period, including the few who can link learning to experience</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->colleges, apprenticeships and universities</strong> - offering opportunities to compete for improved life chances, and for adventures with new people</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;in some outfits the offer is supplementary to core commitments...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->churches, mosques, synagogues and temples</strong> - based on deeply-held and detailed principles, and sometimes more diffusely spiritual</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->community agencies</strong> - often with links to education and sometimes voluntary, with an understanding of local conditions and experience</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->libraries, museums, galleries and collections</strong> - where visitors gaze at what fascinates, look for more, find surprises and buy reminders</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&gt; &nbsp;some <strong>on-line outfits are&nbsp;</strong>professional, some fun, some irresponsible...&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->career websites</strong> - often careers-education-based and digitising its material, some of it interactively diagnostic</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->dedicated websites </strong>- setting out specific aspects of career experience, usually in narrative form and for interactive use</li>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->social media</strong> - on-line exchange of impressions and advice, including career concerns, which may be poorly informed</li>
</ul>
<p>Different sources are familiar to different people.&nbsp; But each is <a href="https://berarespectingchildren.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/bera-fair-equal-final.pdf">designed to help</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;formally or informally. &nbsp;Some do more harm than good. &nbsp;Some are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/jul/23/museums-should-charge-entrance-fees">under threat</a>. &nbsp;So students need to be savvy in their use.</p>
<p>This is not comfort-zone stuff. &nbsp;Nothing moves until students find help worth holding onto or contacts needing to be let go. &nbsp;And that's&nbsp;troublesome, because it turns things on their head - whatever information, advice and guidance there may be is conceived by students and offered to helpers.&nbsp; This is not convention: meta-learning enables students in a life-long grasp of agency - and that agency can be for reform. &nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p><strong>5: &nbsp;DIRECTION</strong></p>
<p>Change is not what it used to be. &nbsp;Once upon a time humanity learned to live with change brought about by such innovations as migration,&nbsp;cities, telescopes, print and industry. &nbsp;Each brings crisis, and we deal with it by seeing things differently - and doing accordingly. &nbsp;But that <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->was</em> change-after-change, this <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->is</em> change-upon-change. &nbsp;Today's crises simultaneously ride on massive increases in commercial leverage, dizzying technological advance, and constantly repositioning cultures. &nbsp;It's been called a '<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/03/britain-economic-crisis-public">crisis like no other</a>'. &nbsp;Sociology characterises it as <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/cafculture.pdf">liquid modernity</a>&nbsp;- the imagery is of evidence drowned by celebrity, reflection sinking in impatience, and producing a pathetic splash compared with consuming. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The imagery of clinging on was never more apposite. &nbsp;It's true that we&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094">mostly learn from failure</a>, and that now means learning to stay afloat in the backwash of change. &nbsp;Careers work cannot, so to speak, duck this. &nbsp;And in the resulting conversation convention will find few twentieth-century answers to twenty-first-century questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>finding chaos</strong></p>
<p>There's no shortage of career conversations - lots of talk. &nbsp;Conventional wisdom positions walking-the-walk ahead of talking-the-talk. &nbsp;It's wrong - we need the talk to signpost the walk. &nbsp;So what might students find worth talking about? &nbsp;Careers work has a good lead on this; looking for student's signposts by inviting them to talk about...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'...songs, movies and stories - I'll never forget'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...memories - that bother me'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...dreams - that keep coming back'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>'...experiences - that surprise and excite me'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...what somebody said - that makes me think again'<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...surprises - I find hard to forget'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Until such talk been heeded the conversation has no starting point.&nbsp; Listening to <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/JVB Feb 11 YJVBE2475.pdf">what is going on in a life</a> belongs to thoughtful careers work.&nbsp; But not to all of it - and there is some jostling for position. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/07/eyond-mindfulness-horse-riding-eating-greens-walk-depression-anxiety-cbt">Cognitive behaviour therapy</a> and its variations pursue one-off mind control rather than enduring understanding. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/NICECCoach.pdf">Career coaching</a>&nbsp;speaks only of individuals and winning.&nbsp; <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000187910900058X">Psychological constructs</a>&nbsp;use expert insights to shape individual memories. &nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://careersintheory.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/applied-chaos/">Chaos theory</a>&nbsp;is a newcomer, boldly taking on change, but bolstering practice in an alliance with psychological constructivism. &nbsp;The publication of that chaos-alliance has been welcomed as&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H6NP9v6KNVIC&pg=PR2&lpg=PR2&dq=savikas+chaos+the+theory+we've+been+waiting+for&source=bl&ots=_CXIerGtix&sig=YSo7qFAnL9hFqqXs7zVHMT2MWyk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GzsRVfzqJ5OP7AbohoCYCA&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=savikas chaos the theory we've been waiting for&f=false">'the book we've all been waiting for'</a>. &nbsp;Not by me.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>managing chaos</strong></p>
<p>When psychologists run out of things to say about career they'd do better turning to sociology than to chaos theory.&nbsp; Physics increasingly sees <a href="http://gu.com/p/49mht">chaos theory as a fad</a>. &nbsp;And, anyway, the unpredictable is not necessarily chaotic and feeling chaotic is not the same as being chaotic. &nbsp;But the chaos-alliance plot-line wins converts - chaos feels like hell and psychological constructs look like salvation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But it ain't necessarily so. &nbsp;There's no case for upgrading chaotic feelings to chaos theory. &nbsp;The alliance is right to acknowledge chaotic feelings.&nbsp; But the narrative needs more than psychological constructs offer.&nbsp; A <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">convincing narrative</a> speaks of both individual and shared experience. &nbsp;Chaotic feelings stem from a spectrum of the who-what-how-when-and-why of what's going on. &nbsp;And there are people in there, doing their thing. &nbsp;So both psychological and social constructs must feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But social constructs can't count on a good press - identity politics don't like them.&nbsp; Anyone defending the rights of gender, race and sexuality see social influences as <a href="http://oakes.ucsc.edu/academics/Core Course/oakes-core-awards-2012/laura-flores.html">entrapment</a>. &nbsp;Actually the evidence is better balanced -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf">socially acquired beliefs</a> are not bound to mislead, and <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/careerlearning.html">individually held beliefs</a> are not bound to be reliable. &nbsp;Emerging&nbsp;evidence shows how we need to be clearer about race and <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1111/hequ.12074?r3_referer=wol&tracking_action=preview_click&show_checkout=1&purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED">class interaction</a>. &nbsp;Some&nbsp;dangerously&nbsp;dare to confront the confusion of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://vimeo.com/79811169">race and class</a>. &nbsp;Too dangerously? &nbsp;Worth talking about? &nbsp;Because any conversation coming out of this spectrum must face the pushes and pulls of all its dynamics. &nbsp;</p>
<p>None of this can bring a halt to change-upon-change or dissolve chaotic feelings. &nbsp;But it can release the depth and breadth of an independently-minded, critically-thinking and creatively-engaged humanity. &nbsp;And that will call on both psychological and <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://thegreatrefusal.wordpress.com/2008/06/05/bourdieu-deviance-from-constructionism/">social constructs</a>. &nbsp;The conversation then becomes less about experts developing career, and more about&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUW8V7Jupns&feature=youtu.be">students managing career</a>.&nbsp; The insights that count speak of the feelings they start from, the hope they look for, and the purposes they find.&nbsp; Their management of these let-go-hold-on processes transforms entrapment into release. &nbsp;Students become their own life-enhancing&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www2.mmu.ac.uk/mcys/">researchers</a>&nbsp;- as well as&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://news.tes.co.uk/b/news/2015/02/17/martin-sheen-tells-pupils-to-walk-with-him-to-social-activism.aspx">agents of change</a>.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p align="center"><strong>space and credibility</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is no hit-and-run agenda. &nbsp;It expands the reach and grasp&nbsp;of career learning. &nbsp;It confronts chaotic feelings, bad news and deception. &nbsp;It enables the transforming use of all such confusion. &nbsp;It releases independent, creative and critical thinking into a change-upon-changing world.&nbsp; And it processes a troublesome but necessary hold-and-let process. &nbsp;It overtakes convention and engages reform.</p>
<p>This is learning that can only be acquired <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">stage-by-stage</a>.&nbsp; Students trial methods, gaining a tangible sense for what needs to be done.&nbsp; Real-time practice connects learning to living.&nbsp; Rehearsed tactics gather feedback to sharpen ready-for-anything flexibility. &nbsp;These are heavy-duty demands on educators, who need to be in position to design programmes and make them happen.&nbsp; It means establishing credibility with colleagues and students, and alertness to the significance of students claiming their rights and finding fulfillment.&nbsp; Not every teacher is like that.&nbsp; But this work doesn't need a recruited many, it's looking for a committed few - with their expanding repertoire for action.</p>
<p>This reform is widely applicable. &nbsp;The hold-and-let process may be most engaged by the <a href="http://shop.niace.org.uk">decade-upon-decade experience</a> of older people.&nbsp; And it is particularly applicable to people for whom&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/cafBuonfino.pdf">blame-upon-blame</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2195">squeezed out all ambition</a>. &nbsp;But we must fully round out the range of applications. &nbsp;And that means calling on the future altruism of the self-excluding, whose past engineering has given them&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/31/inheritance-britain-wealthy-study-surnames-social-mobility">minority advantage at majority expense</a>. &nbsp;I think that would count as reform.</p>
<p>This work needs more time and space than convention, from&nbsp;its marginal position, has been able to find. &nbsp;It needs the&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8844">knowledge, commitment and credibility</a> that can only come from mainstream <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/moving on/cafcurriculum.pdf">curriculum</a>.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>sensibility and sense</strong></p>
<p>It's no doddle - this kind of bothersome thinking is best&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">set out as narrative</a>. &nbsp;And educators can find any number of images.&nbsp; The well-written ones intrigue: like the&nbsp;<a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2015/03/cinderella-—-disney’s-newest-“ella”-both-courageous-and-kind">pretty as courageous</a>; the victim who&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392170/">changes everything</a>;&nbsp;bad news as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/24/migrants-leave-home-future-past-borders">loss and gain</a>; entrapment that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.psychotherapy.com.au/fileadmin/site_files/pdfs/TheDoubleBindTheory.pdf">brings release</a>. &nbsp;These are stories that rise above clich&eacute; and engage year-on-year questioning. &nbsp;They belong to a curriculum for reformed careers education. &nbsp;But where in curriculum?&nbsp; Conventional thinking looks for links with science, technology engineering and maths (STEM).&nbsp; But narrative thinking links to&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/cafbiog.pdf">history and literature</a> - history for its cultural perspectives, literature for its personal proximities, both asking...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'...what sense are these people making of their lives?'</em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;<br /></em><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->'...what sense am I making of these people?'</em></p>
<p>Few storytellers better pose such questions than the creator of <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/sense-and-sensibility/">Elinor Dashwood</a>. &nbsp;Her narratives recount cultural and personal sensibilities - telling of a culture that can't let go of gentility, and a gentility that can't take hold of opportunity.&nbsp; For Elinor hope needs unforeseen chance to realise a longed-for-life. &nbsp;The story still works because, in both yesterday's and today's <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">cultural enclaves</a>, there are hold-and-let entanglements. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My early-life theological training drew heavily on history and literature. &nbsp;It persuades me that these two disciplines&nbsp;might be where light is most usefully thrown on what can be learned from religion - and what can't. &nbsp;In all events, history and literature is where curriculum pushes at conventional boundaries, welcomes surprises and risks offence. &nbsp;It's where well-written accounts illuminate experience. &nbsp;And if, for some, it points to STEM then that will be a more reiable signpost - not bowled over by persuasion but realised by discovery.</p>
<p align="center">___________________________&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>which way forward</strong></p>
<p>The chances of <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf">survival</a> rest on two make-or-break questions.&nbsp; From a long-ago savanna to a barely-recognisable high-street people need to know...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'what's going on?' ... </em>and&nbsp;<em>... 'what can anybody do about it?'</em></p>
<p>Survival is more likely when causes are identified earlier, so that effects can be based on them later. &nbsp;This is horse-and-cart thinking. - things work out better that way round. &nbsp;But not everybody sees things that way round.&nbsp; People who <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/18/daniel-kahneman-books-interview">think they already know</a> what to do harness their horses to jump the causes and gallop in pursuit of effects. &nbsp;The trouble is that it's the causes that are present realities; the effects are&nbsp;merely future constructs.&nbsp; Any other talk is evasion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And evasion need to be managed - which, the evidence shows, entails <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9094">maneuvering</a>.&nbsp; That evidence is of obfuscating facts, capturing support and - if all else fails - telling lies. &nbsp;Part of it recounts devious <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/cafetzioni.docx">economics-politics collusion</a>. &nbsp;Conventional thinking has found <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8875">no way out</a>&nbsp;of the mess. &nbsp;Its allies in commerce and politics trot out answers to questions they've never bothered to ask. &nbsp;This is obstructive and needs to be let go.</p>
<p>Establishments position their influential windows over decades - in the UK the 80's saw a massive and sustained re-alignment of priorities. &nbsp;But there is no correct alignment. &nbsp;The window outlines the sort of society that the politics needs the electorate to favour. &nbsp;This is not rectitude, it's&nbsp;maneuvering.</p>
<p>Reform looks elsewhere - among agencies which are neither politics nor commerce but&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf">civil society</a>. &nbsp;Those interests are best represented by locally-rooted and in-touch <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf">stakeholders</a>. &nbsp;And contemporary stakeholders speak of&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/mkngtwork/caffrmwrk.pdf">changing expectations</a>&nbsp;concerning what can and should happen. &nbsp;People are learning to see things differently, triggering new <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf">ways of managing change</a>. &nbsp;And in contemporary change-conditions - needing ready-for-anything flexibility - independence-of mind, critical-thinking and creativity are essential to reform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The argument is an extension of decade-by-decade thought-and-action. &nbsp;A version begins with <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/CPIpdfs/cafcpiz.pdf">matching</a> people to destinations. &nbsp;Its listing of information allows the assignment of an individual to what is judged suitable work.&nbsp; But, early on, thinking acknowledges the dynamics of social groups engaged in <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafcit.pdf">community-interaction</a>.&nbsp; And that calls for an understanding of how social links, set up in families and neighbourhoods, feature in what people do. &nbsp;That thinking then calls for an understanding which can deal with growing complexities, triggering <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnoriginal.pdf">learning theory</a>&nbsp;as a progressive thought-and-feeling process.&nbsp; It enables people for self-propelled career management in finding and negotiating fulfillment in life. &nbsp;But both community interaction and learning theory are most convincingly expressed in <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbnarrative.pdf">narrative</a> terms. &nbsp;People find more sense in recounted stories than in collated lists. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Research-and-development is unstoppable. &nbsp;So we should not be surprised to find a process for interrogated what, in all this, is worth holding onto and what must be let go. &nbsp;Reform is an assembly of thought-and-action in support of ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; And that calls for more than a single test of validity. &nbsp;But, whatever the test, it can only be administered by stakeholders. &nbsp;It's a local call, because the curriculum is community property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thinking poses two supplementary questions concerning community realities and possibilities...</p>
<p align="center"><em>'...what works for how things are?...'<br /></em><em>'...and what does not?'</em></p>
<p>They are hold-on-or-letting-go questions.</p>

<p>What I say here draws on learning from my students.&nbsp; They give us moments we can't forget.&nbsp; I taught sociology in all-through state comprehensives, during the 60's. &nbsp;(I could be Michael Gove's worst nightmare.)&nbsp;</p>

This goes beyond the usual gibberish and explore practical Financial Modeling as used by Investment Bankers and Research Analysts. In this Free Online Financial Modeling Training Course, I will take an example of Colgate Palmolive and will prepare a full integrated financial model from scratch.Financial modeling is the task of building an abstract representation (a model) of a real world financial situation. This is a mathematical model designed to represent (a simplified version of) the performance of a financial asset or portfolio of a business, project, or any other investment. Financial modeling is a general term that means different things to different users; the reference usually relates either to accounting and corporate finance applications, or to quantitative finance applications.In simple terms, financial modeling means forecasting the future of the company or an asset by way of an Excel Model that is easy to understand and perform scenario analysis.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9155</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9155</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="mailto:fj.meijers@xmsnet.nl">Dr Frans Meijers - editor</a><br /> <a href="mailto:deirdre.hughes3@btinternet.com">Dr Deidre Hughes - editor</a><br /> <a href="mailto:bill@hihohiho.com">Dr Bill Law - consultant</a></p>
<p>A changing world brings change in the way people manage their careers.&nbsp; What that means for people's lives and for professional responses needs to be thoroughly understood.&nbsp; The British Journal of Guidance and Counselling has therefore commissioned an editorial team, listed above, to develop a special issue examining why change is occurring and how it is being managed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->the challenge</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The 21<sup>st</sup> century society is a &lsquo;risk society&rsquo;. &nbsp;Surviving and thriving means managing lives proactively. &nbsp;People are enabled to develop career narratives which articulate their life experience. &nbsp;And, in this process, the development of critical thinking is increasingly important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In uncertain times students need to find explanations concerning both their inner lives and the social and cultural world they live in.&nbsp; This is especially important for people who do not readily find opportunities that reflect their needs, wishes and abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this means that up-to-date guidance and counselling cannot be separated from overall educational reform. &nbsp;But we must face a critical tension between progressive and regressive tendencies - in both education and careers work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The journal's special issue will, therefore, examine innovative solutions originating in both careers work and education. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->the possibilities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The editorial team has a particular interest in academic articles setting out thought and action concerning...</p>
<ol>
<li>...students learning critical thinking and developing a career narrative</li>
<li>...learning cultures managing the troublesome emotions evoked by significant learning</li>
<li>...career workers attending to students' feeding-back their experience and harmonising that with a feeding-forward need for systemic change</li>
<li>...educators dealing with the conflicts between demands for recordable outcomes and the importance of transferable processes</li>
<li>...programme managers considering the values of outsourcing for resources and the marketisation of products</li>
<li>...leadership styles emerging for careers-work programmes run by individual career workers, or in shared responsibilities or in emerging collectives</li>
</ol>
<p>Six examples can only indicate the possible range and scope of thinking. This is not an exhaustive list of topics.&nbsp; The development of 21<sup>st</sup> century careers work and education calls for deeper and wider thinking and action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->your response</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The editorial team is looking forward to receive proposals for articles from you and your colleagues.&nbsp; They should be sent to</p>

              <title>career-learning café update - January 2015</title>

<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Careers work inhabits a world of accelerating change, carrying unforeseen risks, and provoking radical responses in overwhelmed locations.&nbsp; It's hardly surprising that whatever careers work does somebody finds something wrong with it - the practicalities of careers work are contested.&nbsp; Meanwhile the challenge for students and clients is be ready-for-anything.&nbsp; Careers work is confronted with the need somehow to reconcile all this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not easy.&nbsp; An understandable reaction is to wonder why the career-learning caf&eacute; makes things so complicated.&nbsp; The following five paragraphs explain why.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center">careers work needs your say about this&nbsp;<br /><br />sign up on the right and blog at the foot of the page</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><br />change</strong></p>
<p>What is going on now has effects at least as far-reaching as what was seen through the first telescope, or found in the first printed book, or experienced in the first urban factories.&nbsp; And the causes and consequences of such changes stretch from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; At each stage we can have little idea what results to expect, but we can know that nothing will be the same again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviews below ask whether careers work can survive contemporary change by doing the same again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>risk</strong></p>
<p>Contemporary change is multi-layered, mounting all its challenges at the same time.&nbsp; Commerce is more demanding, it's technologies pervade how we all live, and the cultures they nurture are deferential to neither &eacute;lite or expertise.&nbsp; All of this poses risks for careers-work credibility.&nbsp; Policy, commerce, media and anecdote throng with ready-made demands of careers-work practice, throwing it into continuous dispute. &nbsp;The causes of all this are multi-layered and their consequences seem to be irreversible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviews ask whether the risks pose existential threats to careers work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>response</strong></p>
<p>Long ago careers work gets started by concentrating on a self hopefully searching work categories for opportunities that match hopes.&nbsp; Early on just how much choice is available to that self is in doubt.&nbsp; And, soon after, the thinking acknowledges how the attachments and loyalties of social background figure in what the self does about career.&nbsp; As the navigation of that complexity and accelerating change become more demanding careers work looks to stage-by-stage learning - enabling the self to make useful sense of confusing, chaotic, and misleading experience.&nbsp; The growing need to respond to points-of-view in a social world means that recounting narrated sequences works better than scanning ready-made categories.&nbsp; It also accords with neurological findings which show how multi-layered learning so entwines feelings-and-thoughts to make a self capable of fruitful self contradiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;reviews ask how readily careers work is responding to this continuing expansion of the idea of self.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>location</strong></p>
<p>A 'self' may be understood psychologically, economically and neurologically; but a career-managing self must also be understood as socially situated.&nbsp; Work is done with and for other people. &nbsp;Careers work is adept at understanding career management in its national and global contexts.&nbsp; But causes-and-effects in village, neighbourhood and network need to be understood in these particular social-and-cultural locations - where self-awareness is infused with an awareness of other people.&nbsp; Whether in postcode, url or appointments diary, these contacts are experienced as close-up encounters with people who are readily recognisable, understood, valued - and, therefore, trusted. &nbsp;That experience is invested in locations called 'social enclaves' which frame and shape what people do - including what they do about work-life. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviews point to enclaves ranging from what people might claim is 'our-cosmopolitan-set' to what people might feel is 'our-side-of-the-street'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>practicality</strong></p>
<p>Concerns for practicality appear to ask 'how well does it work?'.&nbsp; But where different enclaves attribute different meanings to different experience the question becomes 'who does it work for?'.&nbsp; And that is a question of ownership not efficiency - practice must belong to the people it serves.&nbsp; There is a wide range of expectations for what benefit careers work should bring.&nbsp; The spectrum of claimants ranges from shareholders to stakeholders. &nbsp;And the way their influences are levered is meant to determine the direction that practice takes - and sometimes it does.&nbsp; Whether voiced on behalf of nation or families there are underlying oppositions between shareholder and stakeholder voices.&nbsp; The former claim most to value economic success, competitive achievement and libertarian freedom.&nbsp; The latter claim most to value personal-and-social fulfilment, fair access to opportunity and critical independence.&nbsp; Each different position takes a different interest in what voices are heeded, what research is commissioned and therefore what practice is favoured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviews show what practice works for stakeholders - and what does not.</p>
<p>They follow below, each updating caf&eacute; material on one or more of the five challenges to contemporary careers work.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.wallstreetmojo.com/free-financial-modeling-training-course/">Financial modeling</a> is the task of building an abstract representation (a model) of a real world financial situation. This is a mathematical model designed to represent (a simplified version of) the performance of a financial asset or portfolio of a business, project, or any other investment. Financial modeling is a general term that means different things to different users; the reference usually relates either to accounting and corporate finance applications, or to quantitative finance applications.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Career learning is how clients and students take on their own career management.&nbsp; The career-learning caf&eacute; is a place where their helpers take on the issues.&nbsp; And that work needs to be independent of professional and careers-service interests. &nbsp;It also needs to stand aside from political and commercial influences.&nbsp; So the caf&eacute; has no sponsors.&nbsp; It carries no advertising.&nbsp; It welcomes debate. &nbsp;And, as events unfold, it changes its thinking.&nbsp; You are invited to take part in that process.</p>
<p>This blog sets out the most recent contributions to that process.&nbsp; You can get the preceding account <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/CafCLN17.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp; But, now, both education in general and careers work in particular need to go into how technological and cultural change is raising urgent issues for voice, interests and hope.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;policy&nbsp;issues. &nbsp;The account probes the political causes of career-management effects.&nbsp; It finds that big data and sociology are at odds on that.&nbsp; It shows why the future of career needs re-envisaging. &nbsp;And it probes what, in all this, yesterday's theory has to do with tomorrow's practice.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic defenders of careers-work may not like it.&nbsp; But that's a good reason for studying it.&nbsp; A thinker's best friends are opponents, because not facing what goes wrong is a highway to failure.&nbsp; And all aspects of public-service education are facing that possibility.&nbsp; This is a sequence of signposts to new ways forward.</p>

<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->new questions demand new answers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There's no shortage of reports urging the recovery of public-sector careers-work.&nbsp; The arguments are strong, but contemporary politics is not listening.&nbsp; It is the politics of individual responsibility, for achieving economic gain, by participating in a market place. &nbsp;It seeks private-sector solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a backstory.&nbsp; The global commercial-and-political consensus entertains the possibility of unfettered economic growth.&nbsp; The damaging consequences range from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; Policy characterises such damage as 'creative destruction'.&nbsp; The caf&eacute;'s evidence is that valued and viable small businesses are lost, citizenship and worker rights are undermined, careers and social services are captured, the compliant are rewarded, the critical are dismissed, and society fragments.&nbsp; It is private-sector interests that are served.&nbsp; And the trend is accelerating.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8484">education and policy - changing attitudes</a></strong><br />This is a detailed run-down on why public-sector careers-work is in such a fix.&nbsp; The article examines the interests influencing policy, the appeal to simple-mindedness, the confusion of reality with myth, the fragmentation of society, and the recognition of who is most at risk.&nbsp; It also suggests how fear can be transformed into hope. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8466">what education gets from politics</a></strong><br /> The article examines what policy does and what it fails to do for learning services.&nbsp; It separates stakeholder from shareholder interests, and it explains why it is stakeholder voice that careers work should heed.&nbsp; It wonders why so much of career talk is metaphorical, and how the images shape perceptions.&nbsp; It uses these insights to show how stakeholder interest are voiced.&nbsp; It describes how student voice is central.&nbsp; It shows how educator voice connects to students.&nbsp; And it sets out how community voice can be activated with or without policy support.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8226"><strong>is careers work distinct or extinct?</strong><br /> </a>This is a short introductory article linked to a monograph examining how public-sector careers work can thrive alongside a global multi-billion-dollar private-sector career-coaching industry.&nbsp; The article begins by facing up to the bad news - diagnosing the threat of extinction.&nbsp; It moves on to examine how careers work can make a new start.&nbsp; It points to careers-work thinking, which careers coaching has done little more than cherry-pick.&nbsp; And that gives careers work an opportunity to start again - from scratch.&nbsp; It has done it before, it can do it again.&nbsp; The article points to the opportunity to re-imagine an altogether more inclusive, substantial and distinctive service.&nbsp; It is needed to enable people to manage the precarious work-life that is becoming the norm - people ready for anything in what is partially a foreseeable and but increasingly an unforeseeable future.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">change in politics and education</a> </strong><br /> A careers work whose leadership fails to engage with change cannot survive.&nbsp; This monograph goes into detail on the realities of change.&nbsp; And it sees a way forward in a strategic repositioning of careers work in its communities.&nbsp; In particular it shows how local stakeholder interests can outflank shareholder interests.&nbsp; It examines the ways in which student-educator-community conversations can outshine any hokum.&nbsp; And it sets out how authentically credible voice will attract more constructive attention than merely plausible ploys.&nbsp; The argument is that such a re-negotiated way of working with students and clients in their communities will forge a more sustainable grounding for help.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">which way is forward for students their educators and the business-world?</a></strong><br /> Is there a business-world attempt to capture the careers-work curriculum? &nbsp;If there were, then no educator could afford to ignore it.&nbsp; This article faces the possibility, documenting how such attempts work, and pointing to the unresolvable conflicts that result.&nbsp; It cites and links to examples.&nbsp; And it documents how a prominent careers-work think-tank failed to recognise the danger.&nbsp; But the article also finds a stronger basis for partnerships between students, educators, and employers.&nbsp; And that means setting the partnership in a social-world.&nbsp; It reports how business interests are acknowledging that need.&nbsp; There are no heroes or villains here, just causes worth identifying and effects to be dealt with.&nbsp; One of the most telling conclusions is that genuine partnerships work best, not with 'how-to-do!' prescriptions, but with 'what-went-wrong?' diagnoses.</p>

<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->enclaves and cities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Collections of statistics which can analyse and order wide-ranging findings are called 'big data'.&nbsp; They are commonly used to track national trends used to influence governments.&nbsp; Among their uses is the backing they give to complaints that access to services is a post-code lottery. &nbsp;And in a sense it is.&nbsp; But such massive generalisations need to assume that what applies anywhere applies everywhere.&nbsp; And, in another sense, it doesn't.</p>
<p>There are realities that big data fails to find.&nbsp; They can only be detected up-close.&nbsp; Sociological observations find that what is welcomed in one neighbourhood falls flat in another. &nbsp;Where that is so there is no 'best practice', there is what local people recognise as relevant, useful and possible where they live.&nbsp; What serves some neighbourhoods harms others.&nbsp; These are post-code realities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sociological term for such realities is 'enclaves'.&nbsp; An enclave is where what the people believe, value and expect belongs to that location, and need not belong to any other. &nbsp;Inside the enclave understanding is shaped by that experience.&nbsp; Outside it is misunderstood.&nbsp; This is not economics, it's culture.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafspaceandplace.pdf">enclaves and voice</a></strong><br /> This monograph examines how geography influences life chances. &nbsp;It is because what people mean by winning respect, or gaining self confidence, or experiencing freedom are understood differently in different locations.&nbsp; Each location frames its own memories, expectations &amp; voice.&nbsp; And each has its own way of realising a stake in society.&nbsp; And of not realising such a stake.&nbsp; The monograph sets this thinking in relation to an extensive range of careers-work sociology.&nbsp; And it uses that mapping as a platform for suggesting research and development which must be made to work locally.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8787">while nations fail and cities liberate it's shock that sets the agenda </a></strong><br /> The article examines a new perspective on the importance of locality.&nbsp; It reviews fast-emerging thinking on the potential dynamism of city-grounded reform.&nbsp; It looks at the differences between how nations and cities develop policies.&nbsp; It cites evidence on why nations so frequently fail and cities increasingly succeed.&nbsp; It shows how any careers-work leadership needs better to understand what's going on.&nbsp; The article probes what politicians do, why they disappoint, and how to test them for trustworthiness.&nbsp; It also shows why raising aspirations is the most demanding test for any education policy.&nbsp; But this means being open to the arresting meanings found in the resulting narratives.&nbsp; And it is that shock that opens minds to needed change.&nbsp; The article unfolds a dynamic radicalism which can carry education reform farther and faster.&nbsp; But it needs city specificity rather than national generality.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->theory for practice</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Careers theory is an applied not a pure discipline. &nbsp;Its ideas are, at best, second-hand - imported from original sources, largely in economics and psychology.&nbsp; Early-days UK thinking drew on a handful of US adaptations of such basic research.&nbsp; If UK careers work has a distinctive position it is because it reaches beyond psychological characteristics linked to economic possibilities.&nbsp; The UK account develops an understanding of career management as grounded in economic, social and cultural conditions.&nbsp; This is a distinctively wide-ranging explanation of what people do about work.</p>
<p>Any theory is conventionally validated by the reliability of its research.&nbsp; There is an array of methodological validity tests.&nbsp; But the only test that matters asks whether the reported causes have the predicted effects.&nbsp; And that is not found on library desktops, it is found in immediate observations.&nbsp; The grounded understanding of how and why things work is called catalytic validity.</p>
<p>The importance of the test is heightened where what is found is found on-line.&nbsp; Careers workers have attempted a colonisation of the net by exporting their ready-made theory-based techniques.&nbsp; The more impressive and more worrying career sites are unhampered by any attempt at theoretical justification.</p>
<p>Careers work makes itself most useful by closing all these gaps between thinking about causes and acting on effects.&nbsp; It means never talking about research without saying something about development.&nbsp; The unified concept of research-and-development makes educators and researchers mutually-dependent partners.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497">what educators can do</a></strong><br /> The caf&eacute;'s use of the unified term 'careers work' replaces the divided term 'careers education' and 'guidance'.&nbsp; The unified term undermines the possibility of making either activity ancillary to the other.&nbsp; And could there be some residual clinging to the idea that it is guidance that holds the core careers-work expertise?&nbsp; Such a belief would locate a teaching staff's command of learning disciplines as lesser than a person's hold on a limited application.&nbsp; This article argues that contemporary conditions demand the breadth and depth of both the disciplines and the application.&nbsp; It does that by signposting the untapped relevance to students' lives of so-called 'academic' knowledge.&nbsp; This account of what educators can do identifies and links to sources on how curriculum can enable students to navigate their path through a fulfilling work-life.&nbsp; It rebalances the relationship between curriculum and guidance.&nbsp; And, while the article acknowledges that not all teachers are up to shaping curriculum to such purposes, it also shows that some are ready - and that careers work only needs some.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/NICECHit&Myth.pdf">on-line careers work as hit &amp; myth</a> </strong><br /> This fully-references journal article examines what on-line careers work does well, the 'hits', and how some sites mislead and damage life chances, with 'myths'.&nbsp; It shows how educators are well placed to enable students to deal with on-line sources.&nbsp; There are three key concepts: helping students to &lsquo;grasp&rsquo; understanding, which means enabling critical thinking; while extending student's &lsquo;reach&rsquo; means enabling students to transfer on-line finds into off-line life; and &lsquo;embodiment&rsquo; means the direct-and-personal contact needed to incorporate on-line learning into off-line identity.&nbsp; The article sets out a partnership between what can only be offered through face-to-face guidance and what can only be delivered through stage-by-stage curriculum.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6571">careers education in schools</a></strong><br /> A review, linked to its source, of one of the most influential publications on careers education.&nbsp; Written by David Andrews it sets out a past, present &amp; future for careers education in schools.&nbsp; His key distinction is seminal - it is between learning about something and learning for something.&nbsp; On the one hand students can &lsquo;learn about careers and work', on the other they can  &lsquo;learn for careers and work&rsquo;.&nbsp; The distinction deserves close attention.&nbsp; It opens possibilities for education, showing that it is about more than competing for up-coming placement, but can also explore unforeseen possibilities.&nbsp; David Andrews puts a finger on what kind of mutually-respecting partnership there can be between guidance and curriculum.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8509">what's the use of impartiality?</a></strong><br /> The article wonders whether careers work's claim to impartiality are credible.&nbsp; It finds an impressive definition in Canada: impartiality acts &lsquo;without fear, without favour and without affection&rsquo;.&nbsp; The article wonders if any Canadian or Brit can sustain the belief that careers work has been so unshakably impressive.&nbsp; It also suggests that it might not matter, because it finds, documents and links to a bigger and more independent education professionalism.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUW8V7Jupns&feature=youtu.be">theory and practice</a></strong><br /> This video shows me under interrogation concerning what a century of&nbsp;careers-work&nbsp;thinking has done for careers-work&nbsp;practice.&nbsp; My interrogator is pushy on whether the thinking is for description or for prescription. &nbsp;I'm also asked what is a theory anyway? &nbsp;I have a go at explaining why theories change.&nbsp; And I try to say why the difference between a professional's work on career-development needs to be distinguished from student's action in career-management.&nbsp; The interrogator allows me to track thinking, from career matching, into community interaction, and onto learning theory and critical thinking.&nbsp; When asked 'what next?' I say why I think it's the careers-work's uses of narrative.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6540"><strong>why we need a career-learning theory  and now?</strong><br /></a>The text of a lecture, with links to its sources, sets out operational steps to enabling learning-to-learn, as part of a programme of life-relevant learning.&nbsp; It probes what the theories say.&nbsp; It locates learning theory in the mel&eacute;e of career thinking.&nbsp; It acknowledges that the disturbances of critical thinking may be counter cultural.&nbsp; But It also illustrates how critical thinking is necessary to any conversation about working life.&nbsp; And it shows how that kind of conversation equips a student for control in the navigation of a path through working life.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6973">narrative as a critical voice of experience in contemporary career management</a></strong><br /> The text of this fully-referenced and linked lecture identifies the uses of narrative in commerce and in politics.&nbsp; It argues for the various ways in which careers work can also draw on the dynamics of narrative.&nbsp; It uses 'storyboarding', a technique with a wide range of applications, as an example.&nbsp; The thinking hinges on a distinction between analysis and narrative.&nbsp; The former appears to draw on scientific expertise, the latter is a natural human approach to understanding.&nbsp; There are issues concerning reliability and practicality to resolve.&nbsp; But that resolution is handed to community stakeholders and their partners in education, rather than to remote theorists or political interests or commercial shareholders.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/7681">the uses of narrative</a></strong><br /> The article sets out the material used in a research-and-development workshop on the uses of narrative.&nbsp; It examines how displaying careers-workers' expertise needs to be balanced by engaging the authority of clients' and students' experience.&nbsp; What careers workers know is modified by what students know, and narrative is the medium for recognising that reality.&nbsp; There is a link to the presentation used at the workshop as well as to the monograph which underpins the work.&nbsp; The workshop invites educators into partnerships with careers workers.&nbsp; It encourages the different members to group and regroup in their search for an approach to using narrative which promises to be useful to their work.&nbsp; They look for how they can shape these uses so that they best engage student learning.&nbsp; The assumption is that no one way of doing this will be found - indeed more than one way must be found. &nbsp;All of the issues and findings are documented and subsequently made available to the whole group.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.cegnet.co.uk/blog/peter-daws">trail-blazing thinking for UK careers work</a></strong><br /> An educator who changed the direction of my life was Peter Daws; he died this year. &nbsp;But it was Peter who laid the foundations for a distinctive UK careers work. &nbsp;Nonetheless, Peter was no out-and-out defender of careers-work institutions. &nbsp;Long ago he wrote an article on its iatrogenic effects.&nbsp; He argued that enthusiasts need to consider the possibility that careers work can harm as well as help.&nbsp; The task is not to defend what it actually done but to figure out what needs to be done - and that makes the ideas, not the institutions, the priority.&nbsp; Ideas and institutions are not the same thing.</p>
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A recurring distinction here is the Career-learning Caf&eacute;'s distinction between career development and career management. &nbsp;The former is what educators do to help. &nbsp;The latter is what students and clients do about it. &nbsp;The one rarely exactly corresponds to the other. &nbsp;In a changing world maybe we should worry when it does. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Educators and careers workers, their managers and their leaders, need to catch up with the sense student and clients are making of their experience of learning and work. &nbsp;There is no simple answer to any of the questions, neither is there is any single answer. &nbsp;But any answer must take account of the politics of whose voices are heeded, what interests are served, and who can afford to hope. &nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>This blog gets it start from a detailed account of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">change, politics &amp; education</a>.&nbsp; It's a long account because there's a lot going on - the account speaks for people establishing movements, posing questions and taking stands.&nbsp; It finds a lot of ways to value learning.</p>
<p>This argument looks to a future where, world-wide, cities are taking on education reform - and its shock that proves to be the driver.&nbsp; It examines...</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>politicos</strong> - what are politicians trying to do and why?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>motives</strong> - are we entirely fair to politicians?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>tests</strong> - how do we know what is fact, pretense, or authentic?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>perspectives</strong> - in such complexity can we find a political focus?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>narratives</strong> - what are the stories and what is their meaning?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>shocks</strong> - why would educators sieze on what is shocking?</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>cities</strong>&nbsp;- what cities have that nations lack and reform needs?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is for educators looking for how reactionary shock-jocks don't have all the good moves.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>politicos</strong></p>
<p>A globally influential account of how politics works, and fail to work, is set out by Brazilian politician and philosopher&nbsp;<a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/807-politics">Roberto Mangabeira Unger</a>.&nbsp; He argues that the failure of politics, is a failure to 'provoke the imagining and realisation of new possibilities'.&nbsp; He rejects obstruction by political small-mindedness, looking for immediate answers to run-of-the-mill questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is strong stuff: reform, he says, is what we do about shock.&nbsp; We need politicians vigorous enough to live dangerously.&nbsp; And that means their stepping far enough back from the routine to be able see around conventionally shallow-and-narrow thinking. &nbsp;This sounds to me like a conversation for students and their educators to get involved in.</p>
<p>Because the fusion of political experience and philosophical challenge explains a world-wide rejection of politicians.&nbsp; They are increasingly held in contempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://theconversation.com/the-politics-of-disillusionment-can-democracy-survive-6073">The surveys</a>&nbsp;vary only on the strength of that disillusionment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the reality is complicated.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true, there are politicos who are merely angling for next-election success.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;d be surprised if you&rsquo;ve not found any trying to get something worthwhile done.&nbsp; Politicos are not all the same.&nbsp; You may even be able to think of some who come across most immediately as razzle-dazzle-&lsquo;em performers.</p>
<p>So should we be reframing politicos in at least three groups? - there are politicians, there are policy makers and there are performers.&nbsp; Students and their educators would need to tell when they are dealing with...</p>
<ol>
<li>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electioneering?</li>
<li>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; policy making?</li>
<li>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show-biz?</li>
</ol>
<p class="dent">You may well know about 4, 5 and 6 political doings.&nbsp; But you get the point - despite rumours to the contrary, politicians are not all alike.</p>
<p class="dent" align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>motives</strong></p>
<p>So can that mean that educators, like the disillusioned, dump politics?&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe, but not before we've take on-board more of what we would be turning our backs on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more complicated reality is that no politico is so narrow-and-shallow never to be able to rise above mere electioneering.&nbsp; Unless you know one.&nbsp; Politicos have it in themselves at times to be electioneers, at times reformers and at times performers. &nbsp;Their politics move back-and-forth across a spectrum and over time - she did that then, he's doing this now, but does that have to mean that we can't count on them ever to do better?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It puts political action in varying episodes rather than categories on a list.&nbsp; It would be a mistake to categorise them in a type-by-type analysis. &nbsp;They are actually characters in episode-by-episode narratives.&nbsp; Though, let's face it, some don&rsquo;t vary that much.</p>
<p>A serious policy-maker, of any political colour, can shelve electioneering in the interests of doing something worthwhile.&nbsp; Some of these are working on education.&nbsp; It is good when educators and their students are in a position to converse with them.&nbsp; They deserve to be heeded, they also need to be questioned.</p>
<p>That conversation needs a congenial space, not overlooked by political and lobbying interests.&nbsp; Claims are made for the big society.&nbsp; This is false - it is small government reducing expenditure by unloading onto volunteers.&nbsp; Education's congenial home is in civil society - a locally-supported mutuality, free of political and commercial control.&nbsp; It makes curriculum community property, not a happy hunting ground. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The story moves on.&nbsp; Some UK politicians are learning to manoeuver&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/29/nhs-hospitals-hand-over-mutuals-francis-maude">mutuality into privatisation</a>. &nbsp;While a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/01/new-breed-shareholder-activists">new breed of shareholder</a>&nbsp;is bravely positioning itself to protect civil rights. &nbsp;There's no shortage of what to hear, to probe and to narrate.&nbsp; The challenge for educators and their students is find the questions that test for what to heed.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>tests</strong></p>
<p>Politicians are displaying an interest in raising working-class aspirations.&nbsp; It's in day-by-day press-releases.&nbsp; What progressive educator could be against that?&nbsp; But, before the cheering starts, we might ask what that politics means.&nbsp; Asking 'who?' and 'why?' often suggests meaning.</p>
<p>We're talking about an economy where growth does not mean more jobs. &nbsp;And that can mean that a gain for a bright working-class family means a loss for a less-bright middle-class family.&nbsp; So here are the questions: who would want the brightest to be made ready for work? - and why would they want that?&nbsp; The 'who?' could be business, rather than a middle-class electorate.&nbsp; The 'why?' could be for economic, rather than egalitarian value. &nbsp;The meaning could be&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8776">curriculum capture</a>, rather than community property.&nbsp; Which would make the aspirational press-releases a handy bit of news management.</p>
<p>Well, it's possible - though you'd have to stand back a bit to see it.&nbsp; If I've stood back too far it will come out when the politicians are found to be rooting for a person's aspirations to be a good out-of-work dad?&nbsp; I'm in more trouble when policy accepts that aspirations can include quitting work to put an end to stress.&nbsp; And I will have fatally failed when politics accepts aspirations to oppose the economic growth that damages the planet, ruins neighbourhoods and humiliates the work force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A politician can win approval by promising &lsquo;justice available to all&rsquo;.&nbsp; And there are some politicians who have earned that applause.&nbsp; But there are more than enough conflicting interests in politics to allow the suspicion that &lsquo;justice&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t always mean what you think it means.&nbsp; Neither does &lsquo;available&lsquo;.&nbsp; Nor does &lsquo;to all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Aspiration is about chances in life - in the economy yes, but also protecting the family, nurturing the neighbourhood, supporting colleagues and respecting the planet.&nbsp; Some politicians live dangerously by acknowledging all of this, but some put on a performance to disguise other priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Politics is not show business and its consequences are not a lot of laughs, not in Sunderland, anyway.&nbsp; So, if anything can bring credible hope to Alice in Sunderland, it will be interrogated policy - &lsquo;heeding whose voices?&rsquo; - &lsquo;recognised by what stakeholders?&rsquo; and &lsquo;acting in whose interests?&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Was there ever a time when such an interrogation of politics raised more of an issue for what students learn and how educators help them? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>perspectives</strong></p>
<p>The contradicting, overlapping and unresolved perspectives in the political discourse might be called 'argy-bargy'. The term 'complexity' does it less than justice.&nbsp; Some punters take cover under a claim that they have found a resolution which is 'as simple as that'.&nbsp; But it never is. &nbsp;I think we may need the term 'argy-bargy' as a piece of sociological jargon.&nbsp; I've heard worse. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Contrary to the assertions of narrow-and-shallow politics, there are rarely simple solutions to complex problems - have you looked under the bonnet of your car lately?&nbsp; The twenty-first century needs better than the simple-minded politics of something-must-be-done.&nbsp; It's the equivalent of hitting the engine with a hammer - which, once-upon-a-time, occasionally worked.&nbsp; The political version is 'say anything'.&nbsp; Its press release concludes with vacuous variations on '...and this is why the government is doing what we just said we would be doing'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On-line life further complicates the complicated. &nbsp;It makes social-networking politicos much more visible - but not always more accessible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do citizens know what to heed as reliable fact, what to ignore as electioneering pretense, and what to respect as authentic perspective?</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<em>Prospect Magazine</em>&nbsp;publication,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/free-download-poverty-in-the-uk/">Poverty in the UK</a>, makes a start on mapping what all this is doing for aspiration.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how seventy pages could have packed in more argy-bargy. &nbsp;They reveal how what is supported by one constituency is opposed by another.&nbsp; They find no bases for disentangling the complexity. &nbsp;They reveal no clearly agreed action.&nbsp; In argy-bargy-land all the targets are moving targets.</p>
<p>A significant feature of contemporary policy is speed of change. &nbsp;And things changed before&nbsp;<em>Prospect&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;ink was dry.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s out-of-date on bishops and popes; and on what people do in the name of religion.&nbsp; Neither has it caught up with the economics of debt, or on-line predators, or economic myths.&nbsp; And, perhaps because Roberto Mangabeira Unger has not yet come into view it&rsquo;s well behind the curve on the philosophy of recognising a fact, uncovering a pretense, and respecting the authentic.</p>
<p>Education needs to deal with such complexity because the curriculum is not government&rsquo;s property, nor shareholders&rsquo;, nor educators&rsquo; nor even students&rsquo;.&nbsp; It is managed by stakeholders on behalf of communities.&nbsp; And it must be returned to its owners.</p>
<p>And, so, ideas like those in the&nbsp;<em>Prospect</em>&nbsp;publication will always be longer on opinion than on evidence. &nbsp;Nonetheless, It is enough, for now, that it bumps into most of the perspectives that Alice-in-Sunderland needs to probe, when she's navigating her journey through that changing complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>narratives</strong></p>
<p>A journey is a narrative.&nbsp; Narratives assemble facts, pretensions and perspectives into sequences.&nbsp; They speak of one thing leading to another.&nbsp; And so a sequence has opening scenes, leading to turning points and towards closures. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf">Narrative</a>&nbsp;is our species' most-used way of making sense of experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Career narratives are populated by acquaintances, are set in locations and express interpersonal exchanges.&nbsp; But there are also meta-narratives - backstories with enough breadth to speak of national participation, in global settings, and telling of long-term causes and consequences. &nbsp;Meta-narratives stand back.</p>
<p>Few better understand the learning usefulness of narrative than educators. &nbsp;I'd urge every education outfit to work on its meta-narrative.&nbsp; The sequence tells all. &nbsp;Here's one...</p>
<p class="denthead" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>an education meta-narrative</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>unfettered growth driven by accelerating technology damages lives in ways ranging from the personal to the planetary</li>
<li>while on-line off-shoots of these technologies strengthen global commerce and weaken national governments</li>
<li>but it's true that commerce and its technologies can both help and hinder access to opportunity and the personal fulfillment it offers</li>
<li>while on-line and social life can persuade people that they are free of control and living according to how they make sense of things</li>
<li>but these attitudes work out differently in different backgrounds enough to make neighbours strangers to each other</li>
<li>so group and family allegiances fragment society meaning that what is favourable to some is unfavourable to others</li>
<li>and that shapes aspiration differently in different settings so that what is welcomed by some is rejected by others</li>
<li>but nothing is inevitable because all of this comes with people's consent and withdrawn consent changes everything</li>
</ul>
<p>A meta-narrative does for an organisation what a narrative does for a student - it sets out a reason to be.&nbsp; I'd say it's of more practical use to an education outfit than a mission statement, a vision, or a list of targets.</p>
<p>So where do students figure in meta-analyses.&nbsp; A meta-analysis is not Alice's story, it's everybody's story. &nbsp;But it speaks of where she will make her sense of how things are.&nbsp; And she will do that by assembling the story of her part in it.&nbsp; What the meta-analysis is finding in her Sunderland is as much Alice's business as it is anybody's.</p>
<p>So Alice and her educators need to hear from each other on this.&nbsp; All education outfits have enough people and material to help her figure how her story and all the stories belong to each other. &nbsp;It's where she makes her claim on her membership of that society. &nbsp;It may even enable some families to take an interest in other people's children.&nbsp; Would that count as an aspiration?</p>
<p>There's no disguising the complexity, contradiction and confusion in all of this - the term 'chaos' crops up.&nbsp; But the term is of no use to a sense-making processes embedded in shared and personal narratives. &nbsp;Indeed, seemingly chaotic complexity, contradiction and confusion are the stuff of that process - there is no useful learning that has not worked its way through the discomfort of that kind of questioning.&nbsp; Enabling such&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/crlrnupdate.pdf">critical thinking</a>&nbsp;is what education is for - enabling Alice in her society to deal with what's going on, and not to be dealt with by it.</p>
<p>A narrow-and-shallow search for simplicity ducks all this.&nbsp; It is also ducks surprise.&nbsp; And it is surprise that brings Alice to her turning points.&nbsp; All that is creative, reforming and progressive in learning comes from welcoming surprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there is shock, which is more than surprise.&nbsp; And, according to Roberto Mangabeira Unger, no surprise provokes more that is creative, reforming and progressive than shock.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p class="subsub">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>shock</strong></p>
<p>I suppose there are professionals so committed to public service-education that they believe they can count on government support - if not now, some time and indefinitely.&nbsp; Defenders of careers work are among the believers in strong argument bringing government riding to their rescue.&nbsp; But hope that a neo-liberal government will forever defend public-services is turning out to be the latest scene in a sad saga of professionals being stood up by politicians.&nbsp; It must come as a shock.</p>
<p>All the more shocking because there is, world wide, no shortage of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">evidence on public service education (p.16)</a>&nbsp;making the professionals' case.&nbsp; Public-service education helps to maintain social stability.&nbsp; The more open and responsive its institutions the greater their value to society.&nbsp; The imposition of ready-made ideas for structure, curriculum and method narrows perspectives and causes able people reluctantly to give up on public services.</p>
<p>There are profits to be made from what most people think of as public services.&nbsp; And, world-wide, national governments are not resisting privatising interests moving in on public-service institutions.&nbsp; The career-coaching industry is taking over from public-service careers work.&nbsp; In the UK education front-benchers are openly urging infusing fee-paying practices into public-service education.&nbsp; And compliant educators are taking the bait.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not always clear whether a government can't resist global economic pressures, or whether it just won't.&nbsp; Either way we are entitled to wonder whether the curriculum, which is community property, is safe in any government's hands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this shocking enough to provoke &lsquo;the imagination of new possibilities'?&nbsp; And what possibilities could there be for finding more reliable support?&nbsp; The Royal Society of Arts has a long-standing interest in education reform.&nbsp; And it is now coming up with seriously radical proposals.&nbsp; They are that city governments are better placed than national governments to offer reliable support to education.&nbsp; Is it possible that Sunderland can do more than Westminster for Alice on her journey?</p>
<p>She may see the point.&nbsp; National governments are too big to really understand local damage, and too small to resist global trends.&nbsp; Would educators ever agree that a city can be more alert to that reality, and more agile in that response?</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>cities</strong></p>
<p>The RSA is looking for what it calls&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal">The Power of Cities</a>&nbsp;(journal #3).&nbsp; Its argument starts from the fact that around half the world&rsquo;s population lives in metropolitan areas.&nbsp; The numbers are increasing &ndash; Alice&rsquo;s Sunderland is among them.</p>
<p>In cities people learn to live with other people - all kinds of other people.&nbsp; City dwellers are visible to each other - less likely to be strangers.&nbsp; Cities each have their own account of how things are changing.&nbsp; People can grasp what&rsquo;s going on well enough to suggest realistic responses.&nbsp; And a city can readily canvass more than one way of responding to those voices.&nbsp; All of this is why RSA-chief Matthew Taylor (p.5) recognises cities as a promising new setting for reforming education.</p>
<p>It's not flaky thinking.&nbsp; Political scientists (pp.20ff) find four kinds of gain.&nbsp; Cities have (1) a wide-enough range of sources to draw on, (2) a great-enough range of ideas to engage with, (3) a willingness to let go of what no longer works, and (4) an ability to make sense of what is up-close but fragmented experience.&nbsp; Cities thrive on each their own version of these complexities, potentialities, priorities, and sense-making.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/edctnmngrph34.pdf">evidence on reform (pp. 21-25)</a>&nbsp;includes accounts of how, in cities, centralised uniformity is replaced by creative and reforming progression.</p>
<p>This is bigger than local government.&nbsp; Every city has a hinterland of neighbourhoods, suburbs, outlying villages and settlements.&nbsp; As populations migrate towards cities few out-lying locations are left out of urban reach.&nbsp; Most cities can reach out by encouraging networks of local and scattered stakeholder groups. &nbsp;And each outlying group can identify needs and propose action calling for city support.</p>
<p>The independence of cities can be sustained by their freedom to look outside of central government for funding.&nbsp; Economists (pp.10ff) have tracked city use of alternative funding from charitable agencies, which make grants with no arbitrary strings attached.&nbsp; Some business-world voices (pp.32ff) welcome this trend as independent of commerce and state, and fostering change which is both owned by communities and developed on a human scale.&nbsp; This is civil society.</p>
<p>The RSA reports positive results.&nbsp; Cities move quickly into locally-relevant crime-control measures, transport-management and health-and-safety programmes.&nbsp; They develop rapid responses on climate change.&nbsp; They are well placed to undermine international trafficking of both people and of drugs. &nbsp;And short lines of communication get timely responses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any policy sphere needed this kind of grasp and flexibility it is policy for education.&nbsp; Metropolitan smarts hold out hope of replacing national politicking and outflanking global power.&nbsp; But Matthew Taylor advises patience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He's right - this is a long-term trend and vulnerable to capture by market players.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/03/british-developers-new-york-manhattan">city governments already in the hands of commercial interests</a>.&nbsp; But there are also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/aug/03/rochdale-economic-recovery-challenge-hi-tech">cities whose best hope is to take control of their own future</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSA&rsquo;s proposals succeed if they liberate education reform from both global and central control.&nbsp; And that would require the consent and support of educators - well, maybe all educators is too much to hope for, but the consent and support of enough educators.&nbsp; You?&nbsp; You'd need to be shocked enough?</p>
<p align="center">_________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />Before you make your move understand that I am not impartial about this.&nbsp; Is anybody?&nbsp; Better to declare the favouring of critical enlightenment above arbitrary power.&nbsp; That may not be impartial but neither is it arbitrary.&nbsp; It opposes regimes - the world over - which control populations with ill-founded and misleading beliefs, driving disapproving wedges between the accepted and the excluded, using the resulting conflicts as opportunities for take-over, putting the biosphere at risk, and demanding that their posturing is transmitted as education - while dismissing the rest as irrelevant or foolish.</p>
<p>And there are no clearly identifiable opposing protagonists and antagonists here.&nbsp; What we are facing is a criss-cross of causes and effects driven by conflicting interests and shifting alliances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it is not to say that, in the midst of all this, an enlightenment-driven politics has made no mistakes or committed no transgressions.&nbsp; But it is to say that there is hope in learning from both.&nbsp; You find out most about how your car works when it breaks down.</p>
<p>The issue is imperative, because the criss-cross of global change is not cyclic.&nbsp; There's will be no recovery to restore a temporariiy lost normality.&nbsp; What we are facing has been characterised as&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/blogs/jonathan-derbyshire/crisis-without-end-a-conversation-with-andrew-gamble">crises without end</a>&nbsp;- because it's hard to see how they will be resolved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Educators must be involved because the crisis is anti-educational.&nbsp; So what are they dealing with?...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>politicos</strong>&nbsp;- what are politicians trying to do and why? -&nbsp;educators need to find the other-than-self-interested&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>motives</strong>&nbsp;- are people entirely fair to politicians? -&nbsp;they need to scan political narrative for episodes revealing authentic voices</li>
<li><strong>tests</strong>&nbsp;- how do we know what is fact, pretense, or authentic? -&nbsp;educators can find talk of raising aspirations a particularly telling test of authenticity</li>
<li><strong>perspectives</strong>&nbsp;- in such complexity can we find a political focus? -&nbsp;people see curriculum as community property not government's or commerce's</li>
<li><strong>narrative</strong>&nbsp;- what are the stories and what is there meaning? -&nbsp;educators can develop their localities' backstories so that their students can extend them</li>
<li><strong>shocks</strong>&nbsp;- why would educators sieze on what is shocking? -&nbsp;they can join students in moving from shock to the imagination of new possibilities</li>
<li><strong>cities</strong>&nbsp;- what do cities have that nations lack and education reform needs? -&nbsp;educators work with cities on complex, potential, prioritised sense-making</li>
</ul>
<p>That reform can be implemented with or without government support.&nbsp; And the nations' different histories of monarchy have shaped different attitudes to centralisation.&nbsp; Some can see central government as protector.&nbsp; The Anglo-American history of monarchy has deeply embedded distrust of government.</p>
<p>The question underlying all talk of aspiration and equaiity is 'who gets to do what in this society?'. &nbsp;I find it hard to think a more important question for social policy.&nbsp; And there is no outfit better placed to take it on than an educator's.&nbsp; But the call for reforming research-and-development on education calls for more than educators' abilities, it needs their time and their courage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not to dwell on a failed past, or to take comfort in a plausible present, it is to take on a future struggle.&nbsp; Because nothing is inevitable - not for governments and cities nor for reactionaries and progressives.&nbsp; And also because, in all political systems, the withdrawal of consent changes everything.</p>
<p>But what part can Alice in Sunderland have in that movement, if her educators take no part at all?</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title</strong> ESOL for Employability</p>
<p><strong>Narrator </strong></p>
<p><em>In 2005 I worked as a self-employed teacher, course designer and materials developer for a project based in the north-east of England to help get asylum seekers into employment in the UK and put them on their first step to working towards a study / career plan.</em></p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p><em>The situation was that there was EU grants given for asylum seekers who were close to a status change and eligibility for work in the UK to provide some pre-work English language and UK employment preparation (involving the culture of the UK workplace and socialising within teams, etc.).&nbsp; The technology side of this was basic functionality of computer packages such as Microsoft, use of email (and email etiquette) and basic web search functionality. Socially and emotionally the learners had gone and were still going through many turbulent and traumatic times with family located back home and uncertainty over their status and future.&nbsp; The project operated out of one office where the training room consisted of one long table and a bank of 4-5 computers.&nbsp; The range of language abilities and computer skills varied enormously in each group of students, yet they would often form strong bonds and try to help each other learn.</em></p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p><em>I tried to build a programme of learning that offered ESOL (English to Speakers of Other Languages) at a number of ability levels (not easy with such wide ability levels) and offer access to things like job searching, completing application forms, typing and organising CVs, interview skills, keeping a log of courses and jobs applied for.&nbsp; The programme lasted 8 weeks with a support week either side.&nbsp; Learners would also come and go as they had counselling, formal appointments, case study workers help with job search and interviews.&nbsp; Therefore the programme needed to be flexible and yet also show a step-up approach to each week&rsquo;s learning.</em></p>
<p><em>The measure of success was someone completing the programme and applying the skills to get them into a work placement or ideally a job. It must be noted that this was not just be doing the course in isolation because there was a case worker trying to arrange meetings, placements and opportunities in conjunction with their progress on the programme.</em></p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p><em>Difficult to remember exactly but something like this:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>Diagnostic of current course materials to identify SWOT </em></li>
<li><em>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>Working with the other members of the team to determine suitable Los</em></li>
<li><em>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>Initial discussion with current and former learners to identify what they would put into the redesigned programme and what they feel that they would have benefitted from</em></li>
<li><em>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>Work with the accreditation body to determine routes to accreditation that would be suitable for the course</em></li>
<li><em>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>Build materials and test them at regular intervals feeding back into the material design with different level abilities of learners in terms of language and computer skills</em></li>
<li><em>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>Work with some of the potential employers to identify key skills and areas they required (although this did vary enormously during a calendar year)</em></li>
<li><em>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>Provide differentiated materials to try and cover a range of possibilities</em></li>
<li><em>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>Design formative assessment and feedback mechanisms</em></li>
<li><em>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>Design self-study materials hosted on a website for learners to either follow a very structured path or to dip in and out as per their needs and required outcomes (both tangible like a CV and Los)</em></li>
<li><em>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>Run a small cohort pilot and obtain regular feedback </em></li>
<li><em>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>Restructure parts of the material as required and thus move back in an active-course design cycle from this point onwards</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><em>I feel that by having consultation right the way through the design process, it is more likely that you will produce a course that is suitable for the target group.&nbsp; It met most of the outcomes, but the challenge really is to meet the needs of such a diverse group of learners put together in a classroom not because of ability but more because of who we could obtain funding for (groups of between 8-12 learners in any given course run time).&nbsp; I am not able to provide evidence of the course as it, and the project, has undergone enormous change sinse I worked on it.&nbsp; Also, none of the materials are openly available and I feel it is unsuitable, given the funding application and criteria involved, to show materials outside of the stakeholder group so I find this inappropriate in this case.</em></p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>I have worked in education for a number of years and this was the first time where I did not have a team of educators around me and I was solely responsible for the design and implementation of the learning programmes.&nbsp; In this sense I learnt plenty and across a number of areas.&nbsp; I feel that it is important to consider the context and learners for any learning course design &ndash; but this is really obvious and if this is not brought into consideration then ther course is being built for the course creator and not necessarily the participants.&nbsp; Statements like&rsquo; I think this is what they need&hellip;&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;this is what they have told me that they would like / need..&rsquo; and then respond to this or use this as a starting point.</em></p>]]></description>

              <title>policy, politics - and show-biz</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8544</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8544</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is an extract from a call for urgent action on <a title="part two" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8528" target="_blank">the politics of education</a>. &nbsp;It says that it's shock that stokes the energy needed to reclaim curriculum.&nbsp; Shock can live dangerously enough to step outside the shallow and narrow manipulation of opinion.&nbsp; It's small-mindedness that puts the future of education at greatest risk. &nbsp;And its big thinking that will bang on the doors of show-biz politicians.</p>
<p>The starting point is that the UK electorate mistrusts politicians - some hold them in contempt.&nbsp; Politicians may not deserve this; but surveys vary only on the extent to which they show it. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s easy enough to find politicos doing nothing more impressive than angling for power. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;d be surprised if you&rsquo;ve not also noticed some trying to get something worthwhile done. &nbsp;And then we have the razzle-dazzle-&lsquo;em performers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe we should be thinking of politicos in three groups: politicians, policy makers and performers?:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electioneering politicians</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serious policy makers</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show-biz performers.</p>
<p>But is every politico only one these?&nbsp; Surely they move there-and-back across a range of standpoints?&nbsp; That movement would make each position an episode in a story, rather than a category on a list. &nbsp;Mind you, some politicos don&rsquo;t move their standpoints very much.</p>
<p>Much of politics deserves to be dismissed.&nbsp; But the serious stuff is where policy makers genuinely try to do something worthwhile with education. &nbsp;And they deserve respect. &nbsp;They also deserve to be interrogated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take, for example, policies to &lsquo;raise aspiration&rsquo;. &nbsp;And who could be against that?&nbsp; But, before the cheering starts, let's ask the questions. &nbsp;Are we rooting for aspirations to be a good out-of-work dad?&nbsp; &nbsp;Do we favour aspirations to quit work and end that stress?&nbsp; Suppose it were an aspiration to oppose the economic growth that damages the planet and ruins the neighbourhood? &nbsp;And, even if any of these get a political cheer, who would make sure that the neglected poor are in on this aspiration thing? &nbsp;A politican can win applause for a claim to &lsquo;justice available to all&rsquo;. &nbsp;But there&rsquo;s enough argy-bargy among the sources cited here to show that &lsquo;justice&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean what you think it means.&nbsp; Neither does &lsquo;available&lsquo;.&nbsp; Nor does &lsquo;all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Policy for aspiration is about people&rsquo;s chances in life - far too important to be left to politics, and certainly not to show-bizz. &nbsp;It's not a lot of laughs, not in Sunderland, anyway. &nbsp;So, if anything can help Alice in Sunderland it will be policy&nbsp;interrogation&nbsp;- acting in whose interests? - heeding which voices? - driven by what stakeholders?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<em>Prospect Magazine</em>&nbsp;monograph,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/free-download-poverty-in-the-uk/">Poverty in the UK</a>, makes a good start on policy.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t know how its seventy pages could have packed in more disagreement about what it should be.&nbsp; Never a dull moment.</p>
<p>And, of course, things changed before&nbsp;<em>Prospect&rsquo;s</em>&nbsp;ink had dried.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s out-of-date on bishops, popes and action in the name of religion.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t caught up with what&rsquo;s happening on wages, debt, predators, and economic myths. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s behind the curve on the philosophy of &lsquo;what's fact?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what's knowledge?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;what's valuable?&rsquo;. &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s longer on opinion than on evidence.</p>
<p>But it bumps into all the influences on Alice&rsquo;s life chances.&nbsp; And it surprised and provoked me into trying to get the argument for progressive education into something like a narrative form.&nbsp; A narrative needs a starting point leading to a turning point.&nbsp; Does this?</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; fast-growing technologies mean that unfettered growth is damaging the planet &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; those technologies are also strengthening commerce and weakening government  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; and they&rsquo;re bringing both help and harm to people&rsquo;s personal and social well-being</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; so people can think for themselves about what they believe, value and expect &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the thinking is located in communities that become strangers to each other &nbsp;</p>
<p>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which means that each community makes a different demand on education</p>
<p>... &nbsp; &nbsp;no resolution of this is inevitable it persists with consent and withdrawn consent changes everything&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a narrative if it sets out one thing leading to another. &nbsp;It's like a journey, moving on from the starting point and coming across the turning points. &nbsp;A turning point often surprises and sometimes shocks. &nbsp;And either can lead to unanticipated change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are surprises coming to educational professionals - especially if they are so convinced of their righteousness that they've waited for politicians to ride to their rescue. &nbsp;But they've been&nbsp;stood up, so should they withdraw consent? &nbsp;The planet has enough examples of withdrawn consent for people to wonder whether the days of national politics are numbered. &nbsp;Some of the people are brits. &nbsp;And some of those are students</p>
<p>Could it be a turning point for 'provoking the imagination and realising new possibilities'? &nbsp;And how crazy is it to wonder that, if educationist can't rely on national government, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea to look around for what might be more reliable?</p>
<p>This blog&rsquo;s evidence show that a national government stability depends on inclusive and responsive institutions.&nbsp; It documents policy which excludes open institutions. &nbsp;It quotes&nbsp;global commerce's&nbsp;unresponsive scripts for education. &nbsp;There are, of course, denials; but the evidence is that commerce is moving in on education and policy is not obstructing it.</p>
<p>And so the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) is sticking its neck out. &nbsp;It wants national governments to back off. &nbsp;National governments are too big to grasp locally variable experience, and too small to protect that experience from globally-generated damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSA looks instead to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal">The Power of Cities</a>&nbsp; (journal #3).&nbsp; For a start, it requires us to rise above the show-biz clowns in charge of some of our cities.&nbsp; The more important reality is that around half the world&rsquo;s population is living in metropolitan areas.&nbsp; Sunderland is among them.&nbsp; And the numbers are increasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cities people need to learn to live with all kinds of others. &nbsp;They are close enough to the action for people to know what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;And cities are big enough for them to find more than one way of dealing with things. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why RSA-chief Matthew Taylor (p.5) recognises cities as a promising new setting for designing education policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are significant advantages. &nbsp;A city can develop a network of local stakeholder organisations, reaching to all its neighbourhoods, outlying villages and other settlements. &nbsp;Few locations are entirely out of urban reach. &nbsp;Those that are choose to be.</p>
<p>Political scientists (pp.20ff) find four upsides. &nbsp;Cities have: (1) a wide-enough range of sources to draw upon; (2) a great-enough range of ideas to engage with; (3) a willingness to let go of what no longer works; and (4) an ability to re-integrate the insights that large-scale clumsiness has fragmented. &nbsp;They&nbsp;see cities as thriving on that scope and complexity rather than relying on the bogus persuasiveness of the narrow and shallow.</p>
<p>There are exceptions but, world-wide, cities are gathering approving coverage. &nbsp;The records show that they can act quickly on dealing with the consequences of global warming. &nbsp;They are well placed to undermine trafficking in flesh and drugs.&nbsp; They are moving into locally-relevant crime-control measures, traffic-management schemes and health-and-safety programmes. &nbsp;And no policy needs this combination of local responsiveness and wide-ranging scope than a policy for education.</p>
<p>And cities do not need to be dependent on commercial and government funding; indeed, they really need to be looking elsewhere.&nbsp; Economists (pp.10ff) have tracked city-based capacity for gaining alternative funding with fewer strings attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also business-world voices (pp.32ff) that can see how such trends are usefully getting organised independently of commerce and state.&nbsp; They are seen to be fostering change that is owned by communities and is developed on a human scale. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Metropolitan smarts seem to hold out a hope of dumping national politicking and outflanking global power. &nbsp;But Matthew Taylor advises the hopeful not to hold their breath: it&rsquo;s going to take time. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s right: there are logistical issues for anchoring civil society to metropolitan areas; market players try to eliminate competition not encourage it; and transatlantic trade agreements already protect them. &nbsp;Matthew Taylor is talking about policy, and policy takes time to be realised. &nbsp;It will need persistent stakeholder action to neutralise shareholder guile.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a long haul. &nbsp;It won&rsquo;t be completed in a parliament - I doubt in my lifetime.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m betting it will happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a narrative that is relatively easy to talk about.&nbsp; And a backstory that is not. &nbsp;Education needs the bigger story...</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; civil society is bigger than the big society  because it gets organised for coordinated action</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stakeholder&rsquo;s interests are wider than shareholder&rsquo;s  because they work with the people whose lives are affected</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; citizen voice is bigger that consumer demand  because it knows how a local past, present and future belongs to local people</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conversation is bigger than commissioned consultancy  because it voices both expertise and experience&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning for action is bigger than winning an argument  because it understands the narrative in order to change it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the backstory. &nbsp;It makes the promise possible. &nbsp;The evidence is that without informed resistance to the hegemonic power that it reveals there can be no progressive education. &nbsp;It shows that the resulting promise can be kept with or without national government support. &nbsp;It believes that nothing is inevitable and that withdrawn consent can change everything.&nbsp; It holds to the stakeholder interests and voice that can make change happen.&nbsp; And it insists that education is community property and must be returned to its owners.</p>
<p>Alice will believe none of this unless her educators do.</p>

              <title>what government can do for education - part two</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Bill Law<br /></strong> <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p><strong>on causes-and-effects</strong></p>
<p>Political influences have been famously characterised by a UK prime minister as &lsquo;events, dear boy, events&rsquo;.&nbsp; He also confessed that politics are &lsquo;the art of the possible&rsquo;. &nbsp;His remarks display a genteel modesty about power.&nbsp; It was long ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The political management of events and possibilities has since been seriously weakened.&nbsp; This account shows how increasingly powerful and globally-situated commercial interests besiege domestic politics.&nbsp; Part of the political response is to concede to those interests, and some of these concessions relate to education. &nbsp;But there are conflicts of interest and frustrations of intention embedded in all of this.&nbsp; The politics of all colours sometimes seem to call less on genteel modesty than on futile desperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet government needs to be able plausibly to declare that it can make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives. &nbsp;And so where it finds itself a global loser, it looks for domestic wins. &nbsp;The bigger reality is that issues for contemporary society reach from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; But plausible politics contains attention, keeping it close to home. &nbsp;And education is close to everybody&rsquo;s home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the evidence here is that education is close to home in a sense that central governments are in no position to manage.&nbsp; The dynamics&nbsp;found here&nbsp;of how people learn are precarious, complex and local.&nbsp; Their causes and effects play out differently in different neighbourhoods. &nbsp;Central claims to educational solutions can be made to sound plausible, but this evidence shows them rarely to be credible.</p>
<p>Central directives cannot accommodate local variability. &nbsp;Claims to be acting in everybody's interest do not stand up. &nbsp;This section includes evidence that what is proposed for education-for-all actually works well in some localities, but is demonstrably damaging in others.</p>
<p>Government needs a narrative for education. &nbsp;But it's the backstories, reaching wider and probing deeper, that point to hope. &nbsp;They lift education above government press releases of the narrow, the shallow and the easier to take on board. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The politically neglected particularly need the backstory if their needs are to be understood. &nbsp;And there are out-of-power and opportunistic politicians claiming to understand those neglected interest. &nbsp;The political landscape is being reshaped.</p>
<p>It would be understandable were preoccupied educators to overlook it. &nbsp;But it would be a mistake. &nbsp;Prevailing political narratives shape the future of education in the interest of the constituencies they serve. &nbsp;The backstories are essential to an understanding of how any of those futures will play out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This section revisits the art of the possible and its events, searching among backstories for leads on progressive action. &nbsp;There's no shortage of troublesome news here. &nbsp;The challenge is to make good use of bad news. &nbsp;The section searches for what educators need to understand in order to set up credible causes of needed effects which ignite realisable hope.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; causes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/freedom-for-sale-by-john-kampfner-1784894.html">Freedom for Sale</a> - think-tank based analysis, illustrating how world-wide global corporations gain control of national governments - it describes how weakened governments pump up domestic anxieties, notably concerning health and education - their promises of liberation camouflage the realities of a global capture of governments, and the services they commission</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators working with students and stakeholders need a voice speaking deeply and widely enough to tell of global pressure in terms of local needs</p>
<p><a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Restating_the_State.html?id=mbHpaptI7CwC&redir_esc=y">Restating the State</a> - collection of articles by politically-sophisticated authors, showing that repeated attempts to reduce the size of the state have failed - this is a failure of both the political right and left - the failure includes various attempts to reduce the costs of education - the collection examines the state&rsquo;s weak relationship with market forces, but concedes the relationship as necessary - however it also argues that a sustainable future needs a clear idea of what makes a public good - that means reconciling public ownership with individual rights, a renewed sense of citizenship, and a commitment to personal-and-social well being - the articles assume that solutions will be found in the generalised processes of national politics, it therefore speaks in largely abstract terms</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->education stakeholder groups are not political abstractions but&nbsp;organisers of informed&nbsp;action&nbsp;that is&nbsp;concrete, operational and locally-recognisable</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6344672">Is PISA flawed?</a> - education journalist&rsquo;s report on doubts about the international politics of education - the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has world-wide influence on the politics of education - but statisticians claim that its methodology is misleading - its host, the Organisation for Economic and Cultural development (OECD), shows more interest in setting out clear results for besieged politicians than in disentangling the complexities of education&rsquo;s causes and effects</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders can work on research data in conversation with the people in all education institutions who understand research methods</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/11/why-nations-fail-acemoglu-robinson-review">Why Nations Fail</a> - journalist&rsquo;s review of a world-wide academic explanation of why national survival depends on what kind of political institutions they set up - it characterises some political institutions as &lsquo;extractive&rsquo; because they exclude from benefit all but the few, that is themselves and their closest supporters - the explanation contrasts these with &lsquo;inclusive&rsquo; institutions, which distribute the benefits of action to the many, that is most or all of their citizens - the explanation also shows how history documents the prevalence of these competing orientations - and it shows how, over time, control of technology and science have change the balance of power in favour of exclusion - that trend is discrediting politics, undermining governments and causing political collapse</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders groups need to include both reliable expertise and authentic experience in education if they are to neutralise politicised exclusion&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/29/europe-british-politicians-stand-up-anti-eu-populism">Beware this populism sweeping across Europe</a> - journalist&rsquo;s review of professor of politics&rsquo; account of populism in politics - following the explanation of &lsquo;Why Nations Fail&rsquo;, it argues that institutions once set up for informed debate are being invaded by the political stoking of emotional heat - the resulting intentions are contained inside a narrow scope, where easy conclusions can be reached from short statements - the tactic often invites anxiety, provocation and blame - a consequences is that the extent and complexity of conflicted political realities are overlooked - the overall argument points to the dangers to democracy in seeking only for political advantage - such politics lacks the courage of leadership which brings people to where they can claim citizenship, grasp realities, find social membership, and value education</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders are at the crossroad between popular-and-plausible and informed-and-authentic but will readily recognise which way is forward</p>
<p><a href="http://www.compassonline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/COMJ501-Elephants-in-the-room-WEB.pdf">&lsquo;...where does political vitality come from?...&rsquo;</a> - collection of short articles each outlining an unresolved issue for the future of education - it examines the shifting relationships between what is happening in welfare, identity, immigration, human rights, liberty, economy and ecology - each brings changing, complicated, uncomfortable and yet vital consequences into people&rsquo;s lives - dealing with such big issues must therefore be thought of not as a destination but as a journey - and education must be a part of learning to navigate that journey</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->students with their educators and other stakeholders need a shared conversation to get big issues ready for local action</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Schumpeter.html">Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</a> - scholarly definition of the neo-lib theory which is increasingly embraced by national governments - it argues for &lsquo;creative destruction&rsquo; which allows businesses that are not growing to collapse, so that they can be replaced by enterprises seeking growth - but neo-lib thinking ignores the many ways in which a settled business can be valued by&nbsp;its community - and so its thinking demands that effective local education must be scaled up, so it become more generally and commercially marketable - but this the right-wing hijacking of a left-wing theory - creative destruction was&nbsp;first&nbsp;designed to reinvigorate useful local businesses - and that is what neo-lib economics fails to do</p>

<p><strong>on results</strong></p>
<p>Why are arguments about politics, once started, so hard to stop? &nbsp; It's not hard to see why some people get started - they're looking for the point.&nbsp; But it's not always easy to find. &nbsp;And even harder to agree what it should be.</p>
<p>Much depends on what sort of results people want to see. &nbsp;Are they a return on investment?&nbsp; Is that the tax we pay?&nbsp; Should we be getting at least as much out as we put in? &nbsp;Suppose it's more like a fee? &nbsp;Would that be like an admission charge for membership of society? &nbsp;Suppose some people can't afford it? &nbsp;Could the payoff be held in common ownership? &nbsp;Would we then let people draw on it just because they need it? &nbsp;How would we know?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And why would anyone see it one way and dismiss all others?&nbsp; Is it because, as a species, we each protect our own's best chances to survive and flourish? &nbsp;Do we extend that protection to people we like? &nbsp;And who are like us? &nbsp;They and their children? &nbsp;People we've never met.&nbsp; Other people&rsquo;s children? &nbsp;Is this getting out of hand?</p>
<p>And where do we find these people? &nbsp;Citizens on the street? &nbsp;Workers in the economy ?&nbsp; Claimants on benefits? &nbsp;Grandparents in care. &nbsp;Immigrants at the airport? &nbsp;Subjects of the queen? &nbsp;Should different roles have different rules?</p>
<p>Such talk is full of contradiction, complexity and confusion.&nbsp; Never let anybody tell you &lsquo;it&rsquo;s as simple as that!&rsquo; - they don&rsquo;t know that they don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;I suppose that's why it&rsquo;s hard to bring a political argument to an end - there&rsquo;s too much to disentangle, much of it irreconcilable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This material finds why it is that claim the political high ground. &nbsp;It also finds what kind of evidence points to that claim being a fact, or an opinion, or a lie. &nbsp;The argument here is that there is no more important task for educators than enabling that critical thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evidence stems from three question to be put to any education programme:&nbsp;</p>
<ol><ol><ol>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->interests</strong> does it serve?&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->voices</strong> should it heed? &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;what can <strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->stakeholders</strong>&nbsp;do about it?</li>
</ol></ol></ol>
<p>The questions locate education policy where it can be done with or without the support of party politics.&nbsp; Education policy has no need to be tied to a party, but it does need to be established as a movement. &nbsp;That means taking a stand on pressures and priorities. &nbsp;Which means looking wider and deeper than where party politics is prepared to go. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jun/30/population-growth-wipe-out-life-earth">&lsquo;Humans are the real threat&rsquo;</a> - statistical mathematician&rsquo;s estimates of what he takes to be the most pressing priorities for government action - he calculates the probabilities that what any organisation can do about anything will be curtailed most by its damaging impact on the biosphere and the diminishing availability of resources&nbsp;- in a range of issues for education, stretching from the personal to the planetary, there is no more basic voice for policy than that&nbsp;- it makes the neo-lib pursuit of unlimited growth non-viable - educators, acting independently of the interests of commerce and government, can develop informed, authentic and constructive ways of enabling students to work on these base-line realities</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators and their stakeholders can see unrestrained growth as an issue for the well-being of students&rsquo; and for the children they have and will have&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/9365">&lsquo;...Rescuing the enlightenment...&rsquo;</a> - review of a free-thinking publication, arguing that there can be no idea more significant for education than &lsquo;enlightenment&rsquo; - it originates in the politics of resisting control by crown and mitre - it values well-being and fulfillment above obedience and salvation - it is contentious, arguing that the right to independence can be curtailed by the powerful - and also that control is as much asserted by background and culture as by nation and state - wherever it focuses, the thinking is rejected by some who see it as an instrument of western intellectual imperialism - but enlightenment offers no guarantee of either truth or progress, it thrives on argument - and similar stands have, in both medieval North Africa and in modern Europe, made educational progress possible - the enlightenment&rsquo;s part in education would be to engage students in the value of critical thinking concerning control by political power, by religious belief or by monetary wealth - and it would enable students to act on that independence</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->there&rsquo;s no escape from competing claims on education so its stakeholders need to know where to take a stand</p>
<p><a href="http://helenaroy.wordpress.com/2012/10/27/review-justice-whats-the-right-thing-to-do-by-michael-sandel/">Justice - What&rsquo;s the Right Thing to Do</a> - commentator&rsquo;s review of an ethics publication arguing that values are what a society says they are - this may be because they are convenient to some dominant interest - but it may also be because they accord with what most people can recognise as, in some sense, &lsquo;good&rsquo; - goodness can attach to a handed-down belief about what is honorable, virtuous or safe - it can move into the protection of a person&rsquo;s right to act on behalf of self and those close to self, the self responsibly accepting the consequences of the resulting action - but values can move farther into the justice of protecting people&rsquo;s well-being, not because they are thought of as deserving or responsible but because they belong to a shared humanity - an outcome of education is, then, the enablement of students to take a defensible position, while offering the same respect for others as they would argue for themselves - there is no greater demand on imagination than picturing what you would wish from a society if you did not yet know where, with what, and to whom you will be born - and there are few issues which call more widely or deeply on what a good education should promise</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->educators and their stakeholders are part of a civil society independently voicing the values and interests of people engaging with living together</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/19/richard-hoggart-virtue-and-reward-review">Virtue and Reward</a> - journalist&rsquo;s review of a scholarly reappraisal of &lsquo;The Uses of Literacy&rsquo; - it is a book setting out learning as enabling &lsquo;working-class&rsquo; people usefully to examine critical issues - the learning does not lead to ready-made answers, nor is it materialistic, and it is worked out with others in a community, sharing a culture - the re-appraisal contrasts then with now - in contemporary cultures literacy is found to be for asserting opinion, urging &lsquo;have your say&rsquo;, &lsquo;get your message across&rsquo; and &lsquo;win attention&rsquo; - there is less interest in what &lsquo;The Uses of Literacy&rsquo; takes to be &lsquo;respectable&rsquo; or &lsquo;responsible&rsquo; thinking - and, it&rsquo;s true, such old-fashioned talk is now unlikely to impress - it should, however, be possible to ask that learning is &lsquo;informed&rsquo; and &lsquo;thought-through&rsquo;, and to hope that learning can enable people for reflective as well as assertive conversations - such a society would then be equipped to undermine what is shallow and narrow - and learning would enable people to change their minds - the review raises political issues, including the effects of close links between the US and UK - but the reappraisal doubts that the politics of education can do much about any of this - yet government needs to know how lost reflectiveness and contemporary assertiveness is reshaping what&rsquo;s left of progressive policy - the reflective uses of literacy were never more needed - and, if government can&rsquo;t see that, education&rsquo;s stakeholders can</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->a society relies for its survival on educators enabling people to deal with issues in ways that are informed and thought through</p>
<p><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/807-politics">Politics - the Central Texts</a> - annotated link to publications on progressive politics - the focus is on the neglected needs and lost potential of the excluded - the publications are broad-based, drawing on philosophy, social theory, economics, law and politics - they set out what needs to be done to raise hopes for establishing a full and democratic life - this is argued to require developing a pragmatic and comprehensive alternative to neo-liberalism - the starting point is a diagnosis of limited political imagination - it makes politics arbitrary and haphazard - but the reality need not be chaotic where members of a society can reconceive, reform and rebuild it - and&nbsp;nothing is inevitable concerning&nbsp;property, democracy and wages - but what influential interests institutionalise curtails all such possibilities, and much of human potential is being lost - these documents argue that things will remain like this until members of each society are surprised by events which provoke the imagining and realising of new possibilities - the breadth and depth of the intellectual sources informing this argument call for big thinking, developing a broader and deeper understanding of what's going on than is commonly understood</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->education thinking needs to be wide enough to connect and open enough to explain so that purposes are imaginative enough to make a difference</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>policy, politics - and show-biz &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This final section is allowing itself to be surprised by events that 'provoke the imagining and realisation of new possibilities'.&nbsp; That shock lives dangerously, by stepping outside the shallow and narrow. &nbsp;The assumption here is that it's small-mindedness which poses the bigger risk.</p>
<p>The starting point is that the UK electorate mistrusts politicians - some hold them in contempt.&nbsp; Politicians may not deserve this; but surveys vary only on the extent to which they show it. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s easy enough to find politicos doing nothing more impressive than angling for power. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;d be surprised if you&rsquo;ve not also noticed some trying to get something worthwhile done. &nbsp;And then we have the razzle-dazzle-&lsquo;em performers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe we should be thinking of politicos in three groups: politicians, policy makers and performers?:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; electioneering politicians</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serious policy makers</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show-biz performers.</p>
<p>But is every politico only one these?&nbsp; Surely they move there-and-back across a range of standpoints?&nbsp; That movement would make each position an episode in a story, rather than a category on a list. &nbsp;Mind you, some politicos don&rsquo;t move their standpoints very much.</p>
<p>Much of politics deserves to be dismissed.&nbsp; But the serious stuff is where policy makers genuinely try to do something worthwhile with education. &nbsp;And they deserve respect. &nbsp;They also deserve to be interrogated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take, for example, policies to &lsquo;raise aspiration&rsquo;. &nbsp;And who could be against that?&nbsp; But, before the cheering starts, let's ask the questions. &nbsp;Are we rooting for aspirations to be a good out-of-work dad?&nbsp; &nbsp;Do we favour aspirations to quit work and end that stress?&nbsp; Suppose it were an aspiration to oppose the economic growth that damages the planet and ruins the neighbourhood? &nbsp;And, even if any of these get a political cheer, who would make sure that the neglected poor are in on this aspiration thing? &nbsp;A politican can win applause for a claim to &lsquo;justice available to all&rsquo;. &nbsp;But there&rsquo;s enough argy-bargy among the sources cited here to show that &lsquo;justice&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean what you think it means.&nbsp; Neither does &lsquo;available&lsquo;.&nbsp; Nor does &lsquo;all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Policy for aspiration is about people&rsquo;s chances in life - far too important to be left to politics, and certainly not to show-bizz. &nbsp;It's not a lot of laughs, not in Sunderland, anyway. &nbsp;So, if anything can help Alice in Sunderland it will be policy&nbsp;interrogation&nbsp;- acting in whose interests? - heeding which voices? - driven by what stakeholders?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <em>Prospect Magazine</em> monograph, <a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/free-download-poverty-in-the-uk/">Poverty in the UK</a>, makes a good start on policy.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t know how its seventy pages could have packed in more disagreement about what it should be.&nbsp; Never a dull moment.</p>
<p>And, of course, things changed before <em>Prospect&rsquo;s</em> ink had dried.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s out-of-date on bishops, popes and action in the name of religion.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t caught up with what&rsquo;s happening on wages, debt, predators, and economic myths. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s behind the curve on the philosophy of &lsquo;what's fact?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what's knowledge?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;what's valuable?&rsquo;. &nbsp;So it&rsquo;s longer on opinion than on evidence.</p>
<p>But it bumps into all the influences on Alice&rsquo;s life chances.&nbsp; And it surprised and provoked me into trying to get the argument for progressive education into something like a narrative form.&nbsp; A narrative needs a starting point leading to a turning point.&nbsp; Does this?</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; fast-growing technologies mean that unfettered growth is damaging the planet &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; those technologies are also strengthening commerce and weakening government  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; and they&rsquo;re bringing both help and harm to people&rsquo;s personal and social well-being</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; so people can think for themselves about what they believe, value and expect &nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the thinking is located in communities that become strangers to each other &nbsp;</p>
<p>...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which means that each community makes a different demand on education</p>
<p>... &nbsp; &nbsp;no resolution of this is inevitable it persists with consent and withdrawn consent changes everything&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a narrative if it sets out one thing leading to another. &nbsp;It's like a journey, moving on from the starting point and coming across the turning points. &nbsp;A turning point often surprises and sometimes shocks. &nbsp;And either can lead to unanticipated change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are surprises coming to educational professionals - especially if they are so convinced of their righteousness that they've waited for politicians to ride to their rescue. &nbsp;But they've been&nbsp;stood up, so should they withdraw consent? &nbsp;The planet has enough examples of withdrawn consent for people to wonder whether the days of national politics are numbered. &nbsp;Some of the people are brits. &nbsp;And some of those are students</p>
<p>Could it be a turning point for 'provoking the imagination and realising new possibilities'? &nbsp;And how crazy is it to wonder that, if educationist can't rely on national government, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea to look around for what might be more reliable?</p>
<p>This blog&rsquo;s evidence show that a national government stability depends on inclusive and responsive institutions.&nbsp; It documents policy which excludes open institutions. &nbsp;It quotes&nbsp;global commerce's&nbsp;unresponsive scripts for education. &nbsp;There are, of course, denials; but the evidence is that commerce is moving in on education and policy is not obstructing it.</p>
<p>And so the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) is sticking its neck out. &nbsp;It wants national governments to back off. &nbsp;National governments are too big to grasp locally variable experience, and too small to protect that experience from globally-generated damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RSA looks instead to <a href="http://www.thersa.org/fellowship/journal">The Power of Cities</a>&nbsp; (journal #3).&nbsp; For a start, it requires us to rise above the show-biz clowns in charge of some of our cities.&nbsp; The more important reality is that around half the world&rsquo;s population is living in metropolitan areas.&nbsp; Sunderland is among them.&nbsp; And the numbers are increasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cities people need to learn to live with all kinds of others. &nbsp;They are close enough to the action for people to know what&rsquo;s going on. &nbsp;And cities are big enough for them to find more than one way of dealing with things. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why RSA-chief Matthew Taylor (p.5) recognises cities as a promising new setting for designing education policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are significant advantages. &nbsp;A city can develop a network of local stakeholder organisations, reaching to all its neighbourhoods, outlying villages and other settlements. &nbsp;Few locations are entirely out of urban reach. &nbsp;Those that are choose to be.</p>
<p>Political scientists (pp.20ff) find four upsides. &nbsp;Cities have: (1) a wide-enough range of sources to draw upon; (2) a great-enough range of ideas to engage with; (3) a willingness to let go of what no longer works; and (4) an ability to re-integrate the insights that large-scale clumsiness has fragmented. &nbsp;They&nbsp;see cities as thriving on that scope and complexity rather than relying on the bogus persuasiveness of the narrow and shallow.</p>
<p>There are exceptions but, world-wide, cities are gathering approving coverage. &nbsp;The records show that they can act quickly on dealing with the consequences of global warming. &nbsp;They are well placed to undermine trafficking in flesh and drugs.&nbsp; They are moving into locally-relevant crime-control measures, traffic-management schemes and health-and-safety programmes. &nbsp;And no policy needs this combination of local responsiveness and wide-ranging scope than a policy for education.</p>
<p>And cities do not need to be dependent on commercial and government funding; indeed, they really need to be looking elsewhere.&nbsp; Economists (pp.10ff) have tracked city-based capacity for gaining alternative funding with fewer strings attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also business-world voices (pp.32ff) that can see how such trends are usefully getting organised independently of commerce and state.&nbsp; They are seen to be fostering change that is owned by communities and is developed on a human scale. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Metropolitan smarts seem to hold out a hope of dumping national politicking and outflanking global power. &nbsp;But Matthew Taylor advises the hopeful not to hold their breath: it&rsquo;s going to take time. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s right: there are logistical issues for anchoring civil society to metropolitan areas; market players try to eliminate competition not encourage it; and transatlantic trade agreements already protect them. &nbsp;Matthew Taylor is talking about policy, and policy takes time to be realised. &nbsp;It will need persistent stakeholder action to neutralise shareholder guile.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a long haul. &nbsp;It won&rsquo;t be completed in a parliament - I doubt in my lifetime.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m betting it will happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a narrative that is relatively easy to talk about.&nbsp; And a backstory that is not. &nbsp;Education needs the bigger story...</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; civil society is bigger than the big society  because it gets organised for coordinated action</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stakeholder&rsquo;s interests are wider than shareholder&rsquo;s  because they work with the people whose lives are affected</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; citizen voice is bigger that consumer demand  because it knows how a local past, present and future belongs to local people</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conversation is bigger than commissioned consultancy  because it voices both expertise and experience&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning for action is bigger than winning an argument  because it understands the narrative in order to change it</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the backstory. &nbsp;It makes the promise possible. &nbsp;The evidence is that without informed resistance to the hegemonic power that it reveals there can be no progressive education. &nbsp;It shows that the resulting promise can be kept with or without national government support. &nbsp;It believes that nothing is inevitable and that withdrawn consent can change everything.&nbsp; It holds to the stakeholder interests and voice that can make change happen.&nbsp; And it insists that education is community property and must be returned to its owners.</p>
<p>Alice will believe none of this unless her educators do.</p>

<p class="qote" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>asked to suggest a university mission statement, a philosophy<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;professor suggested &lsquo;analysing concepts for our region&rsquo; </em></p>
<p align="right">urban myth?</p>
<p>Philosophy poses the most basic of questions - &lsquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo;, &lsquo;how do we know?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;why does it matter?&rsquo;.&nbsp; They often-enough need some kind of answer before anybody does anything about something.&nbsp; The trouble is that they rarely get quick-and-easy answers; they get what the professor calls &lsquo;concepts&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My shot at seeing how educators work on such questions is set out in an <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497">account of what educators can do</a>.&nbsp; It shows a lot going on, much of it is based on little more than opinion, and all of it is fiercely contested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Politicians also lay claim to similar what-how-why questions - they need to say what they&rsquo;re doing, how they go about it, and why it&rsquo;s a good idea. &nbsp;This blog takes a look at the opportunities they grasp, the connections they make,&nbsp;the options they find, the complexities they navigate, and the gains they make.</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be a quick and easy read; nobody can deal with it in one take. &nbsp;But nobody needs to.&nbsp; So scan the pages to find what your work can act on. &nbsp;Skip what looks as though it can safely be ignored.&nbsp; Then figure what sort of political support education on your particular patch needs.&nbsp; No two are the same.</p>
<p>But mark this: one of the reason why proposals don&rsquo;t deliver is because something else needed to be done first.&nbsp; And that sometimes means recovering the at-first-ignored and making it the now-reconsidered.</p>
<p>I somehow doubt that the philosophy professor&rsquo;s suggestion galvanised those bosses into reconsidering the organisation&rsquo;s mission statement.&nbsp; But educators don&rsquo;t need a script; this is a range of starting points for thought and action. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Like earlier blogs, each step suggests action by students working with their educators, and by the stakeholder groups representing local interests in education.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on mood</strong></p>
<p class="text">Phrases like &lsquo;sea-change&rsquo;, &lsquo;its time has come&rsquo;, and &lsquo;cometh the hour&rsquo; reflect a belief in the importance of political timing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an ability to shape and catch a nation&rsquo;s mood. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s still about what, how and why to make a move - but it's also about when.</p>
<p class="text">Good timing can be no more than piggyback opportunism - today&rsquo;s headline becomes tomorrow&rsquo;s &lsquo;what teachers must do!&rsquo;. &nbsp;Politicians quickly learn not to waste a crisis. &nbsp;Managed well, good timing can transform a minority myth into a majority belief. &nbsp;This is not recommending that.</p>
<p class="text">But clever political timing sees education as a happy hunting ground for claims that politics can improve electorate's lives.&nbsp; And the claims often turn out to be ignorance of what has already been tried and discredited.&nbsp; Doesn't this mean that educators must get involved in understanding the mood they're dealing with?</p>
<p class="text">But it can't mean following any socio-political consensus. &nbsp;The search here is for durable springs for sustainable action.&nbsp; Like philosophy it's searching for underlying realities, for their reliability, and for their value.&nbsp; So how do we attract a contrary mood's&nbsp;interested attention in that? &nbsp;The way things are changing makes that an interesting question for educators and their studetns - and vital to how they learn from each other.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on connections</strong></p>
<p class="intro">If other peoples' timing can damage education then educators' timing can progress it.&nbsp; Timing takes hold of connections in the comings-and-goings of what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; It may link to the unfamiliar, and that may be unwanted by some.&nbsp; An exploratory brit careers-work programme was significantly entitled &lsquo;Connexions&rsquo;.&nbsp; But influential professional voices chose to canvas its imperfections. &nbsp;Might such resistance be habits-of-mind dressed up as professionalism?</p>
<p class="intro">Changed connectedness moves professionalism on, reframing conversations about what needs to be done.&nbsp; It pushes the questions beyond &lsquo;what to do?&rsquo; and &lsquo;when to do it&rsquo;.&nbsp; They are now about &lsquo;whom do we listen to?&rsquo; and &lsquo;who do we need to listen to us?&rsquo;&nbsp; These are questions of trust.</p>
<p class="intro">The slowest reader of political economy will soon come across complaints that &lsquo;nobody&rsquo;s listening!&rsquo;. &nbsp;But is it possible to listen to everybody?&nbsp; And what if the cry &lsquo;listening is what it&rsquo;s all about!&rsquo; turns out to be the right-foot left-foot politics of the hokey-cokey? &nbsp;</p>
<p class="intro">And so connectedness is complexity: customers are not always right; deals are struck both over the counter and under it; wanting is not the same as needing; claims are not invariably justified. &nbsp;All may demand a hearing. &nbsp;But not all can be heeded; or should be.</p>
<p class="intro">Shaping the connectedness of progressive education is the work of its stakeholder groups.&nbsp; Their links range from local-and-informal communities to established-and-institutionalised organisations.&nbsp; It means not just allowing things to take their course; it needs a tough-minded deliberate positioning of communities and organisations.&nbsp; It reaches outward to the experience it serves, and inward to the expertise it offers. &nbsp;At it's best it is a nicely-timed and appropriately-connected conversation.</p>

<p class="text">The journey is as much a literary as a scientific one.&nbsp; Null hypotheses are hard to formulate; there is too much going on in learning for anybody to be able to say what is never the case.&nbsp; And, anyway, education is a search for what might be so as much as an account of what might not. &nbsp;There is no last word on education.</p>

<p class="text">As a species we need to make sense of things, and confusion gets in the way.&nbsp; For some it can mean caving in to what appears to be chaos.&nbsp; That surrender doesn&rsquo;t say that education can be anything we want it to be; it says that education may be nothing at all.&nbsp; Some students agree - and some of them have a point.</p>
<p class="text">But facing complexity means you're still interested, and if you&rsquo;re not confused then you&rsquo;re just not paying attention. &nbsp;Enabling people to tell the difference between which of this is plausible and which is credible is what educators do. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">And there is also this: the more anybody can take account of complexity, then the more ways that person has of figuring out what to do about it. &nbsp;It's a repertoire which can say 'if this won&rsquo;t work, what about that?'.&nbsp; Repertoires have survival value; they make complexity&nbsp;a solution,&nbsp;not a problem. &nbsp;They mean that nothing is inevitable. &nbsp;Taking some complexity on board could keep you and your work afloat. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">All of this makes complexity a starting point, not a place to jump ship.&nbsp; Actually the discomfort of saying &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know where this is going!&rsquo; energises the pursuit of meaning, and finding meaning gives purpose to action.&nbsp; But all of this comes while dealing with complexity, not while evading it.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on beliefs</strong></p>
<p class="text">Complexity and confusion are troublesome.&nbsp; Is it so hard to understand why people are more likely to spend their energy on dealing with the urgent simplicities of day-on-day survival?&nbsp; The contemplation of the complexities of long-term hope gets squeezed out. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">But education needs to be convincing about hope. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a promise, and to break it is to invite rejection.&nbsp; And that turning away can be to where people find their simplest beliefs confirmed.&nbsp; Among the simplest of beliefs are to be quick in instinct, fierce in competition, and strong in retaliation.&nbsp; They may not feel like aberrations to avoid; they&rsquo;re as likely feel like models to emulate. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s education that can feel like the aberration.</p>
<p class="text">The signs of turning away include classroom phenomena: fidgeting with devices, camouflaging comics, gazing out of windows.&nbsp; And there be media giants out there. &nbsp;Media distractions can feel more real than lessons.&nbsp; They include the adoration of the famous, which can breed dependence.&nbsp; And there is also the rage against everything else, and that can breed fear. &nbsp;The media have a strong narrative; it recounts how &lsquo;we bring you closer to what you hope for, and we defend you from what you&nbsp;hate&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">That may be the story, but there is an undeclared back-story. &nbsp;It's about people becoming believers in what politics and commerce want them to believe.&nbsp; It's the backstory which has the greater impact on their chances in life: anybody who can capture beliefs is well on the way to being in charge. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">The backstory is both complicated and inconvenient to dominant interests. &nbsp;So it gets little attention in the media. &nbsp;It can exasperate people attending to filleted versions of the news. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s not too hard to label anyone who tries to draw attention to that as the true outsiders. &nbsp;Informed educators may qualify for the label. &nbsp;Wear it with pride.</p>
<p class="text">But few educators can be surprised to find cynicism among their students.&nbsp; So, is there a way forward? &nbsp;There's no shortcut; the evidence here is that students need to be drawn into a conversation, and that it must start from what they believe. &nbsp;And that may mean working with impulse, suspicion and hate.</p>
<p class="text">So, let's ask ourselves, &lsquo;is academic learning any good at thinking about such things?' and 'do its exams measure how well people are getting on with it?&rsquo;. &nbsp; On the first, our brains discard redundant learning. &nbsp;People quickly forget what they do not get a chance to use. &nbsp;You may have noticed that. &nbsp;On the second, the disappointed are entitled to their doubts about exams.&nbsp; We have not evolved to waste energy on pointless striving. &nbsp;That too?</p>
<p class="text">All of this leaves academic educators holding an awkward student question: &lsquo;but miss, why are we doing this?&rsquo;. &nbsp;Making &lsquo;because it&rsquo;s in the exam&rsquo; the end of the matter positions educators as running the most expensive selection system ever devised.&nbsp; Worse than that, it cops out of the promise.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">The needed conversation may start cynically. &nbsp;But it's actually about finding personal fulfillment, claiming social membership, earning economic independence, and counting on planetary well-being. &nbsp;And all of that makes the interest of the &lsquo;shirkers&rsquo; and &lsquo;strivers&rsquo; as one - indivisible.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Evading the issues insulates education from all but commercial and political concerns.&nbsp; It makes learning a closed system.&nbsp; And it makes what people will wind up believing a foregone conclusion. &nbsp;Some people like that idea. &nbsp;Not progressive educators.</p>
<p class="text">Any understanding of democracy demands that everybody involved in education is clear about where it stands on working with belief. &nbsp;&lsquo;Everybody involved&rsquo; is commerce and politics, it&rsquo;s education and it&rsquo;s stakeholders, and - most of all - it's students. &nbsp;&lsquo;Being clear&rsquo; means declaring what beliefs are worth airing and whether any doubts should be suppressed.&nbsp; The more genuinely inclusive is that appeal then the stronger its narrative.&nbsp; And that narrative determines who gets into bed with whom, and who gets kicked out.</p>

<p>Chris Target&rsquo;s piece in&nbsp;the Career Development Institute (CDI) magazine, entitled&nbsp;<a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/information/CrrMttrsOct2013.pdf">Meaning and Purpose</a>, is both disturbing and useful.&nbsp; It examines two broadly distinguishable ways of focusing careers work.&nbsp; What might be called a &lsquo;client-centred&rsquo; focus reflects the way a student or client talks about what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; While an &lsquo;expertise-informed&rsquo; focus is on the information and diagnosis that a helper brings to that conversation.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no necessary contradiction here.&nbsp; But the author wonders how much of it can be impartial.</p>
<p>We hear a lot about careers-work impartiality for employability.&nbsp; Politicians declare it.&nbsp; Employers welcome it.&nbsp; Expert careers workers claim it.&nbsp; And the CDI stands up for it.&nbsp; But there are issues...</p>

<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->1: &nbsp; &nbsp;what is impartiality?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Accounts of impartiality have a lot say about why it&rsquo;s important, who can do it, how it&rsquo;s incorporated into practice, who speaks up for it, and what it does for equal opportunities.&nbsp; A great example of all this is <a href="http://www.fasttomato.com/Assets/PublicDownloads/FT Audit Tool.pdf">Fast Tomato - statutory guidance on impartial careers work</a>.&nbsp; Maybe you can tell me where I can find the sentence that tells me how I would know when somebody is being impartial.&nbsp; So far, I&rsquo;ve found one - and it&rsquo;s tomato-free.</p>
<p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police tells me that impartiality is acting...</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a demanding impartiality - RCMP people are not to worry about their reputations.&nbsp; They get on with what needs doing, however disturbing that might be to the influential.&nbsp; And whether or not a person's face fits, it's evidence - not looking-good - that counts.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a big ask, even for a tomato.</p>
<p>My source is Rohan O&rsquo;Grady's gripping fable <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8729105-let-s-kill-uncle">Let&rsquo;s Kill Uncle</a>.&nbsp; The hero tries to deal with troublesome youngsters, drawing on the RCMP impartiality by which he lives and breaths.&nbsp; But he is a loving soul, trapped in an obsessive habit.&nbsp; So he eventually ditches a shed-load of impartial righteousness, to make room for moral goodness.&nbsp; There's a difference - I&rsquo;ll come to it later. &nbsp;But Rohan O&rsquo;Grady is better on impartiality than anything I&rsquo;ve so-far found in the careers-work literature. &nbsp;Maybe you&rsquo;ve found more?</p>

<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->2: &nbsp; &nbsp;can an economics-based service be impartial?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;Impartiality&rsquo; is a claim used by careers work to strengthen its hold on professional status and survival.&nbsp; There is a narrative of impartiality-for-employability-in-a-competitive-economy.&nbsp; That branching into the economy is cultivated - a widely-favoured funding ploy claims economic pay-offs. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a possibility vigorously canvassed by careers work&rsquo;s true believers.&nbsp; But the evidence is not good - the findings of enquiries into <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/economic-value-of-careers-guidance/oclc/654600201?referer=di&ht=edition">The Economic Value of Career Guidance</a> come to modest conclusions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More basically, the claims of economics to scientific status must now deal with its own failures. &nbsp;Those claims are less impressive than meteorology's. &nbsp;Economics is little more predictive than astrology. &nbsp;It has spectacularly demonstrated its inability to agree anything about anything important. &nbsp;A study of <a title="economists" href="http://economistsandthepowerful.anthempressblog.com" target="_self">Economists and the Powerful </a>characterises it as 'convenient theories, distorted facts &amp; ample rewards&rsquo;. &nbsp;Is it possible that politically influential economist are grinding their own self-interested axes?</p>
<p>Some of this partiality features in what careers work calls &lsquo;labour-market information&rsquo; - job descriptions, geographic distributions, rewards offered, demands made, trends plotted, people matched.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s much easy talk about how transformative all of this can be; and there is a transformation, less facile and a lot less comfortable. &nbsp;Because labour markets also feature worker exploitation, health-and-safety risks, manipulative underemployment, a failure to fund training, damage to neighbourhoods, economies weighed down by toxic assets, and invaded environments that we need to bring life to us all.&nbsp; Much of that narrative is set out as <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafstanding.html">Work After Globalisation</a>.&nbsp; Do students and clients need to examine such realities?&nbsp; Are there economists who prefer them not to notice?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Work After Globalisation&rsquo; is a trade-union perspective.&nbsp; It shows that careers work concerns can have at least as much in common with worker representation as with human-resources management. &nbsp;Would that argue for fewer joint conferences with the business world, and more with worker representation?&nbsp; It would relocate careers-work use of economics to where it can be impartial.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s not impartial now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->3: &nbsp; &nbsp;can a psychology-based service be impartial?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>People need links to labour markets, and careers work finds them in psychology.&nbsp; In more than a century of research-and-development careers work has linked labour markets to &lsquo;abilities&rsquo;, capable of &lsquo;potential&rsquo;, displaying &lsquo;interests&rsquo;, voicing &lsquo;preferences&rsquo;, engaging &lsquo;learning styles&rsquo;, framing &lsquo;constructs&rsquo;, managing &lsquo;chaos&rsquo;, and to much more.&nbsp; Talk of linking a person to a labour-market goes down well with commerce, and makes sense to the most transient of politicians.&nbsp; It may look impartial to them.</p>
<p>But they would be wrong.&nbsp; If a test of impartiality is taking account of all the evidence, then a largely psychology-based careers work fails.&nbsp; Because any complete account of inks to labour markets would also mean working with &lsquo;what kind of people would I be with?&rsquo;, wondering &lsquo;would I like them, and would they like me?&rsquo;, and - maybe - worrying &lsquo;who would look after my child&rsquo;.&nbsp; That person has probably seen neighbourhoods damaged, watched friends and colleagues humiliated, and seen news of global exploitation. &nbsp;Some want work that protects Africa, and not all work does.&nbsp; Some care about threatened species, and think of unfettered growth as destroying the planet we all inhabit.&nbsp; No impartial careers worker can assume that people will deny such social concerns in the name of individual ambition.</p>
<p>Work life cannot be transacted in a social vacuum - it is done with, for, and in response to other people.&nbsp; Work seekers inhabit a social space, sharing experience with people they know - and learn to trust.&nbsp; Those responses and that trust are first found in a locality.&nbsp; Those encounters are part of what has been called <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6147">Post-coded Careers</a>.&nbsp; Whether cosmopolitan, suburban, gentrified, rural or rundown, it&rsquo;s where alliances are negotiated and allegiances are forged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that psychology is not necessary, but working only with psychological individualism is not sufficient.&nbsp; And there are wider social connections to a world undergoing change.&nbsp; In what has been called <a href="http://www.social-europe.eu/author/zygmunt-bauman/">Liquid Modernity</a> people take on board new ways of finding things out and doing something about them. &nbsp;It shows how politics, commerce and the media reduce a social world to overblown individualism. &nbsp;To acquiesce is not to be impartial.</p>
<p>Careers work is not alone in permitting individualism to neglect what we know about social influences.&nbsp; There is a broadly-based call for an acknowledgement of <a href="http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-public-value-of-the-social-sciences-9781780931777/">The Public Value of the Social Sciences</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a self-obsessed and self-promoting careerist would believe it possible to separate a career from the lives of others.&nbsp; But clinging to a sense of a free-standing psychology allows some to neglect the people on whom they most depend.</p>
<p>For everybody else a psychologically-driven careers work is not only failing to find any big-enough answers, it&rsquo;s not asking big-enough questions.&nbsp; Those questions would seek out what sociology, cultural theory and narrative-thinking can voice.&nbsp; It may or may not remain impartial.&nbsp; But, if there are any of Rowan O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s heroes out there in careers-work-land, they are resisting the containment of limited thinking - for themselves and for their students.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s impartial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->4: &nbsp; &nbsp;as good as it gets?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Acting without fear, favour or affection can mean calling on evidence that disturbs familiar assumptions.&nbsp; It might mean acting against your own interests.&nbsp; Rowan O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s hero does all that.&nbsp; He sees it as professionalism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At its best professionalism is a willingness to speak truth to power, to blow whistles, to prevent bossiness from displacing hard-won understanding.&nbsp; Working people, all over, put themselves at risk by doing that.&nbsp; A weakened politics might, for example, try to undermine educators who oppose it - the attempt is a clue to politicians&rsquo; own secret anxieties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above all this, independent professionals resist arbitrary control.&nbsp; How they do it is set out in <a href="http://www.propel.stir.ac.uk/downloads/JuliaEvetts-FullPaper.pdf">Professionalism in Turbulent Times</a> - it speaks of 'changes, challenges and opportunities'.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s acting without fear, favour or affection.&nbsp; It defines professionalism as being independent enough, when it&rsquo;s called for, to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to your boss.</p>
<p>It gets better. &nbsp;The likes of Rowan O&rsquo;Grady&rsquo;s hero find impartiality too limiting.&nbsp; In the end he stands for the rights of the people he is there to serve.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s not impartiality, it&rsquo;s commitment.&nbsp; Not the same thing.</p>
<p>Words are important.&nbsp; And the &lsquo;im-&rsquo; in &lsquo;im-partiality&rsquo; is a negation - not taking sides, not serving interests, not accepting blame.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a self-protective and &lsquo;not-me-gov&rsquo; philosophy - seeking to be pure and free of bias. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t see many clients and students clamouring for helpers like that. &nbsp;Do you?</p>
<p>While impartiality is a claim on who gets support, independence is a commitment to what needs doing - it knows whose side it&rsquo;s on, what interests it serves, the risks it must accept.&nbsp; It is a &lsquo;where-I-stand&rsquo; philosophy.&nbsp; And careers work needs a basis for proclaiming that commitment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Philosophy is also important - it speaks of <a href="http://helenaroy.wordpress.com/2012/10/27/review-justice-whats-the-right-thing-to-do-by-michael-sandel/">What&rsquo;s the Right Thing to Do?</a>&nbsp; It poses questions: 'who gets careers work's commitment..., ...the aspirational? ...people ready to work with an &eacute;lite? ...used to consulting an expert? ...comfortable with abstractions? ...asking for more contact?'. &nbsp;Or is careers-work commitment not about seeking success, looking good, with people easy to favour, and congenial to work with.&nbsp; Commitment is to this organisation's students and clients, because that humanity has a right to this help - not&nbsp;&lsquo;worker&rsquo; or &lsquo;shirker&rsquo;, but person.&nbsp; Whatever policy demands, commerce favours or bosses expect, independent careers workers know for themselves what they are here for. &nbsp;That's better than impartial.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s is a necks-out posture.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easier to claim the virtue, than to take the flack.&nbsp; How many do?&nbsp; The CDI needs to know.&nbsp; We all need to hear more of that good news about independent careers-work professionalism.&nbsp; Are you in a position to tell us?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->5: &nbsp; &nbsp;institutionalised for what?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If it were possible for governments to prescribe education, then it would have happened by now - governments have had enough practice trying.&nbsp; So why pick on education?&nbsp; I wonder if, in an out-of-control globality, weakened governments try to show electorates that they&rsquo;re in charge of something?&nbsp; And education look like an easy mark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Organisations need to be institutionalised to make a system work.&nbsp; A complication is that different kinds of institutions work differently - some are more effective than others. &nbsp;And it turns out that&nbsp;politics and careers work are differently institutionalised.&nbsp; However out-of-touch its system may be, a government sets itself up to voice it as inclusive of its constituencies.&nbsp; But the CDI is voicing impartiality as a claim for extracting its own advantage.&nbsp; This is institutionally dissonant, and studies of <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/11/why-nations-fail-acemoglu-robinson-review">Why Nations Fail</a> show the mismatch to be critical.&nbsp; Extractive institutions eventually collapse; the greater survival value is in institutional inclusiveness.&nbsp; It works because people stay close if they are treated as though it is they that matter.&nbsp; Claims to a special standing in the estimation of 'the great and the good', made by people with letters after their name, can look like self-interested &eacute;litist posturing.&nbsp; And sometimes they are.</p>
<p>There is more - Institutions need well-structured descriptions, rules and functions - &lsquo;what are we talking about?&rsquo;, &lsquo;how will we make it work?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what do we require of our people?&rsquo;.&nbsp; The process produces lists of what&rsquo;s important, scripts for success, and nudges to help to get things moving.&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s another complication - well-defined descriptions, rules and functions work well in stable situations.&nbsp; They fall apart when people have to think for themselves - and on-the-hoof.&nbsp; It probably doesn&rsquo;t hurt to have a plan, but plans are less-and-less likely to work.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the process of planning which works &ndash; rehearsing possibilities and adapting responses.&nbsp; Institutionalising is a nightmare when the structure of yesterday&rsquo;s claims is undermined by the dynamics of today&rsquo;s change.&nbsp; Could this be careers work?</p>
<p>In response to change there&rsquo;s much political talk of the need for a &lsquo;change of culture&rsquo;.&nbsp; And here's another complication. &nbsp;The talk is easy, but getting people to let go of what they're used to, or were trained to do, or that they enjoy, or what seems to work well enough... any combination can give a reforming manager more sleepless nights. &nbsp;A culture conveys the beliefs, values and expectations which shape how people get on together.&nbsp; It frames what people in the institution can see - and not see. &nbsp;And that can draw a curtain over what we call 'transparency' - some questions are not acknowledged let alone answered. &nbsp;Where the culture is strong iit takes nerve to let go. &nbsp;It takes outstanding courage to expose or oppose. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the significant workings of such a frame is set out in an account of how loyalty clings to the way things are. &nbsp;That loyalty is characterised as <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/the-righteous-mind-by-jonathan-haidt.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">The Righteous Mind</a>.&nbsp; A culture claiming such loyalty supports people in clinging to what will no longer help.&nbsp; It can cause good people to do bad things.&nbsp; The outcomes can be catastrophic. &nbsp;Aware careers workers detect what interests a righteous mind is canvassing.&nbsp; But, in an inclusive institution alert to change, that loyalty becomes a question for a conversation, not a claim for respect. &nbsp;If professionals want any part of such an open conversation, then they need to bring trained expertise into exchange with experienced reality.&nbsp; Both rate a hearing. &nbsp;It is a bold independence, because such a conversation can change minds - in both directions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The kind of results that we can expect from all this are set out in <a href="http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/academicgroups/equality/forumyouthparticipation/CoopPSpaperHBT121101.pdf">Cooperative Problem Solving</a>. &nbsp;It speaks of&nbsp;learning partnerships, where students, educators and the people they seek to help work together - careers workers and their stakeholders. &nbsp;Stakeholders are not shareholders. &nbsp;They include families, their communities, their places of education and their labour representation.&nbsp; Do careers workers belong here?</p>
<p>When stakeholders find that they are recognised in these ways, then they see a point in taking part. &nbsp;And when careers work is established, it is not because careers workers claim it from stakeholders, it's because stakeholders offer it to careers workers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->6: &nbsp; &nbsp;is any of this possible?&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to claim impartiality than, like Rohan O&rsquo;Grady hero, to live and breathe it.&nbsp; Signs of decay would be in the protection of one&rsquo;s own status and survival.&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples are deference to the influential, manoeuvring for advancement, and shaping programmes to attract funding.&nbsp; None of this is either impartial or independent. &nbsp;Is any of it found in careers work?</p>
<p>At their worst, the failures would involve manipulating students and misleading clients. &nbsp;That might mean failing to question the damaging requirements of institutionalised systems.&nbsp; Resisting such impulses needs a grip on <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/memory/cafsoint.pdf">Working with Systems</a>.&nbsp; System orientation is a measure of the independence that careers workers can muster, when they are dealing with pressure from others.&nbsp; You might recognise this as institutional pressures. &nbsp;There is also political and commercial lobbying. &nbsp;There are even professional controls. &nbsp;Anything like that going on around you?</p>
<p>My bet is that few of us careers workers have entirely clean sheets on system orientation.&nbsp; We may not be as impartial or independent as we like to think we are.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help wondering whether some careers workers have yet noticed that their claim to impartiality is contradicted by their own action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the mention of &lsquo;impartiality&rsquo; gets an audible murmur of approval and a visible nodding of heads.&nbsp; The idea is more impressive than the reality. &nbsp;Nonetheless, it's been installed as &lsquo;a good thing&rsquo;. &nbsp;Maybe a lack of clarity about what it means, rescues it from being put to a searching test.&nbsp; That would be a good project for the CDI.&nbsp; After all, the celebration of what might turn out to be a failure would not do anyone&rsquo;s status or survival any good &ndash; would it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>7: &nbsp; &nbsp;which way is forward?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I find it impossible to think about this without being invaded by images of global finance making instant and hemispheric transfers of capital greater than a nation-state&rsquo;s annual spend.&nbsp; And, for the most part, the whole electronic process is untouched by human hand. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Such power changes everything, and careers work can&rsquo;t hope to be exempt.&nbsp; In the past its development has been framed by practice built into a person-centered programme called Sure-start, and thinking set out in a government policy statement called 'Every Child Matters'.&nbsp; Not now - another government expects careers work to harness its impartiality to the pursuit of unfettered economic competitiveness.&nbsp; This is a retrograde paradigm shift, raising serious <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6410">Questions for Learning and Work</a>.</p>
<p>The idea of <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf">Learning from Experience</a> draws on well-established thinking that first mooted the idea of a civil society.&nbsp; It was originally set out to organise citizenship&rsquo;s independence of commercial and political leverage.&nbsp; And so civil society is older and bigger than &lsquo;the big society&rsquo;.&nbsp; A prime minister&rsquo;s big idea is actually a resuscitation of a right-wing president&rsquo;s hopes for small government.&nbsp; By contrast, civil society does not make things easier for commerce or government. &nbsp;It's more independent than that - by institutionalising social systems and positioning them to voice to stakeholder interests.</p>
<p>Finding that everything is changing means changing what to do about it.&nbsp; Careers work must work with the confusion, loss and stress that hemispheric flows bring in their wake.&nbsp;&nbsp; And conventional careers work is in no position to enable people to navigate that change.&nbsp; It needs more time, more stage-by-stage learning, and more conversational questioning&nbsp;than edge-of-timetable careers work has ever been in a position to consider. &nbsp;There are emerging possibilities, set out in <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497">What Educators Can Do</a>.&nbsp; They reach way beyond what careers workers have been trained to do.&nbsp; This is root-and-branch curriculum reform.</p>
<p>I somehow doubt that commerce and policy are about to call for more theory.&nbsp; But professionalism cannot be a theory-free zone.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true that there are useful theories and theories about which nobody has yet worked out what to do.&nbsp; A useful theory sets out what&rsquo;s going on, how it got this way, and what can be done about it.&nbsp; Every educator needs such levels of understanding, as surely as every medico needs them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If careers work is ever bereft of theory, that emptiness will be invaded by headlines, myths, prejudice and limp compromises - all commitments to nothing in particular. &nbsp;So how would we know what to do about staff-development, about organisation-development, and programme-development? &nbsp;There would be no readable maps and no reliable compasses.&nbsp; What there would be are signposts erected for news management, damage limitation, lobbying and happy head-banging.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6540">Why We Need a Career-learning Theory</a>.</p>
<p>At the close of the first century of careers-work's research and development, it has earned access to a better way forward than are offered by dominant institutions and their cultures. &nbsp;Career work needs somewhere else to go. &nbsp;Is it civil society?</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->___________________________</p>
<p>Chris Targett's article is published in the journal of the CDI - noted for its claim to impartiality-in-pursuit-of-employability.&nbsp; What I've found and set down here persuades me that its claim will probably not succeed, and it may not matter if it fails.&nbsp; Chris Targett is right to headline the issue.</p>
<p>My persuaders are not particularly influential, they are more important than that - &nbsp;global trends and social consequences.&nbsp; They are changing the way people manage career. &nbsp;Careers work does well to stay in touch with the trends.&nbsp; And staying in touch means looking outside the careers-work literature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But hidden behind any headline there is always an untold story.&nbsp; A savvy career-work profession sees through news management, to probe the interests that drive it. &nbsp;Their press releases, lobbying, donations and on-line hacking is power, and way beyond the reach of anything we are sold as 'empowerment'. &nbsp;Such distractions are useful to power, especially when they point to who should be adored and who must be condemned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that so-called political process a powerbase wants to be able to rely on a weakened government for its docility. &nbsp;That realisation is driving a generation into pulling out of civil, political and working life. &nbsp;It's what the culturally-influential Russell Brand calls&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution">&lsquo;On Revolution&rsquo;</a>.&nbsp; The people he's influencing need an independently alert careers work to rise above this - to where helpers and their students can work together on wider causes, deeper effects and firmer bases for action.</p>
<p>If this is anything more than my paranoia it demands a serious rethink.&nbsp; And, for me, that&rsquo;s theory.&nbsp; But what can theory do that it&rsquo;s not already doing?&nbsp; I find the clue in the word &lsquo;conversation&rsquo; - intensively developed in what is called dialogic theory. &nbsp;It can catalyse&nbsp;a radical rethink of careers work's underpinning. &nbsp; And that will enable careers workers in making their expertise available to&hellip;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relocating - linking expertise to experience|</strong><br /><br /><strong>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reframing - expanding the perspectives of both</strong></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>&hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; renewing - catalysing new bases for action</strong></p>
<p>The CDI rightly provides theory-training for its members. &nbsp;If careers work is not to join the conversation empty-handed, it needs an understanding of how things are and what can be done about them. &nbsp;Because a conversation includes the possibility of change-of-mind, it can do more than hold onto theory, it can expand it.</p>
<p>I believe I know careers work well enough to trust that careers workers are engaging with organisations and their stakeholders now.&nbsp; If what I say adds anything to what they do it might be to signpost the ideas.&nbsp; Long ago, a participant set me straight on that...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;we already know the music Bill, you&rsquo;ve given us the lyrics&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>The lyrics here apply recent thinking on&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8497">&lsquo;What Educators Can Do&rsquo;</a> to what impartial careers workers do &ndash; without fear, favour or affection.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s more, it speaks of an independent professionalism. &nbsp;I have to confess that I doubt it's a good idea to say a bald &lsquo;no&rsquo; to your boss.&nbsp; Better to open a conversation among any whose interested attention you can attract - find friends. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestions for adaptable ideas-for-action might well help. &nbsp;And some have cropped up here. &nbsp;There's a case for more complete and interesting labour-market information. &nbsp;Students need to find 'self' in relation to other people and their points-of-view. &nbsp; We can see how cooperative problem-solving can equip people for learning for living. &nbsp;And whatever is done needs to be informed by on-going exchange between careers workers and their stakeholders.</p>
<p>But, however promising the action might be, organisationally embedding it is never a doddle. &nbsp;Careers-work institutions range from village primaries to cosmopolitan universities.&nbsp; Each is installing its own system, framed by a culture, making claims, offering inclusion, developing a narrative, seeking loyalty, finding a philosophy and balancing interests.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s more than one song here, and more than one place to start singing.</p>
<p>There are also dangers.&nbsp; Chris Targett doesn&rsquo;t go this far, but I do: no contemporary organisation does itself any favours by turning its back on what's going on globally and socially. &nbsp;It would be to preside over a redundant institution, nursing a moribund culture. &nbsp;The song would be over, and the melody would not linger on.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="qote" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>I'd rather leave the job I love than teach the government&rsquo;s propaganda</em></p>
<p class="qote" align="right"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/may/18/gove-leaving-teaching-curriculum-changes-history?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487">the secret teacher</a></p>
<p class="main">The secret teacher speaks for himself; we don't know how many other teachers and lecturers would endorse this condemnation of curriculum abuse.&nbsp; But he may well get a cheer from educators who would not call themselves &lsquo;teachers&rsquo; or &lsquo;lecturers&rsquo;.&nbsp; Education has agencies other than schools-and-colleges.&nbsp; Every locality has some such free-standing voluntary agency or social enterprise. organising help in what is called &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="main">My shot at explaining all this is set out in an earlier <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8484">account of education and policy</a>.&nbsp; I examined influences on education, the beliefs they call upon, and the risks they pose.&nbsp; Here I ask how education can respond to those pressures, by forming and activating stakeholder groups as part of civil society.&nbsp; Civil society, by definition, acts independently of commercial and political pressures.&nbsp; And stakeholder groups give voice to that independence.&nbsp; This blog asks what kind of conversations about education that independence sets up.&nbsp; It means probing what different groups want from curriculum, what commitments they each seek, and what varied outcomes they try to realise.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">The possibilities are far-reaching, especially when education for selection is set alongside education for well being.&nbsp; I look for what gets argued when education for competitiveness is set alongside education for fulfilment.&nbsp; The term &lsquo;learning-for-living&rsquo; crops up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">Curriculum development needs all the independent support it can find in schools and colleges.&nbsp; But an independent education may need civil society more than is yet obvious, even to the secret teacher and his allies.&nbsp; This blog faces the probability that education will be privatised; government is in no position to resist the leverage of commercial interests looking for new markets.&nbsp; Thinking about the future of education needs, then, to grapple with all the possibilities - if not in the public service then in civil society.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">It&rsquo;s a long-term project - bigger than a parliament.&nbsp; But Labour is calling for local communities, in partnership with businesses, to be free of arbitrary demands for unsustainable growth, and working for locally-valued outcomes.&nbsp; Those calls resonate with the forward-looking possibilities signposted here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub"><strong>on priorities</strong></p>
<p class="intro">Most people can answer to their own satisfaction the question &lsquo;what&rsquo;s education for?&rsquo;.&nbsp; Everybody has some experience to go on.&nbsp; But agreement in a group is less likely - people have different experiences.&nbsp; Some claims are at such levels of word-playing malleability to be useless: talk of &lsquo;inspiration&rsquo;, &lsquo;confidence&rsquo;, &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo; and &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; can obscure more than it illuminates.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not easy for stakeholders to get enough detail on the action that such claims call for.&nbsp;&nbsp; They need to get to grips with how far such underlying priorities can stretch...</p>

<p class="text">Whatever balance is struck between content and process, educators need to design a scheme-of-work.&nbsp; Before they join their students in a group, they need to think about what students are ready to learn, why it is important, what will attract their interest, what to bring them as resources, how to engage with them in working with those resources, and what indications of learning to look for.&nbsp; There is a conversation about enablement to be had on all this, and stakeholder priorities will figure.&nbsp; There are questions, for example, about how ideas like &lsquo;inspiration&rsquo;, &lsquo;confidence&rsquo;, &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo; and &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; can feature - and whether they are to feature at all.&nbsp; What comes of that conversation is a scheme design - and there is a range of design features to call on...</p>

<p class="sub"><strong>education, interests and 'noises-off'</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/education-a-very-short-introduction-by-gary-thomas/2002267.article">Gary Thomas</a> has distilled curriculum thinking into an hour-or-so of reading.&nbsp; He maps a six-thousand-year history of education.&nbsp; I find his account riveting - it&rsquo;s of a struggle.&nbsp; In the blue corner, an insistence on the need for formal and reliable facts.&nbsp; In the red, trust in the case for an open and progressive process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, before the bruising starts, it&rsquo;s a pointless match - have you ever come across an unprocessed fact? or a fact-free process?&nbsp; So we should be able to find a consensus.&nbsp; But it's hard to find.&nbsp; Educators and their stakeholders need to understand why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author helps by taking a close look at pragmatics, constructivism and marketisation.&nbsp; I've tried here to take account of all that.&nbsp; But I can't help noticing that the author leaves out pretty-well all of what neurology, the social sciences and cultural theory bring to an understanding of curriculum.&nbsp; So where are the clues to understanding?&nbsp; Are they in what we can see included? or in what we can't see because something's left out?&nbsp; We'd have to ask who ignores what?&nbsp; And why would they do that?</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve managed to set out here, I find it hard to lose the suspicion that this is not really a debate about ideas, it&rsquo;s about whose interests are being served.&nbsp; A content-driven factual understanding of how things are suits some, and they are glad to see it included.&nbsp; A process-driven curriculum addressed to critically scrutinising how things got this way will upset some apple-carts</p>
<p>Assembling this account of what educators can do has repeatedly come across those conflicting interests.&nbsp; Any claim made, or research reported, or policy announced stands in a frawework of one set of interests or another...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>neo-lib&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; shareholder &lt; &gt;&nbsp; cosmopolitan&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; street-level&nbsp; &lt; &gt;&nbsp; civil society&nbsp; &lt; &gt; stakeholder</strong></p>
<p>It also finds the interests managed in a range of settings...</p>
<p align="center"><strong>systemic&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; institutional &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; local&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; conversational</strong></p>
<p>Some of this is &lsquo;noises-off&rsquo; - hard-to-decipher murmers of what is somewhere being canvassed, or the wangling of manoeuvres, or - eventually - what turns out to have been downright misleading.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found some of what is signposted here in the news, but the news can also be a daily parade of immediate events, short-term consequences and facile solutions.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s too little time, space or attention-span to pose uncomfortable questions - just enough for evasive answers.&nbsp; Claims to transparency are so narrowly framed as to be laughable.&nbsp; Education needs larger frameworks, demanding disclosing answers.&nbsp; Am I paranoic to sense that there's some probing to do here?</p>
<p>And probing done before any compromises are made.&nbsp; A resolution can only be negotiated from what is put on the table.&nbsp; There's no compromise with absolute beliefs.&nbsp; And compromise with partial disclosure is a commitment to little that's worth having.&nbsp; Garry Thomas&rsquo;s story is in part an account of what kind of limp resolutions are left dangling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Educators are not responsible for any of this, but neither can they afford to ignore it. This account of what they can do is widely-enough framed to take account of the gamut of interests and the reach of exchanges.&nbsp; So there&rsquo;s a lot here.&nbsp; But the more educators take into consideration, the more bases for action they can search.&nbsp; And this blog has argued that the action can include root-and-branch curriculum reform - with or without the support of the 'noises off'.</p>

<p class="main" align="right"><a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-times-they-are-achangin-lyrics-bob-dylan.html">Bob Dylan</a></p>
<p class="main">This is not about acoustic and electric guitars.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more important even than that.&nbsp; This is about change - from the personal to the planetary.&nbsp; And the times they are a-changin&rsquo; alright, but more than Bob knew.&nbsp; More than anybody could know.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">He held out hope for a generation; but no generation gets the last word on anything.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s little consensus on what anybody can do about what's happening.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy enough to trot out vague promises - &lsquo;more choice&rsquo; is popular, &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo; might get applause, and &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; a murmur of approval.&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re pretty fluffy concepts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m suggesting that they camouflage more than they illuminate.</p>
<p class="main">I&rsquo;m thinking about the way influence is exerted, how it fragments societies, whether myths can easily posture&nbsp; as reality, why there are so few whistle blowers, and the risk all of this poses for us all.&nbsp; Growing fear needs transposing into sustainable hope.&nbsp; Educators are in no position to fix that; this is about how students will figure it for themselves.&nbsp; But this is pragmatic, it signposts what can help.</p>
<p class="main">It is a companion piece to an earlier blog - &lsquo;<a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8466">what education gets from politics</a>&rsquo;.&nbsp; If it feels a bit scowling-grumpy, ask yourself whether we've passed the limits of what smiley-nice can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">It's addressed to education&rsquo;s stakeholders.&nbsp; These are the families, educators, voluntary groups and social enterprises concerned for what students can gain from education.&nbsp; It signposts useful ideas, arguments and evidence.&nbsp; Each source is followed by an item for a stakeholder agenda.&nbsp; Education doesn&rsquo;t need shareholders looking for a pay-off, it needs stakeholders probing who is getting what out of education, and whether its stakeholders need to do something about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="main">There&rsquo;s a lot of stuff here, because there&rsquo;s a lot going on.&nbsp; It may be best to start from the signposts which point to your work now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll update the list as things change - and they will.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll also open up other areas of enquiry.&nbsp; You can track this, and other news, by dropping in on <a title="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/billaw" target="_blank">my Twitter page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="subsub">I don&rsquo;t want to be unfair to Bob Dylan - I don&rsquo;t dare.&nbsp; But the issues are too troublesome for uplifting inspiration.&nbsp; The point is this: stakeholders need students to get more from education than they&rsquo;ve so-far been in a position to realise.&nbsp; Boundaries need to be pushed.</p>

<p class="subsub"><strong>on influence</strong></p>
<p class="text">Should the wishes of the rich-and-powerful prevail?&nbsp; Are the people who most need help least likely to get it?&nbsp; Should we be surprised that there is little resistance?&nbsp; Is there damage that is not being openly confronted?&nbsp; And, if any of this is so, how does education resist being bounced into compliance with it?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s evidence on all of this, showing the interplay between politics and commerce - and its consequences for how we live together.&nbsp; Or don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>There is a salutary tale here.&nbsp; It concerns an aspect of education fully enmeshed in these issues.&nbsp; Careers work is about who gets to do what in society.&nbsp; It has a century of research-and-development to draw on.&nbsp; It assiduously canvasses policy support.&nbsp; The commercial world can be counted on to take an interest.&nbsp; It has had some kind of representation in most education settings.&nbsp; Yet it is struggling to secure its own future.&nbsp; What went wrong?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible that it defended a past rather than reaching for a future?&nbsp; That would explain why it ran out of recognisably useful things to say.&nbsp; That retro-thinking was framed by a psychologically-understood individualism, linked to economically-understood opportunity.&nbsp; Such simplicity was, for a time, convenient to both commerce and politics.&nbsp; But it has little place in a privatised, digitised and globalised world.&nbsp; And it has no room for the social-and-cultural complexities of a fragmented, polarised and damaged social world.&nbsp; It has produced not so much inspiration as desperation - and the confusion seems to have taken refuge in what is called &lsquo;career-chaos theory&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But students don&rsquo;t need to be told about chaos.&nbsp; It they are to find meaning and purpose in confusion, it will need more time and space where students can learn about what&rsquo;s going on, and how they can&nbsp; make sense of it.&nbsp; Little of that can be done in hit-and-run careers interviews.&nbsp; This is not to say that face-to-face help is not necessary, but it is to say that it is not sufficient.&nbsp; Careers work has never found the need to draw on the full range of processes available to a well-constructed curriculum.&nbsp; It needs to do that now.&nbsp; The whole of what is set out here need the full scope of a curriculum designed to deliver learning for living,</p>
<p>This website is about innovation.&nbsp; And innovation means the 'creative destruction' of what can no-longer help.&nbsp; Should that be a lesson to us all?</p>

              <title>what education gets from politics</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>What education needs from politics is much less control and a whole lot more imagination.&nbsp; I try here to say something useful about how things got this way.&nbsp;&nbsp; My conclusion is that the way things are demands more than an adjustment here, a fix there and a re-launch sometime.&nbsp; I'm arguing for mind-boggling imagination, in support of learning-for-living usefulness, based on root-and-branch innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>stakeholder voices</strong></p>
<p>The way things are is not a happy story.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s certainly not hard to find reports that politics is remote from experience.&nbsp; People's life-and-work is changed for the worse by politicos claiming to be acting for the better.&nbsp; The people I&rsquo;m thinking of are <em>students</em>, in the <em>communities</em> where they and their families live, with their <em>helpers</em> in schools and colleges and in civil society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All three groups are stakeholders - a term which includes shareholders, but reaches far beyond them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll talk a lot about stakeholder voice - how different people, in different groups, differently voice their interests in education.&nbsp; Each speaks with an indispensable authority of the sense they make of their experience.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s more leadership for education than its designated leaders necessarily know about.&nbsp; There are also more conflicts of interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, the most pressing need has to do with the way in which students now need to navigate a path through accelerating change - a journey too-often signposted for manipulation, deceit and predation.&nbsp; Educators cannot ignore this.&nbsp; But stakeholder responses vary: some see market opportunities, some wonder what markets do for social well-being or personal fulfilment, and some argue for critical thinking to enable students to deal with whatever is thrown at them.&nbsp; I try to show how and why politics shows an active interest in some of this, promises but does not deliver on some, and largely ignores some.&nbsp; Educators are bound to wonder why.</p>
<p class="text">There's plenty here for you to disagree with - and plenty of opportunity for you to say why.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>abstractions and metaphors</strong></p>
<p class="text">But there&rsquo;s no quick-and-easy way to talk about education.&nbsp; Attempts at any length resort to abstract nouns.&nbsp; Various stakeholders variously call on such concepts as...&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="text">&lsquo;achievement&rsquo; - &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; - &lsquo;fairness&rsquo; - &lsquo;fulfilment&rsquo; - &lsquo;progress&rsquo; - &lsquo;self&rsquo; - &lsquo;well-being&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">They&rsquo;re rarely defined in ways that everyone accepts.&nbsp; Some get regularly redefined.&nbsp; And when any of them are loaded into a conversation about accelerating change, a person can get lost.</p>
<p class="text">It gets worse.&nbsp; As politics turns to education for responses to its own problems, the list lengthens, to include for example...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;aspiration&rsquo; - &lsquo;career&rsquo; - &lsquo;choice&rsquo; - &lsquo;citizenship&rsquo; - &lsquo;employability&rsquo; - &lsquo;enterprise&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">They&rsquo;re pretty fuzzy concepts.&nbsp; Some are demonstrably meaningless.&nbsp; But some people&rsquo;s interests find one or more term compelling - even compulsory.</p>
<p class="text">When definitions don&rsquo;t help, metaphors sometimes can.&nbsp; They substitute abstract talk with talk of the tangible.&nbsp; Metaphors conjure images which can be visualised as part of a narrative.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s possible to talk of education...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote">as if it recounted <em>&lsquo;a journey&rsquo; - </em>or<em> - &lsquo;a race&rsquo; ........ </em>or as if featured<em> - &lsquo;a trap&rsquo; - </em>or<em> - &lsquo;a key&rsquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">Such images matter.&nbsp; And narrative seems to be the species&rsquo; default way of making sense of what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; It gives voice to experience...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>what did he say? - why&rsquo;s that so important to her? - </em><br /><em>what can she do about it? - he won&rsquo;t like that!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">Ministerial pronouncements and stakeholder response can be narrated in such terms.&nbsp; But education can&rsquo;t rely wholly on such talk - it can deceive.&nbsp; Thinking about education can use narrative, but it needs hard evidence.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>imagination and reality</strong></p>
<p>I've put in links to imagery that stakeholders might find worth engaging.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the first...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote">Imagine no possessions<br /> I wonder if you can<br /> No need for greed or hunger<br /> A brotherhood of man<br /> Imagine all the people sharing all the world</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text" align="right">John Lennon</p>
<p class="text">John Lennon bequeathed <a title="hope" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnlennon/imagine.html" target="_blank">hope</a>, not least to young people.&nbsp; He sees young people as moving on together, as if on a shared journey.&nbsp; He avowedly does not see them as being taken in one-by-one, as in a trap.&nbsp; He wrote this when an economy, culture and technology made such western-hemisphere hopefulness seem possible.&nbsp; Contemporary experience needs a different narrative - not least for students, with their educators, and in their communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>student voice</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">So what kind of narrative might resonate with students these days?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no hope in a story of entrapment, but it might be worth wondering about the attractions of racing imagery - where people can be winners...&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose students mainly value education to help them be winners?</li>
<li>so that they seek coaching? - to get ahead of the pack? - finding an inside track? - to the finishing line?</li>
<li>might that mean that giving way to others is believed to be weakness?</li>
<li>what about if the belief were that losers have only themselves to blame?</li>
<li>would anybody then expect that excluding others from the game is how the competitive win?</li>
</ul>
<p>Are students finding such talk any more &lsquo;hard to do&rsquo; than John Lennon found in his imagining?&nbsp; Probably not: such competitiveness is not hard to understand in a stagnant economy, where one person's gain will be another's loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a lot of issues embedded here.&nbsp; There is evidence that finishing-line learning gets lost when the race is thought to be won.&nbsp; It's learning for a result, not learning for life.&nbsp; But the beliefs, values and expectations associated with such a story can, nonetheless, embed in the culture of a school, a college or a project...</p>
<ul>
<li>how far would education be valued for the advantages it gives to &lsquo;me&rsquo;, over &lsquo;others&rsquo;?</li>
<li>are relationship increasingly valued for their &lsquo;worth-knowing&rsquo; networking?</li>
<li>and about the excluded, who do they believe they can most count on when it matters? - day-on-day? - in a crisis?</li>
<li>do such outsiders have any value to the advantaged - worth talking to? - caring about? - given as much as a nod?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">This may not be what John Lennon calls &lsquo;brotherhood&rsquo;.&nbsp; And there is some evidence of loss of eye-contact in competitive cultures.</p>
<p class="text">Such issues are not intended for research schedules; they are the makings of fuller conversations.&nbsp; For the helpers these are listening conversations - helpers need to know what sense students are making of their experience of education.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">So what about John Lennon's talk of &lsquo;possessions&rsquo;? - among which socially-isolating on-line devices may be significant...</p>
<ul>
<li>are there possessions that are more valued than, say, on-line devices? - like what?</li>
<li>do we know what such feelings-for-things are about? - fun? - contacts? - status? - what else?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s fun, would that be exciting? - impulsive? - dramatic? - extreme? - dangerous? - what more could it be?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s about contacts? - does that mean with people whom &lsquo;I like&rsquo;? - or are &lsquo;like me&rsquo;? - what&rsquo;s most to like? - what people? - found where? - valued why? - something else?</li>
<li>suppose it&rsquo;s about status, would that have anything to do with expensive stuff? - up-to-date? - looking good? - feeling good? - having followers? - what else?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s plenty of room for imagination here, but it&rsquo;s not John Lennon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If educators find any trace of a &lsquo;me-now-and-fun&rsquo; culture, is it showing any traces of what some call &lsquo;immature&rsquo; - and some would call &lsquo;infantilised&rsquo;.&nbsp; There's evidence, and not only among young people. &nbsp; A second bit of imagery:&nbsp; Aldous Huxley attributes such attitudes to most of us, in his ironic <a title="huxley" href="http://classiclit.about.com/od/bravenewworld/fr/aafpr_bravenew.htm" target="_blank">imagining</a> of a <em>Brave New World</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s no limit in such talk to why-is-this-important-to-anybody questioning.&nbsp; Neither is there any limit to what-can-anyone-do-about-it hope.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text"><strong>educator voice</strong></p>
<p class="text">Inserting words like &lsquo;empowerment&rsquo;, &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; and &lsquo;choice&rsquo; into a message captures comfortable compliance.&nbsp; Other words, like &lsquo;entrap&rsquo;, &lsquo;impulse&rsquo; and &lsquo;infantilise&rsquo; feel more like uncomfortable warnings.&nbsp; But both sets of terms belong to each other, like the conflicted dialogue in a well-told story.&nbsp; Educators do not come empty handed to that conversation.&nbsp; Engaging imagery, tracking sense-making and questioning meaning - that's what educators do.&nbsp; Whatever trap-door may be slammed shut, educators can find a key.</p>
<p class="text">Maybe.&nbsp; But what if education were favourably enough disposed to government to be itself susceptible to capture?</p>
<ul>
<li>is it worth asking how favourably disposed to government educators want to be? - need to be? - are?</li>
<li>what if prevalent social attitudes are more inclined to trust governing voices?</li>
<li>and suppose governmental and commercial priorities were to become interchangeable with each other?</li>
<li>would it then be possible that terms like &lsquo;markets&rsquo;, &lsquo;brands&rsquo;, &lsquo;customers&rsquo;, and &lsquo;choice&rsquo; meld education's aims with political and business-world claims? - okay with that?</li>
<li>if these are trends, then should educators be using on-line sources to track them? - and any place for &lsquo;professional&rsquo; and &lsquo;popular&rsquo; journalism?</li>
<li>and how much of this do government&rsquo;s &lsquo;expert&rsquo; advisers illuminate? - or do its commercially-based lobbyists?</li>
<li>should any of this be a concern of educators? - and would that be only if it concerns education and assessment? - or if it affects student&rsquo;s chances in life? - or because it has broader stakeholder significance? - like what?</li>
<li>but what if such trends are already shaping stakeholders attitudes? - how, then, is any of this making learning-for-living more accessible to some people? - and less to others?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">If any part of this line of conversation seeks to maintain independence then it is more than about skills and theory, it's about ethics.&nbsp; It seems to me to be easier to make ethical claims in mission statements, than to demonstrate ethical commitments in a crisis.&nbsp; There is here the makings a conversation for educators, their mentors, trainers, associations and theorists to get into.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">Because the situation is critical, an independent education service faces formidable issues...</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose educators are asked to treat what students bring out of art, work and creativity as no more than saleable commodities?</li>
<li>what if history were to become a feel-good account of a great nation&rsquo;s leaders?</li>
<li>on another tack, would it matter if an uncomprehended &lsquo;nudge&rsquo; supplants any need to understand the whys-and-wherefores for taking action? - or if back-of-the-envelope &lsquo;tips&rsquo; were thought to be enough to guide what people need to do?</li>
<li>and what if, then, any resulting self-confidence and positive thinking become the prime outcomes of education? - and if not that, something more troublesome? - like asking awkward questions - or dissent?</li>
<li>would it matter if any me-and-mine individualism tightened its hold on curriculum? - setting aside the sense people make of their experience in their neighbourhoods? - about their inheritance and upbringing? - among their connections? - and their attachments to others?</li>
<li>would psychology then be strong enough to carry the explanatory freight concerning what people learn? - and what they do with the opportunity to learn? - rather than an understanding social-and-cultural-group influences on their attitudes?</li>
<li>and would any loss of the sense of living-with-others mean that local and systemic influences on learning are down-played? - allowing the need for socially-located help to be curtailed? - and, despite policy-and-commercial claims to &lsquo;openness&rsquo;, not open to scrutiny?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">There is evidence that political pronouncements shape prevalent attitudes.&nbsp; But policy promises of &lsquo;freedom&rsquo; might not be freedom as most people think of it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s freedom for families to manoeuvre into high-rated schools, and for commerce to edge education towards privatisation.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not freedom for families get their kids into a local school which they have come to think of as theirs.&nbsp; Nor for independently-minded teachers to escape derogatory labelling.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s certainly not a freedom that John Lennon imagined &lsquo;would make the world as one&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="text">A third piece of imagery: are there any traces here of George Orwell&rsquo;s <a title="orwell" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087803" target="_blank">nightmare</a>? - take control of the language, substitute belief for reality, re-write the past.&nbsp; Evidence of social control includes reports of clever news management neutralising what policy does not want heard, smothering it with press releases which are cut-and-pasted into news items by compliant journalists.&nbsp; The media gain is to capture attention and extend the reach of advertising.&nbsp; Popular demands for satisfaction make for a headline-driven curriculum requiring educators to come up with solutions to situations where they can have no control.&nbsp; And much of each requirement is written by politicos, their advisers and lobbyists.&nbsp; Some of it is lies.</p>
<p class="text">There are different interests at stake here - different students, different educators, in different communities, differently benefit - and are differently harmed.&nbsp; But independent educators make a different use of the headline-driven curriculum: enabling a critical grasp of what the media claim, engaging students in asking on what evidence?, on behalf of whom?, and why?&nbsp; How many politicos have you noticed asking for such disturbance?</p>
<p class="text"><strong>&nbsp;<br /></strong></p>
<p class="text"><strong>community voice</strong></p>
<p class="text">The politics of promise rests on a belief in the possibility of unlimited growth.&nbsp; The evidence is that the economics of such beliefs is unreliable, especially concerning the risks and costs of collateral damage.&nbsp; And that damage ranges from the personal-and-frightening, to the planetary-and-catastrophic.&nbsp; People need a new narrative, making new sense and based on sane assumptions.</p>
<p class="text">Isn&rsquo;t that what education is for?&nbsp; It would be surprising to find that no teacher wanted to help with any part of the processes suggested here.&nbsp; A tough test is the purest of all disciplines - maths (said to be god's language).&nbsp; The most basic grasp of probability undermines the most plausible of bogus promises.&nbsp; That educator needs only to understand that this is not just about acquiring skills for an examination, it&rsquo;s about transferring learning into life.</p>
<p class="text">There&rsquo;s much talk of curriculum reform; a lot of it about the needs of the economy and the usefulness to employers.&nbsp; That story needs retelling...</p>
<ul>
<li>suppose we start from an assertion that a pressing need for education is to enable the navigation of a path through change? - how far would the features of that challenge be to deal with overload? - confusion? - deception? - risk? - and what more?</li>
<li>would that mean enabling people to probe and interrogate every promise, enticement and manoeuvre?</li>
<li>and how far do they need to be able to do that as individuals? - with friends? - in groups? - on-line?</li>
<li>do current conditions need an increased ability to scrutinise, probe and interrogate persuaders? - does the phrase &lsquo;critical thinking&rsquo; convey any of this?</li>
<li>if so, is enough attention given to critical thinking in calls for reform from policy? - commerce? - the media? - religion? - if not, is it up to educators to do more about it? - and students? - and other stakeholders?</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">Not all educators will say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to all of this.&nbsp; But this reform doesn&rsquo;t need all educators.&nbsp; The need is for independent educators.&nbsp; Who work with the voice of stakeholders.&nbsp; With their ethics in good order.</p>
<p class="text">The issues raised here are locally experienced, but they are globally generated.&nbsp; The planet is peppered with regimes who find it easier to nudge, entice, cajole and threaten people into compliance than to educate them into autonomy.&nbsp; They breed dependence on dominant and controlling voices.&nbsp; They feed into every conflict, fear and risk that we all face.&nbsp; It justifies violence against outsiders and breeds docility in the group.&nbsp; Educators were never more deeply and urgently implicated.&nbsp; Not least in the UK.</p>
<p>A fourth piece of imagery: John Lennon, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell each rates his mention.&nbsp; But so does Norman <a title="Jewison" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZFaPezzM4k" target="_blank">Jewison</a>, for his movie <em>Rollerball</em> (since disastrously re-made).&nbsp; It tells of a world where global commerce has become the government, shaping what people are to believe, value and expect.&nbsp; The instrument of control is the game - fast, extreme, where winning and losing has life-and-death significance - and, it seems, is impossible to resist.&nbsp; It seems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>why so much detail?</strong></p>
<p class="text">Is there too much to bother about here?&nbsp; Some say so.&nbsp; But the evidence is that the more ideas we take on board the greater our repertoire for action.&nbsp; Complexity is not necessarily the problem, in some form it's necessary to the solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is certainly much more going on in teaching-and-learning than is immediately obvious.&nbsp; Anyone who wants not to be bothered by complexity should stay away from curriculum.</p>
<p class="text">The task of reform is, then, demanding.&nbsp; A sane understand must explain uncomfortable causes-and- effects if we are effectively to deal with crises concerning our economy, technology and security.&nbsp; What we do about education is doubly important: for how educators help students now, and for how students go on learning - life-wide and life-long.</p>
<p class="text">The enemy of all this is not &lsquo;what-if&rsquo; thinking.&nbsp; The biggest danger is &lsquo;if-only&rsquo; thinking.&nbsp; I doubt that there has been a reform movement that has not been colonised by such single-minded claims...</p>

<p class="qote"><em>if only we could get back to... - if only they had more... - if only somebody would...</em></p>

<p class="text">It&rsquo;s people zeroing-in on the opportunity to get their idea, or interest, or programme on-board.&nbsp; The argument is, often enough, that...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>there&rsquo;s no need to start again, we know what we need to do</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">But we don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Education is in unprecedented crisis.&nbsp; The economic, technological and cultural trends move at an accelerating rate, and on a global scale.&nbsp; They are invading &nbsp;students, their helpers and their communities with what are, at times, unmanageable demands. &nbsp;We may not be able start again, but we are able to imagine - and to imagine what it would be like to start from scratch...</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="qote"><em>knowing what we know about how things are - and if we were building a new education service - what would we build in?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text">This is not colonising the action with ready-made proposals.&nbsp; But neither is it discarding all the proposals that are within reach.&nbsp; If we can agree about what&rsquo;s going on, in all its complexity, then we can trawl proposals that can be adapted to those needs.&nbsp; And the more we&rsquo;ve got to go on, the better.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">This innovative strategy does not start with provision but with need.&nbsp; The perspectives which inform the process are not from institutions but from more widely-rooted stakeholders.&nbsp; It is, then, a process of letting go and holding on.&nbsp; It discards what is no longer appropriate, useful or tenable.&nbsp; And it turns to what is.&nbsp; This is what needs mind-boggling imagination, enables learning-for-living usefulness, and calls on root-and-branch innovation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve framed the issues outside dominant interests.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s why you can reframe them.&nbsp; I want you to.&nbsp; There are some issues on which I would be pleased to be proved wrong.</p>

              <title>Joe&#39;s design narrative: introducing interactive whiteboards within a high school department </title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8341</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8341</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Education challenges are situated within a specific context and incorporating/designing new interventions must take this into account. Logistics and resourcing are key components to consider.</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>About a decade ago, as interactive whiteboards and digital projectors became more popular in English secondary schools, the senior management team of the school within which I worked asked/wanted the science department to make more use of a recently purchased interactive whiteboard.</p>
<p>This was a single interactive whiteboard, which was available for use by the science department. The interactive whiteboard had to be booked and was shared with other departments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were 9 science teachers within the department. I, the head of department and one other science teacher were already using the interactive whiteboard in our science lessons. There was some resistance from the other science teachers in using the interactive whiteboard (essentially they had been offered no training with the technology - or in resource creation - and said it could currently add little to their teachings as no useful resources available and they had no time to develop resources). There was also resistance from the science technicians as they claimed it would be another task they would be &lsquo;lumbered with co-ordinating&rsquo; as they would have to move the whiteboard around the school site.</p>
<h2>My role</h2>
<p>As I had some previous experience in this area the head of science department passed this task on to me to action.</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p><strong>What the school wanted:</strong> increased use of the interactive whiteboard by the science department.</p>
<p><strong>What the head of department wanted:</strong> the interactive whiteboard task highlighted by the senior management team (SMT) resolved to a satisfactory conclusion for the SMT.</p>
<p><strong>What the science teachers wanted:</strong> training and access to ready-made resources for use with the interactive whiteboard.</p>
<p><strong>The perceived challenge:</strong> the SMT thought increased use of the interactive whiteboard itself would help (in part) improve the science (and any other) department. There was paranoia and mistrust within the science department regarding an initiative suggested by the SMT, the science department thought they were being unfairly targeted (part of an &lsquo;us&rsquo; and &lsquo;them&rsquo; culture). However, there was no wider resource-sharing between the science teachers within the department, which my work on this task highlighted as the biggest issue to overcome.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><strong>SMT:</strong> I highlighted to SMT the fact use of the interactive whiteboard alone would not improve a department; resources would be needed for more interactive whiteboards if any intervention was to be anything more than supplemental to department&rsquo;s offering; resources would also be needed for technology specific software and staff training (not assuming proficiency or ability to learn by some of the teachers). I also suggested grouping separate departments together for new strategies to overcome possible &lsquo;us&rsquo; and &lsquo;them&rsquo;; and &lsquo;being targeted&rsquo; issues.</p>
<p><strong>Head of department:</strong> there was a need to create a departmental culture of resource-sharing and this would have to be led by the head of department. Giving individual teacher&rsquo;s responsibility for separate parts of the curriculum was a suggested starting point in resource creation/sourcing, as was limiting resource development to one key stage initially.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers within the department:</strong> I ran a training session on suggested ways the interactive whiteboard could be used both interactively and passively (as a digital projector). I created some simple template resources in PowerPoint for use by the department (trading off some of the resource interactivity with the important characteristic of &lsquo;recreatability&rsquo; by novice and expert teacher creator alike for future sustainable working).</p>
<p><strong>Science technicians:</strong> together with the technicians I created a booking form for the interactive whiteboard which the science teachers would have to complete sufficiently in advance if they wished to book the whiteboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><strong>SMT:</strong> agreed to purchase of departmental specific resources and future purpose of departmental whiteboard. Though the SMT felt training needs should be met in-house.</p>
<p><strong>Head of department:</strong> agreed to lead on resource-sharing culture (creating first resources for use by other teachers) to support interactive whiteboard use and also to push for greater resource expenditure in support of this area.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers within department:</strong> agreed to create resources on a rolling basis targeting on key stage at a time. Two-thirds of the teachers produced resources for use by the wider department; the same proportion began to use the interactive whiteboard on a regular basis, usage increasing with resource availability.</p>
<p><strong>Science technicians:</strong> eventually saw the interactive whiteboard as just another piece of science kit to be ordered.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><strong>SMT:</strong> the SMT purchased subject specific software for the department without consulting the department for expertise. It was later agreed future software purchases should be signed-off by head of department.</p>
<p><strong>Head of department:</strong> became a great advocate for the whiteboard use and resource creation with the school.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers within department:</strong> as more teachers within department became regular users of the interactive whiteboard, clashes for using the whiteboard resources arose (led to purchase of departmental interactive whiteboard). Teachers became increasingly more confident in whiteboard use and creation of specific resources; they thrived on the additional responsibility of taking ownership of expertise within the curriculum and this transferred across to all areas of resource development within the department.</p>
<p><strong>Learners:</strong> a departmental survey of pupils several months later stated learner preference for lessons in which the interactive whiteboard was used as being more fun (this survey was later used by the SMT as evidence for rolling out use in other departments).</p>]]></description>

              <title>careers work - distinct or extinct?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8226</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>Careers work helps people manage working-life.&nbsp; The signs in the UK are that public-sector careers work has been seriously marginalised by government policy - some would say pretty-well abandoned.&nbsp; Neither does it seem to be getting reliable support from employers.&nbsp; With a labour economy in crisis, surely a service that helps people into work should be a star turn.&nbsp; What went wrong?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more going on here than blame and complaint can help with.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m arguing that careers work needs a new start.&nbsp; I certainly don&rsquo;t see extinction as inevitable.&nbsp; But I do say that the new start needs to be distinctive.</p>
<p>Careers work has more to offer than policy, commerce and its competitors show any sign of appreciating.&nbsp; That offer can put careers workers into a new relationship with students and clients.&nbsp; And with its stakeholder and community groups.&nbsp; It also means expanding its relationship with education.&nbsp; That would be new - conventional careers work has never needed any grasp of what is entailed in setting up a progressive learning programme... until now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>what&rsquo;s the problem?</strong></p>
<p>A distinctive new start means more than re-aligning past practice for future use.&nbsp; Too much is changing, confused and disputed.&nbsp; Part of the trouble is in the way policy sees public-sector careers work.&nbsp; Some of it is in how public-sector careers work sees itself...</p>
<ul>
<li>neo-liberal policy&rsquo;s reliance on private-sector solutions has fatally damaged public-sector careers work&nbsp;</li>
<li>the fit between professional career-development expertise and day-to-day career-management experience is seriously askew</li>
</ul>
<p>These are changing political and cultural, and not just economic, realities.&nbsp; The question they pose for careers work is...</p>
<p align="center"><em>can its people re-imagine what it is to start from scratch?</em></p>
<p>Public-service careers work has competitors.&nbsp; For an entrepreneur change, confusion and dispute is a business opportunity - bad news is good news.&nbsp; The news is a multi-billion-dollar world-wide career-coaching industry.&nbsp; And, like many entrepreneurial initiatives, private-sector careers work draws on what the public-sector has already developed.&nbsp; There is more than a century of careers-work research-and-development to import - much of it still useful.</p>
<p>So the private is pre-empting the public.&nbsp; And the safest assumption for public-service careers work is that its twentieth-century status is irrecoverable.&nbsp; Actually policy support for that status was never that reliable.&nbsp; But all of that was then, my assumption for now is that a twenty-first-century recovery is within reach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I take the distinctiveness of that new-start position to be critical.&nbsp; And that means not doing again what careers work has always done, but doing what only public-service careers work can do. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s why I think there must be a new deal with communities and their educators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>what&rsquo;s the deal?</strong></p>
<p>A distinctive careers work professionalism can afford to let go of the conventional matching techniques which link personal characteristics to work-life opportunities.&nbsp; In essence this is pegs-and-holes help, and that is what most people assume careers work does. &nbsp;It&lsquo;s also a good fit with what policy and commerce seek from careers work.&nbsp; And, according to its own websites, it is what career coaching has imported.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s wholly possible that versions of its diagnostic and information processes can appear free-to-access on-line.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not much wrong with all of this.&nbsp; But it will not take people far enough into the management of today&rsquo;s working life.</p>
<p>Re-aligning careers work with that day-on-day experience needs more.&nbsp; The experience is as likely to be...</p>
<ul>
<li>concerned for my child-care as much as for their entry requirements</li>
<li>more worried about exploitation-risk than talent-matching</li>
<li>wondering how I look good for work if I've never found work</li>
<li>more attached to whose respect I must retained than to expert abstractions</li>
<li>as interested in work's impact on other lives as its rewards for my own</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s more, much more, to say about contemporary career. &nbsp;The point is that for careers work to pull back from who-we-are, and reach out to who-they-are, is to see career differently.&nbsp; And a person&rsquo;s control of that story is that person&rsquo;s command of career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it happens, recounting a story is increasingly understood as our species' default position for sorting out what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; But advance should tread carefully, narrative is also fashionable.&nbsp; And &lsquo;cool&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t so much educate as entice.&nbsp; So the deal is not to jump onto the narrative band-wagon.&nbsp; It is to draw on careers work&rsquo;s own rigorous take on narrative - both its use and its abuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is no hawking of inspirational stories.&nbsp; On the contrary, it is critical thinking.&nbsp; Any narrative, whether other peoples&rsquo; or my own, can as easily mislead as inform.&nbsp; A story needs to be interrogated to where it can become a basis for action.&nbsp; Not short-cut action, but a discovery... maybe a surprise... sometimes a turning-point.&nbsp; It is learning for action which is fulfilling, sustainable and liveable.&nbsp; And it calls for a careers work that meets people where they find things out, and takes them to where they can figure out what's worth their time and energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not learning for assessment or recruitment, it's learning for well-being.&nbsp; The questions are whether that deal can be clinched with...</p>
<p align="center"><em><br />students?<br />stakeholders?<br />partners?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>job-or-no-job careers work</strong></p>
<p>A new start means new priorities.&nbsp; This is not a defence of conventional expertise, it&rsquo;s a case for learner autonomy.&nbsp; Information, guidance and placement leads are available all over, but people need to be able usefully to learn from them for themselves.&nbsp; And that learning must reliably navigate a way through job-or-no-job change, confusion and dispute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most able and most in-touch helping agencies enable that learning - they are distinctive...</p>
<ul>
<li>seeing learning as readiness for assessment and selection</li>
<li>but distinctively as learning-for-living</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>working with individual perceptions</li>
<li>but distinctively in their social and cultural contexts</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>taking on careers work&rsquo;s expertise in economics and psychology</li>
<li>but distinctively expanding it into the disciplines of the arts, sociology and ethics</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>calling on bi-lateral partnerships</li>
<li>but distinctively forming multi-laterals across the curriculum and among community agencies</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>producing some basic how-to-do lessons</li>
<li>but distinctively integrating them into stage-by-stage learning programmes</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>working with the well connected</li>
<li>but distinctively seeking out the many not yet finding their stake in society</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are issue for the Career Development Institute (CDI).&nbsp; Its leadership has already unified a scattering of professional associations, each maintaining its own position.&nbsp; The question now is...</p>
<p align="center"><em>how does public-sector careers work move on from there?</em></p>
<p>All of this calls for a broader appreciation of psychology, a more critical examination of economics, a wider grasp of social forces, and a sharper appreciation of ethics.&nbsp; Tightly-focussed career guidance, offering immediate gains, has too little elbow for such thought.&nbsp; It never managed to shake off its reliance on auxiliary lessons clinging to the edge-of-timetable.&nbsp; A new start needs to stand back for long enough, and look deeply enough, to see things as though it had never seen them before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>living uncomfortably</strong></p>
<p>There is no significant learning to be had inside a comfort zone.&nbsp; It is a disturbing process of both holding-on and letting-go.&nbsp; This is not comforting, it is arguing - sometimes with yourself.&nbsp; But that is not being difficult, negative or disapproving.&nbsp; Though it must be creatively destructive, so that a promising future is allowed to displace a dysfunctional past.</p>
<p>Argument is good at showing why what is welcomed as fair and reasonable by some can be dismissed as dangerous and misleading by others.&nbsp; Commerce, policy and professionalism all have an interest in focusing comfortably.&nbsp; And, for careers work that focus has been more on what is up-close-and-personal, less on what is out-there-and-pervasive. &nbsp;Conventional careers work has a lot to say about what an individual can offer... might adapt for... and will fit into. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But suppose that is not all that students, partners and stakeholders need to talk about.&nbsp; What if they need acknowledgement of how things stack up differently when you look around a bit - taking account of what is going on in...</p>
<ul>
<li>the interview? - yes, but what about...</li>
<li>the learning-programme surrounding it? - yes, but what about...</li>
<li>the neighbourhood and its culture? - yes, but what about...</li>
<li>the region&rsquo;s communities and their work-life? - yes, but what about...</li>
<li>the continent positioned in a global economy?</li>
</ul>
<p>Any helping agency&rsquo;s understanding of what is going on in career depends on what its people are ready to face up to - and where they want to hide.</p>
<p class="Body1">And the future of any helping profession depends on how many uncomfortable questions it is prepared to ask.&nbsp; But, more importantly, that future depends on who it is prepared to turn to for the answers...</p>
<p class="Body1" align="center"><em>is this where you come in?</em></p>

<p><strong>I love the simplicity of <a class="zem_slink" title="Jenga" href="http://www.hasbro.com/games/en_US/jenga/" rel="homepage" target="_blank">Jenga</a>. </strong></p>
<p>Simplicity has a purity about it. Don't knock it. Behind its functionality and its look and feel there will be some hard thinking. Keep it simple, stupid (<a class="zem_slink" title="KISS principle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">K.I.S.S</a>) may be a training cliche but there is considerable truth in it. I've now had three years here at <a class="zem_slink" title="Open University" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.025,-0.705555555556&spn=0.01,0.01&q=52.025,-0.705555555556 (Open University)&t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">the OU</a> and here on this Student Blog platform (short of five days). I've been working on my ideas regarding learning and e-learning design in particular. Courtesy of THE OU hosted <a title="OLDS Mooc 2013" href="http://www.olds.ac.uk/the-course">OLDs MOOC 2013</a> (Online Learning Design - <a class="zem_slink" title="Massive open online course" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">Massive Open Online Course</a>) I'm experiencing what feels like undertaking an 8 week written examination - the contents of my brain are being pushed through the cookie cutter. And out comes this: <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Il Buono, il Brutto, il Cattivo.)" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/good_the_bad_and_the_ugly" rel="rottentomatoes" target="_blank">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a>.</strong> <em>(Of course I had shut down for the gadgets for the day and was brushing my teeth when this came to me).</em></p>

<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<p>Learning events or activities, moments that make the participant smile, think, reflect, nod in agreement, understand, be informed and generally feel good about the world and this particular learning experience. Hit them with some of this, as the say so succinctly across the Atlantic - at the 'get go'.</p>
<p><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xUqWmeLuB0QOqucJi6k559MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zR7R8ogXYIc/UQtZAD_QDfI/AAAAAAAAi3Y/aeF3UVn7Dfk/s288/The%20bad.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<p>The effort required and built into the learning. OK, we want them to love this too, and you can if you're 'in the flow', have done your work, have wrestled with what you didn't understand, asked for help, listen to fellow students, gone out of your way to do extra reading and research until you have it, one way or another.</p>
<p><strong>There needs to be assessment.</strong></p>
<p>An assignment is a soft assessment to me - though like everyone I have terrible days when the thing just slips through my fingers like a snowball on the beach. A dissertation or end of module assignment is tougher, but tough and 'bad' in a certain way - like commitment to a triathlon. And a good analogy as working on and developing three issues at 2,000 words a pop is about right. And you won't get far if you leave training to the week before. It's a slow burn.</p>
<p><strong>The 'bad' has to be the written examination.</strong></p>
<p>They have to be hated and feared, and like learning lines for that school play, you have to get it right on the night (or day). And what do you do if you act? You have good lines to learn, you learn and rehearse your lines and you practice, and do a test run or two. The curtains going up is the equivalent of your turning the examination paper over. I feel the fear from a year ago - April 2012. I hadn't sat a written exam in 30 years. All my undergraduate and school-boy fears came back. I used rusty techniques that had last seen service during my first degree. Bad is good. You want to do everything not to feel like you are naked on stage - a dream we all have when faced with such an 'exposing' test? <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/wWqqYfaV0PTh72j4OhD1ldMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IvhCwe5Layc/UQtZGBhaShI/AAAAAAAAi3g/Q-hkvFUPdk8/s288/The%20ugly.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Ugly</strong></p>
<p>Shock 'em. Not scare the witless. Have up your sleeve some smart stuff. Whether an idea or the technology offer a creepy and certainly memorable surprise. Boring a student into making a fact or issue stick is like throwing mud at a brick wall - it'll stick, it'll coagulate and build up, but is easily washed away in a shower and destroyed in a storm. Use storytelling techniques perhaps, better still, follow the pattern of a ghost story. Scare them? I'm back on fear I guess. We humans are fearful of many things and will go out of our way to avoid, run away or confront our fears. As I said, the idea here isn't to lose your students, but to empathise with them, understand the ugly side of their learning experience then help them confront their worst fears. It is ugly having to tackle the parts of a subject that stink, but inevitably these are the blocks at the base of JENGA.</p>
<p>My primary colours for learning design, not red, blue and yellow, but good, bad and ugly. We'll have to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So can I apply it? And can I go back to bed now?</strong></p>
<p>Which leads me to another theme - we no longer simply bring work home with us, we take it to bed and sleep with it. If this pisses you off then let me introduce you to 'working with dreams'. If you are prepared to get up for an hour in the dead of night, or can flick on a light without invoking divorce then scribble stuff down to catalyse the thought in the morning. Can work wonders, can produce nonsense, can just be some things you need to put on the supermarket shopping list ... or another dream of being naked on the stage, not knowing your lines and needing the lo but all the exits are locked and the orchestra has stopped and you have to say something. <em>Which, courtesy of the wonders of the mind, has me in the front row of a performance of The Tempest at the University Theatre, Newcastle when I was 13 or 14. Caliban was naked, covered in mud and wearing a prosthetic erect penis.</em></p>
<p><strong>HORROR!</strong></p>
<p><em>P.S. And give me 20 minutes searching the Internet and I will be able to name the actor, date the show and possibly even find a picture. Perhaps you'd like to have a go. But before you do so, be very fearful of what the search terms you use might throw up. </em> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>P.P.S. I've given up (for now). It may have been David Suchet or Jim Carter. The production was in 1974 at the University Theatre.&nbsp;</em></p>]]></description>

              <title>narrative as a critical voice of experience in contemporary career management</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6973</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>This paper tracks the development of a career-management narrative technique called &lsquo;three-scene storyboarding&rsquo; <a href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank">(Law, 2012)</a>.&nbsp; The method invites the recounting of significant events - things happening, involving other people, displaying points-of-view and calling up personal thoughts and feelings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An important side-effect of this work is for finding the dissonances, and they have compelling research implications.&nbsp; The dissonances are between the different ways in which career management is spoken of by government, among professionals and in this narrated experience.&nbsp; The uses of narrative help us better to understand the reciprocal positioning of business interests, policy imperatives and professional expertise.&nbsp; They also help us to understand the disconnection of all of that from day-to-day realities of personal and community living <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/http;/www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf" target="_blank">(Law, 2013)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>decision making and moving on</strong></p>
<p>The aim of storyboarding is to enable people to find meaning and establish purpose for moving on in life. &nbsp;The person is invited to set down a words-and-images account of an episode in which there is a turning-point - a scene where things can be changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The appeal to narrated episodes and scenes is distinctive in careers work.&nbsp; It allows for a more progressive and less stark engagement than does matching a person to an opportunity. &nbsp;The uses of storyboarding are less about decision-making for immediate action.&nbsp; They are also less about choice between a range of options.&nbsp; Instead storyboarding sets down a scene-by-scene narrative of moving on - from a remembered past to an anticipated future.&nbsp; And, in that process, a person works on what from the past to hold onto, and what to let go.&nbsp; Decision and choices are made, but they are contained within a broader and deeper account of how a person is moving on in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>expertise and experience</strong></p>
<p>The development of storyboarding is a response to changing economic and cultural conditions - where, increasingly, career options are constrained, persuasive pressures are intensified, and work-life flexibility is required <a title="professionalism.pdf" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" target="_blank">(Law, 2011)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The uses of narrative shifts focus - away from what professional helpers know, and towards what people do.&nbsp; It repositions careers work - less on expertise, more on experience.&nbsp; The appropriate terms are, then, not of professional knowledge of &lsquo;career development&rsquo;, but of people's experience in &lsquo;career management&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the UK that experience is rapidly changing, increasingly disturbing and seemingly chaotic.&nbsp; <a title="Baumann" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Liquid-Modernity-Zygmunt-Bauman/dp/0745624103/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1357896745&sr=1-6" target="_blank">Zygmunt Baumann (2000)</a>&nbsp; calls that perpetual re-shaping 'liquid modernity'.&nbsp; Storyboarding is designed to enable people - in that apparent chaos - to attribute meaning, to arrive at purposes, and to interrogate that narrative to where it becomes appropriate and sustainable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process calls up visualisations of personal flexibility - and, therefore, of social mobility.&nbsp; An underlying philosophical assumption is that nothing that anybody does about anything need be inevitable.&nbsp; <a title="Dennett" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias=stripbooks&field-keywords=daniel+dennett+freedom+evolves" target="_blank">Daniel Dennett (2003) </a>refers to such freedoms as 'evitability'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>analysis and narrative<br /></strong></p>
<p>For the first hundred years of careers work its processes and materials were designed for expanding economies - which they have best served. &nbsp; A persistent aim has been to enable client employability.&nbsp; A greater part of the process is to diagnose by psychological assessments, and these are framed by labour-market requirements.&nbsp; A major task is to match that psychology to that economics.&nbsp; Much of UK careers-work expertise is currently defined, trained and credited in such terms <a title="CDI" href="http://www.careermark.co.uk/news/career-development-institute-and-careers-profession-register" target="_blank">(CDI, undated)</a>.</p>
<p>But employability is not a reliable concept: a single diagnosis produces variable results.&nbsp; That one person, on that single occasion, is shown to have more and less employability as the economy expands and contracts.&nbsp; Employability is less in the characteristics of the person, and more in the availability of the work.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are cultural shifts undermining the usefulness of the term employability.&nbsp; Trail-blazing signals are fired up in a commentary on contemporary career management <a title="Bunting" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Willing-Slaves-Overwork-Culture-Ruling/dp/000716372X/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1357898306&sr=1-1-spell" target="_blank">(Madeleine Bunting, 2004)</a>.&nbsp; It describes working life as having causes and consequences for well-being, for relationships and for health.&nbsp; These concerns do not feature in a tightly-focussed consideration of matched employability.&nbsp; Madeleine Bunting redirects attention to social settings and wider experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She attracted little attention in the careers-work field.&nbsp; But her analysis suggested a monograph <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/http;/www.hihohiho.com/underpinning/caffutures.pdf" target="_blank">(Law, 2006a)</a> which contrasts the much-used term &lsquo;labour-market information&rsquo; with the newly-coined term &lsquo;labour-market experience&rsquo;.&nbsp; It argues that people are at least as responsive to their own experience as they are to professional help, to political urging or to commercial invitations.</p>
<p>There are closely-parallel calls in Greece for a repositioning of careers work (Chrysoula Kosmidou-Hardy, 1990 &amp; 2006).&nbsp; Such arguments respond to career-management concerns which take into account how working life affects all life - from personal well-being, through social congeniality to planetary survival <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/http;/www.hihohiho.com/newthinking/cafcoach.pdf" target="_blank">(Law, 2013)</a>.&nbsp; Careers workers live with a perpetual clamour - dominant interest groups claiming careers-work support for different positions on any of these concerns.&nbsp; Any headline can increase the volume.</p>
<p>A critical feature of all learning is how it is framed.&nbsp; Much of matching processes are expressed as lists - such as appear in worksheets, inventories, psychometrics and data-bases.&nbsp; But experience is best set down as a narrative - telling of how one thing leads to another.&nbsp; Lists cannot adequately represent such sequences.&nbsp; The distinction is developed in the monograph <em>Fewer Lists - More Stories</em> <a href="http://www.hihohiho/underpinning/cafbiog.pdf" target="_blank">(Law, 2006b)</a> which examines how career-management experience usefully can be set down in narrative forms.&nbsp; Three-scene storyboarding is a product of that thinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>possibility and pragmatism</strong></p>
<p>Daniel Dennett <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias=stripbooks&field-keywords=daniel+dennett+freedom+evolves" target="_blank">(<em>op. cit.</em>)</a>, drawing on a range of evidence, develops modelling to illustrate an ontology of how people understand the way things are.&nbsp; He characterises <em>homo-sapiens </em>as having evolved to be able to identity a repertoire of possible meanings for any experience.&nbsp; He claims that we are, in that sense, free - all is 'evitable'.&nbsp; That multiple grasp on reality has survival value.&nbsp; And careers work needs a way of seeing how what has evolved on the savannah becomes useful in contemporary experience.&nbsp; Nothing need be inevitable.</p>
<p>Peter Sloterdijk <a title="Sloterdijk " href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Philosophy-Wisdom-Practice/dp/0231158718/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1357899280&sr=1-5" target="_blank">(2012)</a> moves the philosophy forward.&nbsp; He closely examines the epistemology of how we come to believe what is going on, and the ethics of how we find it worthwhile.&nbsp; Both are pragmatic questions.&nbsp; And Peter Sloterdijk&rsquo;s pragmatism is particularly useful to professional engagement with career-management narratives.&nbsp; He argues for connectedness to every-day experience, and for independence-of-mind in dealing with the clamour-for-attention surrounding careers-work professionals.</p>
<p>Calling on philosophical roots, especially Socrates and Plato, Peter Sloterdijk documents an age-by-age account of clamour and entrapment.&nbsp; He points to how, in each age - or 'epoch&eacute;' - prevailing academic abstractions allow social &eacute;lites to take over cultural beliefs.&nbsp; He illustrates how the resulting confusions distract people from the realities of every-day experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The analysis resonates with contemporary conditions: disconnection from experts is an escape from information overload, it prefers what plainly seems up-to-date, and that can mean pursuing the fashionable and the celebrated.&nbsp; All of this is, in part, dues to an educational failure to enable people to seek out multiple - and therefore conflicting - perspectives.&nbsp; Peter Sloterdijk refers to that education as acting like a sedative.&nbsp; Disconnection from expertise is reinforced by cultural persuaders who flatter, entice, bribe and threaten people into compliance.&nbsp; Each new epoch&eacute; cultivates its own manoeuvring culture.&nbsp; And if people are not confused by that, then they are simply not paying enough attention.&nbsp; As, Peter Sloterdijk fears, too many do not.</p>
<p>The coming-and-going of these successive epoch&eacute;s is accelerating, and some people wax &lsquo;nostalgic&rsquo; for what, to others, belongs to the relatively recent past.&nbsp; But nostalgia, which is reflected in various &lsquo;inheritance&rsquo; interests, is largely about seeing how a failing past contrasts with a succeeding present.&nbsp; Each epoch&eacute;&rsquo;s &eacute;lites persuade people to believe that &lsquo;there has been little of any truth or value here, until we arrived&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, despite the efforts of the persuaders, some people&rsquo;s direct-and-personal experience teaches them that the claims of the &eacute;lites are false.&nbsp; They disconnect from that way-of-seeing things.&nbsp; It can reach a point of cultivating contemptuous distrust of all &eacute;lites, and turning to each other for trusted support.&nbsp; That isolation makes it easy for dominant interests to blame marginalised victims for the damage done to them.&nbsp; It is a dynamic that can cause deep and dangerous fragmentations in society.</p>
<p>Peter Sloterdijk&rsquo;s underpinning for this account is well-grounded, multilayered, subtle and recursive.&nbsp; But that tightly-interwoven discourse is tied to three themes - each of them critically important to careers-work professionalism...</p>
<ul>
<li>how influential &eacute;lites are formed</li>
<li>how people comply with &eacute;litist persuasion</li>
<li>how all can be reconnected to authentic experience</li>
</ul>
<p>The argument is set out in pragmatically philosophical terms, expanding the dominantly psychological and economic thinking of conventional careers work.&nbsp; Peter Sloterdijk&rsquo;s work demands that we understand careers-work in relation to the society it inhabits and to the culture which that society cultivates.&nbsp; A corollary is that connectedness needs to be predicated - to what is it to be connected?&nbsp; There are far-reaching implications for the purposes of education - and for the repositioning of careers work research-and-development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>shareholding and stakeholding</strong></p>
<p>The features of narrative - its moving through a before-during-and-after sequence, the way points-of-view move it on, how different social settings set up different expectations - all of this responds to Peter Sloterdijk's thinking.&nbsp; The only way in which such experience can be set down is through narrative.&nbsp; And all narration speaks of expectation, meaning and purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each narrative is also widely connected in its society.&nbsp; It means that its uses can be realised in a range of social settings, and can call on many different partners.&nbsp; And so the uses of narrative connect to voluntary and professional activity, engaging both face-to-face work and learning programmes, and in both the public and private sectors.&nbsp; Storyboarding is a careers-work research-and-development tool best engaged in multi-agency partnerships.</p>
<p>But connected to what?&nbsp; All interests claim that careers work is in the interests of clients.&nbsp; Peter Sloterdijk points how to critically interrogate that claim.&nbsp; He asks what &eacute;lite professional, commercial and policy interests are also at stake.&nbsp; In the business-world and in neo-liberal thinking these are shareholder interests.&nbsp; A more comprehensive connectedness would link not just to shareholders but also to stakeholders.&nbsp; These are the people and groups - most of them far from dominantly influential - all with an interest in how careers work works.&nbsp; The research-and-development agenda would then be predicated on...</p>
<ul>
<li>clients and students - their families - their neighbourhoods - and community groups</li>
<li>local business - national economy - global business</li>
<li>local planning - national and European policy - global trends</li>
<li>the employed - under-employed - exploited - unemployed - and enterprising</li>
<li>professional helpers - voluntary organisations - socially enterprising outfits</li>
</ul>
<p>Research is only as good as the questions it poses.&nbsp; The repositioning of careers work raises issues for the research questions posed and the methodologies engaged by its professionalism.&nbsp; It also calls for new thinking on who, and in what situations, careers workers are able usefully to shape the questions and design the methodologies.&nbsp; But, most comprehensively, it opens a research-and-development agenda in which no voice is allowed to dominate, and none goes unheard.</p>

              <title>David Andrews on Careers Education in Schools</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6571</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6571</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com" target="_blank">the career-learning caf&eacute;</a></p>
<p>A question...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;what is the relationship between careers education and guidance?&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Some terms, like &lsquo;CEIAG&rsquo;, suggest - in one breath - a unity.&nbsp; Such talk implies that&nbsp; 'careers education' and 'information-advice-and-guidance' share expertise, and call for the same qualifications. The one might even be thought to contain the other - a dominant partner, and its ancillary support.&nbsp; A consequence could be that anybody with a lot to say about &lsquo;IAG&rsquo; would not know that there was much more to say about &lsquo;CE&rsquo;.&nbsp; They would be unknown unknowns.</p>
<p>We are at a stage in the history of careers work where that relationship needs to be sorted.&nbsp; And David Andrews helps to explain why it hasn&rsquo;t been - and helps us to see how it can be.&nbsp; The author is well positioned to do this.&nbsp; Like few others - Anthony Barnes is among the few - David's own career includes year-on-year experience of listening to students, designing programmes, developing material and managing classrooms.&nbsp; You need that kind of grasp on the reality to make sense of careers education's tangled history.&nbsp; His chronology sets out the twists-and-turns - from its twentieth-century hope, to its twenty-first-century condition.</p>
<p>The book treats careers education as having a distinct professionalism.&nbsp; At its best careers education has its own...</p>
<ul>
<li>rationale - its justifications for existence are its own</li>
<li>objectives - it enables a distinctive range of learning outcomes</li>
<li>methods - it characteristically manages stage-by-stage learning</li>
<li>research - it rests on its own assembly of enquiries into how learning works</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that so many prominent commentators miss so much of this.&nbsp; There is a lot to know - and more to know that we don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>the history</strong></p>
<p>This is how David Andrews' exhaustive, closely-observed and well-organised gathering of information helps.&nbsp; There are run-downs on government reports, significant organisations and influential voices.&nbsp; They form a chronicle of the coming-and-going of objectives, frameworks, roles, training, material, standards, requirements, monitoring and evaluation.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s riveting stuff - some policy initiatives coming two-at-a-time and pointing in different directions.&nbsp; Expectations range over national economic performance, across equal opportunities, and into personal-and-social well-being.&nbsp; Some initiatives originate in the public sector, yet others as private enterprises.&nbsp; The account sets out careers education&rsquo;s relationships with parallel initiatives - such as Personal Social and Health Education, the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative, the National Curriculum, Education for Citizenship, and Connexions.</p>
<p>The author acknowledges parallel work.&nbsp; And it's true that there have been other chronologies setting out the story of careers services, though careers education barely gets a mention.&nbsp; And there have been other examinations of the contested pressures on careers education, but with too little on the changing contexts in which it sinks or swims.&nbsp; It's also true that there are other initiatives which share careers education&rsquo;s commitment to life-relevant learning, but they often have more to say about how to do it than whether it&rsquo;s worth doing.</p>
<p><em>Careers Education in Schools</em> shows the work is bounced around by pressure, repositioning and compromise.&nbsp; It documents the results as being at times integrated, at times competitive, and at times splintered.&nbsp; It is merciless in its scrutiny of both the events and the wider contexts in which careers education flourishes and founders.&nbsp; Both its devils and its angels are in that detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>a critical examination</strong></p>
<p>No aspect of careers work can be understood except in relation to its changing economic, cultural and political contexts.&nbsp; Every time anyone opens their mouth to speak about any aspect of careers work some allusion to that context comes out.&nbsp; Those conversations are with students, their families, politicians, colleagues, programme managers, business people, theorists and philosophers.&nbsp; This critical examination signposts the issues.&nbsp; They are for...</p>
<ul>
<li>stakeholders - who has an interest in careers education?</li>
<li>interests -&nbsp; what is it that they seek from it?</li>
<li>dissonance - can careers education hope to deliver on everything?</li>
<li>credibility - what is supported by convincing evidence?</li>
<li>ideology - with what underlying beliefs about what is valuable?</li>
<li>dominance - what are the most influential interests?</li>
<li>fairness - how do they affect those who most need career help?</li>
<li>location - where in an overall programme can such learning be realised?</li>
</ul>
<p>Understood like this careers education is not merely a welfare service in schools - handed to some kindly person who happens to be available.&nbsp; And this book's middle section provokes more demanding questions concerning...</p>
<p align="center"><em>...who gets to do what?</em><em><br />...on whose say-so?<br />...in whose interests?</em></p>
<p>They are not questions about how careers education can be saved, but an underlying search for what is worth saving.&nbsp; There shouldn't be many thinking teachers who would not be interested in that.</p>
<p>And I doubt that there are many aspects of schooling which are more exposed to such probing.&nbsp; Careers education must be among the most researched, scrutinised and manipulated in any curriculum.&nbsp; Whatever attitude other thinking teachers may take, careers educators would be crazy not to learn from that experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>looking to the future</strong></p>
<p>This third section sets up a distinction between...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;learning <strong>about</strong></em><em> careers and work&rsquo;<br />and<br />&lsquo;learning <strong>for</strong></em><em> careers and work&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>It deserves close attention.&nbsp; It raises questions about the value to students of not just competing for up-coming placement but also of exploring for unforeseen possibilities.&nbsp; And this helps to sort out where each of these most belong in the IAG-CE tangle.</p>
<p>Nobody was in any position to know what to expect of policy when, in 2011, the book was published.&nbsp; As it turned out not even the minister was.&nbsp; We know better now about how radically policy is prepared to reduce careers work and reframe schooling.&nbsp; The position of careers education in schools may well be weaker than it was in 1965.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need the account in <em>Careers Education in Schools</em> to show what has been tried, what has worked well, and what has failed to deliver.&nbsp; The book also shows how careers education was never as strong as it deserved to be.&nbsp; I wonder whether that has anything to do with its apparently ancillary role, which was never going to attract enough interested attention from the ablest in the teaching profession.</p>
<p>But we are where we are.&nbsp; And the book examines current policy statements which promise a liberation of schooling - both in its structures and its programmes.&nbsp; That gives careers education something to play for.&nbsp; But it won&rsquo;t play well unless it understands what is proposed, why, and where the levers for action are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me that, if careers workers are to take their future into their own hands, the outcomes will depend more on the level and quality of professional commitment, and less on compliance with statutory requirements.&nbsp; For any education professionals who take this prospect seriously David Andrews&rsquo; account is a unique resource.&nbsp; Each chapter is a rounded story.&nbsp; The references in each are themselves the products of assiduous search.&nbsp; The index is excellent.</p>
<p>An appendix sets out options for the future organisation of careers education.&nbsp; I don't know that I would recommend showing it to senior managers - they already have enough problems.&nbsp; But every school has colleagues who can be interested in the uses of education that this book describes.&nbsp; And it has enough scope to interest a teacher of any subject.&nbsp; So, instead of trying to distract pre-occupied bosses, look for a friend, get something going that looks more like a solution than a problem, and show them that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If professional freedom means anything it means the ability to do that.&nbsp; It puts us in a new situation.&nbsp; It gives professionalism a new place to start.</p>
<p>Would you call that 'innovation'?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ___________________________</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Panel: Jamie Caras, David Harris, Marc T. Sher</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Limited access to higher education is one the greatest challenges faced by students today. The recent economic slowdown coupled with the increasing costs of education has forced educational institutions of all levels to reevaluate the way they use their resources. As educators begin to explore ways to cut costs, they are beginning to discover that Open Educational Resources (OER) have the potential to not only drive down cost of education but also to increase its flexibility.&nbsp;<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" />However, significant barriers remain: procuring and organizing OER resources can be time consuming, quality standards are inconsistent, few OER platforms inter-operate, and local awareness of OER remains low in the broader education space.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" /><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" />This panel will overview the current &ldquo;chasm&rdquo; that OER has to cross in order to reach mainstream acceptance. The panel provides the unique perspectives of an OER publisher (David Harris, Editor-in-Chief Connexions and OpenStax College), a faculty member (Prof. Marc T. Sher of the College of William and Mary), and a for-profit education service provider (Dr. Jamie Caras, President of Sapling Learning). The panel will discuss the following questions:</p>
<ol style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->What is the awareness of OER on college campuses today?</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->What are the content/development requirements to achieve wide-scale adoption of OER?</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->How do OER advocates effectively reach the decision makers?</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->How can social media enable broader adoption of OER?</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->What new cooperative ecosystem is required for financial sustainability?</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->How do we develop common standards for OER?</li>
<li style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Can OER only compete when it&rsquo;s available anywhere, at any time, on any device?</li>
</ol>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" />A diverse array current OER examples will be introduced to demonstrate current attempts to cross the chasm, including OpenStax College (an initiative of Connexions), Flatworld Knowlege, The Orange Grove, OCWC, stacked credential efforts, and emerging referatories. The session will conclude with a strategy discussion on ideas to propel OER into the mainstream.</p>]]></description>

MOOCs and their implications nearly toppled a president at a major research university last spring, and disruptions like these are sure to continue. Yet these extraordinary developments do not by themselves constitute success for open education. As we seek to move &ldquo;beyond content,&rdquo; there are principles we have not yet discovered or fully articulated, conceptual frameworks we must revisit, and challenges we must acknowledge and address. By synthesizing, or at least mashing up, Seymour Papert&rsquo;s &ldquo;yearning for megachange&rdquo; and Gregory Bateson&rsquo;s &ldquo;ecologies of mind,&rdquo; I will suggest some ways the open education movements might avoid reinforcing the worst models of computer-aided instruction, and instead lead the way toward deep, meaningful, and enduring educational reform.</p>]]></description>

              <title>what is distinctive about storyboarding? - the essence</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6446</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Career-learning Caf&eacute;</em></a></p>
<p>Bill Law&rsquo;s three-scene storyboarding is a narrative learning method, inviting both words and images in accounts of experience.&nbsp; It is designed to enable a person to move on, from whatever the remembered past may be and into a meaningful and purposeful future.</p>
<p>It is the product of a long and wide-ranging development process.&nbsp; Some key and essential ideas are now forming into useful bases for action...</p>
<ul>
<li>findings - what we can be reasonably sure of</li>
<li>steps forward - progress in narrative thinking</li>
<li>issues - how these ideas disturb and reposition practice</li>
<li>needs - what further action is called for</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>findings</strong></p>
<p>There are positions - concerning needs, relevance and process - that we can be reasonably sure on...</p>
<ul>
<li>ascribing new meaning leads to new purpose - and that change may be a compelling response to re-configured experience</li>
<li>how to achieve this kind of change can be learned - and applied life-wide and life-long</li>
<li>it comes from learning to openly questioning the narratives - setting up talking-and-listening conversations</li>
</ul>
<p>more information:<em><br />&lsquo;<a title="twelve" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbtwelve.pdf" target="_blank">Examples of Three-Scene Storyboarding - Narratives of Learning-for-living</a>&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>steps forward</strong></p>
<p>Practice is now supported in terms of aims, theory and philosophy...</p>
<ul>
<li>the aims are for ready-for-anything flexibility - now brought into focus and developed into learning outcomes</li>
<li>there is a theory of turning-point episodes - now developed from the interplay between cultural and neurological influences</li>
<li>there is an underlying philosophy that nothing is inevitable - now focused and made explicit in achievable terms</li>
</ul>
<p>more information:<a title="sbL4L" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank"><em><br /></em></a><em>&lsquo;</em><a title="sbL4L" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/storyboarding/sbL4L.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Three-Scene Storyboarding - Learning for Living</em></a><em>&rsquo;</em></p>
<p><em><br /></em></p>
<p><strong>issues</strong></p>
<p>The essential ideas of storyboarding show both what it is like and what it is not like.&nbsp; These are new uses of narrative, unfamiliar to much conventional thinking...</p>
<ul>
<li>it calls on the availability of significant time, resources and partnerships - which may not accord with familiar educational uses of narrative</li>
<li>it is designed to take people on an exploratory journey, in search of unforeseen possibilities - although people commonly seek immediately-competitive narratives</li>
<li>it re-situates narratives to where people can find new points-of-departure - people whose journey begins in cultural enclaves move beyond them, escaping entrapment</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>needs</strong></p>
<p>There are priorities for action - on developing the programmes, on the locations of their operation, and on the management of their work with narratives...</p>
<ul>
<li>the work calls on learning which is socially-set, is in a step-by-step progression, and is creatively active - which is more than can come from the application of occasional and individually-focussed career expertise</li>
<li>working in community-based and informal enterprise, or in the volunteering branches of that third-sector are well situated - able to do more than private- and public-sector formal institutions</li>
<li>appropriate programme management selectively connects to &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; helpers and stakeholders who are comprehending, intuitive and engaging - which means not relying on institutionalised or policy acceptability</li>
</ul>

<p>________________________</p>
<p><strong>the future </strong></p>
<p>So much for the four essential areas of three-scene storyboarding development.&nbsp; But these have not been propitious times for introducing this work.&nbsp; Careers workers have been led to believe that there is a world-wide ideal and expert-led partnership model for their work.&nbsp; Such talk does not stimulate a hunger for the kind innovation that storyboarding represents.</p>
<p>Furthermore, policy responses to national debts are to transfer resources from the public to private sectors, seriously destabilised the professional prospects of publicly-funded careers workers.&nbsp; These unexpected threats do not commend unfamiliar departures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bad timing may explain why there is more interest than action in storyboarding.&nbsp; But a slow start need not be a bad thing.&nbsp; The following features of storyboarding call for measured implementation...</p>
<ul>
<li>formulating distinctive aims, theory and philosophy</li>
<li>supporting sustained change through reflection</li>
<li>appealing to the authority of student experience</li>
<li>setting narratives in a social context</li>
<li>using words-and-graphics formats</li>
<li>processing attributed meaning into sustainable purpose</li>
<li>enabling critical questioning</li>
<li>rebalancing the importance of step-by-step help with occasional help</li>
<li>relying on widely-linked but carefully-selective management styles</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no quick fix here. &nbsp;It calls for a continually-adjusting development, over some time.&nbsp; Indeed that maintained process will itself modify and expand storyboarding&rsquo;s scope and usefulness.&nbsp; This is slow-burn not quick-fix innovation.</p>

              <title>what future for narrative methods?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6437</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6437</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br /><a title="Career-learning Café" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Career-learning Caf&eacute;</em></a></p>
<p><a title="storyboarding" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6218" target="_blank">Three-scene storyboarding</a> is a format-and-process for reflecting on how past experience can become a new starting point.&nbsp; The theory is of turning-point episodes as new departures.&nbsp; The aim is ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; The philosophy is that nothing is inevitable</p>
<p>An EU Leonardo <a title="Leonardo" href="http://www.kpcgroep.nl/leonardo" target="_blank">project</a> has done enough piloting to suggest that this use of narrative is worth developing.&nbsp; But there are issues about how far we can sufficiently...</p>
<ul>
<li>enlarge education professionalism</li>
<li>expand learning purposes</li>
<li>re-situate student narratives</li>
</ul>
<p>The issues are wide ranging.&nbsp; The links below will fill you in on storyboarding and related issues.&nbsp; This is not about so-called academic learning for use in assessment, it is about recognisable learning for use in living.</p>
<p>Your experience of working with any such use would be useful. &nbsp;The discussion section at the foot of this blog can hold your comments on any issues raised here - together with whatever you can tell about your organisation and role.&nbsp; Thanks for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>enlarging professionalism - making room for storyboarding</strong></p>
<p>The issue is do careers-work <a title="professionals" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6226" target="_blank">professionals</a> have the freedom and resources to make good use of these kinds of narrative techniques and processes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Leonardo workshop participants voice frustration at being in no position to do what they know they are capable of doing.&nbsp; Going through training in storyboarding can add to that bad feeling.&nbsp; There are resource and strategy issues here concerning...</p>
<ul>
<li>whether your position      gives you enough scope... or not</li>
<li>if you have special ways      of managing this... and how</li>
<li>what the people      introducing such methods should be      doing about it</li>
<br /> 
</ul>
<p><strong>expanding purposes - storyboarding for the race and the journey</strong></p>
<p>Narrative methods, like storyboarding, can enable the people who already know what they want to do to find a distinctive voice for realising that purpose.&nbsp; In recruitment and selection it gives them something special to say - showing the different ways they each stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s possible to be too certain about what you want.&nbsp; So storyboarding is designed, first, to take people through episodes in their lives where they can find clues to new meaning and purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; It raises questions about turning-points.</p>
<p>There is a <a title="metaphor" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6313" target="_blank">distinction</a> here between getting-ahead competitiveness - as though in a race, and wait-a-minute exploration - as though on a journey.&nbsp; The distinction gets a lot of attention in storyboarding workshops and follow-up discussion.&nbsp; There are programme-development issues here concerning...</p>
<ul>
<li>how frequently people want to use the story to compete for a known intention... and whether this works out well</li>
<li>how frequently people want to use storyboarding to explore new possibilities... and whether this works out wel</li>
<li>what the people introducing such programmes could be doing about this</li>
<br /> 
</ul>
<p><strong>re-situating narratives - different places calling up different stories</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narrative methods raise questions about moving on in life - &lsquo;stay or go?&rsquo;, &lsquo;where can I go&lsquo;, &lsquo;what to hold onto and what to let go?&rsquo;.&nbsp; They are questions differently answered in different locations - the stories are situated.</p>
<p>Situated areas of community experience are called &lsquo;<a title="enclaves" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6374" target="_blank">enclaves</a>&rsquo;.&nbsp; They link people together in a sense of belonging.&nbsp; There are enclaves in neigbourhoods, and also on the net.</p>
<p>Narratives can therefore show how people who are psychologically different are also bound together by shared experience in enclaves.&nbsp; Although personally different they may well be culturally similar - their stories reflecting shared beliefs, values and expectations.</p>
<p>Project feedback and follow-up discussion sees the importance of this.&nbsp; Enclaved attitudes can entrap - so narratives need to be re-situated to embrace new possibilities in surprising futures.&nbsp; There are equal-opportunity issues here, concerning...</p>
<ul>
<li>what range of different situations your people come from... and how that is reflected in their stories</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>whether narrative methods help people to recognise unforeseen possibilities... and help you to see what you can usefully do</li>
<li>what people advocating such approaches might usefully do</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">_____________________</p>
<p>Narrative methods are increasingly canvassed as congenial ways of engaging students in learning for living.&nbsp; But a tour through these links shows that narrative methods are not problem free.&nbsp; Nonetheless, they can usefully represents contemporary experience.&nbsp; We therefore need to be able to present these innovations to all our stakeholders in terms which are not just congenial but also practicable, defensible and robust.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help with that.</p>]]></description>

              <title>propositions in search of professionalism - part five</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5873</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>this is part five of a five-part keynote presentation to the 2011 annual conference of the ICG<br />the series starts at <a title="part one" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5868" target="_blank">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5868</a></p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; pushing the boundary -&nbsp; managing control and finding space </strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that boundary setting can be a covert form of control.&nbsp; It is true that setting limits on what we do is a practical necessity, but it is also true that the way those limits are set can circumscribe our independence.&nbsp; It curtails our basis for knowing what to support - and what to oppose.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>the personal and the planetary:&nbsp;</strong> If students-and-clients are to narrate what they learn from experience, should there be limits to what they relate?&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp; But what links are appropriate and what are not?&nbsp; Everybody links working to shopping - the one permits the other.&nbsp; And the work that a person takes up is linked, not just to their own life chances, but the lives of any dependents they have - or ever will have.&nbsp; And people increasingly voice concerns for work-life balance.&nbsp; They also see the impact of work on quality-of-life as it links both to local neighbourhoods - even to African villages.&nbsp; Indeed, those impacts are seen as linking to the survival of species and the habitability of the biosphere - work has a carbon footprint.&nbsp; The links that people make to working life extend between <em>the personal and the planetary</em>.</p>
<p>They extend well beyond limits set by recruitment-and-selection interests.&nbsp; And also beyond the market thinking of neo-liberal policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>students and clients pushing back boundaries:</strong>&nbsp; Influential interests set limits on career talk.&nbsp; And that goes against wide-spread contemporary personal-to-planetary interests.&nbsp; The trends are well-documented by political commentators, sociologists, counselling-advocates, labour economists and behavioural psychologists.&nbsp; And our own research accords with the trends, it finds <em>students and clients pushing back boundaries</em>. &nbsp;It also finds people who see child care as a form of work, and who are wondering about work that endangers the planet.</p>
<p>None of this means that careers are boundaryless - if &lsquo;career&rsquo; means everything then it means nothing.&nbsp; But that is not what happens: people directly relate their concerns to labour-market experience.&nbsp; To pre-empt the expression of these concerns would limit the disclosure&rsquo;s they make, the extent of what we learn from each other, and the help we are - therefore - able to offer.&nbsp; They would also curtail the interests we feel able to support - and resist.&nbsp; It would diminish us</p>
<p><strong>whether the big society is big enough:&nbsp;</strong> Such thinking re-locates careers work in other-than-commerce and other-than-government alliances.&nbsp; Does that leave anywhere worth going?&nbsp; The big society is urged as a way of taking on group action which government is not able, or not willing, to take on.&nbsp; The idea is much derided; but there is a more robust concept - &lsquo;civil society&rsquo;.&nbsp; Civil society is characterised as social action which is neither commercial nor political.&nbsp; Voluntary agencies, charities and bona fide non-government organisations are - in varying degrees - examples.&nbsp; So are family, local, social and religious affiliations.&nbsp; There are tensions, take-overs and changing alignments: association football was once part of civil society.&nbsp; Professional associations still may be.&nbsp; Together the agencies and affiliations of civil society weave a social fabric which supports the way we live together - locally and on the planet.&nbsp; And so, it should be possible to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to a question about <em>whether the big society is big enough.</em>&nbsp; Is it a natural position for careers-work professionalism?&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are called &lsquo;bottom-line&rsquo; interest in careers work are actually commercial interests of shareholder.&nbsp; Civil society represents stakeholder interests.&nbsp; And all of the agencies and affiliations concerned with the social fabric have a natural interest in what careers workers do.&nbsp; It calls for multilateral, rather than bilateral, partnership agreements.&nbsp; Multi-laterality comes as no surprise to committed careers advisers and socially alert educators.&nbsp; The mapping of their links is as diverse as any in civil society.&nbsp; We need that independent positioning institutionalised.&nbsp; And a natural home for the institution is not the employer of careers workers - who may well defer powerful policy and commercial interests.&nbsp; The natural home for the institution of careers work is in civil society.&nbsp; Because the future is multilateral.</p>
<p>Practical questions for that reality are...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;who has a stake in careers work?&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;which of their interests should be our interests?&lsquo;<br />&lsquo;how do we manage those boundaries on what we do?&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center">___________________________</p>
<p>Late twentieth-century careers-work has been a story of repeated crisis.&nbsp; The crises have usually been on the back of head-lined events.&nbsp; And the events have usually been outside our control.&nbsp; Headlines aside - the hyper-active manipulation of how we live together by commerce and policy is becoming widely suspect.</p>
<p>Along with many others, in all kinds of societies across the globe, we can think of re-positioning ourselves in relation to policy and commerce.&nbsp; The careers profession alliance is well placed to work on this.&nbsp; If not through the alliance, then I believe we will do it - belatedly - in some in some other way.</p>
<p>We need to do things differently.&nbsp; And it will take time.&nbsp; The task is innovation deeper and wider than careers work has ever taken on.&nbsp; It is for careers workers to take charge of their own future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who better?</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp; enlarging the role - integrating learning for integrated lives?</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that careers-worker professionals know more than they are in a position to use.&nbsp; Enlarged career studies means that careers workers are constantly becoming more able to help.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s good; what is not good is that time- and target-constraints give them little opportunity and freedom to the put that ability to good use.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong><strong>earning space for useful action:&nbsp;</strong> Career studies is applied learning - what is learned is intended to be used in people&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; It requires transfer-of-learning - acquired in one setting, used in another.&nbsp; And that means that people&rsquo;s learning reminds them of their lives, so that their lives remind them of their learning.</p>
<p>But it does not come easily.&nbsp; It needs <em>learning space for useful action</em> - big-enough that learning can be probed, tried out, adapted and embedded.&nbsp; Applied learning is not like academic learning - useful transfer-of-learning needs more than acquisition, record-making and assessment.&nbsp; And it will not fit into the marginal slots that an academic curriculum reluctantly concedes to &lsquo;careers education and guidance&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>finding meaning and purpose:</strong>&nbsp; As a species we look for meaning: long ago, when the leaves rustled, we wondered &lsquo;what&rsquo;s that - predator or prey?... mate or competitor?... us or them?&rsquo;.&nbsp; It ascribes meaning, and an ascribed meaning is a basis for purpose.&nbsp; We wonder &lsquo;... so, what shall I do - move or be still?... run or hide?... approach or avoid?&rsquo;.&nbsp; There have always been versions of this in career-management: what-to-do? and why-bother? - a purpose, and an underlying meaning, giving the purpose its point.&nbsp; Learning-for-living is <em>finding meaning and purpose</em>, &nbsp;</p>
<p>And what people informally find may not be misleading - even gossip can offer useful and authentic exchanges of experience.&nbsp; But not all of informal learning is like that - some borders on superstition.&nbsp; There is nothing that professionals can do - or should do - to displace such experience-based learning.&nbsp; But they can help in two ways.&nbsp; They can expand the experience to make more comparisons possible.&nbsp; That means making new contacts - we could call that thinking &lsquo;community-interaction theory&rsquo;.&nbsp; And they can enable the probing, scrutinising and interrogation of what people find.&nbsp; That means engaging people in critical thinking - we could call that thinking &lsquo;career-learning theory&rsquo;.&nbsp; Those two activities - widening the perspectives on meaning, and enabling the interrogation of purpose - are what careers workers do best.</p>
<p><strong>employability a by-product: </strong>&nbsp;Both activities are process driven - not so much about what people learn, more about how they learn it.&nbsp; But there is no process without content.&nbsp; And keeping up with content is becoming a serious problem: the understanding of facts and factors influencing career has expanded beyond our reach.&nbsp; We need, more than ever, to turn elsewhere for reliable and up-to-date content.&nbsp; And there is no part of any curriculum which is incapable of finding that content and applying it to life.&nbsp; There are educators who know more than we can know - ranging from the dynamics of encounter to the reliability of probabilities.&nbsp; It needs teachers - for example in drama or maths - who are ready to start a scheme with &lsquo;this will be useful in your life when...&rsquo;, and to wind up with &lsquo;...let&rsquo;s go over life situations where you can use this learning&rsquo;.&nbsp; Transfer-of-learning needs that kind of embedding.&nbsp; And, so embedded, it is a life-wide and life-long gain.</p>
<p>It is integrated learning for integrated lives.&nbsp; It is not cross-curriculum infusion: it does not seek a lot of, often half-hearted, curriculum links.&nbsp; Instead it looks for a few able partners - maybe in drama, and - if not welcome there - maybe in maths.&nbsp; What we most need is not comprehensive coverage, which is unattainable anyway.&nbsp; We need to find genuine expertise and experience which can deal with any question, from whatever direction it comes, and who can fire up curiosity - developing the habit of seeing learning as a map, not a hurdle.&nbsp; We need those people to understand the importance of enabling ready-for-anything flexibility.&nbsp; To enable learning in these terms makes <em>employability a by-product</em>.&nbsp; An able educator, helping students to find meaning and purpose in life, does not need to see this in any other way.&nbsp; The best of educators do not care to see themselves as setting in motion a procedure to be completed by recruitment and selection.&nbsp; Education is intrinsically valuable - it is not an agent for other people&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p>Practical questions include...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;is a what-to-do gain all that is asked for - or needed?&rsquo;<br /></em><em>&lsquo;how do we best help with seeking meaning and purpose?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;what can we do about negotiating an integrated curriculum?</em></p>

<p><strong>4.&nbsp; sharpening the image - developing a narrative of what we do</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that careers work is in danger of being marginalised in its own field.&nbsp; Agents who offer short-cut answers to urgent questions will attract plenty of clients.&nbsp; Careers work is talking about a more demanding task - both for ourselves, and for our clients and students.&nbsp; We can work with bigger, and more challenging, ideas.</p>
<p><strong>the &lsquo;race&rsquo; is only part of the &lsquo;journey&rsquo;:</strong>&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a challenge: &lsquo;career&rsquo; is not a thing, like a slice of chocolate-fudge cake; it&rsquo;s an abstraction, like marriage.&nbsp; Abstractions are harder to define in a way that everybody accepts.&nbsp; Metaphors can help, by appealing to visual imagery.&nbsp; And &lsquo;career&rsquo; is already a metaphor - actually, it&rsquo;s two metaphors.&nbsp; In its origins the word spoke sometimes of &lsquo;a race&rsquo;, sometimes of &lsquo;a journey&rsquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not so hard to visualise either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But try this: can you see a person interrupting a race to take part in a journey?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; So try visualising a person interrupting a journey to take part in a race.&nbsp; If that&rsquo;s easier, it makes journeying the bigger idea, and the bigger can contain the smaller.&nbsp; It means we can say that <em>the &lsquo;race&rsquo; is only part of the &lsquo;journey&rsquo;</em>.&nbsp; A journey can be life-wide and life-long.&nbsp; It is not surprising, then, to find that students are more interested in the race.&nbsp; But there are indications that educators are at least as likely to see learning as a journey.&nbsp; Journeying is the stronger image for conveying the causes of career.&nbsp; And, if we are to avoid being marginalised, we need to do more with it.</p>
<p><strong>a person, encountering others, in a sequence</strong>:&nbsp; What we do with the imagery needs to connect with what people do with it.&nbsp; It means facing up to distinctions - between &lsquo;career development&rsquo;, &lsquo;careers work&rsquo; and &lsquo;career management&rsquo;.&nbsp; Career development is our facts-and-factors expertise.&nbsp; Careers work is what we do to help students and clients with what expertise shows.&nbsp; Career management is what they do about it - with or without our help.&nbsp; We need, then, to find the careers-work <em>activities</em> which connect career-development <em>expertise</em> to career-management <em>experience</em>.</p>
<p>Experience is best set down as a narrative - in a story the images are of <em>a person, encountering others, in a sequence.</em>&nbsp; People are not short of career-management narratives - communicated in peer-group and face-book gossip, recounting both direct and on-line experience.&nbsp; Exchanging those stories is a place to start.&nbsp; And we have plenty of narrative-based careers-work activities to engage it - ranging from constructivism to narrative-based websites.</p>
<p><strong>re-balancing face-to-face and stage-by-stage learning: </strong>&nbsp;Inviting people to exchange their stories is a place to start.&nbsp; But it is only a place to start, because narratives are anecdotes - they are not expertise.&nbsp; No story can speak for everybody, each is one-person&rsquo;s experience.&nbsp; So narrative is not a well-sampled diagnosis, it is a living impression.&nbsp; It is not labour-market information, it is labour-market experience.&nbsp; And there are aspects of career management that only narrative can recount: stories can show different points-of-view, things going well and going badly, attributions of meaning, turning-points, the consequences for me and others, and change-of-mind.&nbsp; Such a well-rounded narrative has an authenticity and a spontaneity which facts-and-factors can&rsquo;t convey.&nbsp; It is why a well-rounded narrative draws people in.</p>
<p>But narrative is not quick-and-easy work - the useful recounting of, and reflection on, experience needs interactive stage-by-stage learning.&nbsp; So how do we work with people on linking the story of their experience to the story of our expertise?&nbsp; At our best, our story is&nbsp; engaging, provocative and dynamic.&nbsp; But making the connection means <em>re-balancing face-to-face and stage-by-stage learning</em> - guidance works with a face-to-face agenda, curriculum is a stage-by-stage progression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Practical questions call for a re-thinking of the partnership between guidance and curriculum...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;in how many ways is career management a </em><em>life-wide life-long journey?&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;how do we use narrative to connect our expertise to that experience?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;what does that mean for re-balancing face-to-face and progressive learning?&rsquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp; winning credibility - earning trust</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that credibility cannot be claimed, it must be earned.&nbsp; And that means being open to challenge from the very people whose trust we seek.&nbsp; It is not how we see them that matters, it is how they see us.</p>
<p><strong>culture and its enclaves:&nbsp;</strong> We are not our clients&rsquo; and students&rsquo; only sources of learning for career management - they learn in other ways.&nbsp; That means that they do not come to us empty-handed - they come with beliefs, values and expectations, which they gather from their experience of <em>culture and its enclaves.</em> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those sources of learning are massively expanding through globalisation and its technologies.&nbsp; Everyone has plenty of informal ways of finding out what is going on, and working out what they can do about it.&nbsp; And they find those sources in both friends-and-family, and on-line.&nbsp; But this is learning in enclaves - it increasingly belongs to post-coded attitudes reflected in googled urls.&nbsp; Those geographically located cultural backgrounds are becoming better markers for work-related attitudes than any twentieth-century definition of social class can any longer show us.&nbsp; Different groups, in different positions, with different experiences, learn different things about career.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>contested claims:&nbsp;</strong> And, so, there is always more than one way of thinking about working life.&nbsp; Ideas about career are constantly reorganising how we understand what people do.&nbsp; Words like &lsquo;skill&rsquo;, &lsquo;employability&rsquo;, &lsquo;confidence&rsquo;, &lsquo;experience&rsquo;, &lsquo;allegiance&rsquo; and &lsquo;motivation&rsquo; crop up differently in different accounts.&nbsp; They express <em>contested claims</em>: whatever anybody says about career, somebody else can say it differently.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve ever compiled a career-management essay or case study, you may well have wondered how to be sure that you have covered the ground. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But my reading of the evidence is that there is something like a consensus about the value of careers work.&nbsp; However much they may vary in other ways, in certain conditions students and clients agree about us.&nbsp; They approve of us when...: they know what they want to do; they are facing short-term action; and they are looking for hard information.&nbsp; We shouldn&rsquo;t be too surprised by the modesty of these accolades.&nbsp; In work as complex and dynamic as ours, the best we could ever reasonably have hoped for is that we help some people, on some issues for some of the time.&nbsp; And that is pretty-well what the evidence shows.</p>
<p><strong>enl</strong><strong>arged expertise:</strong>&nbsp; The evidence shows something else: when it comes to reflecting on why to move on in one direction rather than another, that&rsquo;s when people go to other people for informal help - not to us.&nbsp; They turn to people they know, and who know them - people they feel they can trust.&nbsp; And it is on that &lsquo;why&rsquo; question that they look elsewhere.&nbsp; We increase our credibility by working with people, not just on how to do things, but on why to bother.&nbsp; It means being strong both on career and on the causes of career.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t have that understanding: we are expanding our career studies continually - drawing on psychology, economics, and sociology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term &lsquo;career studies&rsquo; is useful, because it speaks less of some wholly-owned careers-work discipline, more of an examination of rigorous disciplines which expand our understanding.&nbsp; The history of careers work is a history of that kind of intellectual exploration and importation.&nbsp; It brings us an <em>enlarged expertise</em>: constantly taking us into unfamiliar pathways, collecting from emerging sources, and discovering new ways of understanding what is going on.&nbsp; A recent example is how culture and neurology interact.&nbsp; It expands our scope for evoking possible selves in possible futures. &nbsp;And that offers people a deeper and wider hold on working life. &nbsp;We will know that it has earned credibility when more people, from more backgrounds, want to discuss more of their lives, with more of us, for more of the time.</p>
<p>Practical questions for winning that kind of credibility include..</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;who collates our understanding of career - and the causes of career?&rsquo;</em><em><br />&lsquo;how do we best connect that expertise to client and student experience?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;how do they know us - and become known by us - enough to trust us?&rsquo;</em></p>

<p>The lecture is based on a monograph addressed to trainers, policy makers and to the careers profession alliance.  Here I&rsquo;ve pulled out the practical tasks which that monograph brings to everyday work in this field.  There are five propositions, each raising questions for our professional associations, the organisations that employ us, our trainers, our networks, and the students and clients we work with.</p>

<p>I could think of two possible answers...</p>
<p>...&rsquo;because it could be in the exam&rsquo;  and <br />...&lsquo;because it could be useful in your life&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why are we doing this?&rsquo; is still a good question for careers workers.  What&rsquo;s our priority: fitting people for getting ahead in competitive selection - learning for academic achievement?  Or enabling people to take charge of their own lives - learning-for-living?  To think they are the same thing is to overlook the mess that the academically competitive can make of their lives.</p>
<p>Careers work has its answer to the question: I know of no field which has done more research-and-development on learning-for-living.  We have a lot to go on in helping people to realise fulfilling and sustainable lives.  That&rsquo;s what I argue in the monograph.  But I also argue that we have been positioned by commerce and policy to do the competitive job rather than the enabling one.  And it has curtailed too much of what career workers are best able to do.</p>
<p>So what are the tasks - and the propositions that call for them?...</p>
<ul>
<li>&gt; re-making the deal - because independent professionalism needs comprehending support <br /> &gt; winning the credibility - because credibility cannot be claimed, it must be earned <br />&gt; enlarging the role - because trained careers workers know more than they are in a position to use <br />&gt; sharpening the image - because careers work is in danger of being marginalised in its own field <br />&gt; pushing the boundary - because boundary setting can be a covert form of control </li>
</ul>
<p>I'll try also to frame the questions - and, for me, to do so is realise that our future cannot be like our past.  We need to do things differently.</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; making the deal - protecting work-place integrity</strong></p>
<p>The proposition is that independent professionalism needs comprehending support.&nbsp; It means being able to negotiate with shared understanding, rather than struggling with uncomprehending power.&nbsp; Making this deal needs people to know who we really are.</p>
<p><strong>personal commitment:</strong>&nbsp; At the heart of that understanding is this: careers work professionalism is a <em>personal commitment</em>.&nbsp; It is grounded in who a teacher, adviser, mentor or coach is - as a person.&nbsp; These qualities are embodied - communicated in authentic demeanour, posture and tone.&nbsp; Clients and students sense it in the presence of that person.&nbsp; Without it disclosure is limited, and limited disclosure means limited learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know of no readily verifiable performance indicators for this kind of commitment.&nbsp; And not all of our work-place managers know how to recognise and support it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>institutional support:&nbsp;</strong> But the people who run our training courses must know how to recognise that commitment, and support it.&nbsp; That understanding includes knowing that selecting for commitment is at least as important as training in technical expertise.&nbsp; Trainers are therefore part of an <em>institutional support </em>for careers workers - providing a professional framework, credible enough to set out how we are selected, how we are trained, and what we have it in us to do.&nbsp; Without that that framework personal commitment is too exposed.&nbsp; And without that personal commitment institutional programmes are futile.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the deal: institutional support from the framework, personal commitment from the professional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, where the organisation&rsquo;s survival is made the prime driver of institutional management, those employers are poor guardians of careers-work commitment.&nbsp; Organisational survival sidelines professional independence.&nbsp; The record of both guidance and counselling tells of such counter-professional pressures.&nbsp; Both need an institutional framework for careers workers which is independent of their employers.&nbsp; In partnership with trainers, the professional associations - and their alliance - can frame and protect that commitment.</p>
<p><strong>versions of professionalism:</strong>&nbsp; Being a professional is defined by that kind of independence.&nbsp; But there are <em>versions of professionalism</em>.&nbsp; Twentieth-century professions protected their independence with credentials.&nbsp; But this is not the twentieth century - and all forms of protectionism are under sceptical scrutiny.&nbsp; We would be rash to assume that careers-work is exempt from this kind of probing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a professionalism which is widely respected - but it is &lsquo;professionalism&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;professional&rsquo;.&nbsp; There is a difference: while a profession was recognised by its claims to status, professionalism is recognised by its usefulness.&nbsp; If all the twentieth-century professions were to disappear tomorrow, working people in - all walks of life - will still take pride in that kind of professionalism.&nbsp; It has been characterised as what enables workers to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to their bosses.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why we need to look, outside our employing organisations, to what the alliance can frame.</p>
<p>So here are practical questions...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;what people do we need to attract into careers-work professionalism?<br />&lsquo;how do we negotiate that in our workplaces?&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;. . . on the basis of what support for professionalism?&rsquo;</em></p>

              <title>riots 2011 - unspoken quotes and thresholds of help</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Law<br />the career-learning caf&eacute;<br />www.hihohiho.com</p>
<p>An earlier <a title="the poor don't listen" href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5322" target="_blank">blog</a> examines &lsquo;why the poor don&rsquo;t listen to us&rsquo;.&nbsp; It finds that the comfortably-off don&rsquo;t understand the priorities of poverty.&nbsp; And it shows how that puzzlement spills over into disapproval.&nbsp; The conflict comes to a head in a crisis.</p>
<p>The August &lsquo;riots&rsquo; are no easier to understand.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve already been labelled as criminality...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;pure and simple&rsquo;<br />'to be confronted and defeated'<br />&lsquo;in an all-out war&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s troublesome enough.&nbsp; But vested interests are also out in force, with their claims...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;if-you&rsquo;d-only-listened-to-us&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;and supported our programme&rsquo;<br />&lsquo;while following our lead&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Careers workers can understand that no explanation of what people do is ever that simplistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From its beginning careers work has negotiated a threshold between what we can work with and what must be controlled. Every teacher faces it every day.&nbsp; So does every parent.&nbsp; And every policeman.&nbsp; They can...</p>
<p>...<strong>work with people</strong> when they recognise an outcry - and the possibility of communication - with people engaged in a search for a way forward - ready to take hold of something with promise.</p>
<p>But they must...</p>
<p>..<strong>hand over to control</strong> when they know there&rsquo;s no more they can do - recognising dangers and damage - to other people and to their clients - standing aside as helper to make way for sanctions.</p>
<p>Having to resort to control is always a failure.&nbsp; To take pride in its advocacy diminishes the advocate.&nbsp; The harder but more promising task is to find a threshold for help.</p>
<p><strong>thresholds</strong><br />People do not always tell us what&rsquo;s going on.&nbsp; One of the reasons - as the earlier blog shows - is not seeing any point in bothering to explain yourself to people who are not going to understand.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a sort of exasperation.&nbsp; It needs alert, patient, and observant attention to clues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the clues are set out below - as if they are quotes.&nbsp; (You might copy-and-paste the list, to compare reactions from colleagues and students.)&nbsp; It invites a response to each &lsquo;quote&rsquo; by asking...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is this a careers-work concern?&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>underline it</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...can we work with it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>tick it</strong></p>

<p align="center">___________________</p>
<p>Two careers work comfort zones here:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no underlining</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not a careers-work concern, no need to get involved<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; no ticks</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing we can work with, leave it to the courts</p>
<p>Reform is not a comfort zone, but it means we have something to offer.&nbsp; To settle for &lsquo;no need to get involved&rsquo; leaves us empty-handed.&nbsp; It means we can only seek support for doing what we have been doing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a limp response to change - expected, unimpressive, dismissible.&nbsp; But acknowledging the need for reform is strong - unexpected, constructive, promising.</p>
<p align="center">_________________________</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember hearing any of these &lsquo;quotes&rsquo; on any of the streets.&nbsp; I don't recall seeing them on any banners or posters.&nbsp; They came up later, usually from <a title="kidscompany" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/camila-batmanghelidjh-caring-costs-ndash-but-so-do-riots-2333991.html" target="_blank">people in a position to speak for them</a>.&nbsp; The looters were not seeking our understanding.&nbsp; They know about the futility of explanation.&nbsp; These are, then, &lsquo;unspoken quotes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They are an attempt to reflect an tacit inner life.&nbsp; If we can gather no clues to those thoughts and feelings we&rsquo;d underline nothing and tick nothing.&nbsp; Is that it?</p>
<p>People who break the law should be arrested, tried and sentenced by the same rules as all criminals.&nbsp; It's a civil right - justice, not populist retribution.&nbsp; In a law court, not a &lsquo;reality&rsquo; tv show. &nbsp;The risk is that once people have offloaded their anger onto a punishment that satisfies them, they can be persuaded &lsquo;job done!&rsquo;.&nbsp; It would be a collective failure.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>in politics</strong><br />So, was this not political?&nbsp; It was not done in the name of Mark Duggan - not his cause.&nbsp; But politics played a hand.&nbsp; In global conditions governments are weak. &nbsp;What they can do about anybody&rsquo;s chances-in-life is constrained by the consequences in massive monetary shifts.&nbsp; So they look for compensating feel-good domestic policies.&nbsp; It means attending to the electorally and economically strong.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t know how many of the rioters see themselves as part of any of those constituencies.&nbsp; But where there are no votes there&rsquo;s weakened political interest.&nbsp; That means that strong constituencies can capture government. &nbsp;And that can consign the poor to the margins.&nbsp; The rioters might have considered campaigning against the politics that fails them.&nbsp; But they didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Though it is failing them.</p>
<p><strong>in education</strong><br />Some of this might have been examined at school - in &lsquo;citizenship&rsquo;.&nbsp; Great teachers know that effective learning has to relate to experience.&nbsp; Students are certainly helped to fit into their experience.&nbsp; But the poor experience is that the world they are asked to fit into already belongs to other people.&nbsp; Teachers call it learning for cooperation, but it feels like compliance - more like jumping through hoops than useful learning.&nbsp; Useful learning is working out how to change things.&nbsp; And the looters seemed capable of doing that.&nbsp; The riots are not a failure of wit or energy.&nbsp; Let them find something they can see is really worth doing, and then try to stop them!&nbsp; Some of the people on those Blackberries are able seriously to out-manoeuvre the police.&nbsp; What a waste of talent.</p>
<p><strong>in culture</strong><br />Commerce has been able to push consumer choice to the top of the policy totem pole.&nbsp; But some commerce is worried about the riots.&nbsp; It looks as though it will recover from the loss; but some is reported to be worried about damage to product images.&nbsp; Many of the looted products are associated with crime, not because of the riots, but because of the promotional iconography.&nbsp; They are sold as &rsquo;up-for-it&rsquo; - tough, independent, ruthless, bold... like ex-cons.&nbsp; Such imagery shapes a culture - feeding into what people believe, value and expect in their lives.&nbsp; It becomes part of a media-branding complex, with media able to capture audiences - with cool, celebrated, rap-and-gossip - and media then able to promote influential interests to whatever audience they have been able to capture.&nbsp; Some of the riots had family support; but why assume that the adults-at-home are any less influenced by that m-b complex than their children?&nbsp; The government says it can&rsquo;t be on every corner, but the m-b complex is on every corner.&nbsp; And it needs its customers to forget the violent imagery built into product branding.&nbsp; So watch out for posters and press releases, disentangling those brands from that imagery.&nbsp; As failures go, this is spectacular.</p>
<p><strong>in community</strong><br />The term &lsquo;broken society&rsquo; is, itself, badly damaged.&nbsp; It labels as &lsquo;bad influences&rsquo; people who are, often-enough, heroically dealing with bad influences.&nbsp; But - with so much innocent suffering, crime and heart-break - being able to punish somebody can be a slight compensatory comfort.&nbsp; And that needs a clear separation between &lsquo;them&rsquo; and &lsquo;us&rsquo; - maintaining that &lsquo;they&rsquo; are not like &lsquo;us&rsquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not universal - we rightly honour the bereaved, magnificently calling for shared restraint.&nbsp; But the us-and-them segregation was there long before the riots.&nbsp; And you don&rsquo;t have to invade the gated communities of the sequestered super-rich to find it.&nbsp; Sometimes the fissure is inside a post-code.&nbsp; But these near but gentrified neighbours face in different direction - buying in different stores, enjoying different venues, send their children to different schools, avoid each other&rsquo;s gaze - strangers to each other.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easier to label a stranger &lsquo;scum&rsquo;, &lsquo;fascist&rsquo;, &lsquo;inhuman&rsquo;, &lsquo;evil&rsquo;.&nbsp; Easier still if convinced of one&rsquo;s own righteousness.&nbsp; But the broom-brandishing will work better when it shares its clean-up with the culprits. &nbsp;It will open a conversation between the perps, the victims and the families.&nbsp; It is what teachers, police and neighbourhoods <a title="restorativeevidence" href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/RJ_full_report.pdf" target="_self">are finding effective</a>.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t repair what is broken by bearing down on it.&nbsp; Is a word we have so-far not heard enough of &lsquo;healing&rsquo;?&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">________________________</p>
<p>This is political, but not like SOLIDARNOSC or the Jarrow March.&nbsp; Does citizenship ever mention <em>Lech Wałęsa</em> or Ellen Wilkinson?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that part of its students&rsquo; story?&nbsp; Do they know that they&rsquo;ve got one?</p>
<p>Speaking of class - I suppose it&rsquo;s not out of the question that some rioter from a middle-class home has been asked...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;get me a Breitling' - nothing too gross!&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>If and when we get the demographics we&rsquo;ll know better about that.&nbsp; But, for the moment, much of what we are witnessing is the poor trying to compensate themselves.&nbsp; I doubt they see it as immoral - some take their allegiance to each other to be moral.&nbsp; As many other people do.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the rioters have made it harder-than-ever for anybody to defend for their interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the call is for &lsquo;a single minded crime-fighter - to lead the Met.&nbsp; The call doesn&rsquo;t speak to me of the breadth-of-mind we need. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s harder-than-ever to hold people&rsquo;s interest in that kind of understanding.&nbsp; But it has never been more necessary to try.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s a critical challenge for careers work.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it <a title="professionalism" href="http://www.hihohiho.com/magazine/features/cafprofessionalism.pdf" target="_self">careers work&rsquo;s task</a> to enable people to take hold of their stake in society?&nbsp; It needs to be...</p>
<p align="center"><em>&lsquo;tough on career - tough on the causes of career&rsquo;</em></p>
<p>Suppose &lsquo;unspoken quotes&rsquo; offered a basis for working with these young men and women.&nbsp; The probability is that it will be in schools.&nbsp; Although that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it is only for students.&nbsp; School&rsquo;s can and should be accessible to anybody, at any stage in life.&nbsp; It would mean seeing our work in a changing relationship with both policy and commerce. This would unfold an appreciation of the subtle and pervasive influence of culture and society.&nbsp; That would re-work our partner- and stakeholder-networks.&nbsp; There would be a new basis for research-and-development and for exchanging feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And also for attracting support. &nbsp;But if the support we seek is for what we have been doing, then we&rsquo;ll be dismissed as predictable, unimpressive, self-serving.&nbsp; But to set out proposals for a comprehending reform of our work, that will invite interest in what is engaging, constructive, promising.</p>
<p>It means understanding not only that the poor don&rsquo;t listen to us - but that they don&rsquo;t much want to talk to us.&nbsp; But, as long as we can underline and tick some &lsquo;unspoken quotes&rsquo;, we can learn to hear what they are not yet saying.</p>
<p>Is that possible?&nbsp; If so, what an agenda for careers-work innovation.</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/5548</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a SCORE funded project which explores ways of enhancing practice in research methods teaching through the use of open educational resources. The project is multidisciplinary and involves perspectives from three different disciplines (Sociology, Education and Criminology) on how OER can be utilised more effectively in research teaching.</p>
<p>The content shared here is intended for the tutors participating in the project, who are invited to view and evaluate the resources from the point of view of whether and how they can embed these in teaching practice. Any comments are welcome however. The aim is&nbsp; to understand whether the OER content included here &nbsp;is flexible enough to adapt to the&nbsp;subject areas of&nbsp;education, sociology and criminology. Can the same content be adapted for use at different levels (undergraduate, postgraduate)? Can this content provide opportunities for multi-disciplinary collaboration and idea exchange?</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently came across this organisation based in Bedford and discovered they have a truly innoavtive approach to reaching into schools and working effectively with young people, parents, teachers and employers. The numbers of young people using the service is impressive i.e. over 230,000. Much of this engagement is achieved through The Foundation&rsquo;s state-of-the art website, b-live.com, which provides impartial, engaging and high-quality careers IAG (information and guidance).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great&nbsp;to find The b-live Foundation has joined the Institute of Career Guidance and&nbsp; works to a code of ethical practice (sometimes&nbsp;overlooked by social enterprises).</p>
<p>Through the site, young people can access personalised careers and learning information, use a CV generator, apply for jobs and apprenticeships &ndash; all specifically created to help young people make informed career decisions and support their transition from education into employment whatever their background.</p>
<p>The b-live has recently been approached by the Cabinet Office to undertake surveys with young people, parents and teachers over a three-four year period designed to find out more about their views of careers education and guidance and the world of work. They plan to launch a new research facility very shortly that will help illuminate the realities of indivduals' views and experiences of 21st century education and employment.</p>
<p>This an exciting initiative which clearly bridges the gap between&nbsp;education and employer opportunities. Each time I ask a question about the work of this organsiation, I learn more and more - &nbsp;it's very clear that listening to YOUNG PEOPLE&nbsp; and&nbsp;CONNECTING THEM TO THE WORLD OF WORK&nbsp;is what really drives this organisation.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h3>Speakers for Schools is a not-for-profit, online network of voluntary speakers dedicated to giving back to schools through free, inspiring talks for students.</h3>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<div id="about_main_mission">
<p>Speakers for Schools aims to provide state schools with access to a fantastic network of speakers who are willing to give inspirational talks to young people for free. <br /><br />These speakers address the big subjects: technological, scientific, political, economic, historical, cultural, artistic, ecological and ethical.They are people who will be able to explain the latest developments in areas such as business, cosmology, biology, medicine, linguistics, history, engineering, inter alia.&nbsp;<br /><br />The speakers intend to open new perspectives, illuminate learning and increase young people's motivation and aspirations.</p>
<p>This initiative, led by Robert Peston, BBC reporter, is truly impressive! He believes that young people outside of private sector schooling deserve the same&nbsp;rights to have access to truly inspiring speakers and he doesn't mean only the A grade pupils..........</p>
<p>So how is this different? Well, it's co-ordinated at a national level; it's captured the interest and engagement of leading figureheads from education and industry; and it's driven by a strong desire to tap into young people's imagination on future careers. They have all agreed to give their time for free to help inspire young people and help broaden horizons, open new perspectives and illuminate learning - WOW!<br /><a href="http://www.speakers4schools.org/speakers">http://www.speakers4schools.org/speakers</a></p>

              <title>The Importance of Teaching. The Schools White Paper 2010</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4882</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4882</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The introduction to the new Education White Paper, published 29th November, 2010, reads:</p>
<p><em>It is only through reforming education that we can allow every child the chance to take their full and equal share in citizenship, shaping their own destiny, and becoming masters of their own fate.<br style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px" /><br style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px" />Throughout history, most individuals have been the victims of forces beyond their control. But education provides a route to liberation from these imposed constraints. Education allows individuals to choose a fulfilling job, to shape the society around them, to enrich their inner life. It allows us all to become authors of our own life stories.<br style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px" /><br style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px" />It is only through whole-system reform that education can be transformed to make a nation one of the world&rsquo;s top performers.<br style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px" /><br style="PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px" />This White Paper outlines the steps necessary to enact such whole-system reform in England. It encompasses both profound structural change and rigorous attention to standards. It includes a plan for attracting and training even better teachers. It outlines a direction of travel on the curriculum and qualifications which allows us to learn from, and outpace, the world&rsquo;s best.</em></p>
<p>So - what do we think? Shall we load on 'writetoreply' so you have the chance to comment on particular parts of the documents?</p>

These new tehnologies can stimulate discussion, open gateway through knowledge, promote creativity and innovation for effective learning. Teacher and also students should have an entitlement to safe internet access at all times. Pulling Piaget and Papert , the use of participatory media tools in education is typically geared towards, creating a more student centered, adaptive environnement where learners can contribute to the course material, formulate and express their own insights and opinion, construct their own understanding of material by connecting concepts, to personal experience or current events, and learn from one another in collaborative environments . Web 2.0 , social media and other digital and information tehnologies are powerful and interesting tools, which open up new opportunities for everyone and for this reason teachers and students must know how to use it nowadays in a safety mode.

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The following links to comic strips made using stripcreator&nbsp;have been contributed as part of the OU 'Learning in an Open World' conference (22 -23 June 2010 - see <a href="/cloudscape/view/2012">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloudscape/view/2012</a>). Please add any questions or comments here.</p>
<p>Anthea Wilson: "I had a little play around with stripcreator, having seen Martin's examples on this site.&nbsp; I started off thinking what might be helpful for K101 students and decided to reflect some of the stories that students share about themselves on the course-wide forums and generally thinking about the FAQs that crop up in the forums.&nbsp;&nbsp; I attached the link to one of the pages on this site, but can't always find it again - but here's the link <a href="http://www.stripcreator.com/comics/acrobat/0">http://www.stripcreator.com/comics/acrobat/0</a>&nbsp;Hope you like them!"</p>
<p>Francis Chetwynd: "Hi Anthea, I love your K101 cartoons. I think many students would find them a really amusing way to find out about course related stuff. As I have 10 TMAs to mark I took some serious marking avoidance action by creating a cartoon to represent one of our 'Top ten tips on how to fail the ECA' on T175. It's here <a href="http://www.stripcreator.com/comics/Frances41/494779/">http://www.stripcreator.com/comics/Frances41/494779/</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately I forgot to put any background in before&nbsp;I published it but I think I'll have a go at illustrating the other 9 tips."</p>

<p>"The abundance of free open educational resources may be changing the role of colleges and universities. How far does it challenge the concept of paying for education?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or, indeed, the concepts of teaching, evaluating, copyright, author, expert... ?</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can classify education into two main categories: passive education relying primarily on memory, and active education relying on intelligent understanding and discovery.</p>
<p>Our real problem is what is the goal of education? Are we forming children who are only capable of learning what is already known? Or should we try to develop creative and innovative minds capable of discovery from the preschool age on through life?&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

              <title>Q5: Web 2.0 tools for building &#39;pedagogical wraparounds&#39; in OERs?</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2777</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2777</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>A culture of sharing and building more context around OERs were among the key and core tasks that are perceived as critical to meeting the needs of students, according to forty leaders in open education and technology who met in Barcelona on October 19-20, 2009, at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://openedtech.org/">Open EdTech Summit</a> sponsored by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.uoc.edu/">Open University of Catalunya</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nmc.org/">New Media Consortium. </a></p>
<p><em>Creating the university of the future</em> was the title of the summit and the question is how and whether Open Educational Resources (OERs) are also examples of creative use of Web 2.0 in a higher education context.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://oet.wiki.nmc.org/CallToAction">Call to Action summarizes</a> the major findings of the 2009 Open EdTech Summit; Of those, point 5 is of particular interest:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Content producers and users alike must embrace strategies (reflective blogging, metadata, documentation of process, visualization of learning, etc.) for linking content generation to "pedagogical wraparounds" that embed context within effective learning practices. Such strategies would ensure that the focus remains on learning objectives and process, rather than on the technology used to deliver the learning materials.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What tools, platforms and environments are available and have been a success thus far in this respect? </li>
<li>What are the barriers for embedding such context? </li>
<li>technical literacies, time commitments? </li>
<li>what are the ways to inter-connect pedagogies around OER use? </li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This ability to combine digital media / information and augment the physical world is commonly referred to as Mixed Reality. Moreover, this ability to fuse digital media within the physical gives way to the potential for Mixed reality learning which creates the ideal conditions for locative, contextual and situational-based learning scenarios. Recent advances in mobile technologies are primarily to reason for the ability for mixed-reality learning scenarios to emerge. "The incorporation of various rich sensors into new phones such as GPS location, wireless sensitivity, compass direction, accelerometer movement as well as sound and image recognition are enabling new ways in which we are able to interact with the world around us."&nbsp; Furthermore, the tools (software) and technologies (hardware) are more evenly distributed and are at our disposal to deploy mixed reality learning scenarios that deliver rich, immersive, augmented reality content which could potentially re-shape how individuals and groups approach learning and education.</p><p>Contact details: mark.kramer@sbg.ac.at</p>]]></description>

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2691</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2691</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This cloud has been set up to live blog, aggregate resources and further discussion, referring to Charles Leadbeater's talk "<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearningpedagogy/elpconference09/programme/openingkeynote.aspx" target="_blank">The role of innovation in education"</a>, scheduled on 24th November at the fourth <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearningpedagogy/elpconference09/programme.aspx" target="_blank">JISC online conference.</a></p>
<p>From the abstract:</p>
<p>Using examples from his research into schools and work relating to the arts, Charles Leadbeater discusses in the opening keynote the role of innovation in education, exploring not only how the web can break down barriers but also how the benefits it promises can be nurtured and sustained.</p>
<p>Key questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How should educational establishments deal with innovation     both in ideas and means of delivery? </li>
<li>What will the universities, schools and     colleges of the future look like? </li>
<li>Where will they be located, and who will they     employ?</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Prompted by the mad cap videos by @mweller and co for their forthcoming presentations at the JISC online conference I've decided to create this cloud to share and discuss ideas around how universities of the future might look like. Here are some questions to stimulate the debate:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a world where increasingly both contetn and expertise is freely available, what does a university offer?</li>
<li>What are the ways in which technologies are likely to impact on education?</li>
<li>What new business models will we need in the future?</li>
<li>Will the current set up and number of universities stay the same or are we likely to see a radical reduction?</li>
<li>Are students attitudes towards education changing, is it becoming less valuable?</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free also to add extra questions to this list!</p>

All they need is the special sign-up code that the teacher generates when they create the environment. If a student has already joined another class on Edmodo then they can just log in as usual with their new class assigned to their login".</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Thurs, 1st Oct 2009, Venue Design Observatory, Venables Building OU.</p>
<p>A gathering to discuss the connections amongst the various OER and web 2.0 projects existing in the university took place.&nbsp; Representatives from projects such as OLnet, Atelier-D, OpenLearn, SCORM, LDI, iSpot, the TERG&nbsp;research group&nbsp;and the OU Library.</p>
<p>It's intringuing how using 'conventional media' like pens and images from magazines we managed to visualise and represent Olnet.</p>
<p>Even more interesting were the perceptions of participants and their feedback. I am trying to include some here:</p>
<ul>
<li>How could it link with JISC JORUM initiative and 'community bay'?</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
If you work on a large text collaboratively with a lot of contributers you can have a look at the history to see the contributions but you have to decide whether to look what a single person changed or to look what is changed without to see who changed it (when you don't want to follow every little contribution). It would be great to have a wiki with a modified history which indicates the changed parts with colours and the changing person in a context menu when clicking on the colored part. The color could indicate how old the change is and move to black over time.

              <description><![CDATA[<p>We ran this as a one day event in Sept 08 for our Faculty for Languages and Education. Faculty were put into teams of 8 - we had 9 teams. The challenge was to design a short course in a day. Each team had a table with lots of materials on, flip charts and three internet computers with our visualisation tool for design, CompendiumLD, preloaded. Around the room were a series of resource stalls with experts on hand to provide advice on a range of things: How to find relevant resources on the internet, strategies for design, case studies of practice - how others had used second life, mobile learning, web 2.0 tools etc. Also support staff from educational development, technical support, the library etc were available. The day was structured to guide teams through the process. There was a really buzz to the day and teams reported that they found the stall useful and felt they achieved a huge amount in a day.</p>]]></description>

<strong>To make students aware of their assumptions on controversial subjects, ask them questions to which their answers can be displayed on a graph.</strong>
<p>Students are often unaware of their own assumptions until they are confronted with those of others. Sometimes these differences reflect different theoretical approaches in the subject.
<p>
This activity – originally conceived to teach the relationships between learning theories and the design of educational software – starts with learners answering online a series of multiple-choice questions, such as: “In a tutorial, if a pupil makes a mistake, it is best to…” The system then produces a graph, plotting each student on two axes (in this case, from “Teaching” to “Discovery”, and from “System” to “Learner”). The teacher then pairs students who have answered differently and gets them to agree new answers, and to give a reason. Finally, the teacher debriefs and organises the students’ answers into theories.

              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/271</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/271</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[Higher order professional skills, such as critical thinking and problem solving, need either a practice environment or a rich scenario for their development, and preferably also a community of fellow professionals.

This postgraduate certificate course for university staff uses multimedia case studies of two fictional universities – ‘Crumpton’ and ‘Mullock’ – featuring realistic scenarios presented in cartoon form. Online communication tools allow learners to discuss the problems raised and recommend solutions, linking into face-to-face classes for those able to attend them.

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/266</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[In many professional subjects, students need to learn to apply academic knowledge to their own practice and experience and to develop their fluency in talking about practice issues.

This course on youth work uses video case study material – one DVD featuring young people, one DVD featuring practitioners – as the basis of online discussions towards the end of each study block.

These discussions, each focused into a particular week, involve students sharing their individual answers to questions on the DVD material, building from basic descriptions, through comparisons, to more conceptual challenges.

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/77</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[If you want teachers to learn about different strategies for assessing pupils and you start by presenting the strategies one after the other, they may end up with little idea of when to apply each one. 

This team instead gave groups students a realistic problem: for example, parents at their school are complaining about the stress caused by repeated maths tests, and the Head of Maths has asked the students to come up with a new plan for maths assessment in the school. 

Each group then investigated a range of 22 assessment strategies through multimedia resources, including for each strategy video of real classroom use, sample pupil work, and comments from teachers and experts.

They then presented their findings, in role as a new teacher in the school, with the rest of the class taking the role of other members of staff, parents, or others as appropriate.

The collaborative element was important to encourage students to articulate and defend their growing understanding of assessment issues.

              <title>The implications of web 2.0</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/73</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/73</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[In this activity students were given an overview of the principles of web 2.0. It was stressed that web 2.0 was both about technology (e.g. using tools such as wikis) and social change, e.g. user generated content. They were then asked to take a course they knew and suggest six changes that would make it more web 2.0. They had to specify three technology and three social ones.
They were then asked to reflect on the following:
   1.Was it easier to think of technological changes rather than social changes or vice versa? Or were both equal?
   2.Was one type of change (social or technological) more significant than another?
   3. Do you think the course would be improved by these changes? If so, in what way?
   4.Is the type of change merely another step in the evolution of e-learning or is it something more fundamental?

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/72</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[In this activity I gave the students 16 claims that had been made about e-learning (both positive and negative), e.g. 'it will be more cost efficient', 'It will lead to the commercialisation of all education', etc. They were asked to group two or more claims together and say why they thought they were similar, giving five clusters in total. Any claim may appear in more than one group, and they do not have to include every claim. They are then asked to reflect and discuss the reasons they have given for grouping the claims.
This can be done using paper, word, or a Flash based interactive game. It could apply to many domains, not just elearning.

              <description><![CDATA[I got students to describe a significant learning experience. It could be good or bad, but they had to say why it was memorable. They then analysed the experiences of other students and were asked to draw out factors that helped make a learning experience memorable. This then provoked discussion about the design of good learning experiences.
We did this via a shared database, but could be done in classroom also, or through a wiki.]]></description>
