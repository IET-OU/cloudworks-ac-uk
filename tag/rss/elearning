              <title>Yvonne Moore&#39;s Design Narrative - reusable training sessions </title>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>A few years ago I was part of an elearning training team and we identified a number of training sessions that we wanted to deliver to teaching staff (in a large FE college). As part of the team I was given a couple of topics to cover.</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>The training team wanted to address the fact that training sessions were often badly attended or were not suited to the audience who did attend.&nbsp; We decided to create a series of short (1 hour long) training sessions with the intention of teaching staff how to use various learning technologies in classroom situations.</p>
<p>The team were not based in the same building (4 of us travelled between 5 campuses) so we allocated sessions based on interest and expertise.&nbsp; We planned that once complete we would deliver our sessions to each other, to share skills and refine the plans if necessary.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The team wanted to try something new to engage more fully with the teaching staff. Success would be measured through attendance figures (each of us was to approach a specific department to encourage participation). We would also gather feedback from participants.&nbsp; We were also introducing a qualification for teaching staff (EPICT) and we mapped those attending our sessions with those taking up the qualification.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Identify topics based on current themes (assessment for learning, peer assessment etc.)</li>
<li>Allocate topics to team members</li>
<li>Each trainer to identify and create activities for their session</li>
<li>Each trainer to identify and/or create resources required to deliver the activities</li>
<li>Write a session plan based on a template, to aid consistency and reusability</li>
<li>Make sure the session fits into 1 hour by practising on team.&nbsp; The sessions were to be publicised as &ldquo;1hour2&rdquo; sessions as in &ldquo;1hour2 peer assessment&rdquo; etc. so they needed to fit the 1 hour time slot.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obstacles &ndash; the team had very specific experience which meant that some topics were not easily covered.&nbsp; However, the development of the sessions came to be seen as CPD for the team.</p>
<p>Trying to create sessions that involved activities for participants was quite time-consuming.&nbsp; To fit activities into a one-hour slot a lot of preparation was need beforehand.&nbsp; For example, creating sample VLE courses and fake students to illustrate how a &lsquo;self and peer assessment&rsquo; tool could be used.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Trying to keep in mind that someone else may need to deliver &lsquo;your&rsquo; session often resulted in a change in direction.&nbsp; This was useful as it meant we kept on track for training teachers who had little experience in using these technologies.&nbsp; Keeping it simple was key.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The sessions we delivered to ourselves (i.e. the training team) were helpful in expanding our skill base. The small number of 1hour 2 sessions we delivered were well received although we didn&rsquo;t always reach the intended target audience (in terms of our department targets). The number of people signing up to the EPICT qualification went up after these sessions (but in conjunction with much publicity and management strategic decisions).</p>
<p>Due to a restructure at the college, these sessions didn&rsquo;t have a very long life span.&nbsp; However, the experience did help inform the next series of training that came along.&nbsp; It became clear that staff wanted more basic, fundamental training and sessions were built around the idea of scaffolding skills from basic to expert level.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>My experience was a really positive one.&nbsp; I chose to create sessions on tools I&rsquo;d never used so I got to learn new skills and share those with others.&nbsp; In developing this kind of training, I learnt about the complexity of demonstrating technology systems for specific purposes.&nbsp; In an earlier job, I&rsquo;d been an ICT teacher and activities I created were designed to introduce skills over an extended period of practice but this was attempting to provide others with information and inspiration in a very short time-frame.</p>
<p>I also learned about how teachers can find it difficult to transfer what they learn in these types of training session to their own practice.&nbsp; When they come with a specific problem to solve they fare better than coming with no real context on which to hang the learning.</p>]]></description>

              <title>How Simplicity Gets Results with eLearning</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9211</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a scenario where you have an imminently upcoming deadline for a big assignment and have swathes of materials to get through. You&rsquo;re not only going to struggle to absorb or retain the information, but you&rsquo;re always going to approach with a sense of dread at the large task at hand.</p>
<p>This is where simple, effective learning can prove to be a saviour; cut away the excess fat and leave yourself with the straightforward numbers and facts. If you&rsquo;re searching for eLearning for your workforce, this is something important to keep in mind.</p>
<p>As a learning method, eLearning has seen a steady rise to become one of the best ways to garner new knowledge and get to grips with new skills over the past decade. The levels of interactivity can&rsquo;t be matched by a simple classroom tuition and it&rsquo;s proven to be a much more cost and time-effective measure.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2 class="western"><em>Del's Drills and Wellheads</em></h2>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western"><em>I was the learning designer</em></h2>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Situation</h2>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>I was commissioned to build a sequence of 5 elearning modules for a specialist Oil and Gas inspection community. There were international contributors in the US and in the middle East as well as the slightly closer to home contributor in Hamilton, Scotland.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Interestingly, the design was not explicit at the design phase &ndash; which was reflected late on in the programme when there was a significant interface re-design.... </em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>The tension between Hamilton (subject matter expert) and Houston (holding the purse strings) was noted at the first conference call where each clearly thought the other was an idiot. The intended audience was experienced technicians and engineers with deep specialist knowledge of detailed tests and measurement principles (hardness testing, tolerances and materials analysis) but with limited exposure to the Oil and Gas Industry.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Task</h2>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Develop 5 discrete modules as a single deployable eLearning element via an archaic LMS to provide an introduction to key components, supporting paperwork and reporting responsibilities for the benefit of junior inspection engineers.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Success would be judged by acceptance from a team of subject matter experts (both eLearning specialists and Oil and Gas Inspection Engineers).</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Actions</h2>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Develop an outline narrative for module 1 and produce an Alpha release for sign off by the subject matter expert. I expected feedback from the SME group to agree / submit corrections regarding interface, colour palette and content delivery style.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Not a lot happened &ndash; after a week a short email was received from Hamilton to say 'yes that looks fine'.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Develop modules 2 to 4 to the same style and standard, submitting each module for SME review. Content was not mature so an unexpectedly long time was spent to-ing and fro-ing with Internet searches and SME questioning to ensure content was correct before submission.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Module 5 &ndash; essentially a scenario in which an inspector must trace paperwork requirements against industry standards to describe what tests will be conducted and what reporting must be made. Reports to be submitted for external moderation by SME group. A module of considerable complexity but which ensured the user was tested in the synthesis of information from modules 1-4 as well as genuine examination and interaction with international standards documents to identify the types of test and report required for each item described.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Beta review &ndash; passed without comment.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Results</h2>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Once the Beta was produced, I was expecting some minor amends to result in Gold edition publication and for Gold to be accepted with little or no comment. What actually happened is that the SME group rejected the product on the basis of a non-approved interface.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>However, (at a cost) the interface was amended, SME group passed product at second time of asking and the training released into a waiting world. </em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Feedback is very positive. Users are complimentary and success rates for Module 5 are approximately as anticipated (around 65% at first attempt &ndash; climbing to 100% after revision and re-submission). </em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Objectives met at the second time of asking.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Asked to produce two more modules for the company.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Reflections</h2>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Don't begin development until the content is all brigaded and understood. Three months in we were still battling with SME's to sign off on content in the narratives produced in week 2....</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><em>Ensure you have a single point of content. The failure to appropriately agree the design was the result of 'too many cooks' and no-one being quite sure who was authorised to sign off.</em></p>
<p class="western" style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Four T's Model</strong></p>
<p>My first reaction to this model was one of bemusement. Although technology is quite clearly placed at the centre of this process the diagram appears just to function as a glorified lesson plan</p>
<p>The lesson/session is split into Tasks, Teams, Technology and Time and then represented using a flow diagram to show how the 4Ts integrate and associate with each other. The timings of the activities appear quite rigid and ambitious which makes me think that the need to move on quickly from one activity to the next might stifle collaboration.</p>
<p>Also, the presence of lanes indicate that each activity is somehow exclusive or neutral to one another; it's difficult to see how there would be time to change both the topic and the learning environment so many times.</p>
<p>Overall, there are some useful aspects here but having learnt my lessons from past experience it would be&nbsp;inevitable that I would end up tinkering and simplifiyng&nbsp;this approach.</p>
<p><strong>eDesign Model</strong><br /> <br />I found the graphic for the 4 phases of scaffolding easy understand and it looks logical in its progression of stages. The constructivist pedagogic foundation bears perhaps the closest resemblance to my own learning design described in Activity 1b. This model seems especially suitable for activities structured over a longer period of time. I like the fact that this model can be orientated to fit around a tool, a technology, a skill or a concept.</p>
<p>I would have liked a little more information provided at each stage of the process and you can't really see from the model if the outcome or objective of the lesson have been achieved.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Prototyping OER MODULE FOR TEACHER TRAINING</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8001</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/8001</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>In fact I think this cloud is a redundant exercise over my Project Cloud - <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6778">http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/6778</a>, where I have my context&nbsp;scenario and narrative, together with some diagrams about the structure of this OER Module.</p>
<p>As I'm working with UDUTU tool, a course authoring tool, which&nbsp;is already programmed to&nbsp;create courses/modules/learning units, every other tool we have experimented along these weeks are really complementary.</p>
<p>The module/course guidelines may&nbsp;be considered&nbsp;as the prototype/the skeleton of the unit.</p>
<p>This module on OER will be a part of a more complete course on &laquo;Inclusion and Accessing Technology&raquo;, which has been running in Moodle platform.</p>
<p>This OER module&nbsp;(in UDUTU tool) can be addressed as an individual learning unit to be used on a self-learning perspective - in this case the main interaction will be with contents - or it can be used&nbsp;in a tutoring/facilitator approach, complemented with collaboration and communication tools (Google tools or other ones).</p>
<p><a title="Bubbl.us diagram" href="http://flic.kr/p/dTGw2a" target="_blank">Bubbl.us diagram with the structure of OER module</a></p>

<p>I'm still working on the&nbsp;contents for the 3 topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>topic 1 - &laquo;open&raquo; concept /copyright-commons</li>
<li>topic 2 - learning design - universal design for learning</li>
<li>topic 3 - creating, reusing and remixing OER</li>
</ul>
<p>Each topic will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>an initial presentation in &laquo;PREZI&raquo;, including videos. An audio comment on the presentation will be added as accessibility (UDUTU allows audio files per screen).</li>
<li>Resources - thematic aggregators (livebinders, pinterest, scoop.it, instagrock...) will be provided</li>
<li>Activities (individual/group)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm still working on&nbsp;Prezi's,&nbsp;on images to illustrate the screens, using Photovisi, remixing with other images</p>
<p>I'll have to write the comments to record audio for each screen.</p>
<p>I'll have to revise aggregators and complete them.</p>
<p>My aim is not only prototyping but to have a whole learning unit ready to discuss and test.</p>
<p>My work&nbsp;in UDUTU&nbsp;so far - <a href="http://publish.myudutu.com/published/evaluations/4599/Course87369/v2013_2_12_13_14_50/course/course87369.html">http://publish.myudutu.com/published/evaluations/4599/Course87369/v2013_2_12_13_14_50/course/course87369.html</a></p>]]></description>

<p>My name is Lu&iacute;s Salema. I&rsquo;m from Portugal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a teacher of Portuguese language and literature, latin and greek, at secondary school.</p>
<p>I worked at the University of the Algarve and I&rsquo;m a on line tutor at Universidade Aberta (Portuguese Open University).</p>
<p>I have a Master in Sciences of Speech and Hearing. My dissertation was in the intersection field of dialectology, experimental phonetics and computer language processing.</p>
<p>I have a post graduate course in Information Management and School Libraries.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m a PhD student at Universidade Aberta (Distance Education and E-learning).</p>
<p>As a researcher, my interests are language learning, online language learning and linguistics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very curious about history, classical studies and about different countries and cultures.</p>
<p>I like to travel and to learn more. I think this new online experience will be great. I will have the opportunity to learn more about learning design and about technology, with people from different countries and with different approaches to these areas.</p>

<p>Instructional design (or learning media design) principles, it is argued, are taken for granted by clients/employers. Are they taken for granted, or are they simply not well known to commissioners of elearning developers' work? Or, as a I suspect, is the assumption that the 'e' makes the 'learning'; in other words, that because technology is involved, learning will inevitably follow?</p>]]></description>

<p>Time: <strong>12th&nbsp;October 2010, 10.00-12.00</strong></p>
<p>Presenters: <strong>Will Woods (IET), Barbara Poniatowska and Liz Burton-Pye (LIO)</strong></p>
<p>This event&nbsp;focused on the future visioning work and explained the developments planned within the current &ldquo;Roadmap Acceleration Programme&rdquo; as well as discussing requirements for the future VLE. Participants&nbsp;were asked to speak up on what they want (and really, really don't want) in the next generation OU VLE.&nbsp; They also&nbsp;heard more about the Roadmap Acceleration Programme and future learning systems.&nbsp;See also&nbsp;the <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/oulife/podcast-626" target="_blank">Future of the VLE</a> podcast from David Wilson to learn more about what is being planned.</p>
<p>Participation took the form of a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.peopleandparticipation.net/display/Methods/World+Cafe" target="_blank">World Caf&eacute;</a>&nbsp;style session. This invited attendees to write on tablecloths at themed table&nbsp;to indicate their support for (or aversion to) particular aspects of key developments around &ldquo;User Generated Content&rdquo;, &ldquo;Personalisation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Joining up&rdquo; (how we can mix the informal and formal learning environments, including how we join up our OER&rsquo;s with VLE and other repositories). Attendees'&nbsp;ideas and their how they see the various aspects of the OU's future learning system co-existing were&nbsp;a focus for the event.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sociology of Education Intercultural</strong></p>
<p>International blended learning class<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>Course concept</em><br />Our teaching project &ldquo;Sociology of Education Intercultural&rdquo; is a blended<br />learning class that leads undergraduate students to intercultural learning experience and<br />encourages them to study abroad.<br />The blended learning class is embedded in moodle, an international accepted virtual learning environment with learning modules and multiple-choice tests. To communicate with international partners we use a virtual classroom and Skype.</p>
<p>This summer term our students will do their own qualitative research project. They will interview foreign students via Skype about conditions of study and living. The interview outcomes results will be analysed and presented on their own ePortfolios (Mahara).</p>
<p><em>Opportunity to join us</em><br />We&rsquo;re looking for students who would like to be interviewed via Skype. Our students will ask them how they feel as a student in their country. What do they challenge, what do they like and what they would like to change. The interviews will take place as soon as possible until your term ends. It will be in English and last max. one hour. The installation of Skype is for free and very easy (www.skype.org) and allows the students to use a webcam and a headset. You and your students are very welcome to join us and will be informed about our outcomes.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This cloud is set up to collect opinions and resources related to IPad as a tool for teaching and learning. Any ideas for a first pilot? Any concerns? Actually it is not easy to imagine the spread and utilization of a device that to date we only know thanks to a demo show. However, its impact on discourses is already apparent and some traces of new scenarios are emerging even in these early days. I think it is worth reflecting on issues such as: what can an IPad add to the experience of a mobile learner? what kind of (e)learning the IPad will privilege = i.e. + multimedia - conversations? what is its sustainability in an era of funding cuts also in academia? Will the "Everest syndrome" (Maddux) affect educators again, with the advent of IPad? I mean: will we all are willing to use the new device merely because "it's there" available? And so on...Certainly you have better questions on this theme.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>"E-learning has become popular among educationists because of the inherent strengths and advantages it provides to the instructional process. Through e-learning initiatives in India dates back to 1999, it is in its infancy as not many institutions have jumped into the bandwagon. Many also cite the Internet penetration in the country as the cause of the current situation. At Staff Training and Research Institute of Distance Education (STRIDE), Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), we believe and understand that technological infrastructure alone is not sufficient for success of e-learning, through it may be a necessary pre-condition. Therefore, we have been engaged in dialogue, discussion and debate about the potential capabilities, strengths and limitations of online technologies in educational programmes. We have also been conducting training programmes on e-learning since July 2001. The <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Handbook</em> is our humble effort to put 'learning' before 'technology' in e-learning endeavours. We expect this <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Handbook</em> to be a starting point and reference guide to new as well as seasoned teachers to use e-learning in their teaching and learning, <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->both</em> at face-to-face and at a distance".</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>From the website:</p>
<p><em>"The programme focussed on the learner voice. Learners allowed us into their worlds and showed us what it is like to study in a technology-rich age. The projects produced a huge collection of rich, detailed data that sheds light on what learners expect from the use of technology in post-compulsory education and the choices they make about using technology to support their study.</em></p>
<p><em>The research took a holistic approach to technology use. We were not so interested in how technology is used on one module, or in one part of the institution, as in how learners interact with technology throughout their learning lives.</em></p>
<p><em>The resources here will be of interest to teachers and staff supporting learning in post-16 education, researchers of student learning, e-learning developers, policy-makers and institutional managers.

              <description><![CDATA[<p>
The fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) project is the Australian government's response to the national broadband network (NBN) tender. The tender ended with no winner as prime minister Kevin Rudd announced the FTTH project, which will be run by a company made up of a partnership between the government and the private sector. It is of interest to the education sector since many education tools are reliant on web 2.0 technology and broadband accessibility.

              <title>The implications of web 2.0</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/73</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/73</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[In this activity students were given an overview of the principles of web 2.0. It was stressed that web 2.0 was both about technology (e.g. using tools such as wikis) and social change, e.g. user generated content. They were then asked to take a course they knew and suggest six changes that would make it more web 2.0. They had to specify three technology and three social ones.
They were then asked to reflect on the following:
   1.Was it easier to think of technological changes rather than social changes or vice versa? Or were both equal?
   2.Was one type of change (social or technological) more significant than another?
   3. Do you think the course would be improved by these changes? If so, in what way?
   4.Is the type of change merely another step in the evolution of e-learning or is it something more fundamental?

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/72</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[In this activity I gave the students 16 claims that had been made about e-learning (both positive and negative), e.g. 'it will be more cost efficient', 'It will lead to the commercialisation of all education', etc. They were asked to group two or more claims together and say why they thought they were similar, giving five clusters in total. Any claim may appear in more than one group, and they do not have to include every claim. They are then asked to reflect and discuss the reasons they have given for grouping the claims.
This can be done using paper, word, or a Flash based interactive game. It could apply to many domains, not just elearning.
