<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>I will be looking at ways to engage the wider community into completing badged open courses to improve wellbeing, employability and further development. Discuss ways to bridge the digital divide gap amongst the nation, with digital literacy and digital wellbeing. Are we too connected to the digital world and do we need time to reflect as much online as offline? The uptake of EPUB and tablet devices are now on the decrease. The world of student learning in classrooms are changing fast from reading textbooks and completing exercises to more engaging online interactive resources in learning. We must ensure that we cater for all learning styles, abilities and make the content as accessible as possible. Other nations around the world have already embraced badged open courses. Could this be the answer to how the UK improves the skills shortage. Recognition could be gained not just from within the class but from voluntary work to sports skills to interests in connection with extracurricular interests. The article will review ways that we can engage with communities that may not be able to connect with education as well as other parts of the cultural community. Looking at the success behind the Princes Trust Mosaic Mentoring programme to help ensure that the ethnic minorities have role models for inspiration. The paper will also look into how BOCs could be used to gamify learning in school, university and the workplace. I have also tried to refer or draw upon the following website on understanding some of the issues relating to the subject; widening participation: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/higher-education-participation">https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/higher-education-participation</a></p>
<p>Open badges lend itself to ensuring that they are inclusive to all learners regardless of background. My presentation will tackle ways we can implement BOCs into our everyday lives as both formal and informal ways of learning. MOOCs have utilised many forms of OER and creative commons content for learning content. The question arises from this on how this will affect the paying pupils and the pupils receiving the material free user expectations. In terms of what, both groups will expect from their learning journey. Will the paying students feel more motivated by the learning content as opposed to students signing up to free courses and feeling disengaged after beginning a MOOC. Figure description of diagram: I will try to tackle ways that this can be addressed by creating an illustration that fits best to explain this. With the user in the middle and all the barriers to learning listed around the user in a circle. By beginning a basic assessment in the form of a needs analysis. A practitioner would be able to understand the learners strengths and weaknesses of subject knowledge and be able to tailor make the content to fit best with the learner. Learning analytics would be greatly beneficial plus the understanding of pupils learning styles. Another question that I will conclude on is how successful will BOCs be in the long run and is there any future possibilities with how we engage more users?</p>]]></description>
