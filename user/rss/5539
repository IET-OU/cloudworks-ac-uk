<p>Teachers nowadays are asked to update themselves on the materials they use to give lessons in a more attractive way to their students. But the reality is that students sometimes have greater ease and knowledge in the use of technology, so it is important to equip teachers to find the tools at their disposal in web 2.0 for free. This project aims to be firstly a version in the b-learning system, to facilitate the integration of teachers who have more difficulty or are more adverse to novelty and innovation.</p>

<p>The aim is to encourage teachers to use web 2.0 tools as attractive features for their classes. With the use of these resources in teaching, students will become more motivated and classes will have different dynamics, since the use of technology is always a motivating factor for students.</p>

<td valign="top" width="612">
<p>The approach will be sought through a training regime in b-learning in order to motivate trainees and clarify any doubts that may occur at morecomplex moments in theclassroom. But the training will have a graduate scheme. In the beginning there will be more classroom sessions and toward the end of the training there will be the use of the e-learning system using videoconferencing one hour a week to clear doubts. The whole course will run from Moodle, Blog, GoogleDocs, Prezi, Youtube, Wikispaces, and videoconferencing amongst others &hellip;</p>

<h2><strong><em>TITLE: web 2.0 vs teaching 2.0</em></strong></h2>
<p><strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Actors </strong>(who is involved?)</p>
<p>Teachers in primary and secondary school education</p>
<p>Team of facilitators - depending on the number of teachers/participants to enroll.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goals </strong>(why?)</p>
<p>Train teachers to create more attractive dynamic digital resources to use in the classroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Settings</strong> (where &amp; when?)</p>
<p>The training will take place in post-working hours for a period of 4 weeks. This project aims to be firstly a version in the b-learning system, to facilitate the integration of teachers who have more difficulty or are more adverse to novelty and innovation. . But during the weeks the regime will tend to direct into the e-learning system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Objects </strong>(what things are involved?)</p>
<p>Computer / Desktop / tablet PC/ notebook / iPhone / smartphone, Internet connection, course platform, email and free Web 2.0 tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong> (what happens to actors?)</p>
<p>The course is provided by the Teachers&rsquo; Training Centre, through the Ministry of Education and announced in every school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Events </strong>(what do actors do?)</p>
<p>After a registration on the platform that will serve as the basis of the course, students will be asked to perform various tasks to be published in digital e-portfolio. They are then called to reflect and share ideas on thematic forums on the tools in use. The facilitators will give feedback in a maximum period of 24 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> (what is achieved?)</p>
<p>Realization of digital resources using Web 2.0 tools to make an e-portfolio with all the digital resources used by participants, these separated by areas of interest.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your design:</strong> (what role does your design play?)</p>
<p>The project is to help teachers produce more attractive and creative digital resources with the use of web 2.0 tools in order to assist in their teaching roles.</p>]]></description>
