              <description><![CDATA[<p>BETT is the biggest show at Olympia by far. Long gone are the days of any computer show to compare. The biggest range of netbooks on any site ever.</p>
<p>Apple may not turn up but try Studywiz</p>
<p>Open Source coders are hiding on the balcony in the smaller hall.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Seems the 2012 cloudscape best place for this. This could be a crunch in MOOC acceptance, though not just on site. CUP and OCR for secondary computing (Wed 1330) and OUP as venture support for apps (Thuir 1405) also John Crouch from Apple may mention some USA news. MirandaNET Wed 12-1 is booked out so any news welcome.Link is to my take on Pulse.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This starts with OhmyNews, I think the most considered model. There is an idea about being "open". As a news organisation the investment is in editors and training the readers to report stories. the editors choose which stories to promote to the front page or combine in themes. OhmyNews continues in Korea but the International site is now a blog about Citizen Journalism and links to many other sites.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Start the year in Las Vegas. This event shows the trends in devices. Apple will not be there but, as reported by AP, &nbsp;DisplaySearch analyst Richard Semenza has estimated that a hundred different tablet models are in development. Some of these will be used for e-books or forms of publishing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TV sets will also feature.</p>
<p>"Basically, the TV will look like your smart phone and have access to the Internet," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, which organizes the show.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This trade show may redefine the UK print industry. The topics have been covered before but the context is an extension of IPEX, a large print event that happens every four years. What was "pre-press" is now "pre-media" so the scope includes most forms of communication. The interest will be in marketing, but this includes aspects of academic publishing.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This cloud links to a more sensible one as I may be going off topic. I am trying to catch up with the week. I have started to discuss design science with JD, we both support a radio show. So my paired discussion with him &nbsp;may not work too well till Thursday next when we meet in the Phonic studio. I would be quite happy to find some relevant sound clips but he wants to apply design science to how he works on a show. Rather, he thinks he has skill so resists the idea of science. He is gradualklky accepting the idea of design though.</p>]]></description>
