              <description><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Title</h2>
<h2 dir="ltr">Vibeke Fussing&rsquo;s design narrative v2: Freaky Photos</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Narrator</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">My role in this is that of teacher of this class where I share the teaching with another. The schedule of learning and assignment for delivery of two BTEC units combined (photography and advertising units), was written by my colleague. I am also pastoral tutor for this class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Situation</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This particular lesson was the 1:30pm after lunch lesson (often fondly referred to by teachers as the graveyard shift). The learners were level 2 BTEC students aged 16-18 on a Creative Media Production course. Attendance was low and it was the first day back after the Easter break. These students had four lessons so were expected to attend college all day in the same classroom where each student sits at a PC.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During the morning lessons students had been given &lsquo;chalk and talk&rsquo; style lessons by my colleague and were next to be required to watch an hour long documentary on photography (and answer 5 questions).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Key actors were 12 male students, the media department technician and myself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Having popped into their morning lessons, I was concerned that they looked as though they were losing the will to live and felt something had to be done quickly.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Task</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What I wanted to achieve was enlivened enthusiasm and interest in photography and the two units they will be studying between now and the end of their course. My measure of success would be active participation and collaboration amongst the class (rather than individual silent staring at PC screens).</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Actions</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Popped into earlier lessons to observe the delivery and how the students were responding.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Had a think about how to improve the situation for the students.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Asked the technician if it would be possible to use a tray of cameras after lunch.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The technician put all the cameras on charge to be ready.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Introduced the activity, Freaky Photos.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students were to first give me their email address (the one that they actually use).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Each student would be given a small digital camera.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">They were to go out of the classroom and spend 20 minutes taking the most surreal, strange, weird, freaky photos they could from odd angles so that the viewer would not necessarily recognise the subject.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Whilst they were out taking photographs I created a Prezi and send each student a link to it, having given each of them editing permissions.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students downloaded their photos from the cameras (USB).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">They then picked up the email with the link, signed up to Prezi and joined the presentation.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Students were to upload one freaky photo to the Prezi presentation giving it a title and adding their name. What actually happened was that they found all sorts of silly pictures on the internet and uploaded them first. Did a lot of deleting of each others pictures, got quite giddy messing around and winding each other up. There was a lot of laughing and talking to each other across the classroom over the PCs.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I was to provide support and guidance where needed, particularly in the signing up and use of functions in Prezi. Once they were in they got to grips with it quite quickly, some needed to be shown the &lsquo;Insert&rsquo; button for uploading their photos. One student was very quickly changing the presentation background image and colour scheme.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The activity would then be brought to a close so that the students could then watch the documentary and answer the set questions. This didn&rsquo;t really happen, they carried on playing with the presentation whilst also listening to the documentary and only stopped when Prezi crashed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Results</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Expected outcome was that students would interact with each other and get up out of their seats to take photos around the college.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The email addresses were difficult to read in some cases so I had to wait for them to return to check.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I wasn&rsquo;t altogether sure that the uploading of their chosen photos to Prezi would work so that was a bonus.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Although when I discovered that they would have to sign up for a Prezi account in order to edit and join in I was concerned that some would not be able to. This actually worked surprisingly well because I think the students were motivated by wanting to join in.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The students did a lot of giggling (teenage boys and &lsquo;rude&rsquo; photos I think) and were engaged in the activity although perhaps not in the way I had intended.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">They all now know a lot more about how to use Prezi.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A day later I again offered them the opportunity to take the cameras out (it was a very hot sunny day for April - far too nice to be cooped up in a stuffy classroom). &nbsp;Most of the students who had taken part in the activity the day before as well as one student who had not attended college then, took photographs and have uploaded them, this time in an orderly way (without any supervision or guidance from me) and also worked out how to create the zooming paths).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Best unexpected result is that I am very proud of them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Reflections</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although the design narrative was mostly a success, it was planned at very short notice and out of necessity to keep students engaged, it was not planned with the assessment criteria in mind. This means that whilst they are gaining confidence in taking photographs, working collaboratively and using Prezi, they are not working on the activity assigned for assessment this week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It would probably be a good idea for me to plan a few of these &lsquo;emergency&rsquo; lessons and keep them ready but make sure that they also incorporate some of the outcomes required by the BTEC units being addressed at the time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of the students who were present during the activity, there were three who struggled and seemingly couldn&rsquo;t be bothered initially, only one is still telling me that photography is just not his thing (he prefers being a team leader and directing students to produce his moving image ideas). I need to work more with him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Their enthusiasm for Prezi as a collaborative presentation tool has impressed me. They are far keener working with it this way than individually on their own presentations. So I will use this in future activities with this class and perhaps encourage them to continue working on the current Freaky Photos Prezi.</p>

              <title>Vibeke Fussing’s design narrative: I’m not … the only gay in the college.</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Title</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Vibeke Fussing&rsquo;s design narrative: I&rsquo;m not &hellip; the only gay in the college.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Narrator</strong></p>
<p>As a UCU (University and College Union) branch union chair and member of staff actively involved in various aspects of an FE/HE college in South East London time has come to do something. My role is perhaps part instigator and part facilitator as well as participant.</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>The situation is a predominantly FE college based in South East London. The college also has increasing HE provision as well as incorporating a new 14-16 College. There has been a degree of social isolation of LGBT+ staff and students at the college (own experience and that shared with me by some of the students that I come in contact with). There is a need to raise awareness and provide a safe and inclusive environment for all students and staff (who are often left out of initiatives mostly provided for the benefit of learners) at the college, in this case, particularly those who identify as LGBT+ and their friends and colleagues. This only began to develop at the end of March 2015 and is still in its early stages. It is likely to be a cross college initiative, across two campuses incorporating the use of student common room areas and online using the college moodle. Key people at this stage are union representatives; the NUS (National Union of Students) Vice President/Higher Education Officer (an HE student) and UCU branch Chair (also the UCU branch Equality Rep), and of course the target audience of LGBT+ across the college.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>My initial intention is to join forces with NUS to decrease the sense of isolation felt by LGBT+ staff and students using a variety of methods; to establish regular meeting slots with recreational activity as focus at both campuses, to establish message boards for online communication, to raise awareness using the college &lsquo;Pop-up shop&rsquo;, to gauge interest in joining this years London Pride.</p>
<p>How will we measure our success? This is where I think I need to remain open to possibilities and the unknown. Initially I just wanted to have an OU style forum, a bit like a social network to communicate with other LGBT+ staff because although I have worked there since early 2008, I still felt like &lsquo;the only gay in the college&rsquo;. So my measure of success would have been forum posts from more staff than just me.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>To make contact with NUS Vice President/Higher Education Officer;<em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--> Having been told by the UCU </em>Equality Support Official (with specialism for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans equality and age equality) that there was an active NUS LGBT+ rep at my college I made some enquiries and emailed him to arrange a meeting. Our initial meeting was gate-crashed halfway through by a nosey busybody but productive nonetheless. We discussed potential initiatives and went away with a few actions.</li>
<li>To contact the eLearning manager about having space on the moodle. I have had no reply to this but have had various email communications with NUS rep and other members of staff. I decided to just try creating one anyway and deal with requesting that a link be put on the front page when I know it works. I also looked into a variety of social network style options outside of the college domain.</li>
<li>To build a moodle course page that includes a news forum, message boards and chat facility as well as other relevant links and resources. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve built a moodle page for staff, am waiting for feedback as of the three people who I sent the link to for testing, one was unable to log in and the other two have not got back to me yet. This unfortunately requires me to be patient (not always easy for me) as it is now the Easter break and few are likely to get back to work till afterwards. When I know it is working I will request that a link be sent to all staff (I don&rsquo;t have permission for all staff emails).</li>
<li>To gauge enthusiasm or interest in a college presence at London Pride 2015. This partly requires the moodle page to be accessible to staff for the discussion forum on the subject. Responses from students have been positive. The college principal has responded positively and more staff members are becoming involved in the organisation of this. The NUS report interest and support from the local police force&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hate Crime&rsquo; Unit and the local healthcare trust.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>Responses have been positive and encouraging. It is too early to measure the success (or not) yet of the intention to raise awareness and communication amongst the college LGBT+ community.&nbsp; What does seem to have grown out of this however is an eagerness by some at the college (for whatever reasons) to encourage a presence representing the college at London Pride this year (27<sup>th</sup> June 2015). This was unexpected as when I first broached the subject, tentatively we didn&rsquo;t imagine that this year would have enough active interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p><em>This was the wrong subject for me to choose for this activity. It is not part of my usual teaching job and is at very, very early stages so not yet possible to talk about results or see as a complete learning design narrative. Another reason for it being a very bad choice is that it is not a formal or planned narrative &ndash; it seems to have a life of it&rsquo;s own. If I were to do this activity again I would use one of my formal taught lessons instead.</em></p>
<p><em>Taking part in two recent events kick-started me into action. First was a CPD workshop with colleagues on PBL (Project Based Learning) in which we discussed a hypothetical project (a local LGBT+ Pride event) for students that might incorporate collaboration across a number of departments. The second was taking part in a focus group for research undertaken by </em>The National Council of Faiths and Beliefs in FE (fbfe) and the UCU Forum for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Equality. Adding to this is my experience as a teacher who tries to maintain a good, honest relationship with my students, particularly (but not only) those for whom I have a pastoral care responsibility.</p>
<p>In hindsight a more formally planned design narrative would be a distinct benefit to this &lsquo;project&rsquo; and I may well start to develop that as term starts again next week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;LGBT stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender.</p>
<p><strong>Lesbian</strong>&nbsp;= a woman who is attracted to other women<br /> <strong>Gay</strong>&nbsp;= a man who is attracted to other men<br /> <strong>Bisexual</strong>&nbsp;= individuals attracted to men and women<br /> <strong>Transgender</strong>&nbsp;= someone who transitions from a man to a woman, or a woman to a man. This includes individuals who are considering transitioning and individuals who define a gender identity that is different to the person&rsquo;s sex at birth.</p>
<p>LGBT+</p>
<p>The +&nbsp;relates to other sexual and gender identities, including (but not limited to) pansexual, asexual, intersex, questioning, queer, genderqueer, polysexual.</p>
