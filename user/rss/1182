              <description><![CDATA[<p>This <a href="http://tallblog.conted.ox.ac.uk/index.php/2009/11/27/the-transition-from-the-co-digital-to-the-post-digital/" target="_blank">blog post</a> by David White synthesizes the strong debate sparked by the discussion paper<a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=aqv2zmc9bgm_51ft65rbn2" target="_blank"> Planning for the Post-Digital&rsquo;.</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the author presents a model of innovation process built upon the <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/the-hierarchy-of-digital-distractions/" target="_blank">Hierarchy of Digital Distractions </a>by David McCandless.</p>
<p>The proposed model aims to represent the transition from an early phase 'Co-digital' - in which "a technology goes through as the user community appropriates it and influences its development" - towards a 'Postdigital' one, in which (according to the original document), the power of the technologies "arises in the act of their colonisation, or appropriation, by people into their lives; when they cease to be technology and become simply "stuff that works".</p>
<p>The debate is underway in reply to this post.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.cudenver.edu/Academics/CUOnline/FacultyResources/Handbook/Pages/Handbook2009.aspx" target="_blank">CU Online Handbook 2009</a> is edited by Patrick R. Lowenthal, David Thomas, Anna Thai and Brian Yuhnke and is integral part of the activities to support faculty in using technlogy at CU Online. This new ebook aims &ldquo;to provide faculty an opportunity to engage in the scholarship of teaching.&rdquo;, mainly taking care of &ldquo;growth in own teaching&rdquo; and &ldquo;dialogue with colleagues about teaching and learning&rdquo;.<br /><br />In the introduction the authors state: <br />&ldquo;This handbook consists of four different sections. The first section is about<br />trends and issues with online learning. The second section is about technology in action.<br />The third section includes a brief summary of 25 different new emerging tools and<br />applications. The last section includes different resources that you might use in your<br />online classroom. Put together we hope to turn the CU Online Handbook into an<br />annual publication, a guide to what is new, a celebration of what works and a toolkit for<br />exploring new territory. Online education holds the promise to change the world. We&rsquo;re<br />excited about that future and looking forward to learning the hardest thing of all: How<br />to teach differently&rdquo;.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Carr, T., Jaffer, S. and Smuts, J. (2009), <strong><em>Facilitating online: A course leader&rsquo;s guide, </em></strong>published by the Centre for Educational Technology, University of Cape Town. Distributed by OER Commons (www.oercommons.org).</p>
<p>"The Centre for Educational Technology (CET) at the Universiy of Cape Town produced a Course Leader&rsquo;s Guide as an Open Educational Resource to assist educators and trainers who wish to implement a course on online facilitation within their institution or across several institutions. The guide contains the course model, week-by-week learning activities, general guidance to the course leader on how to implement and customise the course and specific guidelines on each learning activity".</p>
<p>The guide constitutes a resource for an online initiative aiming to support educators and community facilitators in Anglophone Africa. It provides a step-by-step path in design, implementation and management processes related to fully online or mixed mode courses, online conferences or collaboration projects. The provided materials can be freely adapted to local contexts. The authors built their work on Salmon's 5-steps model of E-moderating and E-tivities' structure and set out to foster and improve social, technical and social networking skills of online facilitators. Beyond this guide, a specimen of an online course site is available, as pointed out in the links below.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Reference: Justus J. Randolph (2007), <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/MultidisciplinaryMethodsInEducationalTechnologyResearchAndDevelopment" target="_blank">Multidisciplinary Methods in Educational Technology Research and Development</a>, HAMK Press</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>"Over the past thirty years, there has been much dialogue, and debate, about the conduct of educational technology research and development. In this brief volume, Justus Randolph helps clarify that dialogue by theoretically and empirically charting the research methods used in the field and provides much practical information on how to conduct educational technology research.<br />Within this text, readers can expect to find answers to the following questions:<br /><br />(a) What are the methodological factors that need to be taken into consideration when designing and conducting educational technology research?<br /><br />(b) What types of research questions do educational technology researchers tend to ask?<br /><br />(c) How do educational technology researchers tend to conduct research? (d) What approaches do they use? What variables do they examine? What types of measures do they use? How do they report their research?<br /><br />(d) How can the state of educational technology research be improved?<br /><br />In addition to answering the questions above, the author, a research methodologist, provides practical information on how to conduct educational technology research--from formulating research questions, to collecting and analyzing data, to writing up the research reports--in each of the major quantitative and qualitative traditions. Unlike other books of this kind, the author addresses some of research approaches used less commonly in educational technology research, but which, nonetheless, have much potential for creating new insights about educational phenomena--approaches such as single-participant research, quantitative content analysis, ethnography, narrative research, phenomenology, and others. Multidisciplinary Methods in Educational Technology Research and Development is an excellent text for educational technology research methods courses, a useful guide for those conducting (or supervising) research, and a rich source of empirical information on the art and science of<br />educational technology research".</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>"E-learning has become popular among educationists because of the inherent strengths and advantages it provides to the instructional process. Through e-learning initiatives in India dates back to 1999, it is in its infancy as not many institutions have jumped into the bandwagon. Many also cite the Internet penetration in the country as the cause of the current situation. At Staff Training and Research Institute of Distance Education (STRIDE), Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), we believe and understand that technological infrastructure alone is not sufficient for success of e-learning, through it may be a necessary pre-condition. Therefore, we have been engaged in dialogue, discussion and debate about the potential capabilities, strengths and limitations of online technologies in educational programmes. We have also been conducting training programmes on e-learning since July 2001. The <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Handbook</em> is our humble effort to put 'learning' before 'technology' in e-learning endeavours. We expect this <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Handbook</em> to be a starting point and reference guide to new as well as seasoned teachers to use e-learning in their teaching and learning, <em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->both</em> at face-to-face and at a distance".</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>"Collaborative environments, the semantic web, augmented reality, mobile computing, open content, and social media are the six technologies with the greatest potential impact in higher education in Latin America, Spain and Portugal in the next five years. This was the verdict of a group of more than 40 experts in the innovative use of ICT, who met in Puebla, Mexico, to debate how new technologies could improve higher education in Iberoamerica. These technologies will be part of the 2010 Horizon Report: Iberoamerican Edition, which is a joint initiative from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (Open University of Catalonia, UOC) and the New Media Consortium (NMC)".</p>]]></description>
