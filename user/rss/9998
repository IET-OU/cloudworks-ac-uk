<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I was the teacher of a Year 11 GCSE English Literature class.&nbsp; The class was nominally &lsquo;top set,&rsquo; yet many of the class, particularly the boys, had difficulty in thinking and working independently.&nbsp; Essays they produced on poetry showed understanding of the texts, but little in the way of inference and developed interpretation.&nbsp; Several of the class, however, displayed exceptional insight in their responses. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>The class had six hours of lessons per fortnight, made up of four single hours and one &lsquo;double.&rsquo;&nbsp; The default location was the classroom &ndash; this had a whiteboard and projector by my desk.&nbsp; Pupils had a place at a desk, allocated through a seating plan.&nbsp; To encourage collaboration, pupils were seated around desks in mixed-ability groups of 5 or 6.&nbsp; Desires of the pupils ranged from wanting to work hard to get an A* in their exam, to simply wanting to get through an hour&rsquo;s lesson without having to write too much.&nbsp; In this situation, group work was imbalanced &ndash; even when specific roles were allocated, the more able ended up doing more work.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>I was aiming to improve the quality of students&rsquo; written responses to poetry exam past-papers &ndash; success measured by an improvement in marks awarded for inference, insight, and independent interpretation.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>&nbsp;I looked through the pupils&rsquo; practice-exam responses, attempting to isolate a key difference between those who had scored highly, and those who had not.</li>
</ol><ol start="2">
<li>There were a few factors, such as less sophisticated vocabulary, sentence structures, and punctuation &ndash; but the one which stood out was that those who scored poorly had very short explanations of quotations they had used.</li>
</ol><ol start="3">
<li>I thought about possible actions to address this, ranging from teacher-talk to group-work; but I wanted to come up with a way that would combine the benefits of collaboration with the necessity of pupils thinking and writing for themselves.&nbsp; I decided that I would have students working collectively to produce an exam-style response to poetry; one team would produce one essay, made up of contributions of individuals.&nbsp; As a Star Trek fan, this reminded me of the Borg &lsquo;collective,&rsquo; which led to this lesson being called &lsquo;We are Borg!&rsquo;</li>
</ol><ol start="4">
<li>I decided that one of the reasons group-work had not always been successful was that some of the boys were relying on the girls to do the work.&nbsp; To combat this, I split the class into two teams, boys vs girls, a near-even split.</li>
</ol><ol start="5">
<li>I allocated a poem/exam question to each team.&nbsp; I then sub-divided the teams into smaller groups, each responsible for analysing and explaining one aspect of the poem.&nbsp; Some members of the teams were given the task of overseeing the work of the sub-groups, co-ordinating responses.</li>
</ol><ol start="6">
<li>Pupils responded well to the element of competition, and there was a buzz of enthusiasm in the room.&nbsp; However, it was difficult to co-ordinate everything, as it required pupils to move around a lot to share ideas.</li>
</ol><ol start="7">
<li>After the lesson, I decided to combat this using Google Docs, which would allow real-time collaboration without movement.&nbsp; I set up and shared a document for each team, showing their essay question and an outline.</li>
</ol><ol start="8">
<li>The next lesson was in an ICT suite, with girls on one side and boys on the other.&nbsp; I went through the shared document carefully, reminded pupils of the aspect of the poem they were analysing, and set them off.</li>
</ol><ol start="9">
<li>Two of the girls&rsquo; &lsquo;overseers&rsquo; were absent.&nbsp; This meant that I had to spend more time helping the girls co-ordinate everything at the beginning.&nbsp; This meant that I didn&rsquo;t immediately realise a problem the boys were having: even working in smaller groups on one paragraph, it could be confusing having so many writers working at once.&nbsp; I had to narrow down roles further and reduce the number writing at once.</li>
</ol><ol start="10">
<li>Occasionally, Google Docs would disconnect on a computer, not allowing further editing until it reconnected.&nbsp; This slowed the process down.</li>
</ol><ol start="11">
<li>At the end of the lesson, each team printed out a copy of their collaborative response.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The two finished responses were very good &ndash; each paragraph showed evidence of detailed and developed inferences, and the pupils were proud to have an example of a high-grade essay to which they had contributed.&nbsp; However, although the next set of individual responses was much improved, many pupils had failed to produce a complete answer.&nbsp; They had some very detailed individual paragraphs, at the expense of a complete essay.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>I was most pleased by how much pupils enjoyed the experience &ndash; the most significant result was perhaps not the improvement of inference, but in that everybody in the class had seemed motivated and engaged, working hard.&nbsp; However, I think the scale was too ambitious &ndash; having 15 people working simultaneously on a document was difficult to co-ordinate, and either Google Docs or our network struggled.&nbsp; Moreover, as the task was so different from the &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; activity of writing an individual exam response, the outcome was not as successful as I had anticipated.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Abstract</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Tomorrow&rsquo;s Digital Scholar: Using Google Docs to promote Collaboration in Secondary School English</strong></h2>
<p>The advent of Web 2.0 technologies in recent years has prompted a shift in academic practices, the openness and networked participation afforded by such tools leading to the emergence of what has been dubbed &lsquo;the digital scholar&rsquo; (Weller, 2011).&nbsp; Technologies such as social media, blogging platforms, and collaborative writing software have provided digital scholars with unprecedented access to synchronous collaboration and real-time feedback, with vast networks of peers facilitating a constant process of creating, sharing, commenting and revision (Yamamoto and Karaman, 2011). As Higher Education institutions begin to adopt such practices, and Web 2.0 tools are increasingly &lsquo;becoming popular in teaching and learning environments&rsquo; (Brodahl and Hadjerrouit, 2011), notions of what it means to be a learner are in a state of transformation.&nbsp; Digital tools have the potential to support learning in ever more innovative ways, &lsquo;mark[ing] a step change in the ways in which learners can interact with and on the web&rsquo; (Selwyn, 2008), and encouraging a pedagogy that is open, participatory, and collaborative.&nbsp; The educational landscape is evolving, shaped, in part, by the digital scholar.</p>
<p>This has implications for the Secondary School Teacher, who is expected to &lsquo;demonstrate a critical understanding of developments in the subject and curriculum areas, and promote the value of scholarship&rsquo; (Department for Education, 2011).&nbsp; As the definition of &lsquo;scholarship&rsquo; changes to include the practices and pedagogies of digital scholarship, and more school-leavers than ever before are going on to study at university (UCAS, 2016), teachers have a responsibility to ensure that their learners &ndash; the digital scholars of tomorrow - are adequately prepared in the tools and practices used in Higher Education and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many teachers are keen to embrace this responsibility, and there is evidence from the UK (Penney, 2017) and beyond (Woodrich and Fan, 2017) that some secondary institutions are already making innovative use of Web 2.0 tools to further open and collaborative teaching methods.&nbsp; Despite this, there remain barriers to ensuring that tomorrow&rsquo;s digital scholars are adequately prepared, including school cultures that discourage risk, a lack of confidence with Web 2.0 technologies amongst staff, and the absence of a support network to exchange ideas and to share examples of best practice (Kirkland and Sutch, 2009).</p>
<p>The conference presentation will demonstrate how a short multimedia course is being designed to negotiate some of these barriers. &nbsp;Aimed at the Secondary English teacher, who is ideally placed to promote the creative and collaborative practices of digital scholarship, the online course uses the open-source Learning Management System, Canvas, to demonstrate how Google Docs can be used effectively in the classroom for collaborative writing. &nbsp;Providing not only a guide to using Google Docs to promote collaborative writing, but a virtual environment for colleagues to exchange innovative examples of best practice, the course will offer one of many possible ways in which Secondary practitioners can nurture the skills of tomorrow&rsquo;s digital scholar.</p>
