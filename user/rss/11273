<li><strong>10.00-10.40 Hands-on: a review of cutaneous haptics in applied discipline study</strong> - Lisa Bowers (Engineering &amp; Innovation,&nbsp;STEM Faculty)</li>
</ul>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>Abstract</strong> -&nbsp;Multimedia, utilised to enhance students' interaction with virtual environments is well-known and understood in education. Haptics are not as well-known to the public or used as widely by students or academics.&nbsp; The term haptics is derived from the Greek phrase&nbsp; meaning &lsquo;to come in contact with&rsquo;, the term is currently used by Computer Scientists to relate to mechanical machine-led touch interactions. Although in recent times haptics are better known to enhance game play or increase tactility in mobile phones, there is an undercurrent of trend using haptics for more formal learning instances to increase students' immersion in studying &lsquo;hands-on&rsquo; based disciplines e.g. design, applied science, applied maths, engineering. This presentation will define the term haptics from an historical and modern perspective and offer how haptics has been shown to enhance students' immersions and perceptions for applied study.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>10.40-11.20&nbsp; Sonifications: experiences in applying them in an OU context</strong> - Karen Vines (Mathematics and Statistics, STEM Faculty)</li>
</ul>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;- </strong>Sonification is the depiction of information using non-speech audio thus providing a means of listening to data, literally. As such sonifications have the potential to enhance module materials, and more importantly improve accessibility by providing non-visual representations of plots. In this talk I will discuss a couple of eSTEeM projects which explored this potential in the OU context.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>10:30 - 11:00&nbsp;&nbsp; The MA in Translation: some challenges and opportunities&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;active presentation - </strong>Dr S&eacute;verine Hubscher-Davidson&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> In this talk, I will briefly explain how direct authoring and active presentation have shaped the new MA in Translation, what were the key benefits and challenges associated with these practices from an academic perspective, and what lessons could be learnt for future modules and qualifications aiming to go down this route. The talk will draw on the team&rsquo;s experience of creating three 60 credit postgraduate modules in this way, and will also include student perspectives.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong><em>Dr S&eacute;verine Hubscher-Davidson</em> </strong>is Head of Translation in the School of Languages and Applied Linguistics. She was previously Head of Translation Studies at Aston University and Head of French at the University of Salford before that, and has 13 years of experience in teaching and researching translation. At the OU Severine is also one of the convenors of the Open Languages Research Group.</p>

<li><strong>11.00-11.30&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct-authoring and active presentation on A329, the Making of Welsh History</strong> - Richard Marsden</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em> A329 was produced under the auspices of project Minerva to trial new approaches to production and pedagogy. As well as making extensive use of pre-existing external content and engaging students in a deep and continuous online learning community, it was direct-authored by the module team and employs an active model of presentation whereby module materials are updated and amended in real-time in response to student need. This talk will reflect on the benefits and challenges of those direct-authoring and active presentation approaches, and will also consider some of the wider implications of this direction of travel for OU students and staff.</p>
<p><strong><em>Richard Marsden</em></strong> is a Staff Tutor in History and also an Associate Lecturer. He was previously a Senior Lecturer in Online Learning at Cardiff Metropolitan University, and before that a Lecturer in History at Cardiff University. At Cardiff he also ran the university&rsquo;s Pathways to a Degree programme for adults returning to education without formal qualifications.</p>

<li><strong>10.00-10.30&nbsp; Supporting students to represent their student journeys: Possibilities for narrative capture, reflective learning, dialogue and feedback </strong>- Kate Lister (Learning &amp; Teaching Development Manager (Accessibility), LTI)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - Our Journey is an innovative and engaging tool that has the potential to support student wellbeing in a variety of ways. Used autonomously, it can provide a vehicle for student reflection, while if facilitated it can be used in a support context to enable dialogue, or in research capacity to structure narrative. Used at scale, it can enable student-led feedback on student experiences, providing institutions with the data needed to enable systematic change. In addition to introducing and demonstrating Our Journey, this presentation will explore the student-led rationale behind the tool, the participatory design process through which it was created and examples of the ways it is being used to support and enhance student wellbeing.</p>

<li>&nbsp;<strong>10.30-11.00&nbsp; The world at their fingertips? The mental wellbeing of online distance learning law students </strong>- Dr Rajvinder Samra (Lecturer in Health, WELS,) (presenter); Dr Emma Jones (Teaching Director, Law); Dr Mathijs Lucassen (Senior Lecturer Mental Health, WELS)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> -&nbsp;In recent years, there has been an increased interest in student mental wellbeing within higher education. In terms of legal education, much of this has been focused on the USA and Australia, with a limited consideration of legal education in the UK. There has also been a lack of exploration into the factors linked to the mental wellbeing of online distance learning law students in general. This has resulted in notable gaps in our knowledge of the challenges these students may experience, as well as understanding the type of support that meets their needs. This presentation presents data gathered from an empirical study of the mental wellbeing of OU law students. Quantitative results about mental wellbeing from validated questionnaires will be presented, as well as qualitative data from open-ended items about the challenges to students&rsquo; mental wellbeing, current sources of support, and students&rsquo; recommendations for improving their mental wellbeing.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>11.15-11.45&nbsp; Conversation and community: what the Big White Wall can offer Open University students </strong>- Dr Troy Cooper (Head of School, FASS, School of Psychology)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - The Open University&rsquo;s relationship to its students is changing with the changes in external political and HE context.&nbsp; In the last three years academic research, NUS reports and policy institute scholarship have documented an apparent increase in presentation of mental health issues by students at UK HEIs, and this had been noted by government HE departments in their policy and regulatory activity. The high tuition fees paid by students directly through their loans, now carry a growing expectation of high levels of student welfare services and wellbeing support to enable them to complete their studies.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->In this context earlier this year VCE initiated formation of the Academic Services Mental Health Working Group to consider the level of provision of student mental health and wellbeing support at the OU, and any actions we should take to improve it.&nbsp; &nbsp;After an audit of existing provision the Group set up a project to procure access to an online wellbeing community and set of resources called Big White Wall (BWW) for all OU students. &nbsp;&nbsp;This was launched in October, formally on World Mental Health Day October 10th.&nbsp; I will discuss what BWW offers, how it works, why it was chosen, and how it has launched and landed.&nbsp; I will conclude by raising some larger questions about the level, kind and extent of wellbeing and mental health support the University could consider developing in future, and the much broader benefits to student success.</p>

<li><strong>10.00-10.30 OU Analyse - The models - how it works? What's under the bonnet? Future development direction </strong>- Martin Hlosta (Research Associate, STEM/KMi)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract -</strong> OUAnalyse (<a href="http://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/">http://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk</a>)&nbsp;is a project piloting machine-learning based methods for early identification of students at risk of failing. We primarily focus on identifying students who are at risk of not submitting (or failing) the next Tutor Marked Assignment (TMA). This has been identified as a proxy for the possible future student failure and also a close milestone to focus in case an intervention is needed. The predictions are generated weekly and the students with their risk of failure are available in the dashboard to the Course tutors and Module Chairs to consider appropriate support. The predictions and other supportive information within the dashboard support the course users in better understanding of their students. In my talk, I will describe how we generate the predictions, which data we use and also describe our current work on the Personalised Study Recommender.</p>

</ul>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Abstract</strong> - The Student Probabilities model produces probabilities, or predictions, of an individual student reaching specific milestones in their module&nbsp;(for example, completing the module, returning in the next academic year).&nbsp; These predictions are based on models built from observed behaviour of students in previous academic years, applied to the current cohort. This information can be used in various ways - for example, in helping to identify students to target for interventions; in identifying modules where the pattern of success differs from the norm; in managing student cohorts on modules of particular interest. All of these uses could result in increasing student success. We have evidence that early interventions carried out by SSTs using the Student Probabilities for selection have beneficial impact on student retention.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - OU Analyse (OUA) is a system that predicts students at risk of not submitting their next assignment. It has been used in more than 48 modules across the university during the last three academic years (2015-2018). &nbsp;This presentation presents evidence about the effectiveness of OUA for supporting teachers and&nbsp;students through a systematic mixed-methods evaluation (interviews, focus-groups, statistical comparisons, learning analytics data). &nbsp;Evidence suggest that OUA use by teachers is a significant predictor of students&rsquo; performance and retention, with average teachers&rsquo; engagement leading to better learning outcomes, over and above teachers&rsquo; and students&rsquo; general performance. Qualitative data point to positive views of involved stakeholder in using predictive data widely across the university, with teachers in particular recognising its usefulness in complementing the teaching practice and monitoring students&rsquo; behaviour online.</p>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>Abstract</strong> - OU Analyse (OUA) is a system that predicts students at risk of not submitting their next assignment. It has been used in more than 48 modules across the university during the last three academic years (2015-2018). &nbsp;This presentation presents evidence about the effectiveness of OUA for supporting teachers and&nbsp;students through a systematic mixed-methods evaluation (interviews, focus-groups, statistical comparisons, learning analytics data). &nbsp;Evidence suggest that OUA use by teachers is a significant predictor of students&rsquo; performance and retention, with average teachers&rsquo; engagement leading to better learning outcomes, over and above teachers&rsquo; and students&rsquo; general performance. Qualitative data point to positive views of involved stakeholder in using predictive data widely across the university, with teachers in particular recognising its usefulness in complementing the teaching practice and monitoring students&rsquo; behaviour online.</p>

<p><strong>You are warmly invited to the next eLearning Community event: Student Voice. Understanding our students and learning from them</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timetable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10.00-10.30&nbsp; Student consultation in the framework of student voice </strong>- Rachel Garnham and Jack Orbell (Academic Services, PVC Students)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - This presentation will look at how the University&rsquo;s Student Voice framework and Action Plan have been established and the role of the Student Voice Steering Group, particularly in light of the introduction of the new Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Students. We will look at the next steps needed in meeting the University&rsquo;s commitments to student voice as set out in the Student Charter and the OU-OU Students Association Relationship Agreement. We will also introduce the University&rsquo;s student consultative process and take a look at the role it plays in enabling students to talk to staff about areas for improvement at all levels. We will look at some successes and areas for improvement, paying attention to all elements of the feedback cycle &ndash; involving students in setting the agenda, participating in the consultation, analysing and acting on student views and &ndash; hugely important &ndash; closing the feedback loop!</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<strong>10.30-11.00&nbsp; Developing community among a diverse student body: research students at the OU </strong>- Emily Yossarian and Robert Wilson (Graduate School Network, OU Grad School)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - The OU Postgraduate Research Student (PGR) community is a small but vital part of the OU&rsquo;s mission, doing PhDs and professional doctorates. There are around 1000 students in all disciplines, distributed across campus, working remotely and in affiliated research centres across the globe. Our challenge has been around fostering inter-disciplinary communities, across on-campus and off-campus students. We strive to balance a vibrant online network with an equally supportive research community in our physical spaces here at Walton Hall. &nbsp;In each case we encourage student-led initiatives, celebrate students successes and acknowledge struggles in a supportive manner. &nbsp;In this talk, we&rsquo;ll present some of the events and interventions that worked, and some that really didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; <strong>11.00-11.25 Coffee / Tea Break</strong></li>
<li><strong><strong><strong><strong>11.25-12.00&nbsp; The Unheard Student Voice </strong>- </strong></strong></strong>Ruth McFarlane (Students in&nbsp;Secure Environments Team, Widening Access and Success Services)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - There are currently 1800 people studying an OU module in prison, who achieve results on a par with general population students in spite of the many barriers they face. Having only very limited access to the VLE (via learn7 &ndash; a locked down version of learn2), most students make full use of their printed offline pack and many still write their assignments by hand. Students in prison are not allowed to use the tutor group forums or to have direct contact with other students and they often feel very isolated. The Students in Secure Environments team (SiSE) is working in prisons to offer opportunities for students to give direct feedback on their study experience and to share study experiences, via Student Councils, Study Skills sessions and Academic Seminars. This session will introduce a student profile and some images and experiences of the study environment, as well as some comments from students in prison about their involvement in these activities and feedback from the SEaM survey.</p>
<p>You are welcome to attend for all or part of the event, and we will aim to stick to timings to enable you to do that.

<p><strong>You are warmly invited to the next eLearning Community event: Supporting Students in Independent Study</strong></p>
<p><strong>Timetable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10.00-10.25&nbsp; From Directed Independent Learning to co-teaching, and back again</strong> - Lynda Prescott (Associate Dean (LTI)&nbsp;FASS)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - Currently independent study at undergraduate level tends to be most prominent in the final stages of our degrees. However, some element of independent study is part of module models for Levels 1 and 2 as well. In the interests of building a staged approach, FASS is adopting the pedagogic strategy of Directed Independent Learning for two new Level 1 modules currently in production, but this planning is also supported by lessons learned from a Level 3 dissertation module where students have engaged in co-teaching, with very successful results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10.25-10.50&nbsp; Supporting Independent learning in Psychology</strong>&nbsp;- Helen Kaye (Senior Lecturer, STEM)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - The British Psychological Society (BPS) requires that all students complete a substantial piece of empirical research, generally in their final year of a psychology degree. In DE300 (Exploring Psychology 3) this requirement is met by students carrying out an independent project under the close supervision of their tutor. Students can draw on any area of psychology that they&rsquo;ve encountered during their studies and use one of 3 methods of investigation to collect data from their peers. To enable the projects to be completed in an ethically and methodologically sound manner DE300 has developed an interactive pre-module course where students explore the research methods available to them. Students are selectively allocated to ALs who have particular expertise in one of those methods, and each is provided with an individual project forum where they share ideas, materials, data, etc., with their AL. The ALs act as project supervisors providing personalised support and guidance as students pursue their individual learning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10.50-11.10 Coffee / Tea Break</strong></li>
<li><strong>11.10-11.35&nbsp; TM470: The Computing and IT Project </strong>- Soraya Kouadri / Leonor Barroca (Senior Lecturers, STEM)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - TM470 is the end of award project in a set of Computing &amp; IT qualifications. It allows students to explore in depth an area of Computing &amp; IT Students extending the knowledge from one of their L3 study. It requires a high level of independence and agency with the materials offered supporting the process followed rather than the content of the project. Students are supported by a very experienced group of tutors who act as their supervisors. This is a challenging module for students; we provide a project preparation forum 2 months before module start, for students to discuss ideas for their project; we are also trying to raise awareness of the project from early on, when they start L3 study.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>11.35-12.00&nbsp; How does the Library support students in their independent study?</strong> Ute Manecke (Learning and Teaching Librarian)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - The Library offers a vast number of resources to support students&rsquo; independent study including e-books, e-journals, databases and many other resources that can be accessed full-text. In order to make sure that students exploit the library content to best effect, we offer skills activities and training sessions, which are based on the DIL Framework and we offer students 24/7 help and support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Timetable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10.00-10.25&nbsp; The practical realities of designing and moderating a FutureLearn MOOC </strong>- Anna Calvi (Associate Lecturer and Consultant)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - Over a period of three years I have designed and moderated the &lsquo;Italian for Beginners&rsquo; program of six online Italian MOOCs, the &lsquo;Business Fundamentals: Effective Communication&rsquo; MOOC and &lsquo;Writing an academic essay&rsquo;, a MOOC produced as part of a project initiated by WELS/LAL in conjunction with Project Minerva. This presentation will share insights and reflections on my experience of designing and moderating these MOOCs. I will explain how the objectives of each course, its target audience as well as affordances and constraints of the Future Learn platform have influenced the design phase, the choice of audio-visual materials and the process of repurposing L195 materials. I will also share reflections regarding my experience working with LAL and OUBS teams and under strict time constraints. Finally, I will draw on my experience as MOOC mentor and moderator to comment on the most common student engagement patterns.</p>

<li>&nbsp;<strong>10.25-10.50&nbsp; Can online personal finance education for young people really work?&nbsp;</strong>- Martin Upton (Senior Lecturer in Finance and Director of the Centre for Public Understanding of Finance (PUFin), FBL)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - Martin Upton of FBL talks about the production, launch and impact of the online course Managing My Money for Young Adults (MMMYA). The course was launched on OpenLearn in November 2017 and on FutureLearn in September 2018. Martin will discuss:-</p>
<ul>
<li>The background to the production of the MMMYA course</li>
<li>The course design and the aim of making it both relevant and interesting for the core target audience of 16-18 year olds&nbsp;</li>
<li>The additional support provided to teachers using it in the classroom</li>
<li>How the course was promoted</li>
<li>How mentors have supported the FutureLearn presentations</li>
<li>The take-up and the response by learners</li>
<li>The lessons that are being learnt for future personal finance education projects</li>
</ul>

<li>&nbsp; <strong>10.50-11.15 Coffee / Tea Break</strong></li>
<li><strong><strong><strong><strong>&nbsp; 11.15-11.40&nbsp; Ethical reflections on a MOOC about research ethics </strong>- </strong></strong></strong>Alison Fox (Senior Lecturer, WELS)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - This presentation charts the building of a FutureLearn MOOC People Studying People: Research Ethics in Society. The MOOC runs for six weeks twice a year and since 2017 has run five times. It is not very massive, as far as MOOCs go, but has been recruiting variable numbers of between 500-2500 participants. The eLC presentation covers how researching the MOOC was scoped, conducted and reported. The aims of the research were to learn from the collective discussions of the participants about ethical issues associated with the ethical framework forming the basis of the MOOC. However, the research changed to look at the effects of researching a MOOC using the ethical framework itself. The presentation will discuss issues about FutureLearn policies, participant rights, and the participant experience that are of particular importance for colleagues engaged in development of MOOCs at the OU.</p>

<div style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>11.40-12.15&nbsp; Making Change Happen:&nbsp;MOOCs and Development - </strong>Tim Seal (Senior Project Manager, IDO/WELS)</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> - The OU worked with Oxfam to develop a MOOC &lsquo;Make Change Happen&rsquo; delivered via FutureLearn. The course was designed to support activists working in the wider humanitarian sector&nbsp;on how they can better understand power dynamics to positively drive social change.&nbsp;This was developed&nbsp;collaboratively&nbsp;with Oxfam&rsquo;s subject expertise and the OU&rsquo;s learning expertise over the course of 2018. Starting with a 2 day exploratory design workshop and drawing on a diverse team of experts from Oxfam&rsquo;s global network the course attracted learners from over 150 countries. It consists of&nbsp;24&nbsp;hours of learning across&nbsp;8&nbsp;sessions, and the approach focuses on learners engaging in and sharing their own context by which to gain greater understanding of the systems in which they are working and living.&nbsp;There will be 3 presentations of this MOOC:&nbsp;one in 2018 which had 3,839 enrolled learners, and a further two presentations in 2019 one of which is currently underway. This talk will provide an over view of the process in developing the course with focus on working with partners externally to the OU. The MOOC can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/make-change-happen" target="_blank">www.futurelearn.com/courses/make-change-happen</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
