<p><strong>14:00 - 14:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the pain worth the gain? (Hillary Collins, Business School)</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Hilary Collins, Lecturer and Student Experience Manager at The Open University Business School</p>
<p>What role can Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) play in enhancing the perceived value of higher education? Whether or not MOOCs will revolutionize higher education or whether they are a&nbsp;passing fad is perhaps of&nbsp;less&nbsp;importance. They can perhaps be seen as creating value &ndash; from the learners&rsquo; perspective- but is the pain worth the gain?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>14:45 - 15:00 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coffee break</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>15:00 - 15:45 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Designing and delivering a language MOOC on FutureLearn (Zsuzsanna B&aacute;rk&aacute;nyi and Anna Proudfoot, School of Languages and Applied</strong> <strong>Linguistics)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Language MOOCs have now been added to the ever-growing list of open courses offered by various providers, including FutureLearn. The School of Languages and Applied Linguistics at The Open University launched its first language MOOCs, a programme of six Spanish for Beginners courses from August 2016, and a programme of six Italian for Beginners courses from September 2016, all delivered on the FutureLearn platform. They contained activities designed to enhance receptive (reading, listening) and productive (writing, speaking) language skills, and encouraged learners to use the target language from the very beginning.</p>
<p>In a massive course, where a discussion can attract hundreds of comments, moderation, support and feedback represent a big challenge for the lead educators and moderators, and the heterogeneous composition of the learners, who come from a range of countries and backgrounds, also requires a certain level of intercultural awareness both in learners and educators.</p>
<p>We will offer an insight on the experiences of designing and delivering language MOOCs in Italian and Spanish on FutureLearn, and will discuss the opportunities and challenges encountered, and what worked and what didn&rsquo;t, paying special attention to the challenges posed by teaching (and learning) speaking skills with no face-to-face or synchronous contact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The event takes place during <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/">Open Education Week</a> and will be live streamed to an international audience. The recording of the event will also be made available openly outside the university on <a href="http://stadium.open.ac.uk/stadia/index.php?s=31">Stadium</a>.</p>

              <title>Gender Issues in HE</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10236</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The focus of the second e-learning community e-LC event for 2017 will&nbsp;be on gender issues in HE with four linked presentations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Where</strong>: Library Seminar Rooms 1 &amp; 2</h2>
<h2><strong>When</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;10:00-12:30, Tuesday 21 February 2017&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>10:00 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrival and introductions</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>10:05</strong> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Title - Initiatives in Gender in STEM&nbsp; (Katie Chicot, &nbsp;Mathematics and Statistics, STEM)</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In this talk I will review some research in gender issues in STEM. Then I will talk through resources we have developed and disseminated through Open Learn.&nbsp;Together with Clem Herman Katie produced a Badged Open Course to support people returning to careers in STEM. A light version of the course, &nbsp;intended to be used on module devices, was also produced. These resources will be combined with other support for people returning to careers in STEM in a new project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>10:40</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Gender Equality in Computing &amp; IT (Magnus Ramage,&nbsp; C&amp;C, STEM)</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><em>&lsquo;Girls can code&rsquo;</em>, according to a recent campaign and television series. Yet for large proportions of women, computing &amp; IT subjects have been profoundly off-putting. This talk will examine why that matters, to both women and men, to the wider economy, and (more parochically) to student numbers on one of the OU&rsquo;s largest programmes, in Computing &amp; IT. I will discuss the student numbers on different parts of the OU&rsquo;s curriculum, examined in some detail for the successful Athena SWAN bid from the School of Computing &amp; Communications, compared to good practice in other institutions, and try to draw out some of the issues in gender equality for computing &amp; IT&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>11:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coffee Break</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>11:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Why&nbsp;are women making different choices in computing and IT study? &nbsp;(Elaine Thomas,&nbsp; C&amp;C, STEM)</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Despite numerous initiatives aiming to increase&nbsp;participation, the number of female students studying for computing degrees is&nbsp;falling across the entire HE sector.&nbsp;Recent data on the percentage of women registering&nbsp;on the Open University&rsquo;s Computing &amp; IT degree suggests that the issue is&nbsp;one of recruitment rather than of&nbsp;retention. The data also shows that a lower proportion&nbsp;of women register for the single honours Computing &amp; IT degree than for the&nbsp;joint honours or the open degree.&nbsp;This suggests that women are making different&nbsp;choices about computing degrees from male students. This presentation reports&nbsp;on initial data from an eSTEeM-sponsored project that uses focus groups and&nbsp;survey data to explore gendered differences in study motivation across the&nbsp;different computing-related degree&nbsp;programmes.</p>
<h3><strong>12:00 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Athena SWAN:&nbsp; advancing the careers of women academics working in STEM areas &nbsp;(Jane Wardale,&nbsp; Research and Academic Strategy Unit)</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In this presentation, I will give a brief overview of Athena SWAN, and the OU&rsquo;s involvement in it, before exploring how the OU has responded as an institution to the Athena SWAN challenge.&nbsp; In particular, I will describe some of the practical initiatives and measures that&nbsp;&nbsp; have been introduced, and how they have made a difference.&nbsp; Finally, I will look at the ways in which the Athena SWAN scheme is changing, and at the opportunities that represents for the OU.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As always you are welcome to attend for all or part of the session. We try to stick to timings to enable you to do that.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The eLC will be discussing computer-marked assessment at the OU: current practice and ways of improvement</h2>
<p>The focus of the first e-learning community event for 2017 will be computer-marked assessment (CMA) with three linked presentations discussing current practices and ways of improving assessment through CMAs.</p>
<p>ã€€ã€€</p>
<h2>ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ Where: <strong>Library Seminar Rooms 1 &amp; 2</strong></h2>
<h2>ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ When:<strong> 10:00-12:15, Tuesday 24 January 2017</strong>ã€€</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>10:00&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrival and introductions</h3>
<h3>10:05&nbsp;&nbsp; Improving the quality of computer-marked assessment (Professor Sally Jordan, STEM)ã€€</h3>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Sally has been using online interactive computer-marked assessment in her Open University teaching since 2002 and has been delighted to see a steady growth in the use of iCMAs across the University. However she does not see iCMAs as a panacea, and feels that there is still scope for improvement in the quality of what we do. She will explain ways in which she thinks quality can be improved, focussing on assessment design, the use of a range of question types, improving the quality of our questions, and monitoring student engagement.ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€</p>
<h3>10:40&nbsp;&nbsp; STACK &ndash; Open-ended computer-marked assessment formaths (Dr. Tim Lowe, STEM)ã€€</h3>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->STACK is a question type in the VLE which uses a computer algebra system for assessing mathematics. We have been using it at the OU for several years on a range of modules. Tim will describe what the system does, how it is used and how that impacts students.</p>
<h3>11:15&nbsp;&nbsp; Coffee Breakã€€</h3>
<h3>11:30&nbsp;&nbsp; Other types of open-ended computer marked questions: Pattern-match and CodeRunner (Dr. Tim Hunt, IT)ã€€</h3>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Pattern-match is a question type that can automatically grade sentence-length free-text responses to questions. Recently it was enhanced to make it easier to create such questions. CodeRunner is a brand new addition to the VLE. It is a question type for teaching computer programming. It will be included in the March VLE release, for use in Computing modules from the second half of 2017 onwards. Tim will demonstrate these features, and talk about how they might be used in modules.ã€€</p>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>Student Success in the OU: definitions, targets and examples : Maria Kantirou (Head of Student Success in STEM) and Sam Thorne (Head of Student Success in FBL)</strong></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->What is the OU&rsquo;s institutional definition of &lsquo;student success&rsquo;? What are the key retention priorities and targets that we have set for ourselves for the next three years? &nbsp;The speakers will discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the latest on institutional student success targets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what various stakeholders perceive as student success;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how student retention is monitored at University and Faculty level.</p>

</ul>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS--><strong>Improving retention on a Level 1 Social Science module: Matt Staples</strong></p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Inspired by the &lsquo;More Students Qualifying&rsquo; theme within the Students First Transformation programme, the DD102 module team, chaired by Georgina Blakeley and Matt Staples and working with Martin Higginson, Student Support Team lead for social sciences, have been working incrementally on a number of initiatives that appear to be supporting an increase in retention. The 2016J presentation completion rate is likely to be around four percentage points higher and the 2017B presentation around two to three percentage points higher than the respective presentations the year before. In the talk, Matt Staples, the current DD102 chair, will explore some of the work that has been taking place over the past two presentations of DD102 to do with pre-module contacts for historically low achieving groups, in-module changes to support induction and assessment and in-module contact between module team members and tutors and between tutors and students.</p>

<li><strong>10:00 - 10:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>What can TEL Design offer &ndash; Mat Schencks and Sue Lowe (Senior TEL Designers, LTI)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Mat and Sue will talk about how TEL Design can support module teams, both in the design process during module production and with evaluating modules using learning analytics during presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10:30 - 11:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Creating a curriculum-focused learning community. The S111 experience &ndash; Rafael Hidalgo (Senior TEL Designer, LTI)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->S111 is a new, all on-line entry module in STEM in which the majority of students (62% for 16J) are new to the OU. The Module Team was keen to foster the creation of a learning community and to support this, they combined the use of Social Media with a live, in-campus webcasted event in which students were able to participate remotely. Rafael supported the team as Senior TEL Designer and will talk about his work in supporting the team.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->&nbsp;Preliminary results show a high level of engagement and the lessons learnt are already feeding back into the 17B presentation.</p>
