              <description><![CDATA[<p>This design narrative forms part of an exercise for Open University H800 module.</p>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p><em>I was a school teacher responsible for teaching English.</em></p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I was a supply teacher on a long term placement in a state secondary school (over several terms). The placement happened within the last five years. &nbsp;I was covering a leave of absence and teaching English as a subject.&nbsp; &nbsp;The class in question were around twenty five twelve to thirteen year old pupils (Key Stage 3, in the UK).</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The class were variously described as &lsquo;challenging&rsquo; and &lsquo;lower ability&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the subject in the school, pupils were streamed, and this class was in the lowest mainstream.&nbsp;&nbsp; The class were described as &lsquo;challenging&rsquo; &nbsp;because a large proportion of pupils had statements of additional needs many of which related to behaviour and emotional difficulties.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Lessons for this specific class were held in various classrooms around the school throughout the week.&nbsp; I was therefore required to arrange the logistics of delivering books for every single lesson, with the aid of the pupils.&nbsp; I taught English mainly within a French classroom, thus nearly all the displays related to France and the French language.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Around ten minutes were alloted at the start of each lesson for silent reading by pupils.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>As a supply teacher, I was the pupils&rsquo; second supply teacher within that year.&nbsp; I had taught them for three months before undertaking the learning exercise described below.&nbsp; I had built up a level of trust with the pupils and understanding of their individual needs.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Pupils generally hold a negative view of transient supply teachers, even those employed on a longer-term basis.&nbsp; There is of course the issue of trust.&nbsp; Can we trust this new teacher ?&nbsp; There was the desire, on the pupils&rsquo; part and mine as a teacher, to build a good working relationship based on trust and respect.&nbsp; This took many months to achieve.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Belief : Please note that an important assumption I make as a teacher is that within every pupil is a writer and that every pupil is capable of telling a story in writing.</em></p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I was trying to get the pupils to develop their understanding of the writing process.&nbsp; I wanted the pupils to write about where they were now : this very moment, in the classroom, sitting at a desk, with their friends, in school, with a pen, their thoughts, and the sights, sounds and smells around them... describing their direct experience.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I explained to the class that they would be having a picnic in class in two days&rsquo; time.&nbsp; &nbsp;By picnic, I mean that I would allow the pupils to eat a snack and work during part of the lesson.&nbsp; I explained that they would be doing some creative writing as a lesson focus.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>(Effect &ndash; pupils were amused and surprised as they had never had a &lsquo;picnic&rsquo; in class previously, but looking forward to the experience.&nbsp; There was palpable excitement &ndash; not the fear usually associated with writing.)</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>At the start of the agreed lesson, I explained to pupils that they would be writing in their books about their experience in the classroom, describing what they saw, heard, smelled, thought etc...&nbsp; (Effect &ndash; confusion, pupils not familiar with this way of working, excitement that they could have a snack etc).</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I told the pupils that I too would be writing about my experience in the classroom... but that I would share all my writing with them immediately and live.&nbsp; Thus I used Microsoft Word and ensured it was showing on the projector screen for the whole class to see.&nbsp; The writing was enlarged to make it easily readible by the whole class.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Using my computer, I wrote freely.&nbsp;&nbsp; I described what I saw and noticed in plain language.&nbsp; I mentioned the pupil names where appropriate :</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I notice a French flag draped above the door.&nbsp; This is the first time I&rsquo;ve noticed this flag.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B looks like he&rsquo;s lost in thought, holding his hand against his forehead.&nbsp; L looks at the ceiling, looking for ideas.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>(Effect &ndash; the whiteboard writing caught the attention of pupils.&nbsp; The use of humour in the exemplary writing on the board reduced the &lsquo;fear factor&rsquo; associated with writing with this profile pupil).</em></p>
<p><em>Pupils likewise emulated this process of free writing in their writing books.<br /></em></p>
<p><em>In my writing example, I quoted speech from people in the situation, making it as realistic and lively as possible, reflecting directly on experience as it was happening.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Obstacle.&nbsp; As I was describing in writing the experience of the classroom, some of the pupils saw this as a means of &lsquo;playing up&rsquo; so that they were named in the written exemplary albeit in a humourous tone.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>After giving the example writing to pupils, I moved around the classroom, reading pupil work, encouraging, making suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the lesson, I took in pupils work for marking and for feedback during next lesson.&nbsp; </em></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>As regards pupils developing their understanding of the writing process, the expected outcome was that most of the pupils were able to describe some aspects of their direct experience.&nbsp; This was achieved as evidenced in their written work.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Unexpected outcomes :&nbsp; Describing what is happening in a live classroom, quoting people as they speak, has an engaging and humourous quality about it reducing the typical tensions associated with writing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also actively &nbsp;demonstrates the use of speech and quotation, but it can become a distraction to the learning focus, as evidenced in my post lesson reflection.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Additional outcomes : Using the whiteboard to &lsquo;live write&rsquo; as an exemplary for pupils led to much imitative writing.&nbsp; This of course is a facet of writing that could be discussed in a future lesson (how one can imitate or parody other writing, for example).</em></p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Using the computer and projector to model &lsquo;free writing&rsquo; in a live classroom context can be very effective as a means of encouraging the pupil/learner/writer.&nbsp; With portable display technology (eg. an iPad attached to an Apple TV device linked to a screen) one could show pupils&rsquo; work in a similar live way on the screen during the lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is much potential here for formative assessment, peer assessment etc.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Fear is a major learning obstacle in English as indeed every subject.&nbsp; Embedding this writing exercise within a picnic in a classroom may seem a little eccentric but this, along with the humour co-created in the experience, it helped make the learning much more effective because it didn&rsquo;t seem like hard &lsquo;classwork&rsquo; but instead it seemed more natural and more like &lsquo;having fun&rsquo;. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>One of the transferable metacognitive insights pupils can gain from this exercise concerns their own creative process in producing writing : recording their first draft (as in this lesson example), subsequently showing and sharing, re-drafting, developing, editing etc.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>

              <title>Review of representations - 4Ts and 4SPPIces - H800 Activity Wk8 A2a</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>4Ts and 4SPPIces Model</strong></p>
<p><strong>Readability</strong></p>
<p><strong>4Ts&nbsp; -&nbsp;Task, technology, team and time</strong></p>
<p>The graphical depiction of &lsquo;lanes&rsquo; and use of flowchart-type symbols increase &nbsp;readability.&nbsp; It condenses the action a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Easier to scan the plan.&nbsp; As the brief notes output is &lsquo;cear and tidy&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>4SPPIces</strong></p>
<p><strong>Readable after time spent become familiar with unusual layout of element.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Expressiveness</strong></p>
<p><strong>4Ts&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Although able to split lanes limited expressivness due to lack of space to add more detail.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>In the example, the design limited by language used... mainly action verbs.</p>
<p>No priority given visually in terms of task timing and importance, eg. circles for tasks of 5 minutes exactly the same size as circles for 15 minute tasks.</p>
<p><strong>4SPPIces</strong></p>
<p>Model seems capable of expressiveness when used for suitable learning contexts (as described in the extract).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Utility</p>
<p>4Ts&nbsp;</p>
<p>Useful in conveying a succinct, user-friendly, readable learning plan, but lacks abilty to express finer detail and nuance.</p>
<p><strong>4SPPIces</strong></p>
<p>Best used for matching learning context (as described in the extract).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Are the designs adequate for expressing your design?</strong></p>
<p>The 4TS model would be suitable for expressing my design and it could serve as a simplified but very effective representation drawing on the graphical strengths of 4TS. The 4SSPIces model would not be adequate as it would be an unnecessarily convoluted way of expressing my design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What would the benefits of using these representations for your design?&nbsp; Please explain your views.</strong></p>
<p>The representations would generally help define the key elements in the process &ndash; eg. in 4Ts task, technology, team and time &ndash; and make it easier to see and manipulate these elements in the designing process.</p>]]></description>
