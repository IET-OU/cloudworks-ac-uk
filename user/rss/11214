              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Healthy Eating as a 4Ts model</strong></p>
<p>I like this model a lot really clear and easy to read.</p>
<p><strong>Readability:&nbsp; </strong>Very readable with a clear overview of what is taking place at each stage.&nbsp; I have been introduced to a similar model during training with The Training Foundation/QA so probably why I was at ease with this module.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find this a very readable representation, possibly due to my previous experience with it. It provides a clear overview of&nbsp;how the lesson is to progress, the activities to take place at each stage, how the students are to be grouped, and how long each stage should take.</p>
<p><strong>Expressiveness:</strong>&nbsp; I think that there is a lot of expressiveness in this model.&nbsp; The lanes give the opportunity to expand more by inserting more columns e.g. back up technologies if the IT fails etc and add even more lanes.&nbsp; A lot is able to be described quite succinctly using these lanes.</p>
<p><strong>Utility:&nbsp;</strong> Really useful and clear.&nbsp; I can share this with colleagues and they could follow it with minimal explanation.&nbsp; Really easy to refer to.&nbsp; The strength is in its clarity, the description starts with the diagram which is extremely clear and tells you everything you need to know before diving into the narrative.</p>
<p><strong>Healthy Eating as an ISiS model</strong></p>
<p>Although I initially thought this model was difficult, I actually after a few re-reads can see the utility.</p>
<p><strong>Readability:</strong> I am a visual learner and for me there was far too much going on, to many symbols and seems a bit over complicated.&nbsp; However after reading a few times there is a logical sequence.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t that clear about the various interactions between the students and the teachers etc and what is happening when.</p>
<p><strong>Expressiveness:&nbsp; </strong>There is just as much scope for expressiveness as with the 4Ts possibly a bit more.&nbsp; The visual representation in figure 3 using the ScenEdit tool shows the level of expressiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Utility:</strong>&nbsp;It does seem quite complex to use.&nbsp; It may end up with the trainer working out and spending a lot of time working out how to use the technology rather than delivering the lesson.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Additional note</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion both models in very different ways did meet and connect with the learning objectives/outcome.&nbsp; For me the 4Ts was clearer.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they adequate for expressing your design?</strong></p>
<p>Without a doubt the 4Ts model would be more suitable for expressing my design. The swim lanes would be great to clearly and simply articulate the tasks, technology needed, time etc, whether it is one to one or a group session.&nbsp; It would be easier than my long narrative.</p>
<p>The ISiS model is not as useful but I think it could be adapted and used for my purposes.&nbsp; The visual aspects of the ScenEdit tool are the parts I would be keen to try out.</p>
<p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; What would be the benefits of using these representations for your design? Please explain your views.</strong></p>
<p>On the whole the visual representations and being able to plan out in a systematic way of planning.&nbsp; It allows the trainer and others to have a look and make comments and feedback which is key.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of the 4Ts model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to read</li>
<li>Easy to transfer between teams of trainers, great for inducting new staff as part of Train the Trainers</li>
<li>Simple visual representations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of the ISIS model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Visual representation of activities and tools</li>
<li>Is very learner centred so focus on the students inputs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Healthy Eating as an ISiS model</strong></p>
<p>Although I initially thought this model was difficult, I actually after a few re-reads can see the utility.</p>
<p><strong>Readability:</strong>&nbsp;I am a visual learner and for me there was far too much going on, to many symbols and seems a bit over complicated.&nbsp; However after reading a few times there is a logical sequence.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t that clear about the various interactions between the students and the teachers etc and what is happening when.</p>
<p><strong>Expressiveness:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>There is just as much scope for expressiveness as with the 4Ts possibly a bit more.&nbsp; The visual representation in figure 3 using the ScenEdit tool shows the level of expressiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Utility:</strong>&nbsp;It does seem quite complex to use.&nbsp; It may end up with the trainer working out and spending a lot of time working out how to use the technology rather than delivering the lesson.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Additional note</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion both models in very different ways did meet and connect with the learning objectives/outcome.&nbsp; For me the 4Ts was clearer.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they adequate for expressing your design?</strong></p>
<p>Without a doubt the 4Ts model would be more suitable for expressing my design. The swim lanes would be great to clearly and simply articulate the tasks, technology needed, time etc, whether it is one to one or a group session.&nbsp; It would be easier than my long narrative.</p>
<p>The ISiS model is not as useful but I think it could be adapted and used for my purposes.&nbsp; The visual aspects of the ScenEdit tool are the parts I would be keen to try out.</p>
<p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; What would be the benefits of using these representations for your design? Please explain your views.</strong></p>
<p>On the whole the visual representations and being able to plan out in a systematic way of planning.&nbsp; It allows the trainer and others to have a look and make comments and feedback which is key.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of the 4Ts model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to read</li>
<li>Easy to transfer between teams of trainers, great for inducting new staff as part of Train the Trainers</li>
<li>Simple visual representations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of the ISIS model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Visual representation of activities and tools</li>
<li>Is very learner centred so focus on the students inputs</li>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Healthy Eating as a 4Ts model</strong></p>
<p>I like this model a lot really clear and easy to read.</p>
<p><strong>Readability:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Very readable with a clear overview of what is taking place at each stage.&nbsp; I have been introduced to a similar model during training with The Training Foundation/QA so probably why I was at ease with this module.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find this a very readable representation, possibly due to my previous experience with it. It provides a clear overview of&nbsp;how the lesson is to progress, the activities to take place at each stage, how the students are to be grouped, and how long each stage should take.</p>
<p><strong>Expressiveness:</strong>&nbsp; I think that there is a lot of expressiveness in this model.&nbsp; The lanes give the opportunity to expand more by inserting more columns e.g. back up technologies if the IT fails etc and add even more lanes.&nbsp; A lot is able to be described quite succinctly using these lanes.</p>
<p><strong>Utility:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Really useful and clear.&nbsp; I can share this with colleagues and they could follow it with minimal explanation.&nbsp; Really easy to refer to.&nbsp; The strength is in its clarity, the description starts with the diagram which is extremely clear and tells you everything you need to know before diving into the narrative.</p>
