<p>SCoPE is an online community hosted by BCcampus in British Columbia, Canada. The core activity in SCoPE is scheduled seminar discussions facilitated  by volunteers. This is a tradition that began with the Global Educators' Network in 1999 as part of the TeleLearning Network of Centres of Excellence. At SCoPE we also host special interest groups (SIGs) by request,  online conferences, and special projects as they emerge. Ideas for  seminar discussion topics and other SCoPE activities emerge through participation in the communitiy.</p>
<p>SCoPE seminars are free and open to the public. We attempt to cater to busy professionals. In that sense, there is no registration process for seminars and members are free to participate according to their own time and interests. We welcome participation on the periphery through the Web and RSS; no login is required.</p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>As part of the Learning Design Workshop a group of ETUG members decided to focus the next workshop as a design project. We talked about format and venue, and reflected on the current and past workshops and what made them successful. We also began to gather ideas for workshop themes, and the important topics that are on our minds these days. But most importantly, we wanted to find ways to find out YOUR ed tech hot topics. What are your burning issues? debate topics?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add your ideas here, or on twitter using this tag: #etugidea</p>
<p>Really go crazy adding your ideas! We will consider these topics for the Spring Workshop as well as planning for online discussions.</p>

<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Since its original publication, Garrison, Anderson and Archer&rsquo;s (2000) &ldquo;Critical Inquiry in A Text-based Environment: Computer Conferencing in Higher Education&rdquo; has inspired a great many researchers and advanced our understanding of online learning and online education. In recent years, a number of reviews of the Community of Inquiry framework (CoI) have been published, including, Garrison and Arbaugh&rsquo;s (2007), Swan and Ice (2010). Cindy Xin, author of a recently-published critique (Xin, 2012) will be with us to explain her argument and, together with Sarah Haavind, facilitate a discussion reconsidering the CoI and its recent reviews and critiques. By provoking new thoughts and possibly constructing new theories and methods, we hope to further our understanding of online discussion in particular, and online education in general.</p>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2503</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>This session will describe the collaborative team approach and provide some examples of collaborative learning design models used at <a href="http://www.bcit.ca/">British Columbia Institute of Technology</a>. BCIT is characterized by a considerable range of programs and students, which requires careful consideration of the teaching and learning context and the various stakeholders &ndash; professional governing bodies, industry, subject matter experts, and program requirements &ndash; in the development of learning and teaching materials. As a result, the e-learning continuum is quite varied at BCIT and presents both challenge and opportunities.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Session: Designing for Engagement</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2462</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2462</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Foundational learning theories recognize that getting and keeping students&rsquo; attention during learning activities is critical to effective learning. Yet, little research has been done on how to address this challenge explicitly in design processes, especially when teaching adult learners.</p>
<p>Denise Withers, Learning Design Specialist at the Sauder School of Business (UBC) and retired documentary filmmaker, tackles this tough topic by exploring, then building on, the combined experience of the workshop participants as facilitators of learning, as well as the latest research into engagement. Esther Hsu will assist during the session by creating a live visual overview of the presentation. Together, Denise and the participants will:</p>
<ul>
<li>De-bunk marketing hype about what engagement is &ndash; and isn&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Explore the concept of the &ldquo;gap&rdquo; as the essence of engagement.</li>
<li>Discover why story is one of the most powerful tools designers have for engaging learners.</li>
<li>Try out some of Denise&rsquo;s practical &ldquo;10+1&rdquo; design tips for generating and sustaining learner engagement.</li>

              <title>Session: Designing Learning Spaces in Physical and Virtual Settings</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2461</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/2461</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>What does it mean to design &ldquo;spaces&rdquo; for learning? How do our design choices reflect our aims and perspectives and how do they create different affordances and constraints for learning? How does learning space design differ in physical and virtual settings and how can they inform each other? In this session, Alyssa Wise and Justin Marples will tackle these and other big questions from a learning space design perspective. They will touch on principles of student learning, illustrate how these principles have been applied, in both virtual and physical learning environments, and invite you to explore how spaces might be designed otherwise in order to support student learning.</p>]]></description>

The redesign started with an internal and external program evaluation, and from there a visioning session and curriculum mapping exercise with much input from stakeholders. This session will focus on the process but will also cover the challenges faced and lessons learned.</p>]]></description>
