              <title>Glenn&#39;s Healthy Eating Design Representations: 4SPPICES and eDesign Template</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>The 4SPPIces model sets out a model for the development eLearning materials which concentrates on four factors invloved in the design of courses: Space, Pedological Method, Participants and History.&nbsp;The four elements are represented by four quadrants in a circle. The model is integrated into a tool called LdShake which is designed provide a virtual space in which practitioners&nbsp;&nbsp;(Instructional Designers or experts in education) and technicians&nbsp;(i.e.those&nbsp;knowledgable about available technologies)&nbsp;can jointly work togetherin developing blended learning.</p>
<p>The eDesign Template is a pedagogical model which focuses on four key best practice principles of eLearning design. The four principles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active Induction</li>
<li>Guided exploration</li>
<li>Facilitated Investigation</li>
<li>Self-organised learner</li>
</ul>
<p>The&nbsp;four principles,&nbsp;applied to an eLearning course&nbsp;are&nbsp;incrementally&nbsp;supposed to &nbsp;increaseand scaffold&nbsp;the diversity of interaction and assessment. The eLearning activities are then set out in a matrix, against the four principles, in order to show to what extent the course activities fulfill the four principles.</p>
<p>In terms of readability of the two representations, both were reasonably easy to understand within &nbsp;the Rashomon article. Both used the Healthy Eating activities to illustrate the representations. Both also included Figures and Tables to help to illustrate the collection of data and the interelated best practice principles of eLearning. It is worthwhile pointing out that the text of represenation was written by different people i.e. experts in that representation.</p>
<p>In terms of their expressivenes of the two representations,&nbsp;I find this an unusual facet to try to assess. Does this mean to what extent does the narrative stray from being&nbsp;a purely analytical text to including more opinion and conjecture? Neither text seems to contain unnecessary unsubstantiated text. Its worth noting though that each representation in the Rashomon article wait until their final sentence to describe a succinct explanation as to the purpose of the representations i.e. the 4SPPices model is a virtual space in which stakeholders can have discussions about the design whist the eDesign Template offers a quick and easy reminder of key features of quality learning.</p>
<p>In terms of their utlity, I feel that both representations provide a good overview and explanation of the most important aspects of the design.</p>
<p>In terms of the activity carried out in <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9890">Activity 1b</a>&nbsp;using the two representations would not have been sufficient to express the design of the course. Though the 4SPPices represention is for the development of blended learning and Activity 1b is a mix of individual research, classroom activities and remote support for participants and therefore could be useful. However there was no collaboration between instructional designers and 'techies` as this was all done by a single person (i.e. me).</p>
<p>The eDesign template may have been useful if I had decided that the overarching aim of the course was to instil the four principles. However Activitiy 1b was not&nbsp;a purely eLearning activity. Nevertheless, it would still be interesting to assess the course against the four principles.</p>]]></description>

              <title>SAT: Study Of The Use of Closed Facebook Groups (CFGs) By Standards Professionals And The Presence Of Community (Glenn Bosmans)</title>

              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11975</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The overall purpose of the study is to assess standards professionals&rsquo; interaction with, and attitude towards, the CFGs e.g. how often and how do they access them- This would inform possible areas of improvement and development of the CFGs.</p>
<p>The second theme gathered evidence of the presence of a community of practice and an epistemic community among the members.</p>
<p>A community of practice (CoP) is a &ldquo;group of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly*. The essential elements of a CoP are those of domain community and practice&nbsp;(Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991).</p>
<p>An epistemic community is defined as a group of professionals, often from a variety of different disciplines, which produce policy-relevant knowledge about complex technical issues (Haas, 1992). The essential elements of an epistemic community being shared beliefs, shared causal beliefs, shared beliefs of validity and shared a set of common practices associated with a set of problems to which their professional competence is directed.</p>
<p>Members of eight regional Closed Facebook Groups were surveyed. The members are all members of national, regional or international standardization organisations or work fields related to standardization from developing countries across the globe.</p>
<p>An online survey using Google Docs template was developed and distributed to the members using the discussion and messaging features within the Closed Facebook Groups.</p>
<p>The survey comprised 7 sections. Your background, Interaction with Closed Facebook Groups, Posting to the CFGs, Online Communities Part 1, Online Communities Part 2 and Final Thoughts. A total of 44 questions were asked.</p>
<p>Responses to date indicate that almost all respondents access Facebook and many access the CFGs on a daily basis. Three quarters have posted an item onto the CFGs themselves and all have &lsquo;liked&rsquo; a comment. The machine translations of posts are considered accurate. 93% of respondents prefer the posts to be in the English language.</p>
<p>Responses from the questions regarding the presence of communities indicate that the elements identified are present.</p>
<p><strong>Brief summary of your interpretations and conclusions</strong></p>
<p>To date the responses to the survey have been low (only 16) and they are a self-selecting group from among the members of the CFGs.</p>
<p>The responses, including the open statements indicate that the members are benefitting and learning from the CFGs. However, the level of interactivity among members could be improved.</p>
<p>The responses indicate the presence of both a community of practice and an epistemic community. Further research is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the communities and what impact their presence has on the field of standardization.</p>]]></description>

The essential elements of an epistemic community being shared beliefs, shared causal beliefs, shared beliefs of validity and shared a set of common practices associated with a set of problems to which their professional competence is directed.</p>
<p>In order to establish whether a CoP / epistemic community was functioning in this domain, a project was undertaken in which members of eight regional Closed Facebook Groups were surveyed. The members are all members of national, regional or international standardization organisations or work fields related to standardization from developing countries across the globe.</p>
<p>An online survey using Google Docs template was developed and distributed to the members using the discussion and messaging features within the Closed Facebook Groups.</p>

<p>These results and associated conclusions will be discussed further in this conference presentation.</p>
