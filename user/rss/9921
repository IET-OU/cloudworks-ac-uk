              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I am a teacher of Biology for higher education courses within a further education college. I designed, created and delivered the learning activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>The group consisted of 4 adult learners on a first year BSc module. The end of module assessment contained a number of multiple choice questions which they needed to answer under examination conditions within a specific timeframe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>In order to suitably prepare the students in the style of questions, a series of multiple choice quizzes were developed, supporting the delivery of the module. Although the content of the questions would not be the same as in the actual exam, the task aimed to allow students to develop strategies that enabled them to successfully navigate the questions within the time constraints of the end of the module assessment. The measure of success for the activity would be through an ongoing evaluation of the scores obtained in the quizzes, which would increase if the learning activity was meeting its objective.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li>Preparation of the assessment questions. These were taken from the content of the module. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Construction of the Socrative Quizzes. This was time consuming but the resources are not available for future years for the duration of the module.</li>
<li>Delivery of the quiz over a ten-week period. Each quiz was delivered as a plenary activity at the end of the last session of the week. The quiz was carried out through mobile devices.</li>
<li>Feedback was provided to student both instantly through the Socrative application and through a PDF showing the results e-mailed to the students after the session. This did not take up very much time as I had such a small group but I can imagine that this task would be cumbersome should it be used with a large group.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>Students reported that the quizzes did help them prepare for the MCQ aspect of the exam.</li>
<li>Scores for the MCQ component of the assessment were mostly higher than for the longer answers required in the other parts of the assessment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing something consistently can be extremely valuable. By using Socrative each week, students did not need to spend unnecessary time familiarising themselves with the quiz software.</p>
<p>2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data provided of the results proved very useful in quickly identifying learners that may struggle with the exam so that appropriate support could be put in place.</p>

              <title>Leanne&#39;s comparisons: 4T&#39;s model and ISiS model</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10383</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10383</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The 4T's model was much easier to read than the ISiS model which used complicated language and terms that I would consider jargon. The ease at which the 4T's model could be understood would, in my opinion, lead to more consistent usage and in turn this would allow practitioners to share learning designs more effectively. Both papers use diagrams which support the reader in understanding the model, this is especially effective for the ISiS model due to its complicated wording.</p>
<p>The ISiS model is supported by software called ScenEdit tool which allows the practitioner to visualise the components into groups. Whilst the results are effective and clearly present the information, I am unsure of the added value of using the tool compared to providing a list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The 4T's model would be more suited to the learning activity described in my <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10379">design narrative</a>. I would be more likely to use the 4T's model as I think I would quickly become overwhelmed by the ISiS model.</p>]]></description>

              <title>MON: Blogging vs Vlogging (Leanne Johnstone)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10199</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/10199</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>It is important that learning experiences and assessments remain relevant and in line with the way information is communicated in the wider world. Blogging has been increasingly used as a method to communicate and this has been reflected within the education sector. The use of blogs has been shown to allow students to exhibit significant gains in their ICT self-efficacy (Papastergiou et al, 2011) and English language skills (Wong Pei Jun, 2012). A drawback of blogging could be that it can be difficult to implement successfully when students have minimal prior experience of doing such an activity (Kerawalla et al, 2007). Microblogging has been shown to have provide a more effective learning experience than traditional blogging for learners with lower attainment levels (Huang et al, 2015).</p>
<p>Vlogs (video logs) are a more recent method of communication where individuals share information in a short clip that is shared online. Although the process of creating an article would be the same, the output would be different. When vlogging, it has been demonstrated that students produce higher level explanations of concepts when using three-dimensional objects as opposed to static images (Lawrie, 2013). It has been found that students enjoy making videos (Smith, 2014) and that vlogs can allow students to organise and reflect on the outcome of their learning (Hung, 2011). Similar barriers to blogging have been found in that technological difficulties may hinder progress (Hung, 2011).</p>
<p>Both blogging and vlogging present opportunities for peer feedback. When students are given an opportunity to evaluate and give comments on each other&rsquo;s work, it has been shown to allow them to develop a deeper understanding of the subject (Thomas et al, 2014) and the quality of the feedback can be the same quality of the tutors (Walker, 2013).</p>
<p>It is important that the impact of the use of blogging and vlogging is understood in terms of the skills and knowledge used. Does one provide a more effective learning experience than the other? What considerations should be when deciding to undertake such activities with students? Although currently this project is in its infancy, it is hoped that these questions can be explored and answered in the specific context of FE.</p>
<p>This presentation intends to share with you the initial findings of an action research project involving the use of blogs and vlogs as a method of assessment. Focussing on the experience of the students, which will be gauged though a series of focus groups and surveys, the study aims to further understand the benefits and limitations of both blogging and vlogging as an assessment tool.</p>]]></description>
