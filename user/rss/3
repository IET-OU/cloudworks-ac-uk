              <description><![CDATA[<p><em>The problem space &ndash; theories the why and the wherefore, review of previous work?<br /></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Work as part of the LDSE project</li>
<li>Eliciting practitioners&rsquo; perspectives on theory and reflection</li>
<li>Implication for design of the LDSE</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The value of theory</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Lawes, 2004: 199 Framework of understanding that improve the quality of practice and leads to the transformation of subjective experience</li>
<li>Conole 2008: Ensure that pedagogy drives the use of digital technology and not vice versa</li>
<li>Mayes and De Freitas: Ensure good pedagogical design</li>
</ul>
<p>A meta-taxonomy &ndash; theory covers a multitude of things<br />4 useful categories</p>
<ul>
<li>Theories as a way of understanding and predicting something &ndash; explanatory (Cook 2002)</li>
<li>Model an abstract representation that helps us understand something we cant see or experience directly (Conole, Oliver, et al.&nbsp; 2007)</li>
<li>Framework structure and vocabulary that support the explication of concepts and issues (Conole and Oliver 2002)</li>
<li>Taxonomy &ndash; an ordering classification (Merriam-Webster 1993)</li>
</ul>
<p>JISC Planner tools</p>
<ul>
<li>London Pedagogy Planner: Used Conversational Framework as the underpinning to take users through design decisions </li>
<li>Phoebe: Form filling to create designs, but had concept sensitive help</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Perspectives on theory from these projects<br /></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Theory is a cornerstone of professional practice&hellip; and an antidote to technological determinism</li>
<li>Bt do teachers consciously espouse formal theories or are they driven by prior experience and reflective practice</li>
<li>Combine knowledge of theory with skills to make decisions</li>
<li>LDSE &ndash; funded under TLRP TEL programme</li>
<li>Theory informed but room for individual interpretation</li>
<li>Embed appropriate theories into tools and support what it? Modeling of learning designs</li>
<li>Uses knowledge engineering to build an ontology of learning designs &ndash; concepts and their relationships and educational theories</li>
<li>Practitioners use of theory &ndash; research questions</li>
<li>What is the value of educational theories in learning design? </li>
<li>What theories etc are they aware of and do they use?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Working with 10 informant practitioners &ndash; who can see the vision and potential<br /></em>Value of theories</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of a &ldquo;world view&rdquo; of learning design: &ldquo;constructivism is a big part of what I do&rdquo;</li>
<li>For structuring students&rsquo; learning: I always try and map everything I do onto CF</li>
<li>A yardstick for measuring change: I&rsquo;m trying to effect change and they are useful markers </li>
<li>For critiquing and challenging: I regard theories as ways of critiquing something</li>
<li>Balance between theory and pragmatic considerations</li>
<li>I linked things up, I want them to get this out of a session, informed decisions &ndash; time, number of students, etc, how to motivate them</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Were asked about a range of learning theories:Inquiry learning, problem based learning, Kolb, Bruner&rsquo;s spiral curriculum, Ausubel&rsquo;s advanced organizer, communities of practice etc</li>
<li>Multiple interweaving influences &ndash; tend to use a mix of theories</li>
<li>Some evidence of sloppiness</li>
<li>Different between theories of teaching (pedagogic theories) vs theories of learning</li>
<li>Pedagogic theories &ndash; take the form of models, frameworks for constructing a learning experience</li>
<li>Theories of learning &ndash; explain how students learn, explanations of how people come to know</li>
<li>Approach through practice &ndash; priority is to give them the tools they need to teach right&nbsp; now informed by their understanding of the theories that you are filtering</li>
</ul>

<p><strong></strong>Ten really nice sites to support learning across different disciplines. Although aimed at school kids I can see that some of them, like livemocha - social networking for language learners - are equally valuable for adults. I am certainly going to take a closer look at VerbaLearn with my daughter.</p>]]></description>
