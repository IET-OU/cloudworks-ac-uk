              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>I am currently working on state &nbsp;grant aimed at improving K-12 education in our state. In my position, I work with a team of content area experts and Instructional design professionals to create online professional development for teachers. We are currently working with the challenge of providing professional development to teachers across a whole state with very limited human resources.</p>
<p>Relevant context:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The audience is large and very varied. There are techno and content novices as well as experienced users</li>
<li>Teachers are very busy and do not have the time to deal with a steep learning curve</li>
<li>Motivation can be a barrier</li>
<li>Making the learning environment relevant to a diverse population is a challenge</li>
<li>Building peer collaboration and networking is important</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The change you would like to see (challenge)</p>
<p>Currently we are providing un-facilitated modules that teachers can take individually or in PLCs. The PLCs are supported mainly through a blended learning environment.... though we have recently provided suggestions for other options.</p>
<p>Alternatively we offer a few facilitated course, one instructor and 30 or so students. This is not scalable as we are attempting to reach a target of 100000 teachers</p>
<p>What would be wonderful would be a way to support&nbsp; larger cohorts of learners</p>
<p><strong>How you might go about bringing that change</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;A modified MOOc. Less open and less massive than most.&nbsp; Technologies would have to be simple (or easily adopted)</p>
<p>I would be interested in any content relevant to the K-12 teacher</p>
<ul>
<li>Teaching online</li>
<li>Using technology in the classroom</li>
<li>Teaching diverse students ect.</li>
</ul>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->To briefly introduce myself: I currently work as an educational consultant and instructional designer with North Carolina's Race to the top grant. Having a PhD in Educational Research and technology: I have bounced back and forth between being an assessment/ed research professional and working in online learning. Both fields continue to fascinate me.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Through this MOOC, I am hopeful to see what works, and what does not, in such an environment and also hope to familiarize my self with tools like Cloudworks. I also look forward to looking into new aspects of learning design. And of course I look forward to network and connect with ... and learn from..others like you who have similar interests</p>]]></description>
