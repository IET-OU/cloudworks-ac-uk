              <description><![CDATA[<p>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) can attract hundreds if not thousands of learners. As such, for course teams designing and delivering MOOCs, this can present many challenges. Learners can have many motivations and be diverse in their needs. Learner dropout rates can be high and producing MOOCs usually means significant investment in terms of budget and staff time. Making an impact and sustaining interest is therefore an important design challenge.</p>
<p>This presentation will give an overview of a project which is exploring implementation through a consideration of three key design challenges associated with the FutureLearn* model and designing for learning at a massive scale: (1) creating engaging video content, (2) creating optimal designs for learner interaction and collaboration and (3) designing quality automated feedback.</p>
<p>It will focus particularly on video.&nbsp;Video content can be quite costly to make; online course designs have to fight for attention; distractions are high; research tells us many students stop watching after a matter of minutes (Guo et al., 2014). So we consider: how can video make best impact? When is the use of video most effective? </p>
<p>We'll look at some initial findings in response to such issues, as part of a wider project to produce design guidelines. The project looks at research and existing guidelines offered by those active in this area, and also at MOOCs with higher than average learner retention rates. Difficulties associated with measuring impact in this area are also considered. Learner dropoff rates, and dropoff points, for example, offer a measure but cannot provide a complete picture (see Koller et al. 2013, and Ferguson and Clow 2015).</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><em style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Readibility</em></strong> (i.e. the ease with which you understood the content)</p>
<p><em>4Ts Model:</em></p>
<p>This was an accessible model with clearly depicted swimlanes for the four facets: Tasks, Teams, Technology, Time.</p>
<p><em>e-design Template:</em></p>
<p>Less visual, but the principle was clear - guided learning from teacher-centric through to student-led in a scaffolded progression through defined stages.</p>
<p><strong><em>Expressiveness</em></strong></p>
<p><em>4Ts Model:</em></p>
<p>Very visual - I found it simpified understanding of the overall picture of the design in this way. However due to this, it lacks detailed description of each stage.</p>
<p><em>e-design Template:</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Less visual, depicted stages in a tabular format but still clear to understand.</p>
<p><em><strong>Utility</strong> (i.e.&nbsp;their usefulness in communicating important aspects of the design)</em></p>
<p><em>4Ts Model:</em></p>
<p>Perhaps a bit limited in communicating finer design points seeing as it is diagrammatic and each 'T' is a vertical swimlane.</p>
<p><em>e-design Template:</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A straightforward layout, mapping the stages of progress to a tabular format. As each stage in the table defines the strategy, and the contents provide a brief description, they combine together to make the communication of the design straightforward without excessive information - but more is communicated than in the 4T design.</p>]]></description>
