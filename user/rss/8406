<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->Although at first glance is seems streamlined and linear, the points about the designer having to juggle all 4 t&rsquo;s and that they have an impact on each one could be frustrating and I feel students would become frustration and choose to opt out. The swim lane exercise might need a number of attempts to complete. It is a good visual tool and looks easy to follow; breaking down the 4 ts is a good idea and makes it a SMART activity where you assess each area, it seems to be a good exercise that could be used for any activity.</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->The 4SPPIces Model is another effective tool and I liked the idea of having a specialist on hand</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->There are 4 elements:</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->1.Pedagogical Method</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->2.Participants</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->3.Space</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->4.History</p>
<p style="cursor:auto"><!--NO CSS-->It gives a quick summary and one that can evolve where students and staff can input and change. It looks easy to use and one that anyone even those who have very little knowledge and understanding of technology can use due to the simplistic operating system. The fact that the student can be anywhere and still access the activity, although this would need to be planned when the staff are online. Our new planning will show the new teacher what resources needed and staff can look at previous lessons that are all on a shared area to see what students have previously been taught.</p>]]></description>

              <title>MON:Online international collaboration to analyse childcare practices  (Angela Bonehill)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This presentation aims to demonstrate the impact of a collaboration between two universities. Online International Learning (OIL) projects involve online interactions between students studying at a UK university and other international universities, developing further &lsquo;intercultural and digital skills&rsquo; between students and organisations ( Villar-Onrubia, &nbsp;Rajpal, 2016). A small amount of students get the opportunity to work or travel abroad as part of their studies, interactions through the internet can be a way forward for widening participation with regards to supporting the intercultural interactions.</p>
<p>The design of this innovative online project was to facilitate a working party of students from Denmark and England to converse and assess the differences of curriculum planning and childcare in the two countries. There is a vast difference in the childcare systems of both countries. This was explored through digital collaboration on a number of platforms.</p>
<p>What was the motivation? To educate the students on the different curriculums, to enable them to analyse, to evaluate, and to give them knowledge of other practices.&nbsp; We began with UK organisations linked to education, we invited guest speakers, we watched videos of different practices, we read studies and papers, we visited children&rsquo;s centres, forest schools, nurseries, and schools, but the learning was passive, the students were not engaged, the students found it difficult to put this into practice or to contextualise their learning. The teachers were the depositors and the students were the depositories (Freire 1974). How could we change the perspective and practice of these new practitioners? We were beginning to get a vision: to expand cognitive horizons about early childhood studies and research beyond the United Kingdom with an interactive project where other students gave their perspective of curriculum and children&rsquo;s development through online collaboration. The students became the teachers.</p>
<p>As a group we began to question&hellip;What if we could&nbsp; encourage students to unlearn everything that they have learned about education, to gain a better understanding of natural learning rather than the structured delivery here in the UK? How can we ensure the new practitioner goes out into practice with a new mindset? How can we empower new practitioners to make changes to the existing curriculum but still meet the government frameworks for the county? Why do children not go outside to learn? (Henley 2010)</p>
<p>Early childhood students in their second-year degree collaborated with their equivalent in Copenhagen studying a contrasting early childhood pedagogy program. This occurred through structured online learning using platforms; &nbsp;a shared Moodle, vlogs and&nbsp; skype.</p>
<p>The students had regular interactions and developed relationships as well as &nbsp;learning about the child care practices and culture of another country, from the initial feedback students and lecturers, developed an understanding of the democratic and spiritual care that pedagogues &nbsp;provide in Denmark and the importance of the assessments and milestones children are expected to reach as per the Early Years Framework in the UK (Gov.uk 2016).</p>
<p>The presentation will report on the experience of networking with academics, students and colleagues, it will demonstrate that digital communications will encourage wider collaboration, mobility and changes in practice for the early years sector.</p>]]></description>

              <title>Play Spaces By Angela Bonehill</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/9815</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This narrative shows the design of a scenario for students to design a &lsquo;play space&rsquo; to encourage learning for children in early years</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>Age: 18+ Level 4 (First year of University) Early Childhood students at University. Lecturer was interested in how students would plan, work collaboratively and design a play space for children.</p>
<p><strong>Material</strong></p>
<p>Students are presented with a bag of model making resources, empty boxes, tubes and bottles, tape, string and glue. Each group has a separate room to work together for one hour. A 7 year old child will assess the learning possibilities and the durability of the play space.</p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>Students are in their 3<sup>rd</sup> module and have had lessons on child development, communication and collaboration. We have also learnt about the importance of play in relation to children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>The students work well in their preferred groups and some students have concerns about their own creative skills, they are keen to achieve the activity and enjoy having &lsquo;real live&rsquo; children to work with. Parents of children have given their permission and are present throughout the assessment</p>
<p>The students seemed to understand the theory of play and were able to reflect on their own experiences of play as a child, however they did not have a good understanding of the benefits of learning through play. They also struggled with the concept of play spaces, therefore the tutor felt the best way to tackle this was for the students to &lsquo;have a go&rsquo; and also have a project where they were able to reflect on their work as a team, their reflective practice and their model building skills. Students will have the opportunity to go on placement this academic year and need to develop a number of skills to be placement ready.</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>The goals of activity were for students to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan a play space with peers</li>
<li>Decide which resources to use</li>
<li>Decide the learning opportunities available for children in the early years up to 7yrs</li>
<li>Improve team working skills</li>
<li>Improve analytical skills</li>
<li>improve evaluation skills and listen to constructive criticism from peers and child</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<p>I informed the students of what they were going to do, you will go to a room which has a selection of resources, you will design a play space, you have 1 hour, and a child of 7 years will come with his parent and assess your play space, for learning capacity and play capacity.</p>
<p>You will be expected to work as a team, plan, assess, analyse and critique your play space</p>
<p><strong>Obstacles</strong></p>
<p>Some student were not confident to get involved with the project and let others take the lead, the lead people ensured that tasks were shared out equally in all but one group where one student watch the rest of her group rather than join in. difficulty for the tutor was to capture this and encourage collaborative working as the activity was split between 4 rooms. Some student became competitive and wanted to know from the tutor which was the best play space.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>The child enjoyed all of the play spaces and the tutor was pleased to see the variety of learning taking place by the students. All students had implemented activities for learning maths and English within their play space, so for example, giving opportunities for mark making. Most groups worked well and planned their activity. The students analysed their play spaces and evaluated what they could improve on, they also had an opportunity to see other group spaces and give constructive feedback to other groups.</p>
