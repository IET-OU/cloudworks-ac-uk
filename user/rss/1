The seventh e-learning@greenwich conference entitled 'Making it Personal' 
</p>
<p>
will take place on Wednesday, 8th July 2009 at the Old Royal Naval College Campus in London and aims to: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Explore the concept of personalised learning</li>
	<li>Provide opportunities for practitioners/researchers to share their experiences of investigating personalisation</li>
	<li>Examine the role of technology in personalising learning</li>
	<li>Consider the implications of personalisation for stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Contributions to the conference programme are sought from students, practitioners and researchers in all education and training sectors that provide case study examples of, or project/research reports on, personalisation that address at least one of the conference aims and themes. 
</p>
<p>

<div id="workspace_content">
<p>We are currently piloting a range of computer simulated science  experiments as 3-D virtual environments.&nbsp; These simulated experiments  are not meant to replace laboratory based work, but to enable students  to participate who would otherwise not be able to.&nbsp; In particular, it is  aimed at disabled students and students unable to access the necessary  equipment, such as those in prison.&nbsp; <br /><br />These experiments are  rendered on a PC in 3-D and use photographs of specific parts of the  actual apparatus as textures to add realism and accuracy to the  simulation.&nbsp; In particular, photographs are used to represent the  consequential views of an experiment, such as a spectrum, rather than  the mundane views, such as the back of a voltmeter.&nbsp; These particular  views may also be animated depending on the state of the experiment.&nbsp;  The work combines the photographic approach of the Interactive Screen  Experiments (ISEs) with the advantages of a fully simulated 3-D  environment where the user can interact with the apparatus in a more  natural and intuitive way.&nbsp; <br /><br />The potential advantages are that  users can quickly adapt to the environment and in particular the  controls.&nbsp; They gain realistic views of the physicality of the  experiment as they are not just seeing it from a particular viewpoint,  but from wherever they see fit to place themselves within the  experiment&rsquo;s scene.&nbsp; They are immersed in the experiment in a way that  mitigates some of the objections to online as opposed to real laboratory  experimentation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Furthermore there is no need to represent  scales, read-outs or controls as separate parts of the interface; these  can all be rendered at their correct physical positions within the  experiment.&nbsp; Two of these experiments based on the use of a diffraction  grating and a spectrometer have been fully implemented and are being  evaluated with a Physics A&rsquo; level class.&nbsp; The application and its  evaluation will be presented.</p>
