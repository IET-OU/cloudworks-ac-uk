              <title>MON: Compulsory Or Graded Peer Forum Activity As A Factor Affecting Inclusion And Ownership Of Learning In Higher Education Distance Learning (Richard Sharp)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>The presentation while recognising the value of peer participation, experienced in asynchronous forums on higher education (HE) distance-learning courses, will discuss its application. &nbsp;Peer participation is regarded by some as an <em>essential</em> component of learning.&nbsp; Brown states that participation is key in a social view of learning in which understanding is socially constructed, saying &ldquo;we learn [&hellip;] from our interaction with others&rdquo; (Brown, 2007, 3:27).&nbsp; Where learning and curriculum design is framed to support this kind of social learning pedagogy, then forum participation may be set as compulsory or graded (effectively compulsory). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The paper will ask whether a compulsory approach to peer activities acknowledges diversity and supports inclusion within the student cohort.&nbsp; Also, whether the reduction of choice could negatively affect a student&rsquo;s sense of ownership about their own learning practices, leading to isolation and exclusion.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In support of diversity and inclusion</strong></p>
<p>The UK Department for Education (DfE), in a report about inclusivity in HE stated that HE institutions must adopt inclusive practice in order to equitably support the learning experience for the whole student body (Department for Education, 2017, p. 3).&nbsp; The report confirms the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of the social model of disability, and notes how inflexible practice, not individual characteristics, are at the root of exclusion issues (Department for Education, 2017, p. 12).&nbsp; Although the report focuses on disability and adjustment, there is also a clear recognition that inclusive practice and design can remove barriers for all students by &ldquo;using more flexible methods of teaching, assessment and service provision to cater for different [&hellip;] learners&rdquo; (Department for Education, 2017, p. 16).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Choice, flexibility, and ownership of learning.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Anderson&rsquo;s (2003) Equivalency Theory proposed that there are three types of interaction that a student engages in: student-student, student-teacher, and student-content interaction.&nbsp; These differing foci can be equally valuable in achievement of a learning outcome, dependent on the individual and situation.&nbsp; In relation to student-student peer interaction, Luhrs and McAnally-Salas (2016) state that asynchronous discussion forums are especially useful for students on distance courses (Luhrs &amp; McAnally-Salas, 2016, p. 29).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Downes (2006) said that &lsquo;students own education&rsquo;, he was referring to how students can now define and construct their own personal learning environments (PLEs) and make individual choices about how they act, and interact, in their own learning practice.&nbsp; The National Centre on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) also state that a key factor in encouraging engagement is to &ldquo;optimise individual choice and autonomy&rdquo; (National Center on Universal Design for Learning, 2017). &nbsp;The ability to choose gives the student a sense of ownership of their learning practice.</p>
<p><strong>Can graded or compulsory forum participation activity be restrictive and disabling?</strong></p>
<p>Inclusion is a term which is often linked to disability adjustments.&nbsp; However, all students benefit from experiencing control over the learning practices that they choose to adopt.&nbsp; The presentation will suggest that practitioners consider the effect of making participatory forum activity compulsory or graded, and asks whether, for some learners, it could reduce choices, and create feelings of exclusion and disengagement?<strong><br clear="all" /></strong></p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>This is not a typical design narrative as&nbsp;I'm not a teacher, so the learning activity being modelled is a reflection of the design of a personal learning plan.&nbsp; It is a discussion of my own plans and actions for undertaking distance learning study on the OU MA Online and Distance Education.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Narrator/Situation</strong></p>
<p>Prior to joining the MAODE, I had no distance learning experience.&nbsp; I also had no previous direct experience in the field of study therefore wanted a plan to structure my background reading, and to structure my study, note-taking, and research once the course began.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>The challenge in designing a personal study plan for myself involved consideration of:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to manage and structure my pre-course study preparation &ndash; to gain some background knowledge on which to build.</li>
<li>How to organise and create a useful personal resource from my study activity.</li>
<li>Finding ways to build study into and around my normal and working life &ndash; use of materials and systems.</li>
<li>Gain experience of TEL, new tech, and social tech apps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li value="1"><strong>Choose software for organising notes, research and study materials.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I chose the MS OneNote product.&nbsp; This is cloud-based &ndash; which allows for flexible working at various locations, and also is stable and backed-up.&nbsp; I have developed an organisation and formatting style that allows me to distinguish between course directions, quotes taken from sources, paraphrased text, my own notes and comments.&nbsp; Notes can be organised in a structure: Note-Books &gt; Section-Groups &gt; Sections &gt; Pages etc. and the whole resource is searchable and easily navigable.</p>
<ol>
<li value="2"><strong>Build resource of background reading notes</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I read the notes for a few of the modules prior to enrolment and purchased recommended texts and others that I noticed myself that seems interesting.&nbsp; I also use OneNote to record notes on books and articles read outside of direct links to the course work.</p>
<ol>
<li value="3"><strong>Gain experience of TEL related apps, social/network apps</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I became interested in Blogs, Podcasts, and YouTube as information sources.&nbsp; I started a blog for writing practice and as preparation for course elements.&nbsp; I looked at social media apps such as Facebook etc. but cannot find a personal use for them that would justify any allocation of effort at present.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li value="4"><strong>Find tech solutions to learning flexibly</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned I use podcasts on academic writing, and also on subjects relating to the module content.&nbsp; These are excellent to fit flexibly into travel and other times.&nbsp; I also convert videos into audio format for listening to on an audio player (if the content does not suffer from the lack of video).&nbsp; The cloud-based nature of the OneNote tool allows me to work in multiple locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As many TMA/EMA assessments are linked directly to course content the building-up of personalised notes, reflections, and additional content can become the perfect starting-point for getting underway with assessments.&nbsp; In this way I am motivated to fully participate in activities, reading, and deep reflection and development of understanding throughout the module &ndash; in the belief that it will save me time and get me started on assignments as they are begun.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>This plan, the structure and format has worked well for me.&nbsp; I felt as prepared as possible at the start of the course and have subsequently at each point in the module/course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This kind of study, rewording and categorisation helps me to develop understanding and construct meaning from the source topic material.&nbsp; The structuring also helps me to organise my thoughts and the materials, and to create a resource to help me to create assessment pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>This method produces a digital and searchable store of reflections and notes, forming a connected view of the topic.&nbsp; I find this method essential to keep up with the pace of study and my work/study balance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is like a digital enhancement to my memory, knowledge, and understanding of the topic, which is necessary to aid in the completion of TMA/EMAs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do find that the method involves quite a bit of work.&nbsp; For instance by the end of week 4 of my current module, I had created over 28 thousand words of material in OneNote.&nbsp; If I had a background in the topic or worked in the field I might have developed a less onerous&nbsp;plan.&nbsp; However, these activities and the plan as a whole support the learning and assessment outcomes of the module &ndash; which are then evidenced in the production of activity postings and the TMA/EMAs, ... and the notes contribute to that output.</p>]]></description>
