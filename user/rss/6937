              <title>THU: Dyslexia: Supporting Students In A Clinical Healthcare Setting (Stephen Gardiner)</title>

              <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Specific Learning Difference/Difficulties (SpLD) relates to characteristic individuals who have a particular facet of learning. &nbsp;The most common SpLD is that of dyslexia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dyslexia affects one in ten people (Pennington, 1990), this equates to more than 6.3 million people in the UK (Census, 2011) and is recognised as a disability under the Equality Act 2010. &nbsp;Dyslexia is a perplexing blend of difficulties and strengths and is diverse in severity within individuals. &nbsp;People who generally have dyslexia will tend to have unique capabilities as well as a classic array of complications.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reid (2009), states that a person with SpLD and especially those with dyslexia are normally right-brained scholars who carry ocular behaviours of learning and therefore any open resource should take this into consideration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In our increasingly high-tech learning environment a vast amount of Information Technology equipment is available to assist learners with SpLD, however this is mostly provided in house at universities. &nbsp;This equipment does not extend into the clinical area and the situation is more complex where permission may be needed to use digital recorders for example.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This OU live presentation will describe my literature review of &ldquo;How to support dyslexia students in Clinical Healthcare settings&rdquo;. &nbsp;As part of any clinical healthcare training, integration of nursing science, multiple information management and online engagement also known as &lsquo;Nursing Informatics&rsquo; (NI) (Scope and Standards of Practice, 2015), is to predetermined the development of any clinical curriculum (McGonigle and Mastrian, 2012; O&rsquo;Connor, 2016).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blended learning and multimedia engagement are key aspects of learning as stipulated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) (NMC, 2010).</p>
<p dir="ltr">This presentation is about promoting behavioural arbitration of clinical educators about the inclusion of students with SpLD and especially those with dyslexia within a clinical setting. &nbsp;The presentation strives to provide information on deliverance of open education to those clinical students with dyslexia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presentation will focus on both implementation and inclusion. &nbsp;Focusing more on inclusion. &nbsp;The small element of implementation is that the presentation will target on is that how to employ the findings within resource material and the potential impact on long-term conclusions (Durlak, 2011).</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presentation will focus on research completed by the major dyslexia associations, JISC, Nursing and Midwifery Council and that of my own person experience. &nbsp;It is anticipated that it will highlight some of the obstacles students encounter when face with open resources.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My presentation will reveal the &lsquo;Three M&rdquo; model approach (McLoughlin, 2001) and how this can help learners to plan their own learning, their lives, and other framework for the work environment. &nbsp;It will briefly introduce the work of Association of Higher Education Access and Disability and academic staff are liable for ensuring their open learning material is accessible to all students, who enter into third level education. &nbsp;It will provide information on how to construct material which will be more accessible to all service users with SpLD.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The final element of the presentation will bring all the elements together in the form neurodiversity and by creating neurodiverse environments students can thrive (Armstrong, 2012).</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p class="normal">Specific Learning Difference/Difficulties (SpLD) relates to a characteristic individuals have with a particular facet of learning.&nbsp; The most common SpLD is that of dyslexia.</p>
<p class="normal">Dyslexia affects one in 10 people (Pennington, 1990), this equates to more than 6.3 million people in the UK (Census, 2011) and is recognised as a disability under the Equality Act 2010.&nbsp; Dyslexia is a perplexing blend of difficulties and strengths and is diverse in severity within individuals.&nbsp; People who generally have dyslexia will tend to have unique capabilities as well as a classic array of complications.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">Reid (2009), states that a person with SpLD and especially those with dyslexia are normally right-brained scholars who carry ocular behaviours of learning and therefore any open resource should take this into consideration.</p>
<p class="normal">A person with a SpLD does not anticipate intellectual development.&nbsp; However the journey to attainment is customarily increasingly harder and requires more complex and definable skill sets.&nbsp; The threats and opportunities available in an academic situation, both for the lecturer and learner is apprehension of the definitive effects. These characteristics have in examining a diverse approach to expedite optimal study.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="normal">The project will focus on both implementation and inclusion.&nbsp; Focusing more on inclusion.&nbsp; The small element of implementation is that the project will target on is that of how to employ the Dyslexia toolkit within resource material and the potential impact on long-term conclusions (Durlak, 2011).&nbsp; The artefact will be presented as a multimedia presentation.</p>
<p class="normal">Dunlosky (2013) acclaims that diverse learning actions can potentially have disagreeable conclusions of attaining information.&nbsp; He goes further to state that repeated reviewing of study material has insufficient impact on learning.&nbsp; Many people with SpLD will initially think the only way to attain the information is to keep re-reading text or highlight information.&nbsp; However, by engaging in different approaches to learning and how the resources are produced can have a decisive action on fulfillment of learning.</p>
<p class="normal">This presentation will focus on research completed by the major dyslexia associations, JISC and of my own personal experience.&nbsp; It is anticipated that it will highlight some of the obstacles students encounter when faced with open resources.</p>
<p class="normal">It is envisaged that the conference presentation will be used by those who develop resources for their learners and to generate discussion.&nbsp; By doing this it is hoped that the toolkit will be used and to engage with their students further and to motivate and enthuse an inclusive learning environment.</p>
<p class="normal">The presentation is planned to attract individuals who desire to improve their open resources for students with SpLD, as well for those would have the desire to learn and extend their knowledge of how to bring inclusivity more into their resources and their online and open learning environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description>
