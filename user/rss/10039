              <description><![CDATA[<p>The e-Design template was the most familiar model to me and the type of learning design I routinely use when carrying out online tutorials. This learning design is influenced by Laurillard, 1993 whose work I am familiar with. I therefore found it quite readable and I was able to relate to its use.</p>
<p>I think template is useful for activities where a relatively high amount of scaffolding is needed as the teacher has the opportunity to lead discussion. This format might be useful for the early stages of first year undergraduate courses when students are unfamiliar with each other and may be less comfortable cartung out lengthy student-student interactions.</p>
<p>I found the remaining templates less familiar and more challenging to conceptualize, but I am interested in looking beyonf the e-Design template, particularly for the higher level courses I tutor on. I have seen the Design Priniciples Database on another course and this is a resource I would like to spend more time exploring as it might help me design tutorials to encourage more student-student interaction.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The prevalence of mental health problems such as anxiety and depression amongst students in Higher Education is high. In a 2016 survey carried out on university students within the United Kingdom, 27% of students reported mental problems of which 74% were anxiety related (Aronin and Smith, 2016). Levels of anxiety appear to be high even amongst students who do not report a mental health problem with only 19% of Higher Education students survey by the Office for National Statistics (2017) reporting low general levels of anxiety compared to 41% of the general UK population (cited in Neves and Hillman, 2017).</p>
<p>There is also an increased likelihood that students may be studying in an online environment. Digital activities are increasingly common within Higher Education in general (Newman and Beetham, 2017) and an increased number of university students studying entirely online in some countries such as the USA (Clinefelter and Aslanian, 2014 cited in University of Birmingham, n.d.). But despite the high probability that students with anxiety may be studying online, they often lack training in supporting students with mental health problems in Higher Education (Kendall, 2017).</p>
<p>To address this need, a new open education resource is being developed with the aim of helping teachers in Higher Education support learners with anxiety in online environments. As part of the &lsquo;inclusion theme&rsquo; of the H818 online conference, an overview of the main features planned for this resource will be provided. These will include defining anxiety and background information on disability and the law. Issues relating to the disclosure of anxiety and confidentiality will be considered as well as barriers to participation and engagement that may exist in online environments for students with anxiety. There will be an emphasis on suggestions for adjustments to promote inclusion. Finally, the online resource will promote the opportunity to share best practice and to network with peers with common interests in supporting students with anxiety. During the presentation, there will also be an opportunity to provide suggestions to shape the direction of this resource.</p>
