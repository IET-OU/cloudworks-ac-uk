<h2>Title</h2>
<h2>Practice Session - Using a Schema to Analyse a Text for Structure and Language.&nbsp;<em><br /></em></h2>
<h2>Narrator</h2>
<p>I tutor individual students with special needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>Many of the students have specific learning needs such as dyslexia, autism or/ and physical disabilities.&nbsp; Some of the students are private and the others are at a local grammar school. The private students are tutored in my study at home and the students at the school in the Learning Support Suite. The students for this task are all GCSE students in Year 10 and 11. In one of the sessions a deaf student is paired with an autistic student. The reasoning behind this is to provide the deaf student with more opportunities to work collaboratively with peers in a quieter environment. The autistic student benefits as he has to make eye contact and speak clearly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the&nbsp; E854 EMA, I analysed student's answers to a question based on a unknown text. The question asked them to discuss how the author use language and structure to create atmosphere.&nbsp; My findings revealed that while they understood what atmosphere meant, they had difficulty relating it to the author's use of langauge and structure. They know the PEE (point, evidence, evaluation/ explain) structure they get taught in class, but didn't seem to know how to use it. Some summarised the text while others got fixated on points that didn't relate to the question.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>My goal was to find a structure they could follow each time they need to analyse a question for language and structure. I didn't want to create just one structure but rather wanted them to experiment with a few options to find a path best suited to each student.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>I found an unknown text and created three different worksheets with three different questions related to language and structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They had to write two paragraphs, each with a topic sentence (point), evidence and then an analysis of the point and the evidence. The analysis allows them to zoom in on a specific word, phrase, reader experience or author's intention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the first worksheet I provided them with the topic sentence and they had to find the evidence supporting the point and the analysis.</p>
<p>The second worksheet provided the evidence and they had to formulate a point and provide the analysis.</p>
<p>The third worksheet provided the analysis and they had to make the point and find the evidence.</p>
<p>They could also provide a different point, evidence or analysis, if they believed they found something better than the ones I presented them with.</p>
<p>I worked through the text with them and encouraged them to keep the question in mind and annotate the text for possible points and evidence. They could then compare this with the evidence and points I provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first worksheet they did had the points provided. Each point I made referred to a specific literary device (e.g. contrast, descriptive adjectives, personification, pathetic fallacy). I hoped that they would pick this up without me specifically reminded them that they would score better marks in an exam answer if they can connect the points they make to a literary device.</p>
<p>Problem One: With worksheet two they had to provide the point for the evidence and they didn't pick up the clue to refer to literary devices in their answers. I tried to overcome this by asking many how, what, why questions when we looked at the answers. Some students managed to infer from the questions that they need to look for evidence that can be linked to a literary device. Others didn't and I had to make it explicit. Luckily all the students who had to be told had a 'wow' moment as literary devices are well known to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem Two: I wanted the deaf student and the autistic student to work together on the analysis as it would have provided them with the opportunity to practise their communication. This didn't work. The autistic student works much faster than the deaf student and ended up providing all the answers before the deaf student has even taught of an answer. I had to rethink and decided it would be better if they work separately and then discuss their answers once they are both finished. While the autistic student had to wait for the deaf student to finish his answer I allowed him to work on his Art drawings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All the students chose to structure their paragraphs around specific evidence. We are busy with a follow up activity where they have to use the chosen strategy and it proves to be effective as their answers are more targeted to the question and while analysis is still difficult for some there are far fewer summaries and irrelevant content.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>I am working on a visual representation of all the information they need to answer this type of question. The idea is that they will use that until answering in that specific way becomes a habit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The deaf student is still having a hard time with connecting the literary devices to the topic sentences and will need more individual time. I am not convinced he is completely comfortable with the process he chose. Individual time with him will reveal the problems in time. As he is only in Year 10 there is still time to find a different way if this one doesn't work.</p>

              <title>Comparing 4T&#39;s Model and DPD</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11629</link>
              <guid>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11629</guid>
              <description><![CDATA[<p>The 4T&rsquo;s design seems task and time focused. The teams and technology will depend on the task that needs to be completed.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a typical lesson design for the classroom. On the other hand, if time is flexible, the time feature can be ignored without influencing the design. The visual representation is useful to give an overview of the structure and to clarify the design.</p>
<p>Without including the time component, I would say my design follows this structure. My design allows the task to form a hierarchy from reading the text to worksheets, which aids, but also requires individual work. The student needs to make a choice and then complete an individual task without assistance. As it is 1:1 tutoring discussions will only be between the tutor and the student.</p>
<p>DPD is less time bound and more fluid, but it also allows for choices to be made. While the generic design doesn&rsquo;t propose a hierarchy the lesson design had certain steps. Even though there is no visual representation for the specific lesson the generic representation of DPD is clear and shows the meta principal which looks at the bigger picture and explains the concept of &lsquo;showing thinking&rsquo; while the pragmatic principle is more focused on visual aids around the inquiry process and then split into specific inquiry choices. The phenomena researched with dynamic visuals. The idea of reusing the students&rsquo; own artefacts resonates and reminded me of the What If video and Book Creator that allow student artefacts to become more visible and have utility.</p>
<p>While my activity is text based and I attempted a visual representation of all the different components the student needs to remember to be able to answer a specific question, more visual aids will be beneficial.</p>
<p>The main difference though seems to be the overarching meta principle for DPD where the 4T&rsquo;s Model doesn&rsquo;t state that explicitly.</p>
<p>I am adding this because I want to remember it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Meta principle allows for building on student ideas, communicate the rich diversity of inquiry, flow of activities, cognitive conflict, complex projects, reasoning templates, support for adaption, reduce visual complexity, reuse artefacts and connect to personal context.</p>]]></description>

              <title>SAT: Jekyll and Hyde: An Alternative Mini-MOOC Curated on Trello (Annette Hendley)</title>
              <link>https://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/11912</link>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>Literature evaluation benefits from multiple perspectives (Savonick, 2018), and collaboration, communication and problem solving are viewed as key 21st century skills (Lombardi, 2007; Johnson <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Creating and curating an alternative mini-MOOC using Trello addresses these requirements.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lack of proper information on how to search relevant OER&rsquo; (Athabasca University. and Raisamo, 2000), and the skills to find &lsquo;fit for purpose&rsquo; (Kawachi, 2014) resources can influence students&rsquo; and teachers&rsquo; perception of open resources.</p>
<p>This project delivers a set of &nbsp;reusable learning materials, using the Trello software platform, to support students with a set GCSE literature text ,The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (AQA, nd). The powerful theme of duality in humans is as relevant for the 21<sup>st</sup> century as it was for Victorian Britain (Rankin, 2010). The BBC Bitesize website contains comprehensive study material on the text (BBC Bitesize, nd), but it has to be accessed online, and the resources are not downloadable or reusable. Revision questions are mainly multiple choice type which doesn&rsquo;t allow for real &lsquo;problem solving&rsquo; and &lsquo;deep thinking&rsquo;, nor &lsquo;collaboration&rsquo; (Brown, 2018). Other valuable resources available are mainly university and individual school resources, which are available online, but without an obvious licence that allows for reuse or adaptation.</p>
<p>Within the conference theme of implementation, this project therefore has as its goal a collection of resources, addressed by chapter in a MOOC-like style. It deviates from MOOC&rsquo;s as resources will be reusable and adaptable with a focus on problem solving, rather than multiple choice question. Students would benefit most from attempting it collaboratively. While the focus is on revision and study for GCSE students, it has the potential to be of value to a wider audience. Literature has many interpretations and can be influenced by personal context, culture and perceptions. Collaborative perspectives can therefore only add to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the text.</p>
<p>Trello is a project management website, but there is evidence that it can be used successfully as an educational curation and collaboration work space (Bettstetter, 2016; Martin K, 2018; Moon, 2018). Apart from being a collaborative space, the main advantage is the ability to upload and download adaptable resource documents and to create links to other available resources.</p>
<p>The OER Research Hub found that &lsquo;the more educators used OER, the more willing they were to share&rsquo;(Weller <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Hopefully users of this project material will be prepared to share their repurposed resources to help build a workspace voicing a variety of perspectives and interpretations to aid better understanding and enjoyment of the text and its value. &lsquo;Optimising the usability of the teaching and learning materials produced is one of the most important challenges involved in developing OERs&rsquo; (Whitfield and Robinson, 2012).</p>
<p>The conference presentation will discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>the value of reusable open resources.</li>
<li>Jekyll and Hyde as a text choice and the importance of collaboration in analysing texts.</li>
<li>the effectiveness of Trello as a curating space.</li>
<li>what is meant by &lsquo;an alternative mini-MOOC&rsquo;.</li>
<li>plans for dissemination.</li>
</ul>
