<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Project Title &ndash; <strong><em>Designing a mini-MOOC for Assessor Training on the verification systems in Further Education&rsquo;.</em></strong></p>
<p>MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have been well established in Higher Education (HE) and for many studies this has been the primary focus (Andreatos, 2015; Evans et al., 2016).</p>
<p>However, few studies have empirically examined the influence of MOOCs in an organisational setting and more research is required to explore how MOOCs affect employee learning and development in the workplace (Dodson et al., 2015; Egloffstein and Ifenthaler, 2017).</p>
<p>With this notion research has shown the transformation of MOOC initiatives progressively moving towards the more corporate training and development sectors (Savino, 2014). According to Savino (2014) corporate leaders and training professionals have become aware how MOOCs can <em>&lsquo;supplement and support corporate training&rsquo;</em> (Savino, 2014, p. 59). Drawing on the study conducted by Savino (2014) the paper examines how MOOCs are used in both HE and corporate training and learning.&nbsp; Further prompting the idea that this method could be used in training employees (Weiss, 2013), I have taken these viewpoints to further add support to my rationale in conducting this activity and the impetus on staff development.</p>
<p>The H818 Online conference theme will focus on innovation and the scope of my idea will discuss the viability of using mini-MOOCs for training and professional development purposes.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to design a mini-MOOC to train assessors on the verification systems used in the context of a Further Education setting. The intention of bridging the skills gap in staff and promoting further development for staff to eventually become internal verifiers for the school.&nbsp; The demonstration will involve discussing elements of layout and themes from an adapted MOOC idea to create a multimedia presentation using Adobe Spark to create slides of my proposed mini-MOOC design. Furthermore, uploading the video presentation to a YouTube platform. There is scope to use Canvas which builds on the idea of teaching and learning with its &lsquo;intuitive&rsquo; interface which increases its adoption and appeal to any developer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically, it has shown that expensive, offsite training had proved ineffective, due to the lack of external support given by some awarding bodies. As Lead Internal Verifier for my centre and providing face to face training, this also presented itself with many challenges.&nbsp; For example, poor staff turnout to the sessions due to work commitments, collaboration not effectively used and some staff reluctant to share ideas.&nbsp; Therefore, due to time and staff commitment issues, looking at openness through the lens of innovation can potentially help to deliver a more innovative form of training and worth exploring.</p>
<p>Training materials will be resourced from the awarding body amalgamated with my own resources to provide the project materials in my design.&nbsp; It is likely that I will be faced with several pedagogical challenges, such as the reluctance for participants to share more openly.&nbsp; Therefore, further research into using situated &lsquo;Design Patterns&rsquo; is paramount to seek possible solutions to such issues (Liyanagunawardena et al., 2015).</p>
