              <description><![CDATA[<p><em>I learnt how to use the computer in a very interesting way many years ago.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I was working for a school. Two young men joined us and started using computers to do many things in the school for us such typing, editing, formating and printing out letters. I found what they were doing very fascinating and wanted to learn how to use the computer too.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I went out in search of a computer school and got myself enrolled into one just by the street next to ours. My computer teachers name was Mr Young.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I soon discovered Mr Young was really kind and eager to teach me. My first computer lessons were basically discussions about the usefulness of the computer with Mr Young. Then he started giving me books to read and the books had tasks I needed to do using the computer. The content of the book had a lot of guidelines and instructions. This helped me to know a lot about the computer.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>It was obvious to me (or so I thought) that I did not need Mr Young. It was easier for me to pick up new computer skills following instructions from the book. My interactions were more with the books and the computer than with Mr Young. I only consulted Mr Young when I was confused about an instruction or about what I needed to press in the computer.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>With the help of Mr Young, I bought a personal computer for myself (a desktop, CPU unit, mouse, keyboard, UPS and loudspeakers). I also asked Mr Young to sell the books to me. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I now had my teachers at home and I went to see Mr Young less frequently. I learnt how to type using the software called Mavis Beacon and I developed a lot of computer skills following the guides in the books and the tutorials from software help functions.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The obstacles I had were mainly getting confused once in a while but I always benefitted from the kind consultancy of Mr Young.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I wanted to learn how to use a computer system and to process documents with the computer, format spreadsheets, design a presentation and browse the internet using a computer. I achieved all of these in less than three months using my guidebooks and pc at home. Today, I am happy I learnt so much about using a computer to solve life many problems.&nbsp;</em><em>The transferable insights I gained has been amazing.&nbsp;</em></p>]]></description>

              <description><![CDATA[<h2>Multimedia Poster</h2>
<p>For an introduction to the project presentation please see the >multimedia poster</a> . I have also created an >accessible version</a> of my poster for people with sight challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Social exclusion has continued to be an enormous issue despite the increase in technologically rich learning platforms on the internet. A lot of those who use mobile technology have access to the internet but are unaware of the existence or use of OER (Online Educational Resources) and so they are being left behind.</p>
<p>My project is focus on the adaptation of OER for English language teachers. The essence of the project is to provide help to ensure the provision of learning materials to the marginalised teachers in the developing world, especially those in sub-Saharan African countries such as Nigeria.</p>
<p>The project will sensitise the teachers and help them acquire information and knowledge on OER. The English language teachers on the project will discover alternative ways of demonstrating what they know, and this will lead to a change in their classrooms as they begin to challenge their learners in more productive ways using materials from the OER sites.</p>
<p>Most teachers in Nigeria use mobile technologies and are on social media app networks such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram. This project will empower the teachers and improve their access to professional development and education available via OER sites (See O&rsquo;Connor, 2000). OER offers a plethora of choices.</p>
<p>My presentation will consider how systems can be created for teachers to have access to OER repositories. In recent times, there has been an increase in internet-based network of freely available online resources for learning and teaching. These open educational resources include highly interactive and innovative curricula, visualizations, simulations and lesson plans. There are features that support the use of real-world resources (see McArthur &amp; Zia 2008; Zia, 2001; Borgman et al., 2008). These increasingly available online resources are infrastructure available for teachers to use, access, and share, connect, create and adapt resources in ways that can change their practice (Borgman et al. 2008).</p>
<p>In the presentation, I will demonstrate that the use of social media technologies has an essential place in teacher professional development because teachers learn voluntarily. Teachers use forums to reflect on own practices and exchange ideas with colleagues (see Marcia &amp; Garcia, 2016). So, instant messaging software have helped teachers to adapt information, to re-conceptualize and to make information much more functional for their contexts (Cranefield &amp; Yoong, 2009). In very recent years, mobile learning devices have offered a variety of learning opportunities (see Macia &amp; Garcia, 2016; Rambe &amp; Bere, 2013; Cakir &amp; Arslan, 2013; Hwang, Huang &amp; Wu, 2011).</p>
<p>Given that WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook stand out in many studies as effective tools and applications used by many people and available in mobile devices. It is easy to create online community of practice using WhatsApp, Telegram or Facebook (see Baran &amp; Cagiltay, 2010; Wesley, 2013) and many teachers all over the world use WhatsApp, Telegram and Facebook for social and learning purposes.</p>

              <description><![CDATA[<p>I reviewed 'Healthy Eating" as a 4 Ts model'. This model&nbsp;fully represented Lesson 2 of the &lsquo;healthy eating&rsquo; scenario in terms of the 4 Ts. The exercise turned out to be challenging and useful at the same time, as it gave me the opportunity to reflect on the ability of the 4Ts to represent scenarios that are not completely oriented to collaborative Tasks.</p>
<p>The second model I reviewed was 'Healthy Eating" in an e-Design Template'. Basically, there is one identified opportunity for formative feedback in this template/model. The interactions in the lesson include student-tutor, student-student and some opportunities for student-external. &nbsp;The lesson includes some active and collaborative learning.</p>]]></description>
