<h1>Presenting the process and progress of Dyslexia Friendly Workplace digital wall</h1>
<p>The following alternative to this embedded content has been provided by the person who put the content on the site for accessibility reasons.</p>
<p>Transcript of Presentation &ndash; Susan Eley Morris</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 1 &ndash; Title Slide</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to talk about my Dyslexia and Social Entrepreneurship Open Digital Resource.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 2 &ndash; Structure of Presentation</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start by talking for 2 minutes about Why I&rsquo;m doing this project, before using the methodology of Pecha Kucha to cover how I am designing my multimedia project and what it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will end by mentioning the networks that I participate in with a view that can you select one or more for us to connect in to continue the conversation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 3 &ndash; Enterprising public open scholar</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m displaying a photograph of myself taken in Scotland where I live.&nbsp; To the left of the photograph is a path offering wheeled access to the canal boats moored on the Union Canal and behind me stands The Kelpies, a public art installation constructed from steel, using technology, of two Clydesdale horse heads. The Kelpies are accessible, public and open to all to view and touch 24/7.</p>
<p>I describe myself on LinkedIn &ndash; considered the World&rsquo;s largest Professional network &ndash; as an enterprising public open scholar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My agenda in the Dyslexia-Friendly Workplace Project includes The Social Model of Disability where difference is not considered a deficit, digital inclusion of all adults, free open education in informal digital spaces, accessibility and universal design to ensure accessibility plus research and scholarship about social curation of open digital resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 4 &ndash; Emerging issue in social enterprise</p>
<p>I started the Project in response to a gap identified in my work with social enterprises and the design of the Digital Wall has been driven forward by my experience of research and teaching in higher education.</p>
<p>I am displaying here Jess Gildener&rsquo;s blog last year for The Social Enterprise Academy which reported on the evidence of dyslexia and entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Research shows that around 10 per cent of the adult population in the UK have some form of dyslexia. Twenty per cent of adults who are entrepreneurs in the UK have some form of dyslexia so it&rsquo;s estimated that 30,000 entrepreneurs with dyslexia working in social enterprises in Scotland.</p>
<p>I met Steve &lsquo;Unique Dyslexic&rsquo; McCue in the first month of the Project and was motivated by his storytelling as an entrepreneur and activist that many adult dyslexics feel isolated and there is no real tangible dyslexic community in Scotland.</p>
<p>Unlike Steve, I am not an adult with dyslexia. I am not an expert in dyslexia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 5 &ndash; Multimedia behavioural intervention</p>
<p>In higher education I have worked with over 380 adult learners with dyslexia and in the past year I have collected unsolicited disclosures in the social enterprise sector usually at events relating to writing applications, regulation of business and social audit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel that I can do something, as a social curator, with a digital wall to facilitate behavioural changes in the workplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[2 minutes 38 seconds]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 6 &ndash; How? And What? Pecha Kucha</p>
<p>Now I am adopting a pecha kucha approach, Japanese for the sound of conversation, invented by Mark Dytham and Astrid Klein to reduce wordiness, &nbsp;to set out the process and progress of the multimedia Project.</p>
<p>For the next 400 seconds and 20 slides you will enter my world of making the Dyslexia-Friendly Workplace digital wall happen.</p>
<p>Slide 7 &ndash; Bricolage</p>
<p>The ambition is to be a CYP-Media.&nbsp; Tony Coughlan curates an award winning website supported by Facebook posts and Twitter tweets plus scholarship about open educational resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Becoming a social curator of the bricolage of dyslexia and social entrepreneurship resources requires determination and skill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 8 &ndash; Inclusion</p>
<p>Dyslexia is identified as a disability as defined in the Equality Act 2010.</p>
<p>As the recent win in a disability discrimination case by a London woman with dyslexia against her employer Starbucks demonstrates, dyslexia-friendly workplaces are a social justice issue and a business issue where the law can punish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 9 &ndash; Campaign</p>
<p>The British Dyslexia Association has three campaign areas including &ldquo;To enable dyslexic people to achieve their potential in the workplace&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Designing an intervention targeting CEOs of social enterprises in Scotland makes an intensive contribution alongside the extensive campaigning work of specialists in the British Dyslexia Association.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 10 &ndash; Adult Checklist</p>
<p>In adults of working age, self-appraisal of severity of dyslexia brings the promise of rapid feedback and signposting to expert screening services.</p>
<p>The Adult Checklist of Ian Smythe and John Everatt was copyrighted in 2001.</p>
<p>Open effective communication about social curation of my digital wall is essential to the Project&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 11 &ndash; Microsoft Sway</p>
<p>I am using cloud-based Microsoft Sway to author the digital wall.&nbsp; At its launch in 2014 Sway was described by PCAdvisor as &ldquo;Powerpoint on Steroids&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Indeed content and images can easily be imported and remixed in Sway. You can scroll vertically or horizontally.</p>
<p>For effective use of Sway, insightfulness and skill is still required in digital storytelling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 12 &ndash; Social Enterprise Scotland</p>
<p>The digital wall is a landing platform for the social curation of video, audio and written digital open resources for working and learning that will also spotlight services for employees and employers.</p>
<p>I am displaying the infographic of the findings from the first Census of Social Enterprise in Scotland published in 2015, as an example of an artefact curated by the Project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 13 &ndash; What is Dyslexia &ndash; TED ED Original</p>
<p>Dyslexia expert, Dr Kelli Sandman-Hurley&rsquo;s animated talk What is Dyslexia, is an esteemed artefact of the Project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A TED ED Original, with running time of 4 minutes 38 seconds, What is Dyslexia had at the time of writing 924,718 views and 11,674 questions answered by the dyslexia researcher who tweets as @DyslexiaDoctor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 14 &ndash; Advocacy &ndash; Access to Work</p>
<p>Artefacts will vary in their currency to the audience of the digital wall. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast to What is Dyslexia video which would form part of the core scaffold, other information / advocacy resources would be flash promoted on a rotation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example here is the Access to Work grant availability information which is shown in this image,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 15 &ndash; Community of Interest</p>
<p>By my creation and curation of a dyslexia and social entrepreneurship open digital resource, I join a community of interest in dyslexia and inclusion.</p>
<p>Remember that I said earlier that I am not an adult with dyslexia and I am not a dyslexia expert so How do I network? How do I connect as a edtech practitioner and open public scholar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 16 &ndash; Twitter campaign</p>
<p>Marketing of the Digital Wall will include social media and radio advertising strategy to top up direct networking within social enterprise in Scotland.</p>
<p>Twitter will be at the core of start up marketing because of its currency, reach and analytics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 17 - #dyslexiafriendlyworkplace</p>
<p>Indicators of traction of the idea, engagement with the curated resources and contemplation to change or consolidate the dyslexia-friendliness of workplaces will include association of CEOs and workplaces with #dyslexiafriendlyworkplaces as emblematic that they are leading in this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 18 &ndash; Twitter relevant network</p>
<p>Traction of the digital wall as expert in the social curation of resources will be lagged and indicators will include emergent followers on Twitter and potentially a separate Twitter account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 19 &ndash; Retweeting</p>
<p>Currently @susaneleymorris following dyslexia resources on Twitter and a retweeting strategy has generated new Followers.</p>
<p>A retweet of an article on Dyslexic friendly fonts gathered 15 new followers and 16 retweet using the magic full stop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 20 &ndash; CEOs of Social Enterprises &ndash; members</p>
<p>However while there will be general interest, the first iteration of the digital wall will be personalised for CEOs of social enterprises operating in Scotland.</p>
<p>The main membership organisation representing the voice of Social Enterprise in Scotland, Social Enterprise Scotland has been approached to throw a spotlight on the Project to CEOs and best practice in social enterprises in inclusion of adults with dyslexia in the workplace including learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 21 &ndash; Cross-Party Group on Social Enterprise</p>
<p>The wall has the specific target of curation dyslexia resources relevant to social entrepreneurship, social enterprises including charities and social firms and those in leadership roles.</p>
<p>My participation in the cross-party group on social enterprise at the Scottish Parliament is an influential network of CEOs to interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 22 &ndash; Measuring Social Impact</p>
<p>The Project aspires to have transformative economic and social impact as a provision of open education about adults with dyslexia for all employees and volunteers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will need to organise quantitative and qualitative measures of the social impact of the Project &ndash; to feedback to supporters and invite investors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 23 &ndash; Ideas on Ideas</p>
<p>I created the Project but others will own the Project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Konstantin Stanislasky is attributed as saying: Yesterday an idea is mine, today it is yours and tomorrow it belongs to the whole world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 24 &ndash; Problem Solving The Falkirk Wheel</p>
<p>I am showing here a photograph of The Falkirk Wheel that solves the problem of canal traffic wishes to move between Union and Forth Canals which are at two very different heights.</p>
<p>My learning from others and about myself has gifted me to solve a problem facing social entrepreneurs with dyslexia without a tangible community, little recognition of the challenges of doing social audit, written business regulation and applications.</p>
<p>Slide 25 &ndash; Dyslexia&nbsp; Friendly Workplaces &ndash; lots of making marks</p>
<p>I am displaying here the logo of the Digital Wall which used Open Dyslexic 3, an open source font created to increase readability for readers with dyslexia. The font is open and free for commercial and public use.</p>
<p>Behind the logo is an image of a painting made by myself using oil bars.&nbsp; Oil can take a while to dry.</p>
<p>I use this to illustrate that the digital wall remains a work in progress that I am making my marks over.&nbsp; It will launch in March 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 26 &ndash; Networking &ndash; Edinburgh Melting Pot</p>
<p>With that confidence, I am a member of The Melting Pot, considered Scotland&rsquo;s Centre for Social Innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Marketing student from the University of Stirling Management School will be joining the Project on a 3 month placement.</p>
<p>I have joined other businesses and individuals that look through the Inclusion lens to Open Education on some tangible mission of co-creating learning that will contribute to equality and prosperity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slide 27 &ndash; Networking &ndash; Central Scotland Superheros</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tough environment&nbsp; - open education, inclusion and accessibility.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s how to keep in touch.</p></div>                   </div>
