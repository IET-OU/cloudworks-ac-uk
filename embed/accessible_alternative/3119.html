<h1>Open Partnership Model: In practice.</h1>
<p>The following alternative to this embedded content has been provided by the person who put the content on the site for accessibility reasons.</p>
<p>Honesty and transparency of practice are cornerstones of careers work, whether advisers are members of the CDI and thereby their ethics or not. We often call this independence and impartiality however, some work we now do comes with a predetermined agenda due to the reduced amount of time we have with clients or, time which is dedicated to other non-guidance led activities such as CV writing due to the contracts we have to deliver.&nbsp;We sometimes find ourselves delivering targeted work that is aimed at raising awareness of various opportunities which again, comes with a predetermined agenda.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CXK is keen to help advisers maintain their integrity in this new commercial environment where there are challenges to be faced. To do this, we have been developing and trialling a model of practice which enables advisers to work in an open and transparent manner, called the Open Partnership Model (see attached handout).</p>
<p>It also, includes a recognition that sometimes due to situations beyond our control, we can&rsquo;t do all we can and need to signpost on to other services where possible.</p>
<p>Examples of how the model can be applied in practice to National Careers and Schools work can be found below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Schools Adviser delivering an Apprenticeship &ldquo;awareness raising&rdquo; larger group session:</strong></p>
<p>At the start of the session the adviser sets the aims and objectives but, also ensures they explain that there are other options available and often more than one way to the same goal which, could include University or College based training.</p>
<p>They also explain that the focus is on raising awareness of Apprenticeships today and, if students would like to explore the other options they would recommend making an appointment to discuss these. If appointments are unavailable, adviser signposts to National Careers Service website and phone line plus any in house support in school.</p>
<p>Apprenticeship agenda of session declared and signposting to wider services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Schools Adviser delivering a group guidance (five students) session for Year 11 options:</strong></p>
<p>At the start of the session the adviser introduces self and aims for session but, also declares limits placed on session by time. Adviser also declares that although they won&rsquo;t tell them what to do, they will ask them questions to help challenge their thinking so, they don&rsquo;t miss any opportunities. Adviser also signposts to lunchtime drop in for further help; for issues which can&rsquo;t fit into session.</p>
<p>Agenda relating to intention (questions) declared and signposting to further support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>National Careers Adviser delivering a one to one session on CV building:</strong></p>
<p>At the start of the session the adviser declares that a request has been made by the job centre to help the client produce a CV which, will affect the range of other activities that can be completed in the time given for the session (such as exploring wider ideas). With client, they negotiate together the time taken on CV and time taken to explore ideas for the future (prioritising). <br />Signposting to National Careers website and further support via college guidance services if applicable to client concerns.</p>
<p>Agenda from job centre affecting purpose of session declared and signposting to further services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">National Careers Adviser delivering a group session on job hunting:</strong></p>
<p>At the start of the session the adviser explores the aims and objectives but, also declares the limits on the session that, they are unable to focus down on individual queries due to time. Adviser signposts to further help available, via one to one and/or telephone service. If due to funding constraints these are unavailable, they can signpost to guidance services via local colleges.</p>
<p>Job hunting agenda of session declared, further support signposted to.</p>
