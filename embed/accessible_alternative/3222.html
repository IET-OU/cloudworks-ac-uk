<li>Attitudes? <br />I was able to use the interface <br />I was able to hear and see OK <br />I found the chat window useful <br />I thought session was the right length <br />I found the session useful <br />I enjoyed this session <br />I would recommend to other students</li>
<li>Chat comments <br />Really enjoyed it thanks for the demo, it's an awesome bit of kit!!<br /> Thanks for having us, this was very interesting <br />Useful session <br />Tutor: I was at your TM129 Baxter demo last night and just wanted to say how brilliant I thought it was. The students were really engaged with it and found it inspirational!</li>
<li>Questionnaire comments <br />Seeing a live demonstration of a robot and having someone knowledgeable in the area, that could answer questions near the end was very helpful. I like the idea of the widgets and being able to interactively answer questions that the answers got explained further by the person presenting. <br />Seeing the practical, real world use of robotics really helped me grasp the wider purpose of what I was learning. I found that giving the course material a more tangible context helped me to engage with it more strongly. <br />Having now watched the recording &hellip; I wish there had been some publicity&hellip;. I did receive the invite &hellip;, but I had the impression it was another generic video &hellip; that wasn't that relevant to the studies. Having now seen it, this was great!</li>
<li>Thanks!&nbsp;</li>
