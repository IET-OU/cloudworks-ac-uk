<li>1. Does personality affect our participation with the open environment? Debbie Meakin H818, Inclusion/Implementation Presentation</li>
<li>2. Background &bull; Teaching delivery &bull; Differentiation &ndash; Visual, Auditory, Kinaesthetic and needs &bull; Multiple intelligences &bull; Reading &ndash; book &lsquo;Quiet&rsquo; by Susan Cain (2012) &bull; Self awareness &bull; MBTI</li>
<li>3. Introduction &bull; The accessibility of online environments is a general entitlement to being inclusive (TechDis) &bull; Inclusion? &bull; About potential barriers to online access &bull; What about personality? Is this also about behaviour &bull; ie participation? &bull; Personality has been the subject of studies looking at online interaction &bull; Does personality present barriers?</li>
<li>4. Personality is organised into 5 dimensions or traits &bull; The five-factor model (FFM )has five areas known as dimensions and these are, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience. &bull; These are also known as the &lsquo;Big 5&rsquo; &bull; Also can be linked to learning styles (according to Wikipedia) and MBTI &bull; Stability of this personality testing is agreed by psychologists</li>
<li>5. &lsquo;Big 5&rsquo;</li>
<li>6. Other studies &bull; Shyness and anxiety have been found to have an effect in engaging online, but not in relation to email use or chat rooms (Scealy, Phillips &amp; Stevenson 2002) &bull; In another study it was found that openness is a positive factor online for entertainment, social relationships and communication while agreeableness has a negative impact on communication (Tsao 2013)</li>
<li>7. Other studies &bull; When working online four areas of personality affected behaviour online less than offline (Blumer and Doering, 2012).</li>
<li>8. A method &bull; Based on previous work using a questionnaire approach and a test &ndash; retest situation for being offline and online &bull; Move this to a not open/open approach with the questionnaire &bull; Devising appropriate questions about working in the open environment &bull; Identifying the sample group(s)</li>

<li>10. My Results &ndash; Big 5 Personality Test www.outofservice/bigfive/results</li>
<li>11. Other methods &bull; Self reporting &ndash; determination of personality using easily accessed websites &bull; Using self reporting and compare with responses to open environment working &bull; Ethnographic approach &bull; Focus groups</li>
<li>12. Inclusion and/or Implementation &bull; Is personality something that can affect inclusion and accessibility to the online environment? &bull; Is personality something that can affect engagement with openness? &bull; Knowing the effects of personality in different online and open situations, can approaches to engage people in openness be considered?</li>
<li>13. Questions please?</li>
