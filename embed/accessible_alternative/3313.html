<h1>Transcription of Treloar’s Trello research Team Podcast #1 Feb 2019</h1>
<p>The following alternative to this embedded content has been provided by the person who put the content on the site for accessibility reasons.</p>
<p>[00:00:01.75]</p>
<p>Hello and welcome to podcast number one from the Treloar&rsquo;s Trello research project team. My name is Kelly Williams, the project lead. I've invited the student lead researcher &lsquo;SL&rsquo; here today to discuss the project and our findings so far. Hello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:00:19.36]</p>
<p>Just before we start a little bit about the project so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:00:23.20]</p>
<p>This is a six month in class project looking at the introduction of what is traditionally a productivity tool from Trello, which has been excused extensively in business but we've been repurposing it here as a technology enhanced learning tool in the class. We're hoping it's going to promote inclusion and independence for a cohort of students we're working with here at Treloar&rsquo;s. They are further education creative arts students and they have been changing Trello to suit a different context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:00:59.35]</p>
<p>So can you tell me SL if you had used Trello before this project?</p>
<p>I have never used this type of software before like collaborative learning. Trello was completely new to me, when Kelly approached me to help with this project. It&rsquo;s been taking a while to get used to the format and how it all works but going to work out quite well I think yeah it's been going quite well so far. A few hiccups but the app itself is good.</p>
<p>Before we actually look at the app can you tell me how you yourself came to be involved in the project? As you were looking at some other type of software similar to this before we start.</p>
<p>I was curious what it was and then you said that you were doing this project about collaborative learning and independence and as it was something I'd never really been involved in before. Thought I could give it a go and also might help my learning with the other students and also I have increased my own independence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:02:06.21]</p>
<p>So, you just mentioned independence, what does that mean to you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:02:08.66]</p>
<p>This is like giving students kind of leeway in their own work. Mm hmm like gives them a chance to take charge a bit more rather than just being told you know do this by this time. I think some students have preferred it, to give a little bit more free rein I think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:02:25.64]</p>
<p>Do you think your independence could maybe increase as you get new skills learning this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:02:31.94]</p>
<p>I think the best part about this is that we're actually kind of working together a bit more because most of time is just like each student with their individual work. A &nbsp;lot of students have enjoyed working together a bit more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:02:47.42]</p>
<p>I think it could help with communication and also like cohesion with one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, you've stepped up in to a role where you actually run the sessions. Have you ever done anything like that before this project?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:03:03.83]</p>
<p>No, never really given a chance to kind of like take charge of it. It&rsquo;s actually good you know trying to make plans for the class and what we're doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:03:18.21]</p>
<p>So maybe the people might like to hear how you've been working to plan the sessions. So, how's that how's that worked in practice for you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:03:29.12]</p>
<p>I think Trello has helped a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:03:31.13]</p>
<p>Yeah we are using Trello to plan as well as do the project!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:03:35.39]</p>
<p>Yeah because the system they use is quite helpful. Yeah. And it's actually given me a bit more I guess organization I guess. Given me more of a chance to actually plan ahead of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:03:53.27]</p>
<p>So, we've slotted in little 15 minute lesson planning sessions every week on a Friday. We're just looking at all Planning Board here in front of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:04:06.08]</p>
<p>Maybe you could let people know how we are planning, what we've got on the planning boards and how it's how we've worked through them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:04:15.90]</p>
<p>So what we got with the planning boards is we have each month separate in each category with a checklist of things we need to do within that time frame. Which we tick off as we go along. So we have a few meetings every week to plan what we're going to be doing the week ahead and on the day. It also keeps us on track to make sure we don't yet forget about something and then realize oh no we haven't done it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:04:53.10]</p>
<p>So we've had a bit of a funny month in January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have few things have gone wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we're having to move a few things to February. I think we need to get some more session feedback at the moment don't we?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually everybody did some last week didn't they?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:05:11.14]</p>
<p>Yeah but the feedback has been on and off as we've been forgetting. Not me. Well it was me once. (laughter)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it just students feeding back?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. Staff feeding back as well. Yeah. Which I think is good as well because staff and students are kind of you know together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have the staff showed you any of that feedback they've done?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't seen some of it yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay so we need to get a time for you to look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:05:44.82]</p>
<p>So within the research team that we've got obviously you've got the role as the lead student research of any other students got roles within the research?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:05:54.58]</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, &nbsp;some serious roles of like basically admin really like they get to make sure everyone's keeping aligned with the terms of using the board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:06:07.95]</p>
<p>There were quite a lot put their hand up to be moderators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah. They just want the power! (laughter)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:06:16.38]</p>
<p>There was a student that I noted she brought in some skills she already had from creating fanfiction. Yeah.</p>
<p>She modelled the posting guidelines for the board from fanfiction boards which I found quite an interesting thing. So she was bringing prior knowledge into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is good to have some knowledge of that as well because I mean most online stuff is setting guidelines really. Yeah, but just be nice to one another that can be posting stuff that could make some people upset. I guess, I think especially when it's just the class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:06:54.44]</p>
<p>For me it's worked really well cause we've got boards that belong to both of us and we get notification of when each other add to the board. We don't add to the board and I find that really useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also put I'm also putting all my OU work on here as well so you can see what comes up. You're not the only student here. I'm a student as well so it's it kind of feels like we're in it together a little bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:07:24.87]</p>
<p>&nbsp;Can I just take you back to the beginning of the project?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:07:28.70]</p>
<p>When you all got together as students roundtable, we've got the overarching question in the project of whether student independence can increase but as a student research group you also came up with your own questions as an entry survey to the project. How was that as a process for you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:07:51.81]</p>
<p>The process was a very rocky start. To get all the students in the same room at the same time! The actual getting together and working out like, what does it mean independence and collaboration. The students were really keen on actually asking questions and coming up with ideas. I was expecting everyone to be so what? They were listening to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:08:22.77]</p>
<p>You were expecting to have to do more?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah. Did actually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah I think it's because you were you were leading the session as a first major and as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:08:30.87]</p>
<p>Yeah that was the first time that you've done that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah I was just a little bit. As you went there and I thought it was gonna I was surprised you wanted to listen to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:08:41.13]</p>
<p>It's interesting because in the research I've done behind the project there's a lot of evidence base that peer learning works as well if not better than learning from a teacher at times. To have you as a new voice&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm one of their peers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:09:00.15]</p>
<p>I suppose it's like you feel like you're on the same level as I'm really the same wavelength. You know you speak to them regularly &hellip;more in tune, at one level and you're calmer with talking to them. I think it's because they're used to talking to one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:09:20.31]</p>
<p>You don't really know that it is a Friday afternoon slot it just seems like a quite relaxed session as well. They're going to be sleeping? But no.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our students who can't be in the regular sessions has found it a bit difficult to work. Yeah but that's that's&nbsp; just the context we work here anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:09:40.31]</p>
<p>The last term we all gathered round the tables scribbled on pieces of paper of various questions which were then worked up into an entry survey. So we carried out the entry survey and then we're gonna be carrying out the same survey at the end could you just set a few things if I run through the survey monkey the kind of questions you will came up with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:10:05.46]</p>
<p>So basic questions like I'm confident are you using these types of apps and what was the general consensus among everyone seems relatively confident when using new apps and websites things. Some more than others but I think the majority of them are quite competent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:10:27.82]</p>
<p>Do you expect that will move up a little bit more too?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah I'm expecting it to be a bit high on next year and working with other students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:10:39.04]</p>
<p>Well that's definitely improved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think as a snapshot that we took there was kind of quite representative at that point. I know one of the students said quite poignantly that she hoped that the research would bring the class together as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:10:56.77]</p>
<p>Yeah well we've been working together a lot more on any other ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've been working with the students?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:11:03.83]</p>
<p>Well I think they come around with the problems yet they've been having. Yeah yeah I mean trying to figure out how to fix the problems of the board sometimes. Yeah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:11:14.95]</p>
<p>What about outside the Trello project in the classroom?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:11:17.44]</p>
<p>People seem to be talking a lot more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:11:24.05]</p>
<p>We've got a couple of nonverbal students in the class as well. Do you think it's helped them find their voice?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:11:29.63]</p>
<p>I think they've definitely enjoyed it.&nbsp; I think it's even better for them on Trello like that because they can just type wherever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't take long. Like it would say something out loud because all the equipment they need to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:11:49.25]</p>
<p>We are quite a technology rich. There's loads of technology going on in the class all the time and it's sometimes actually a barrier for some students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get everyone in the class kind of was on the same level I think. I'm thinking we didn't really work together enough at that point. I'm not collaborative which I do agree with that. I mean yeah we have a lot of the work and also art is that everyone kind of does their own work and never really mixes with anyone else even though we've got a semi open class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:12:22.40]</p>
<p>Do you think people are having a little bit more of a look each other's art and their sketchbooks?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:12:26.39]</p>
<p>Yeah, but the main benefit of this would be everyone gets to kind of comment. Even to get a chance that a bit as well to make their own versions of each other's work which I think I'm looking forward to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:12:39.95]</p>
<p>Laughs Yeah. We haven't done that yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:12:43.01]</p>
<p>Yeah yeah definitely. Like we're planning to work towards that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:12:46.46]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:12:46.63]</p>
<p>So the point of the project we're at the moment is students still getting used to the posting functionality and just getting the chance to do their own thing and get their stuff out there get the confidence to show everyone their work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:13:00.38]</p>
<p>But as we were just having a look at the board before we started this podcast and we did definitely notice that there were a few areas that need work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:13:09.89]</p>
<p>There were a few things that have gone missing randomly and we're not sure why. Well obviously that's another good thing with Trello, it wasn't deleted but archived somewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:13:55.22]</p>
<p>QUESTION Do you think Trello will help with your current qualification?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:14:00.68]</p>
<p>I was a bit unsure Yeah. I don't know that maybe you know I'm&hellip; I'm thinking this could be the one that would change the most and. I think it definitely happening with the competence bar. Yeah I think it's like communication one another I think it's good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:14:16.40]</p>
<p>I think what we might see is students is using it for other things. One is for her EPQ</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh yeah used it for their work which is good yeah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:14:30.80]</p>
<p>And a comedy meme board, which you started on the site didn't you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:14:34.85]</p>
<p>A bit of fun alongside the actual serious issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I did see one student did a board about Japan which was quite interesting and another I'm pretty sure they did something about dogs. It's good they were doing their own thing but like sometimes they kind of go off too much from the others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:15:04.61]</p>
<p>But it's learning to use Trello?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:15:15.98]</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still kind of early days in the project so I think we've covered that about bringing the class together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Yeah. Here was the big one that quite often the students said about yeah I could try to help you gain confidence to work with the students. Because confidence is not kind of a strong point for some students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't forget we had a student haven't even used any social media</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:15:56.65]</p>
<p>And she's had to do loads of troubleshooting with this. I think the one that never used it, is the one that had the most problems which is not helpful for her and but gave me confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:16:08.00]</p>
<p>So how did you help her resolve those issues?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:16:10.88]</p>
<p>Well there was a few it took a while. Well first we had the logging in issues, the network there was something wrong with that. And then I had to help again, she made another account by accident. So I tried to make sure got deleted then somehow got to work out again. Now we've finally got it working but Trello doesn&rsquo;t work on her phone right now. So I think she's learned a lot about troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a new user of social media it would be interesting to interview her and find out if she would be more confident reporting issues and how to report an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far it's not been so much about Trello though for her it's been about communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and what's called digital literacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:17:19.08]</p>
<p>So you know typing online and online collaborative software can be a lot different to actually talking to people in person. Yes because it's the way you convey what you're saying. Yeah because a lot of things can be misconstrued online. Yeah like somebody can sound a lot worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:17:37.98]</p>
<p>And that's why emojis help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a thing there about finding a suitable voice, an appropriate voice for communicating online that differing on those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:17:48.84]</p>
<p>Everyone does have a completely different voice online?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah well a lot of them do. It's a lot different online. So sometimes that that language is a bit different. than they normally are in person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give me an example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I realize some students say a lot more when they're on the Trello than in person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:18:07.75]</p>
<p>Yeah. Are there any students in particular who are very markedly different online?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:18:13.32]</p>
<p>Yeah I mean there's one of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:18:17.13]</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of our very quiet students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:18:20.03]</p>
<p>Yes they seem to be very confident with being online. Yeah. Because he uses everything including Facebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:18:27.80]</p>
<p>As well as the research question about independence the group independently came up with a question asking whether I could improve independence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:18:45.31]</p>
<p>I think it could improve independence in terms of taking charge of your own work. And actually keeping organized. Yeah because now students just discover what their target is sometimes. A chance to be more productive with themselves and actually plan ahead of time what they would do in life when they get this bit of art done when they finish, when you get it printed you know. I think sell it and selling could be a good part of that as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:19:23.16]</p>
<p>Yeah cause another thing students have been doing recently - you've been setting up Etsy shops and starting to look at selling artwork.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:19:32.75]</p>
<p>Trello can be used to good for that as well. And I mean the main thing is that they're getting a chance to put their stuff on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:19:44.56]</p>
<p>At Treloar&rsquo;s with the tools with it&rsquo;s very much trying to look at tools for students that can be used beyond Treloar&rsquo;s. I guess is whether that's a is a realistic tool for you to use for organization when you've left the college.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I think it could help some students..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:20:08.79]</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to ask people at the end if they will go on to independently use Trello for other things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:20:15.39]</p>
<p>Could Trello help you gain new skills?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:20:28.89]</p>
<p>It's almost like asking how long is a piece of string if you haven't used the software at that point. So this is going to be another really interesting one for us to become at the end of the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:20:39.16]</p>
<p>Going back to the planning - it has helped the organization within class and works for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:21:04.74]</p>
<p>Yes. And I think that helps me be organized and I I personally I'm using Trello outside the project now for other things. So it's it certainly helps keep on track because obviously I produced a project plan which is very formal documentation but bringing that formal documentation into what was is more of an informal board works&hellip; well. And the fact that we can use that as basis for our weekly planning I find that really useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:21:46.64]</p>
<p>Do you think this has been productive so far?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;There's a board! Students are working on it. Nobody said they don't want to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:21:55.04]</p>
<p>I did wonder if anybody wouldn't want to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's various elements to this. There's &hellip; the creative side of making a very visual Trello board to help with your qualifications but then there's also the student led element and teaching people about what research is. I mean I don't know if you've ever taken part in any research in the college at all before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:22:21.32]</p>
<p>No it's definitely a new thing to me &hellip; a bit more you know reign I guess. Yeah. Gives me a chance to be more organized myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:22:35.74]</p>
<p>Yeah it's been really nice. This isn't this isn't me sat in the corner filling in grades and grids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:22:45.57]</p>
<p>Do you think the students are working well?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:22:52.70]</p>
<p>I think they are, from observational data&hellip;I am seeing that more. I'm also seeing rather than students asking a support staff member they're asking that actually they're coming to you. Quite a lot to ask if they've got problems with the board but there's definitely been more peer learning on show in the class. So students have kind of asked each other or what is this? And it's kind of been a feeling like staff and students in it together. So it's nice that some of the staff don't know this software &hellip;because then it's yours, it's yours to learn it's not theirs and it's not their learning, it's your learning. I think for me that's a real positive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:23:55.33]</p>
<p>So what next for the project?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:24:03.13]</p>
<p>Next week on our planning session doing on elements and design, is being careful with the hour. I think I think maybe the next part that could be maybe giving people the chance to share, there are maybe give to the challenge kind of playing with the elements and maybe Yep kind of edit bits and be with others see what they think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:24:25.52]</p>
<p>So we need to post on the board, videos maybe?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:24:30.25]</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. We could even put tutorials for like Photoshop stuff on that. Yeah could be a good idea. Yeah. I will probably ask students, they can make a survey thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:24:47.26]</p>
<p>So maybe what we do is we have done this for a while just have a look at how we swap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:24:53.23]</p>
<p>Maybe be good to get together as a group again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah&hellip;.discuss what we should do next. And what they think they've actually done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:25:02.26]</p>
<p>I think from what I've seen as well there's a few students maybe need to get technical help. because I've seen everything on one card &hellip;so it's still getting their heads around the idea of the cards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:25:13.69]</p>
<p>And I think some are still confused on what they can actually post&hellip;Has to be relevant, to make sense. &hellip; it's gotta be something to do with the board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:25:28.78]</p>
<p>You know that that can be in the separate file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:25:31.42]</p>
<p>This is all part of the learning&hellip; The best thing is just to have a play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:25:37.09]</p>
<p>Yeah well it's good because a lot of students have never tried this or that so I'm not surprised some things have come out this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:25:52.02]</p>
<p>Well I look forward to having another chat with you and possibly another student for another podcast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:25:56.58]</p>
<p>Yeah we should do another one. Yep. We're gonna do a few more. Yeah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[00:26:01.44]</p>
<p>So thank you very much for giving me your time today. Well we'll be releasing this as an Open University resource as well. So thank you very much. I look forward to talking to you again soon. Goodbye.</p>
