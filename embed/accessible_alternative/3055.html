<p>Audio Transcript</p>
<p>Slide 1</p>
<p>Dyslexia and Social Entrepreneurship Open Digital Resource actively supports and promotes the social model of dyslexia and disability.</p>
<p>Slide 2</p>
<p>My name is Susan Eley Morris. I am not an adult with dyslexia. I am not an expert in dyslexia. I have worked for 30 years in the UK where I have worked with over 380 adult learners with dyslexia and had colleagues and CEOs disclose dyslexia to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This poster invites you to attend my conference presentation about my multimedia project which is a behavioural intervention aimed at CEOs delivered using a social media strategy.</p>
<p>Slide 3</p>
<p>Research indicates that around 10 per cent of the adult population in the UK has some form of dyslexia. Dyslexia Pathways CIC in Fife Scotland report that many dyslexics feel isolated and there is no real tangible dyslexic community.</p>
<p>Twenty per cent of adults who are entrepreneurs in the UK have some form of dyslexia.</p>
<p>Slide 4</p>
<p>If one in five business leaders has dyslexia then we also expect our global CEOs will have dyslexia and some will also be in a position to speak out. Notable figures include Richard Branson and also Jamie Oliver.</p>
<p>Slide 5</p>
<p>My professional life is based within Scotland where I work with several social enterprises. Social Enterprise Academy estimated 30,000 entrepreneurs with Dyslexia. In my professional and personal life I actively support and promote the social model of dyslexia and disability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hold the view that dyslexia is an experience that arises out of natural human diversity on the one hand and a world on the other where the early learning of literacy, and good personal organisation and working memory is mistakenly used as a marker of &lsquo;intelligence&rsquo;. The problem here is seeing difference incorrectly as &lsquo;deficit&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If you are intrigued about my multimedia project then find out more about what I am aspiring to do to change workplace behaviours towards dyslexia in a multimedia open digital resource.&nbsp; Come to the H818 The networked practitioner Conference in February 2016.</p>
<p>Slide 6</p>
<p>My presentation is called Dyslexia and Social Entrepreneurship and Open Digital Resource. I am presenting on the Saturday, February the 13<sup>th</sup> and it&rsquo;s an afternoon session.</p></div>                   </div>
