<p>Transcript of Auto-ethnographic approach<br />Does personality affect our participation with the open environment? A potential enthnographic approach towards an answer.<br />Autoethnographic approach<br />Ethnography involves research undertaken through observation and interview of participants in a study group. The experiences of participants within the group are investigated so that perceptions and behaviours in response to the study are recorded. The researcher is usually an observer and does not impinge on the data collection, however different perceptual positions can be used. Where the researcher is directly involved in the research and records their own experiences it is referred to as auto-ethnographic.<br />Co-collaboration<br />Individuals within a group write (or record) and collaborative based on their experience. Participants document experiences as autoethnographers, recording their perceptions as a result of new information or research experience and relating this to their previous experience (using a reflexive approach).<br />Example 1<br />Laptopers in an educational practice: Promoting the personal learning situation<br />Method<br />: Ethnographic, including observation in lectures and social situations, interviews, teacher as observer and workshop.<br />Outcome<br />: Five characteristics of laptoping were found. The student situation contributes to how laptops can be used in learning. Using digital tools well extends learning in and outside the classroom.<br />Methodology<br />Anthropological and social science based.<br />Qualitative method, with material potentially arising as part of the process.<br />Approach is subjective, based on individual participant experience with contributions<br />being relevant.<br />Example 2<br />Review: autoethnography for reflexive inter-professional inter-collegial work<br />Method<br />: A group of cross-disciplinary researcher-practitioners used recordings and other<br />records for critical enquiry of the group process.<br />Outcome<br />: A reflexive approach to autoethnography was identified. The language of the<br />benefits of cross-working were developed, informing future culture and ways of<br />working in collaboration.<br />Proposed method<br />Co-record with colleagues from the module to share experiences. To use the subject<br />of this study as material for recording experiences. Specifically if the perceptions to<br />working in an open environment within education are appropriate to record and if the<br />personality aspects are a point of reflection.<br />Proposed Outcomes<br />Discuss whether personality has an effect on the interaction with the online<br />environment, especially with respect to open education. Does this have a place in<br />the consideration of inclusiveness?<br />Identify areas of open working which are important and if some are more relevant than others.<br />Record qualitative aspects of experiences and perceptions; potentially using vaire media.<br />Potentially discuss whether the recording of these experiences contributes to a form of digital ethnography.</p></div>                   </div>
